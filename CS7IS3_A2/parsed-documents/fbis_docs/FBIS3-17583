Went to Moscow. Short Tour of the Head of State's Recent Past. Is the Russian President Healthy? An Impolite and Offensive Question for Yeltsin That Has Troubled the Public All Week. How Rhetorical Is It?"] [Text] Yekaterinburg -- Lots of foreign and domestic news agencies are now trying to learn from Sverdlovsk people who used to know Yeltsin well whether the former first secretary of Sverdlovsk CPSU Oblast Committee [obkom] suffered from any chronic ailments. Put it this way -- among our circle, who were once employed at the CPSU obkom special hospital, nobody saw Boris Nikolayevich walking through the confusing corridors of the hospital building on Working Youth Embankment with prescriptions in his hand. I personally met his second and third in command in this building -- everyone without exception had to traipse round a dozen or so offices before they could get their prescriptions filled! Boris Nikolayevich can be rebuked for not paying attention to his health and not always finding the time for compulsory checkups. But that is not our business, it is the business of Yeltsin's relatives and doctors. Admittedly, we would note that Boris Nikolayevich could have been improving his health at the medical establishment in the settlement of Izoplit, which was even more secret than the clinic on the embankment.... But, strange as it may seem today, the Sverdlovsk party nomenklatura's relationship with the press was democratic, and I did manage to get a few urgent interviews precisely in this "secret" medical firm, right at patients' bedsides. Unfortunately, over the course of many years I never saw Boris Nikolayevich here either. In the first half of the eighties Yeltsin was so hard-working, demanding, and energetic that he was more likely to drive any of his colleagues to Izoplit through overwork. I recall that I met up at the settlement with Viktor Makarov, a former "Uralkhimmash" director, who had been taken ill inopportunely. During this period Yeltsin was impatient about pursuing the idea of fundamentally restructuring and modernizing this plant, and insisting on automating old production facilities. He would tour the shops himself with a good 100 plant directors and city or rayon committee first secretaries trailing behind him.... Yeltsin sometimes set industrial enterprises such major and fantastic tasks that anyone -- even the fittest director -- could have a seizure! In the eighties, under Boris Nikolayevich, the Sverdlovsk Oblast nomenklatura worked day and night, battling for the oblast's identity to the last breath, without exaggeration. Oblast Executive Committee Chairman Mekhrintsev and Deputy Chairman Shkrebnev died untimely deaths. Top officials' concern about model plants and villages was never noticed [as published] in the capital, and was perhaps geared to gaining the Kremlin's attention.... The more you built the more investment you got. That was the way things were! I entirely share the view that many responsive, hardworking, and reliable officials of that time were stung by the innumerable visits to the oblast by highly placed guests.... But you cannot touch the number one in such circumstances! Any incautious behavior by a top man around a dinner table even of dull clerks from Staraya Ploshchad could result in his being sent to Paris or even Addis Ababa. There had been other examples of this happening in the history of the top Urals nomenklatura.... Now to turn to the question of "this matter." A secretary with chronic ailments -- if such a person had existed -- would never have gone to work in the Moscow City Committee. If some people today are annoyed that Yeltsin was healthy enough to make smart decisions, then in that case it is his opponents who are suffering from hangovers. Nobody from Sverdlovsk who had been through the Komsomol and party schooling would claim that Boris Nikolayevich was sanctimonious about alcohol. His participation in many youth and construction brigade festivities was a tradition. But, as eyewitnesses will recall, the group of top officials would never stick around until the bitter end. Boris Nikolayevich, as a rule, instructed more junior party members to look after the young people and ensure order at the festivities -- and then hurried off to his own work. The good thing about Yeltsin was that he did not lord things up at the celebrations, but realized that the young people had earned the money themselves, and, after the meal -- somewhat to the embarrassment of the Komsomol members -- would leave a large sum on the table. This purely ethical gesture would be copied by the other party bosses. Insofar as I recall, Yeltsin's entourage was not overfond of people even hinting at going for a drink in the evening. Aleksey Tsaregorodtsev, the former first secretary of the Komsomol oblast committee, who was a Yeltsin aide, would get angry if he thought there had been any drinking the previous day and could quite justifiably ask: "Did you have to indulge last night, guys?!" One talented man dismissed by Yeltsin as a Komsomol obkom secretary for having attended a single party literally a month after starting his career is today part of the Urals industrial guard. The man turned out to be unusually strong and was able to rehabilitate himself 200 percent after Yeltsin's "punishment." But how tough was Yeltsin himself when it came to the honor of a party worker? Paradoxically, in the eighties the capital's opponents rebuked the provincial Yeltsin for violating human rights, including the rights of drinkers. Boris Nikolayevich stoically supported and pursued throughout the Union the Seversk Pipe Plant's initiative of "Collective Guarantees for Labor Discipline!" -- this meant that if a single team member got drunk or went absent, the entire collective would not get its bonus! Lawyers from the capital's party apparatus hinted to Yeltsin that neither the labor family nor a worker's personal family should suffer, that alcohol dependency is a medical rather than a party matter, that in this instance the cure should be a private one rather than a party and state one.... Alas, it seems that in those days Boris Nikolayevich was more consistently in favor of the anti-alcohol legislation than Yegor Kuzmich [Ligachev]. I recall how I went into the office of V. Manyukhin, second secretary of the CPSU obkom, with a freshly printed "dry" law. Viktor Mitrofanovich, who was greatly concerned about the oblast budget and the timely payment of wages, "assessed" the Staraya Ploshchad initiative in terms which I had rarely heard even among a small group of friends on a fishing trip.... Boris Nikolayevich was silent at the time -- clearly he was more subject to party discipline and was more cautious. Or perhaps he felt slightly responsible for the fact that his own campaign against drunkenness at work had been so distorted into the Politburo initiative. ...Who was the first to raise the subject of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's "health"? Yeltsin's mother -- Klavdiya Vasilyevna -- was still in full health when we visited her with foreign TV journalists. Yes, his mother was terribly worried about her son's health, his mental balance, and the fact that the Moscow climate did not suit him very much and he often came down with colds. Klavdiya Vasilyevna was knitting woolen socks for Boris Nikolayevich. The bottle of vodka which my foreign colleagues had brought in order to talk in greater detail with [Yeltsin's] younger brother Mikhail Nikolayevich was requisitioned by me and placed in a briefcase. I told my colleagues that Russians bring out their own bottles.... And if Mikhail Nikolayevich wanted to greet you with alcohol he would do so, if he did not -- tough luck! Tea was served, along with jam from Klavdiya Vasilyevna's kitchen garden. There were plenty of photographs of Boris Nikolayevich as a child and a young man to keep the conversation going.... And yet somebody was playing tricks! There is no other way of putting it. Another team of journalists -- not the one that was with KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. When I visited the team of construction workers where Boris Nikolayevich's brother Mikhail Yeltsin worked a few months later, I found him very angry. Having trusted the West European press without having any reliable local journalist intermediaries president, Mikhail Nikolayevich later read some pearls of wisdom about the Yeltsin family that had been concocted. The sincere and very hospitable family found itself described as "distant," "uneducated," "country bumpkins," and, of course, "showing signs of alcohol dependency".... Quite honestly, if such provocative attacks had been made by the partners with whom I worked, Mikhail Nikolayevich would have thumped me on the back of the neck with his concrete shovel. As a result we stood on the roof of a unfinished house and agreed never to give foreigners any more information on the Yeltsin family! ...Yeltsin was absolutely healthy when he left Sverdlovsk for Moscow. The last time I heard his happy, optimistic voice was in the office of Viktor Kashpurov, the CPSU obkom's finance chief, who was concerned about his boss' accommodations. In practice these were telephone calls of farewell. Judging from these conversations, Yeltsin's first days in Moscow were full of energy and hope. Who was to know that there would be so many suspicious people in the capital who are perhaps more sick than the president!
