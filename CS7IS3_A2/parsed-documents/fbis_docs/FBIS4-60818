"We declare that again. We condemn those actions against independent Latvia and its people," Yeltsin stressed. Speaking in reply, Latvia's President Guntis Ulmanis voiced hope that Yeltsin's statement would help many Latvians to get over the prejudices piled up over the past decades in relations with Russia. Asked by an INTERFAX correspondent about the outcome of bilateral talks, Yeltsin revealed that along with preparation for the signing ceremony he and Ulmanis had drawn up guidelines for economic accords with the view to endorse them. According to Yeltsin, there are 10 such drafts, including documents on free trade, on the most favoured status in trade, and on easy-term taxation. In Yeltsin's words, a mixed working group will elaborate on these documents so that Russia's Premier Victor Chernomyrdin could sign them during a visit to Riga. However, it is too early to say when precisely he will go there, Yeltsin said.
