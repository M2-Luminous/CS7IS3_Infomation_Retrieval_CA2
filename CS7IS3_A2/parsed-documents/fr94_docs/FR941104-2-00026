FR941104-2-00026 FR941104-2-00019 [Docket No. TM95&hyph;2&hyph;17&hyph;000] Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff October 31, 1994. Take notice that on October 27, 1994 Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1, the tariff sheets listed on Appendix A to the filing. The proposed effective date of these revised tariff sheets is December 1, 1994. Texas Eastern states that the tariff sheets are being filed (i) pursuant to Section 15.6, Applicable Shrinkage Adjustment (ASA), contained in the General Terms and Conditions of Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1, and (ii) pursuant to Texas Eastern's Docket No. RP85&hyph;177&hyph;119, et al. Stipulation and Agreement (Settlement) filed January 31, 1994 and approved by Commission orders issued May 12, 1994 and July 13, 1994. Texas Eastern states that the filing constitutes Texas Eastern's second regular annual ASA filing under Section 15.6 for the purpose of reflecting changes in its requirement to retain gas in-kind in compensation for the quantities of gas used to provide service for its customers and Texas Eastern's first annual filing pursuant to the Settlement to (i) calculate revised reductions to its shrinkage factors to reflect projected purchases under Appendix C contracts under the Settlement, (ii) calculate revised Spot Fuel Components as provided in Section 5.08 of the Settlement, and (iii) report the annual reconciliation of the interruptible revenues under Rate Schedules IT&hyph;1, PTI and ISS&hyph;1 as well as for Rate Schedule LLIT and for Rate Schedule VKIT. In addition, this filing provides information with respect to certain elements of the Settlement which Texas Eastern believes to be of interest to its customers and the Commission. Texas Eastern states that the changes proposed to become effective beginning December 1, 1994 consist of (1) revised ASA Percentages designed to retain in-kind the projected quantities of gas required for the operation of Texas Eastern's system in providing service to its customers for each seasonal calendar period, Winter (December 1, 1993&hyph;March 31, 1994), Spring Shoulder (April 1, 1994&hyph;May 31, 1994), Summer (June 1, 1994&hyph;September 30, 1994) and Fall Shoulder (October 1, 1994&hyph;November 30, 1994) and (2) the ASA Surcharge designed to recover the net monetary value recorded in the Applicable Shrinkage Deferred Account as of August 31, 1994 and (3) Spot Fuel Components designed to recover the Spot Costs, as defined in the Settlement, projected to be incurred over the twelve month period beginning December 1, 1994 and the balance recorded in the Spot Fuel Deferred Account as of August 31, 1994. Texas Eastern states that the filing reflects an overall average decrease of approximately 12.3 percent in its in-kind retention factors and an average increase in usage rates of approximately 2 cents due to the revised ASA Surcharges and the revised Spot Fuel Components. Texas Eastern states that the filing also includes, for information purposes only detailed supporting information for the balances as of August 31, 1994 in the Non-Spot Fuel Deferred Account and the Account No. 858 Costs Deferred Account established pursuant to the Settlement. Texas Eastern states that copies of its filing have been served on all Firm Customers of Texas Eastern and Interested State Commission, as well as all current interruptible shippers and all parties to the Settlement in Docket No. RP85&hyph;177&hyph;119, et al. Texas Eastern states that in accordance with the Settlement, with respect to those elements of the tariff sheets pursuant to the Settlement, Texas Eastern's filing is subject to refund or adjustment only to the extent not in compliance with the Settlement. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before November 7, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room.
