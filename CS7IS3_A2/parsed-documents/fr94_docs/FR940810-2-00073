The NOFA announced the availability of $142 million for grants to States and local governments. The NOFA also stated that to be considered for funding, an original and two copies of the application must be physically received in the Office of Lead-Based Paint Abatement and Poisoning Prevention in Washington no later than 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time on July 6, 1994. For the three days immediately prior to the date that applications were due under the NOFA, July 4 through July 6, East Central Illinois, specifically Southeastern Cook County, Will County and Kankakee County, were subjected to severe weather conditions, which disrupted electrical service to many of the communities in this part of Illinois. Accordingly, due to a weather emergency and a prolonged regional power outage, the Department is extending the deadline of 3:00 pm Eastern Time on July 6, 1994 for submission of applications under the NOFA for Southeastern Cook County, Will County and Kankakee County, Illinois. The Department will accept applications received from this region by 3:00 pm Eastern Time on July 7, 1994 if (1) the applicant submits a certification demonstrating that the applicant's ability to prepare or submit the application was substantially impaired by the above-described power outage; and (2) the Department approves the certification.
