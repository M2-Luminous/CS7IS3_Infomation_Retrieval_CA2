[Zlenko] Well, we have no pending problem with Spain. I believe that we are on very good terms. Spain's embassy is working very well in Kiev, and we are considering setting up our embassy in Madrid, and this will be one of the topics of conversation [during Zlenko's visit to Spain], since we hope to do so in the course of this year. We have many joint enterprises which are making their way in trade, and we hope that this process will be accelerated with the treaty of friendship and cooperation which we will sign and with President Leonid Kravchuk's visit, for which we will also be preparing during these days. Ukraine has been independent for two years, and has already established relations with many countries, including Spain. Now it is necessary to begin with the legal basis of our relationship, and this treaty represents a very real step toward our relations' embodiment in law. [Serbeto] One of things which link Spain and Ukraine is that both countries are keeping troops in the former Yugoslavia. What is Kiev's stance on the possibility of a decision to launch air strikes in Bosnia in order to support the Blue Helmets' work? [Zlenko] Ukraine believes that all possibilities of a negotiated solution should be sought, and through an overall view. It seems to us that the embargo against Serbia and Montenegro is creating a terrible situation in which only the children, who have no medicines, and the civilians, who are now beginning to have problems in feeding themselves, are suffering. I believe that this is creating bitterness and very great resentment among people who could believe that they now have nothing to lose, and so we would be fostering an uncontrolled reaction which could go beyond the Balkans and perhaps extend throughout Europe. I therefore believe that we should study the possibility of scaling down the blockade in return for being able to extend the humanitarian action to Serbia as well. People who do not eat and are desperate are capable of anything. [Serbeto] Would Ukraine withdraw its troops if the United Nations had recourse to retaliation by air? [Zlenko] Spain contributes 1,200 troops to the UN peacekeeping forces, who are on the spot like the Ukrainian troops. We do not want an escalation or an internationalization of the conflict, because our troops and the Spanish troops would become hostages of this situation.
