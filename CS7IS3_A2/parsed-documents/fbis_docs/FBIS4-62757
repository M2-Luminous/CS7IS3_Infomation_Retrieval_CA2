The Central Bank Does Not Care for the Monetarist Bill"] [Text] Yesterday an enlarged session of the Central Bank's subcommittee on money and credit policy discussed a draft law presented by Boris Fedorov: On the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. The session was attended by ex-Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, now chairman of the [State Duma] subcommittee on the Central Bank; Aleksandr Khandruyev, deputy chairman of the Central Bank; and representatives of commercial banks and the Moscow Interregional Currency Exchange. Although the discussion of the draft law was not in the confrontational spirit of old, it was interrupted by some rather sharp interventions by representatives of the legislative and monetary "power branches." At the session, the draft law on the Central Bank was disseminated, whose basic provisions are contained in Articles 19, 20, 75, 79, and 122. In particular Article 19 resurrects the Central Bank from the ashes of former battles as a powerful phoenix: "Legislative and executive bodies may not interfere in the activity of the Bank of Russia in exercising its powers enshrined in laws or make decisions which hinder the Bank of Russia's activity. In the event of an intervention attempt, the Bank of Russia shall ignore the illegal injunctions and advise the State Duma." Boris Fedorov's draft provides only for "a week-long freeze" on Central Bank decisions on matters pertaining to its powers, and this prerogative is concentrated in the hands of the finance minister who may (Article 20) suspend Central Bank decisions for this period of time. Viewed from the angle of political practice, these decisions show that Boris Fedorov has not lost the hope of becoming head of an independent Central Bank, while for the Finance Ministry loss of power is to be offset by the possibility of deriving a profit from collaboration with commercial structures. Incidentally, Fedorov sees the president's position as a source for his hopes to get "Gerashchenko's scalp": Article 122 proposes a new procedure for appointing and dismissing the Central Bank chief. As of now the Russian president will have an overriding power (while the State Duma will be able to make such decisions in a limited enumeration of cases) Articles 75 and 79 of the draft are of major importance. Thus, Article 75 empowers the Central Bank to license all currency operations by "banks and other credit institutions," including the import and export of capital. Article 79 strips commercial banks of the right to commercial secrets (insurance companies, investment funds and companies, in full; and brokerage firms, their associations, and regulating bodies, partially) if the Central Bank demands relevant data from them. The same article, however, obligates the Central Bank not to pass on such information to anybody else. On the whole, the draft law proposes that the Central Bank be used as a locomotive of monetarist economic reform, with Fedorov's Central Bank model being closest to Latvia's. There they have a president of the Bank of Latvia, Eynars Repshe; the lat stands at $1.50; and industry is winding up the production of RAF minivans.
