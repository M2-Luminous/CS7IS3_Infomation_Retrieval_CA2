He said: Inclusion of the Great Jamahiriyah in such claims and allegations and the concoction of accusations against it is not a new thing. It has become one of the hallmarks of the conspiracy against the Libyan Arab people in order to exert pressure on its choices and to force it to serve certain interests which are known to everyone. Concerning the issue of terrorism and other related matters which have been used by the Western powers to serve their interests in the world, we wish to explain the following points: 1. The Great Jamahiriyah, which is eager to see international peace and security established on solid bases which will help relations between peoples of the world to be based on equality, mutual respect, and noninterference in internal affairs as well as the nonuse of violence in resolving disputes, has been calling on the international community to overcome negative aspects [in international relations], such as the phenomenon of terrorism, by defining it, analyzing the reasons for it, and combatting it. 2. The Great Jamahiriyah is another victim of terrorism, particularly the state terrorism which has been used against it for years, a matter which has claimed tens of innocent victims as well as causing material damage. It reached its zenith during the U.S.- Atlantist aggression against the innocent inhabitants of Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986, as well as against the brother leader of the revolution and his family. This was a serious international precedent, condemned by the UN Gneral Assembly in successive resolutions. 3. The Great Jamahiriyah reacted to the U.S. Administration's claims on terrorism with clear and public statements, documented by international and regional organizations, in which they condemned terrorism in all its forms. All international organizations and bodies highly praised this stand. 4. The Great Jamahiriyah, in a bid to refute American claims, asked the UN secretary-general to take appropriate measures to expose the falsehood of such claims.
