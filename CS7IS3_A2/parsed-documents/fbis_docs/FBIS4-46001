He said: We took the food out of our children's mouths to pay for arms and half this sum would have changed the Middle East. It is not the Arab countries that started the arms race, but Israel. If we reviewed the military budgets of the Arab countries before the establishment of Israel, we would find that they were modest. We used to spend far more on health and education than on arms. Israel purchased arms from Communist Czechoslovakia and Israeli committees roamed the world to buy arms. Egypt then moved and concluded arms contracts with communist countries. Thus was the feverish race triggered. Israel not only began the arms race but also introduced political assassinations into the region with the assassination of British Minister of State Moyne and assassinations followed. President Mubarak called for removing atomic bombs from the Middle Eastern countries and all these countries responded positively except Israel, which insisted on continuing to make atomic bombs. If Israel really wants peace, the first thing it must do is to join the Arab countries' consensus and get rid of its atomic bombs. Israel is mistaken if it imagines that it can have a monopoly on the atomic bomb in the region. Certain regional countries have indeed reached the stage of making atomic bombs and, in a few years, most regional countries will reach this stage. These countries will lavish funds on catching up with Israel. Israel's interests lie in stopping this danger that threatens it and us. The Israeli foreign minister told the truth when he said: The world will not pay us the price of our folly.
