Thus, the Bundesbank is well advised to orient itself toward other values, such as costs and capacity utilization, which can help to predict the future development of prices. Since these indicators signal a further easing of tensions at the price front for the foreseeable future, one can probably assume that the Bundesbank will be willing to make further cautious reductions of the prime rate in the coming months -- even if the money supply does not move toward the target corridor. This was stated by Friedel Neuber, chairman of the board of directors of West Landesbank, at the news conference presenting his bank's balance sheet. In Neuber's view, the overall economic constellation in the FRG is fundamentally different from that in the United States: There they have a strong upswing with expectations of rising inflation and an increasing demand in net capital imports, which goes hand in hand with increasing deficits in the balance of goods and services; here we have a generally moderate recovery of the economic development with expectations of declining inflation and a declining dependence on capital imports, which goes hand in hand with shrinking deficits of the balance of goods and services. In addition, short-term interest rates in Germany are now clearly below long-term interest rates, so that sooner or later shifts to longer-term forms of deposits can be expected. All this indicates that the German capital market will decouple itself from the U.S. capital market to a certain extent so that the German capital-market interest rate will probably go down again over the next few weeks. However, Neuber does not foresee a decline to the record low of the beginning of the year. In the view of Neuber, who quoted a new 1994-95 forecast for Germany of the West Landesbank economists, the international economy has gotten out of the longest period of weakness of the postwar period so that, for the first time since 1989, the German economy will once again get tangible stimuli from abroad. In the wake of product and process innovations at the companies and a moderate wage round, Neuber sees a clear reduction of unit labor costs in industry in 1994, while productivity and profits will increase considerably.
