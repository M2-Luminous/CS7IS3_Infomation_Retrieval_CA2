The official said Ecopetrol "asks everyone who is interested in buying oil to guarantee their purchase with a letter of credit. We do that with all our customers." That "is what we have asked Cuba to do, and it has proposed an alternate payment method that is still unsatisfactory. Therefore, as long as they do not offer a letter of credit, there will be no deal," Rendon emphasized. Colombian Energy and Mines Minister Guido Nule Amin announced in early February the sale of approximately 20,000 barrels of crude oil per day starting in June or July. According to the Colombian minister, the sale would provide one-third of the island's crude oil needs. The general manager of Ecopetrol also explained that Cuba "is offering its main export product, sugar, as its guarantee through a three-party transaction with the company that buys from them. It offers to pay for the Colombian oil once it has sold the sugar." Obviously, Rendon emphasized, "what we want is a letter of credit and as of this moment we have not reached an agreement." The announcement about the sale of crude oil to Fidel Castro's island caused Cuban exiles to protest in front of the Colombian consulate in Miami as well as announcing that Colombian products would be subject to sabotage and boycott. Moreover, the Ecopetrol manager ruled out the possibility that Colombia would refine crude oil in Cuba because, he said, the refineries on the island are too old.
