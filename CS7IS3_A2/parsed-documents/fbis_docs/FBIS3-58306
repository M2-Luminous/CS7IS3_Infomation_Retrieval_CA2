According to a secret document of the Tehran Parliament that FOCUS has obtained, Kinkel pointed out that the execution of the alleged Iraqi spy would place a serious strain on German-Iranian relations. Bonn would be grateful if the death sentence were to be commuted to life imprisonment. Apart from that, one has to do everything to keep the topic out of the media, Kinkel reportedly said.
