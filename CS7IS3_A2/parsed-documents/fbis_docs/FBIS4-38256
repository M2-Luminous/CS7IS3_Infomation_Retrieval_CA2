Monte Carlo radio interviewed the member of the Palestinian National Authority [PNA] immediately after the meeting. [Begin recording] ['Amarah] Dr. Sha'th: What topics were discussed during the meeting? [Sha'th] We discussed all outstanding issues. Moreover, we planned for future talks. I can say that today's meeting marked a real beginning for the second phase. It was also in preparation for the meeting between President 'Arafat on the one hand, and Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres on the other, due to be held in Paris on 7 July. It was an important meeting for the overall peace process. We discussed the issue of detainees and prisoners. I have informed Maj. Gen. Rothschild that we have chosen Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq, a freed prisoner, to be the chairman of the Palestinian committee assigned the task of holding negotiations on Palestinian detainees and prisoners. All members of this committee will be freed detainees and prisoners. Additionally, we agreed on a good first step for the negotiating process. Nonetheless, I cannot divulge details. This is because I will go to President 'Arafat first to seek his approval of this prelude before it is announced. ['Amarah] Has a date been set for the resumption of talks? [Sha'th] This is also contingent upon the venue and time, which have to be decided by President 'Arafat first. ['Amarah] Israeli Minister of Environmental Protection Yosi Sarid, who took part in the meeting, has said that he attended the meeting to find out how the agreement will be implemented on the ground, and also to find out about the problems facing the agreement. He expressed his belief that there must be a rapid transfer of powers to the PNA in the occupied West Bank, with the exception of settlements, Jerusalem, and safe roads, as he put it.
