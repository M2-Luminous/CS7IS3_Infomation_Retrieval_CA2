In particular, the document on the situation in Bosnia and the bomb strikes of the Serbian positions in the region of Gorazde inflicted by NATO aviation, points out that as a permanent member of the UN Security Council Russia "cannot stand aside from such responsible decisions and should not associate itself with forcible actions which it has not sanctioned." At the same time the faction expressed conviction that there cannot be any success without Russia's everyday contribution into the settlement process in the former Yugoslavia. "One should act resolutely in order to put an end to deaths and deprivations of innocent civilians, to violence and terror, to any provocations whoever provokes them," the statement reads. The Russia's Choice faction also declared that the incident connected with the seizure of the territory of the Black Sea Fleet's 318th squadron in Odessa and the arrest of its officers and employees by the Ukrainian special purpose forces "can aggravate relations between Ukraine and Russia." The indefinite status of the Black Sea Fleet "is fertile ground for further dangerous provocations," says the document. "We welcome the decision of Russian and Ukrainian presidents to resume negotiations on the status of the Black Sea Fleet and call on them to force diplomatic efforts in this important sphere of bilateral relations," declared the Russia's Choice faction.
