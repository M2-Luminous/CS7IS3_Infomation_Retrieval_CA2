Reports from Firmino Lukamba, Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel's correspondent in that city, say that people are crying everywhere. Yet another father, a mother, a grandfather, or son dies. Yesterday the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] aircraft once again carried out another heavy air raid against positions on the outskirts of N'Dalatando. The raids were carried out by 3 Su-25 aircraft and 5 PC-7 aircraft which dropped highly potent toxic bombs over villages, districts, and communes, resulting in considerable human and material losses. Firmino Lukamba says that the democratic world should persuade Luanda to stop such operations. He said that there is authentic genocide in N'Dalatando, and the international community is silent about the issue.
