Kakh leader Barukh Marzel, currently in prison, and Kahana Hay leader Binyamin Kahana decided on the merger. Beni Kahana held a news conference this afternoon in Jerusalem to report on the affair. Our correspondent Nitzan Hen reports: [Begin video-recording] [Hen] The decision to merge Kakh and Kahana Hay was born in the Hasharon Prison where Binyamin Kahana was held in the same cell with his biggest rival, Barukh Marzel. Kahana was released from prison last weekend. In response to the wave of administrative detention orders issued against activists of both movements, the two decided to put personal rivalries aside and work together. [Kahana] In putting a large group of people in prison, the government has itself established the alternative leadership. [Hen] The police sent its own observers to the news conference, fearing that the cooperation declaration might not strictly fall within the law. [Kakh activist Mikha'el Ben-Ari] The cooperation will mainly be expressed in public activity, primarily on the streets. There will be legal coordination of our struggle against the various government decisions. We will also choose other ways, some of which we will disclose, others of which we will only report after the fact. [end recording]
