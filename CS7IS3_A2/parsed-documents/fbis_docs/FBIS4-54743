The fund should be financed by a 50 percent share from proceeds from privatization of agricultural companies and should start operating in June. It will be administered through the National Bank of Slovakia by some of the banks that have granted loans to agricultural producers in the past. Koncos said Polnobanka (Agricultural Bank) and Vseobecna uverova banka (General Credit Bank) were under consideration. The fund is to provide money particularly for technological equipment for agricultural, forest and water management companies. Koncos also said the ministry was working on food legislation which includes stricter criteria for inspecting the quality of food products, in line with European Union regulations. He said that Slovakia, in contrast to the Czech Republic, had already adopted a number of norms corresponding to regulations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which had also brought about the introduction of certificates on imported food products.
