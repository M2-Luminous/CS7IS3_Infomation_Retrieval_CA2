The group for investigating the chases of those disappeared without trace during the 1992 armed conflict also presented a report. The session discoursed the project on cooperation between the Joint Control Commission and CSCE in the security zone proposed by the CSCE mission to Moldova. The report of the Joint Military Command indicated that a grenade and 16 cartridges were confiscated from a Tighina inhabitant last week. Some 107 people were detained for violating the regulations of the security zone. The report also states that the Dniester side again impeded the Joint Control Commission from inspecting the Tighina fortress where as it was earlier reported a Dniester motorized battalion is located.

It was suggested that the parties examine the CSCE mission's proposal and discuss it at a new joint session with the CSCE mission representatives.
