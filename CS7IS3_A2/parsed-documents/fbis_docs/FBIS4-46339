Up to 2,500 hired killers could already be in the country. A special investigation by City Press has found a terrifying web of conspiracy between the highly trained mercenaries and groups of rightwingers bent on toppling the ANC-led Government of National Unity. Police said they knew many German neo-Nazis were infiltrating the country -- and warned that they should expect no mercy from the law. It has been found that the Nazis -- who enjoy close links with the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] -- and other secret organisations -- have been armed with weapons of Russian origin and provided with military uniforms used by the SADF [South African Defense Force]. The mercenaries have also been linked to Third Force activities, the manufacturing of deadly weapons and gun running. Security forces believe some of the Nazis enter the country illegally and are issued with false identification documents. South African and German authorities are, however, cooperating in trying to weed out the Nazi assassins. Although the Department of Home Affairs and National Statistics Services have no figures of German tourists who entered SA [South Africa] in March and April, the figure for February was 10,477, compared to less than 1,000 in January. It is estimated that more than 800 mercenaries entered the country in February. During an interview, which was attended by a foreign television crew, one of the sources -- who asked to remain anonymous -- showed City Press a large quantity of rifle bullets he said he had purchased from the foreigners. [passage omitted] City Press also found that when Germans enter the country they are put in a private house in Kempton Park. There they are given money and documents before they are dispatched to their underground cells. The Germans were promised 1,000 German marks per week for doing duty in South Africa. A German embassy spokesman in Pretoria said they knew of the Nazis coming into SA from Namibia and Mozambique. Others came from Germany, the French Foreign Legion and Bosnia. "There is little that we can do to stop them coming into the country with valid documents, even though they are not coming with good intentions. However, we are working closely with South African authorities to identify them," he said. Safety and Security Ministry spokesman Craig Kotze said police knew of the mercenaries' presence and special action to counter them had been launched. "They are planning to use South Africa for easy pickings as a mercenary mecca. But we are watching them. Their moves are being closely monitored." Kotze said an investigation was underway into the role of the Nazis as they were regarded as extremely dangerous.
