A total of 428 enterprises completely stopped their work due to the shortage of raw materials and difficulties attributed to the sale of manufactured goods. This data was presented by the leader of the Federal Employment Service [FES] Fedor Prokopov on Thursday in Moscow. According to the experts of the Federal Employment Service, possible "partial" unemployment in 1994 will constitute 5-8 Mn people and the number of workers at unprofitable enterprises could exceed 20 percent of the total number of the employed people in Russia. As many as 4.7 million people could be fired as a result of production reduction in 1994, and the amount of people who had no work or who lost it and are looking for a job could exceed 12 million people. At the same time, experts believe that because of the discrepancy in supply and demand the unsatisfactory demand for working places could exceed 6 Mn people or 8.7 percent of the able bodied population in 1994. Experts of the Federal Employment Service are convinced that unemployment will become the dominating problem in social and economic policy this year. To this effect they intend to undertake certain measures on the urgent introduction of compensation payments for approximately 970,000 people who are forced to work an incomplete working day or week or who are forced to take vacation without payment. The Federal Employment Service forecasts that in 1994 it will be able to find work for 1.5 million people and 550,000 people will be granted an opportunity to re-train at the expense of the funds of the non-budget employment fund totalling 4 trillion rubles. The service is especially concerned about the situation of those leaving school, training colleges, and institutes; about 500,000 of them will be unemployed in 1994, including 90,000 graduates from high schools. The Federal Employment Service intends to preserve the quotas at existing enterprises to accept graduates from schools and institutes and to financially support employers who hire young people. The government's presidium agreed to the key provisions of the draft of the federal program on employment for 1994, however, it has returned it for revision to the specially formed governmental commission headed by Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov.
