In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Grachev said that the trip had been postponed twice. "When I was flying here I expected to see restraint and hear traditional phrases instead of words about closer contacts," he said. "However pretty soon, mostly on the initiative of the Romanian side, there were no doubts about the need for my visit left, all our neighbours stressed that despite the long stagnation in bilateral relations Romania is ready to develop equal and mutually beneficial ties with Russia," the minister said. Relations between the armed forces of the two countries broke up after the conflict in the Dniester Republic, Grachev continued. Now Romanian partners have shown that they have changed their views. "During the talks none of our partners tried to raise the question about the situation in Moldova. This is a real turn -- not to connect our bilateral relations with the situation in a third country. The situation in Moldova is the internal affair of that independent state and its leaders will settle it on their own," he said. The key question of Russian-Romanian military relations is cooperation in the military and technical sphere. The disintegration of the Warsaw Pact has severed traditional ties between the two countries. The bulk of machinery and equipment now used by the Romanian Army was made in the Soviet Union. Some spare parts could be produced in Romania, but the majority of them have to be supplied from Russia. Now that Romanian and Russian defence departments signed an agreement on cooperation, Romanian plants which have been making spare parts for obsolete military equipment will switch to civilian production, others will be modernised with Russia's assistance. Romania was the first to have joined the Partnership for Peace programme and made no secret of its intention to eventually join NATO, Grachev noted. "President (Ion) Iliescu told me that Romania calls for integration into NATO with all other countries simultaneously, including Russia. The head of the Romanian state foresees the transformation of that military-political alliance into a military-peace-making union. Moreover, the president of Romania prioritises partnership not so much in the military as in the economic sphere," he added. Many former Warsaw Pact countries consider the Partnership for Peace programme as a stage towards full integration with NATO. This is a very long process which will go gradually. Now these countries are not ready to enter NATO and this transitional period may last eight to ten years, according to various estimates. "As for Russia, we will not integrate into the structures of the North Atlantic Alliance. One of the reasons is that it is impossible to adjust Russian nuclear missiles to NATO standards. Russia is a great power and it has a great Army with powerful modern weapons. That's why we stand for close cooperation, but the Partnership for Peace programme is not a transitional stage for us," Grachev said. "Fears that this programme may hamper the establishment of new military structures within the CIS are groundless," the minister continued. "There are certain circles in Russia which have never stopped considering Western countries, let alone NATO, as an enemy. It is they who claim that Russia is allegedly being involved in NATO structures and that NATO will soon govern Russia. This will never happen. We can exist on our own and resist any bloc, including NATO, if the need arises. It is time to stop frightening our people with American and NATO threat," he said. In a separate statement made at a news conference in Bucharest, Grachev said that Russian troops will act as peace-keeping forces in the former Soviet Union, pending a respective resolution by the U.N. Security Council. Russian troops will be deployed in a republic only with consent of its leaders and will act in conjunction with the troops of that republic to prevent bloodsheds. At present, 15,000 Russian troops are engaged in peace-keeping operations. The issue is expected to be discussed during U.N. Secretary General Butros Butros-Ghali's upcoming visit to Moscow in April.
