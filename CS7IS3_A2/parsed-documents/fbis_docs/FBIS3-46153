Kozyrev, who arrived Wednesday for a three-day visit, told his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen that the strengthening of bilateral relations would remain a "top priority" and that he hoped Chinese President Jiang Zemin could visit Moscow for a summit later this year. The two foreign ministers met for more than two hours of "sincere and cordial" talks on bilateral and international issues, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said, adding that one hour of the talks was held in private. No details were given of their closed-door session. Relations between the two neighbours would not suffer as the result of "political changes in Russia's domestic situation," Kozyrev was quoted as saying. According to the spokesman, Qian said high-level contacts over the past year, including the visit here by President Boris Yeltsin in December, had lent "great impetus" to the development of Sino-Russian relations, particularly economic and trade links. Bilateral trade last year soared 30 percent from 1992 to 7.7 billion dollars, with border exchanges alone accounting for 2.5 billion dollars. Following their talks, Kozyrev and Qian signed an agreement for regular consultations on the establishment of "transit ports" along their 4,500-kilometre (2,800-mile) common border. About 20 such ports are currently in operation. The spokesman did not say if the two foreign ministers had discussed the possibilty of visa restrictions to stem the flood of people crossing the border daily. Some 2.5 million people crossed the border in 1993 and Kozyrev admitted before leaving Moscow that the number of Chinese in Russia had become "a very serious problem." Kozyrev was quoted as telling Qian that Moscow's military policy was strictly "defensive" and he reiterated Russia's commitment to a bilateral agreement pledging non-use of nuclear weapons against each other. After the Sino-Soviet rift that developed at the beginning of the 1960s, the two communist giants officially reconciled in 1989 during a visit to China by Mikhail Gorbachev. Since Yeltsin became president of Russia in 1991 following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moscow and Beijing have enjoyed close military cooperation. While the two foreign ministers discussed cooperation in various areas, the spokesman said they had not specifically touched on military issues. Kozryev also voiced hopes that Russia would be able to participate in several large-scale construction projects in China, including the massive Three Gorges hydroelectric dam being built on the Yangtze River. Qian said he would welcome Russian cooperation, the spokesman said. Kozyrev is due to hold talks with Jiang on Friday before leaving for a tour of the southern Chinese special economic zone of Shenzhen.
