FBIS4-20975 "jptdd014__l94035" JPRS-TDD-94-014-L JPRS Narcotics 28 March 1994 LATIN AMERICA PANAMA Coca Fields in Darien Province Destroyed During `Operation Coca Fields in Darien Province Destroyed During `Operation Tornado' PA0104204494 Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 28 Mar 94 p 1A PA0104204494 Panama City LA PRENSA Spanish BFN [Report by Ibeth Vega G.] [Text] The Panamanian Public Force, with the aid of the U.S. military and in coordination with Colombian authorities, has destroyed at least 10 coca fields in Darien Province and detained an undisclosed number of people. Operation Tornado, directed by Major Santiago Fundora of the National Air Service (SAN), was confirmed to LA PRENSA by President Guillermo Endara himself, who thanked the newspaper for not reporting on the operation before its completion, even though the newspaper had received all of the information well ahead of time. Operation Tornado was launched Saturday morning when three teams--one from the SAN, one from the National Police, and one from the Institutional Protection Service (SPI)--flew to Darien aboard several SAN helicopters to destroy the coca fields, whose acreage was not disclosed. The groups also destroyed coca-processing labs in the region along the border with Colombia. Fundora reported to Endara on 27 March that the operation had been "a complete success," because at least 10 coca fields had been destroyed. Endara said the Panamanian authorities also set fire to several huts presumed to be small coca-processing labs. He also confirmed that several people were caught and handed over to the proper authorities. One source who asked to remain anonymous said Operation Tornado was carried out quickly and without any clashes. Those arrested were taken by surprise in the afternoon and evening last Saturday. The operation was nearly complete yesterday, Sunday morning, although several coca fields, allegedly planted by Colombians, had yet to be destroyed. The source said Panamanian and Colombian authorities took part in the operation, along with the U.S. Government's logistical support through the U.S. Embassy in Panama. The source also told LA PRENSA that the authorities are looking for a hacienda worth several millions of dollars and located somewhere in the Darien jungle. Endara said: "I have been told that the operation was a complete success. The second stage consists of burning other fields that were found." Members of the special teams that participated in Operation Tornado are still in Darien. They are expected to begin to return to Panama City today provided no trouble arises with guerrillas in the Palle area who have threatened to shoot down Public Force planes and helicopters. Endara did not reveal the size or exact location of the coca fields destroyed or the number of police who took part in the operation. An official report is expected to be released today, however. Panamanian and Colombian security forces have been carrying a coordinated work against drug trafficking and to heighten border security to prevent a number of crimes perpetrated in and around the jungle. This type of work started to be carried out in the framework of good-neighbor commissions that Presidents Endara and Cesar Gaviria installed last year. As part of the effort, a number of Pamamanian agents have received police training in Colombia. In addition to fighting drug trafficking, the two countries have been implementing a process of rapprochement and cooperation on energy, trade, culture, and agriculture and livestock, according to official reports of the two governments.
