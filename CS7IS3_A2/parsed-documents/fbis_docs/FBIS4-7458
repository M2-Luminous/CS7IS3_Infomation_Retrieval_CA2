According to him, the government has reached the conclusion that the days before signing the agreements with the international financial institutes will prompt the most acute conflicts from a political point of view. [Begin Matinchev recording] Our opponents know that those agreements will be signed in the next few days. On behalf of the Bulgarian Government, I want to assure the Bulgarian people that precisely those agreements, against the background of the strenuous budget adopted by the National Assembly and the difficulties that all people experience, will contribute to stabilizing the general socioeconomic situation in the country. Unfortunately, precisely at this moment, apparently sensing an opportunity to destabilize the country, certain political and financial forces are trying to create panic on the foreign currency and stock market by disseminating incorrect and provocative rumors, thus prompting speculators to purchase convertible currency on their behalf in unjustifiably large quantities. In the last two days and especially yesterday, this caused an abnormal and speculative rise in the dollar rate on the foreign currency market. [end recording] Further in his statement, Evgeni Matinchev stressed that the government is determined to achieve its goals and successfully complete the talks with the international financial institutes. Together with the National Bank, the government will adopt measures aimed at stopping the speculations. Deputy Prime Minister Matinchev appealed to sober politicians and all citizens to preserve maximum calm, something that would guarantee the success of the reforms, prevent the devaluation of the Bulgarian lev, and the destabilization of the country.
