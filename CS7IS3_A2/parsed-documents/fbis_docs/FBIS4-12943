These representatives of the residents of the occupied territories declare their non-commitment to any agreements that will be signed regarding Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. This memorandum will soon be presented to the United Nations and the envoys of various countries in Jerusalem. According to the Palestinian sources who provided this information, the initiative for this memorandum came from Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi and some West Bank and Gaza Strip mayors. The memorandum is expected to include many names since it enjoys the support of all Palestinian opposition organizations in addition to the People's Party and some Fatah figures. The memorandum was drawn up in the wake of the immense pressure that Israel is exerting on the PLO in the negotiations in a bid to obtain further concessions, not to mention the Israeli practices on the ground against Palestinians, such as the recent closure imposed on the occupied territories.
