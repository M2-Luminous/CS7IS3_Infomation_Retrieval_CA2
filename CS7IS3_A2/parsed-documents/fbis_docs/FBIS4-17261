FBIS4-17261 "drsov078_v_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-078 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 Lithuania Election Commission Denies Decisions `Biased' Election Commission Denies Decisions `Biased' WS2104112494 Tallinn BNS in English 1003 GMT 21 Apr 94 WS2104112494 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Vilnius, Apr 21, BNS -- The Chief Election Commission [CEC] of Lithuania on Wednesday [20 April] circulated a statement denying accusations that its decisions are politically biased. The statement came as a reaction to allegations that the CEC unlawfully refused to register Conservative Party candidate Liudvikas Sabutis for a by-election in the Kaisiadorys district. The conservatives filed an appeal against the decision to the Supreme Court. Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the Lithuanian parliament's opposition, said CEC is manipulated by the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party. The CEC said Sabutis was denied registration because the Conservative Party did not register itself specially for elections, although the conservatives are an officially registered political party. The Conservative Party says the commission misinterpreted the law on election, which does not require special registration for elections. In its statement, the CEC said Landsbergis' allegations are "groundless and insulting." The commission said it "always observed and will observe the Constitution and Lithuanian laws." A by-election election in the Kaisiadorys district to fill a vacancy left by President Algirdas Brazauskas is scheduled for May 15. Bakery worker Albinas Visockas, leader of the newly founded extreme-left Socialist Party, is the only candidate registered for the election. Visockas nominated himself as an independent candidate. Justinas Karosas, chairman of the ruling LDLP faction, categorically denied accusations of manipulating the CEC. Karosas told reporters Wednesday that the party in power will neither support nor hinder Visockas's participation in the by-election.
