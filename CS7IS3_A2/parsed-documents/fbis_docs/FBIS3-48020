With Japan-U.S. economic framework talks facing rough sailing and debates on deregulation and income tax reductions in Japan stalled, U.S. Government officials are increasingly taking the view that "Japanese bureaucrats are standing in the way of changes for Japan." U.S. Government officials are taking this view because Japan's politics are unable to display leadership and Japanese bureaucrats are increasingly taking an inward-looking attitude, asserting that "Japan must say what it needs to say and it must protect what it needs to protect." Under these circumstances, there is no sign in sight for breaking the stalemate in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The criticism by Japanese bureaucrats is roughly classified into two categories. First, the Japanese bureaucrats are standing in the way of rebuilding Japan's economic structure, which has been sought by the United States. The U.S. side explained: "We have drawn that conclusion after reviewing the results of a series of discussions by deliberation and research councils of the Japanese Government." The Provisional Council for the Promotion of Administrative Reform has been deluged with a flurry of deregulation requests from the private sector, but many of the council members only lamented: "We have been unable to brush aside the resistance of government ministries and agencies." Late last year, the United States expected the Economic Reform Research Council (the Hiraiwa Commission) to make a recommendation that Japan set a target on its own to cut its current account surplus, but the recommendation has disappeared. Every day the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo translates a huge volume of Japanese newspapers to send to Washington. The embassy has also used its own channels to gather information about discussions by the deliberation and research councils from sources close to the prime minister and other sources. There is a strong indication that the White House, the State Department, and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) have lobbied the Hiraiwa Commission to draw conclusions favorable to the United States. Last December, one American under secretary-level official after another visited Japan for the sole purpose of "collecting the information." The National Economic Council (NEC), the supreme decisionmaking body for U.S. economic policy, at a recent working-level meeting, concluded that: "All conclusion drawn by the deliberation and research councils were far from meeting our expectations because of resistance from the bureaucracy." Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to President Clinton said: "Japanese bureaucrats are giving more priority to the interests of their respective ministries than to the prime minister's intentions." Many U.S. Government officials think that Japanese bureaucrats are whipping up anti-America sentiment. In particular, the U.S. side was surprised to find that: "Officials in charge of past external negotiations in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] and the International Finance Bureau of the Finance Ministry are now in the forefront of criticism against the United States after abruptly turning inward. A U.S. Government official, who does not hide his irritation, said: "The Japanese bureaucracy appears to have a "policy consensus" of never making concessions to the protectionist Clinton administration." Several Japanese Government authorities have admitted the existence of the policy consensus. Last September, Japanese negotiators decided to uphold the principle of "making no concessions to any U.S. trade demand which may lead to setting numerical targets." Recently, Jiro Saito, Finance Ministry administrative vice minister, and Hideaki Kumano, MITI administrative vice minister, agreed not to hastily seek a compromise with the U.S. side to settle bilateral negotiations on insurance, automobile, and auto parts in February." "Ending the era when Japan is changed by external pressure" is a password of the Japanese bureaucrats. At the same time, however, they cannot ignore the consequences of their password -- a toughened U.S. attitude toward Japan and a vicious cycle in the two countries' relations. There is a large difference between Japanese and U.S. bureaucrats. In the United States, the President appoints all senior government officials, known as political appointees, and they are tasked with policy coordination. Mr. Cutter stated: "Their work is to carry out the President's intentions." There is a decisive difference between the United States and Japan in the personnel affairs management of senior government officials. In Japan, the prime minister has no personal ties with them, with some exceptions. American senior government officials, who share the same fate as the President, are now moving toward changes. The Clinton administration has announced its plan, worked out by those senior government officials, to cut 100,0000 federal government employees. The Japanese bureaucracy, which does not change even when a change in government occurs, is suitable for the continuity of policies but unsuitable for changes. There is no denying the Japanese bureaucracy has problems which draw criticism from the United States. American bureaucracy is too often pushed around by the President and Congress and this is a defective aspect of American bureaucracy. At Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, differences have existed between departments in charge of the talks and American officials in charge of the talks on U.S. demands. There have also been differences between them over U.S. sanctions against Japan, causing the Japanese side to distrust the U.S. side. Another cause for stalling bilateral negotiations, that seemingly contradicts U.S. criticism of the Japanese bureaucracy, is excessively high expectations by the United States for a good performance by the Japanese bureaucracy. American bureaucrats appear to have an "opportunist trend" in which they first pin high expectations to the performance, and if their expectations are not met, they then attack the Japanese bureaucracy. From the start of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the United States has pinned high hopes on the "leadership" of bureaucrats in MITI and the Finance Ministry. The United States still sticks to its demand for setting numerical targets to open the Japanese market wider after concluding that it is quick to use the conventional bureaucrat-led formula to get trade results. As for stimulus measures, some U.S. Government officials even said: "It is best to negotiate directly with Administrative Vice Minister Saito." This, however, is a miscalculation on the part of the United States. MITI's influence on businesses has waned compared with the influence it exercised in the past. What is growing in the entire bureaucratic world is an introspective mood. The voice is heard both in Japan and the United States: "No matter how many times the two countries hold working-level economic framework talks under this situation, they will only find it difficult to break the stalemate." While the United States is waging a campaign aimed at criticizing the Japanese bureaucracy, American Embassy staffers familiar with Japanese political circles are frequently contacting aides to Prime Minister Hosokawa. As a result, the United States appears to be using a tactic aimed at going over the heads of bureaucrats to seek political settlement. This U.S. tactic is aimed at gaining the same agreement as an ambiguous agreement reached between former Prime Minister Miyazawa and President Clinton last July that "set an objective criteria in both quantitative and qualitative terms," leaving its definition unclear. If the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks are to produce some agreements before Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled for February, the United States may use the same tactic to seek an "ambiguous political settlement" which, like the July agreement, will leave something less than desirable. Behind Japan-U.S. trade friction are differences between the bureaucrats of Japan and the United States.
