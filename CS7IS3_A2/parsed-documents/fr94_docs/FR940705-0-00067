FR940705-0-00067 FR940705-0-00009 If the conditional approval is converted to a disapproval, the sanctions clock under section 179(a) will begin. This clock will begin at the time EPA issues the final disapproval or on the date the State fails to meet its commitment. In the latter case, EPA will notify the State by letter that the conditional approval has been converted to a disapproval and that the sanctions clock has begun. If the State does not submit and EPA does not approve the rule on which the disapproval was based within 18 months of the disapproval, EPA must impose one of the sanctions under section 179(b)_highway funding restrictions or the offset sanction. In addition, the final disapproval triggers the federal implementation plan (FIP) requirement under section 110(c). This action has been classified as a Table 3 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225) as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for a revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et. seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. By today's action, EPA is conditionally or fully approving four (4) State programs created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The programs being conditionally or fully approved today do not impose any new regulatory burden on small businesses; these are programs under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance provided by the state. Therefore, because the EPA's conditional or full approvals of these four programs do not impose any new regulatory requirements on small businesses, EPA certifies that this action does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected. Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit within 60 days from date of publication. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).
