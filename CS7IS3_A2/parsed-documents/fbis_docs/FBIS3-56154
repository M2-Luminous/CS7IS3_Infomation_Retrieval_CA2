In exchange for ephemeral international aid, Ukraine will recklessly dispose of its nuclear weapons. Stetskiv spoke in favor of simultaneous disarmament of all nuclear states. The only promising news is that the agreement must be ratified by the Supreme Council, he added, and this is very unlikely to occur. Stetskiv believes that the negative aspect of the Partnership for Peace initiative is that it contradicts the idea of the Baltic-Black Sea Commonwealth; one positive aspect is that it has been offered to Ukraine along with other Central Europe countries, but not Russia. This, in his opinion, gives a chance for Ukraine's integration with Europe without Russia. We should knock more decisively on Europe's door, concluded Stetskiv.
