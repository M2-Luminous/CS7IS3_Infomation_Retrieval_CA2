Blondin Beye and the observers today met with the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. The government did not take part in the meeting and is not aware of the outcome of the meeting. Pedro Manuel reports from Lusaka: There are contradictory reports about the new text dealing with specific issues. Yesterday the mediator and the observers were reported to have drafted a new document. Meanwhile, reliable sources say the mediator and the observers failed to put the final touches on the new document because UNITA did not cooperate. UNITA successively postponed its comments on the specific principles ruling the police force, alleging that it needed more time to evaluate the main document. Finally, this afternoon the UNITA negotiating team presented its position to the mediator and the observers, but it has not been possible to confirm this in view of the news blackout [preceding word in English]. Meanwhile, the government is awaiting for Blondin Beye to give details about this afternoon's meeting between the mediator, the observers and UNITA. There are rumors that government and UNITA delegations will meet face to face tomorrow.
