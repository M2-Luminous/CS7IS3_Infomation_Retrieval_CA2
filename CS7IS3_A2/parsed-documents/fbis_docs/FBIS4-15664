Only three-four projects in each area will be supported from amongst the current 22 communications satellite projects and ten proposals on space distant earth probing systems. The Almaz interesting and costly project is in question, as its financing would mean termination of other earth probing programs. The mars program can hardly be financed as well. At the same time, the space agency does not give up promising research and development. As for non-state financing sources, Russian commercial structures do not want to invest in works to bring benefits in a few years. Several commercial projects of communications satellites are all Russia now has. The world space market is not eager to welcome Russia, despite the fact it has a unique set of reliable rocket-boosters, including proton, which are able to put a satellite on any orbit even the most exotic, said Milov. The space agency is open to international cooperation. It has three contracts to launch foreign satellites with Russian rocket-boosters, Russian satellites are equipped with foreign machinery, exchange of satellite information is underway, flights of foreign cosmonauts on board the Mir station are profitable, same as the lease of satellite channels by foreign clients.
