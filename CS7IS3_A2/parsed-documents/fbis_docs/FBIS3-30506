The general view is that the material should leave the country in the very near future. According to one of the proposals to unload the material, the Russian firm of Tekhnosnabeksport, acting as an agent, would acquire the concentrate at $17 per kilogram, and then sell fuel rods filled with the uranium to the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Station for $27.20 each. The price reportedly includes the cost of shipping, safeguarding, and storing the rods. In the view of experts specializing in this market, which is monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the uranium concentrate will be sold for $26.59 per kilogram. On the free market the prices are lower, ranging from $18.44 to $19.35. The cost of producing uranium in Bulgaria ranges from $202 to $73, and is on average 4.5 times higher that free market prices. Before the uranium industry was shut down, Bulgaria produced about 250 tons of concentrate per year, which satisfied 35 percent of its own needs. These 250 tons can be used to generate 8.4 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. There are two possibilities for supplying the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Station with nuclear fuel. The first is to buy uranium rods filled with Russian fuel, and the second is to fill the rods with Bulgarian material. Experts claim that then a kilowatt-hour of electric power would be 166 times more expensive. The Council of Ministers will designate the organizations that will engage in putting the uranium concentrate onto the international market. One of the possibilities is the state company Rudmetal, another is the private Intersteel company, which belongs to Multigroup.
