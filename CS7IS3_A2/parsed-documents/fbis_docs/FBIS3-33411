Congressman John Joseph Moakley announced that the United States will withhold $20 million of annual aid to pressure the Salvadoran Government to investigate a sizable swindle conducted by a domestic bank. The opposition deputies do not agree with the U.S. Congress' decision to withhold aid in light of a swindle that took place in a domestic bank more than six years ago. Jorge Avear of the PDC [Christian Democratic Party] and Guillermo Guevara of the MAS [Authentic Christian Movement] agreed that it is regrettable that a private matter has a bearing on such U.S. decisions, because this falls outside the purview of foreign policy. [Begin recording] [Unidentified speaker] What happens in a bank is clearly a financial matter; it is not related to the central government's actions. It does not seem logical to me to say that because this incident took place and has not been cleared up that economic aid should be suspended. It is not fair, suitable, or appropriate for an entire nation to be punished by denying the aid it needs because of a private matter that, to a great extent, is criminal in nature. [end recording] The $30 million swindle took place at a domestic bank when the PDC was in power. In the case, the swindle involved a number of companies, including some shrimp harvesting companies, that received credits without giving any guarantees when the financial system was controlled by the state. This situation prompted the suspension of U.S. aid to El Salvador, according to Congressman Moakley. Deputy Juan Jose Martell said this situation exposes a larger problem. [Begin recording] [Deputy Juan Jose Martell] [words indistinct] a problem, $20 million are retained. Our nation's problem is a banking system that does not operate properly. [end recording] In Martell's opinion the swindle places the national financial system -- which, by the way, he does not consider reliable -- in a difficult position. According to Martell, this is not the first time that incidents such as these have taken place, recalling the fraud committed by [word indistinct] against the Salvadoran banking system.
