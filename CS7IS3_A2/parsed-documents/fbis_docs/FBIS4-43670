Talks between the political parties in the province are not expected to resume before the autumn because of slow progress by the British and Irish governments in drafting the framework document, which is intended to provide a focus for the talks. The governments had hoped to publish the document to coincide with a planned bilateral summit next month, but following a meeting of the UK-Irish inter-governmental conference in Dublin yesterday, Mr Spring admitted it would be "difficult to meet that timetable." Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the framework document, which will flesh out the principles established in December's Downing Street declaration would not be "a blueprint or template" to which the parties would have to conform. But he stressed that it would have to address modification of the Republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland "if it is to have any chance of success" in bringing unionists to the negotiating table. "It is central to the problem," said Sir Patrick. Mr Spring said: "There has to be compromise on both sides, by both governments." Modification of the territorial claim would be in the context of a "balanced accommodation" which would also involve modifications to the Government of Ireland Act of 1920. He referred specifically to Section 75 of the act, which states: "The supreme authority of the parliament of the United Kingdom shall remain unaffected and undiminished over all persons and things in (Northern) Ireland and every part thereof." Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has indicated that it intends to give its "definitive response" to the Downing Street declaration early next month -- but is not now expected to recommend an end to the IRA campaign.
