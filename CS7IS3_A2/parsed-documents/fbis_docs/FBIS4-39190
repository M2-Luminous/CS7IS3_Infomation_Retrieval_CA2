IF Note: Sevem servicemen have been killed in Dushanbe in the past few days. The latest victim was Lt.-Colonel Sergey Leontikov, who was murdered Saturday [4 June] morning in a residential area of the Tajik capital. "These brutal, well-organized and purposeful crimes pose the start of methodical terror against Russian servicemen," Chechulin told a news conference in Dushanbe. He accused a leading member of the Tajik opposition and Islamic Revival Movement, Akbar Turajonzoda, and the head of the so-called "government in exile", Said Abdullo Nuri, of having provoked these actions. Russia's Deputy Defence Minister, Cl.-General Georgiy Kondratyev, also explained the series of terrorist acts with the unwillingness of the hard-line opposition to "give up its intention to resolve the Tajik problem by force, including military measures." According to the general, at the moment the opposition is concentrating its forces not only on the border with Afghanistan, but also within Tajikistan. Russia's 201st motorized infantry division stationed in Tajikistan, in cooperation with Russian frontier guards and Tajik armed forces, is capable of stopping any military actions launched by the opposition within Tajikistan and from neighboring Afghanistan, Kondratyev said. Chechulin demanded that Tajikistan's law-enforcement agencies investigate the murders without delay. Earlier First Deputy Chairman of the Tajik parliament, Abdulmajid Dostiev, tried to assure Interfax's correspondent that there are no political grounds for the murders of Russian servicemen. According to him, these are purely criminal offences, and the authorities are doing their best to find those who committed them. Some observers link Dushanbe's unwillingness to accept the version of political terror with its reluctance to aggravate relations with the opposition on the eve of another round of inter-Tajik talks which is to take place in Tehran on 14 June. In the meantime spokesmen for the opposition Movement for Islamic Revival (MIR) qualified the Russian officials' assertions as to the involvement of the Tajik opposition in the terrorist acts as conflicting with reality. In its statement released on Monday the movement said: "Certain circles are used to blame everything on the opposition. The acts of terror and violence committed in Dushanbe and other areas of Tajikistan reflect the intrigues of those forces which are not interested in a peaceful solution to the conflict, and which seek to hinder the process of talks. It's they who unleashed the civil war in Tajikistan for the purpose of seizing power, not for the purpose of restoring peace, law and order." The statement points out that the Tajik opposition would like Russia to be "more impartial and neutral toward the conflicting sides." The MIR welcomed Russia's suggestion that the opposition should join political reforms, such as debates on a new constitution, underway in Tajikistan. "However it's practically impossible to implement this initiative in the present circumstances. If a new constitution is adopted at submachine gun point, without the participation of about one million refugees, we will not recognize it," the statement points out. According to the MIR, "at first we must settle the conflict politically, ensure return for all the refugees, guarantee freedom of the press, speech, political parties and movements, and begin to discuss a new constitution nationwide in order to adopt it only after that."
