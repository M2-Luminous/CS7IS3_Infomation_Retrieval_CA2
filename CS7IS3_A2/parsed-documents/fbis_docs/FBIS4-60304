The message dubbed the move a grievous crime and high treason as well as being in clear violation of the popularly-endorsed constitution. The secession was also described as a brazen deviation from the aims and principles of the Yemeni revolution for which droves of martyrs have fallen. This criminal action, the cable read, is the latest in a series of acts of sabotage, intrigues, and treason typical of the secessionist circle in the Socialist Party.
