[Kuebart] The Air Force needs a new fighter plane as of 2002. The decision about procurement is to be made in 1995. Therefore, it is important that there are no delays in the development of the new fighter, which would call the date of such a decision into question. [FOCUS] Do you need a fighter plane at all? [Kuebart] The fighter plane is an air defense means with specific strengths, which other air defense means do not have to the same extent. I just mention the particular flexibility, the great range, and the speedy deployment of flying air defense. In particular in the new air defense concept, which is oriented toward area protection and focal points in the future, the fighter plane thus becomes an indispensable element. In the future, too, a credible and effective air defense will be possible only in a construct that unites ground-based and air-based weapons systems. [FOCUS] Do you think the procurement of 140 planes is sufficient -- particularly with a view to out-of-area missions? [Kuebart] The Bundeswehr needs a modern and efficient fighter plane as a successor to the F-4F Phantom to exercise German rights of sovereignty in the air space, to make an appropriate contribution to the alliance, to sufficiently secure the effectiveness of NATO's air defense in Central Europe together with the allied armed forces, and to contribute to the protection of the allies in crises. The number of planes, which has been considerably reduced compared with the original Air Force plans, takes the changed security policy conditions into consideration. [FOCUS] Will the "thrift" fighter have to be reequipped sooner or later? [Kuebart] In the view of the Air Force the operational demands on the new fighter plane, which have been changed as a result of the reorientation, are acceptable and do not require short-term corrections.
