We hope Hong Kong's public servants will continue to work for the HKSAR Government after 1997. The HKSAR Government will certainly act according to the Basic Law, and the interests of the public servants are protected by law. This morning, mainland members of the PWC held a discussion with the principal responsible persons of seven Hong Kong public servants' organizations, hearing their opinions and suggestions on matters related to public servants. The seven organizations are (?the Association of Hong Kong Government Employees of Chinese Descent, Hong Kong Retired Public Servants Welfare Society, Hong Kong Public Servants Federation, Hong Kong Government Employees Association, Hong Kong Federation of Public Servant Unions, Hong Kong Retired Public Servants Association, and Hong Kong Local Public Servants Association.) After attentively listening to the views of the responsible persons of these seven organizations, Lu Ping said: The current disputes between China and Britain will definitely not affect China's policy towards public servants. In other words, the articles in the Basic Law concerning public servants will definitely not be affected and will be carried out as they are currently stipulated. Hong Kong public servants may rest assured in this. He urged those responsible persons present at the meeting to publicize his reassurance among the members of their organizations. Lu Ping stated: According to the Basic Law, the principal officials of the HKSAR Government shall be Chinese citizens who are permanent residents of the region, and who shall be nominated by the chief executive and appointed by the central government. Besides the principal officials, we hope all other public servants will remain and continue to work at their present posts after 1 July 1997. He reassured the public servants that the break of the Sino- British talks will definitely not affect their future, although the two countries could no longer cooperate in Hong Kong's political structure. Lu Ping said: Some people are worried whether the financial strains of the HKSAR Government will affect the public servants' retirement pensions after 1 July 1997. I would like to reassure you we have already taken the matter into account. Besides, according to the Basic Law, the HKSAR Government shall strive to achieve fiscal balance and "keep expenditures within the limits of revenues." However, the budgeted expenditures must include the retirement pensions of public servants. He emphasized: The retirement pensions of public servants after 1997 are clearly stipulated in the Basic Law and are protected by that law; they will not be affected by the Sino-British disputes. Lu Ping added: Of course we also support your proposal on establishing a pension fund before 1997. The British Hong Kong Government has proposed to establish a HK$7-billion pension fund. The amount is of course far from sufficient. However, even if the pension fund is not established, the HKSAR Government will surely pay your retirement pensions, and those pensions are guaranteed. Please rest assured in this regard. This is Chinese Government policy and has been stipulated in the Basic Law. We will certainly act according to the law. Lu Ping said: Some people have suggested that a consultancy group for public servant issues be established within the PWC's Political Affairs Subcommittee. This is a good suggestion. It is important to establish a formal channel of communications, constantly exchange views, and avoid unnecessary misunderstandings between the PWC and public servants. He said the PWC would study the suggestion. Lu Ping also stated: Besides the PWC, there are many other channels of communication available. For instance, within the Hong Kong branch of the XINHUA News Agency there is a special department handling public servant issues. He hoped Hong Kong public servants will not hesitate to bring their questions to that department. According to Lu Ping, the British Hong Kong Government is not very enthusiastic about contacts between the public servants and the PWC, and sometimes purposefully creates obstacles. Citing an example, he said: The PWC has extended an invitation to officials of the departments concerned within the British Hong Kong Government to come and explain the draft regulations for the new airport administration. It is a simple matter, but the British Hong Kong Government issued an order prohibiting them from contact with us. To facilitate coordination over railroad construction and connection, responsible persons of the Guangzhou-Jiulong Railroad Company were supposed to attend a discussion with members of the PWC's Economic Affairs Subcommittee this morning. The meeting is for a good purpose, and both the time and place have been set, but they changed their mind at the last minute. Lu Ping stated: These tricks are completely unnecessary. We are very willing to establish a constant channel of communication between us and the public servants. For the sake of a smooth transition and to reassure public servants, and for the sake of normal operations of the HKSAR Government in the future, we still hope you will keep in touch with us, despite the British Hong Kong Government's deliberate obstruction. Lu Ping added: After 1997, public servants will not be required to express their political attitude. The suggestion made earlier by the PWC's Political Affairs Subcommittee is merely for the purpose of reminding any public servant who does not want to stay and work for the HKSAR Government in 1997 to give the government notice beforehand so that a replacement can be found to facilitate normal operation of the HKSAR Government. In the afternoon, the members of the PWC's Political Affairs and Economic Affairs Subcommittees held a discussion with more than 20 district advisers.
