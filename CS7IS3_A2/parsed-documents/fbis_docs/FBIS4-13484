[passage omitted] The slain terrorist was the deputy of Ayman al-Zawahiri, the fugitive al-Jihad commander who lives abroad, and the group's top man in charge of organization inside Egypt. As described by a senior official in the security organs, he was the most senior member inside the country and was worth a thousand ordinary members. It was Shulah who planned the attempted assassination of Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi. He used to follow him daily from his house to his Interior Ministry office so as to prepare the plan well. It was Shulah who prepared the members who took part in the ambush and the one who convinced one of those involved in the crime to undertake the suicidal explosion, blowing himself to pieces. 'Adil Siyam's control of his aides was so awesome that he imprisoned Diya'-al-Din Dawud Mahmud Hafiz, who later carried out the suicidal attack on the interior minister, in a locked room for 30 consecutive hours to mentally prepare him for the crime, only letting him out to perpetrate the crime. It was Shulah who planned to attack Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, assassinate Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif, and UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali during his visit to Egypt. His last crime was to plan the assassination of the primary witness in Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's case. The witness was killed when extremists shot him in the car showroom he owned in Shibin al-Qanatir. Notorious terrorist 'Adil lived in the al-Basatin quarter but moved between dozens of dens in al-Munib, the outskirts of al-Qalyubiyah, al-Khankah, Shibin al-Qanatir, and the Bilbays desert. He only held an intermediate trade certificate but dressed elegantly and wore "RayBan" sunglasses and an elegant leather jacket. He spent money freely and drove around in seven different cars, all of them stolen. In his various dens security men seized enough explosives to blow up an entire city. In two apartments in al-Munib, they seized police, officers, and garbage collectors' uniforms, which he intended for his group members use when committing terrorist crimes. Terrorist 'Adil Siyam's boldness even reached the extent of preparing a number of his followers, dressed in municipal workers' uniforms, to dig 12 metres across Salah Salim Street at a specific spot, which was carefully chosen site for detonating explosives in a major operation he was planning. The terrorists wearing the municipal workers uniforms did in fact dig up the street, lay down electricity cables, and connect them to a secret hideout under the street which was to be the center for detonating a explosive device to destroy any target that might be using that road. Regrettably, no one noticed that those digging up the road were terrorists and not municipal workers or electricians. The security men also seized an underground factory for making explosives in the Bilbays desert. A long tunnel led to a spacious hall, where the security men found a number of barrels containing acid and chemicals that are used to make explosive devices. They also seized 500 grenades that were ready for use. The notorious terrorist was under the security men's close observation for a long time. But they preferred to let him stay free so as to capture all the members of the organization and expose their plans and dens. The security organs did in fact arrest 32 persons, including seven hardened criminals who were being prepared to carry out suicidal operations similar to the attempt to assassinate Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi. The security organs also discovered the means and ways by which these groups were financed from abroad. Most of the remittances that 'Adil Siyam received came from Palermo, capital of the Italian island of Sicily, to an Egyptian bank. The security organs monitored their account numbers and balances. The remittances that this terrorist received from Palermo alone in the last five weeks totalled $14,000, 4,000 pounds Sterling, and a few thousand Egyptian pounds, all of which was seized in his dens.
