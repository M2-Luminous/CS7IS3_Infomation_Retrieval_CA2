The BAI will focus its investigative might on evils such as shoddy construction of public facilities and irregularities in public welfare, and relax administrative regulations to remove public inconvenience and insecurity, Yi pledged in his New Year speech. He warned wrongdoers and idlers in public service that he will punish them mercilessly, but promised creative and active public servants that they will be rewarded. Yi, spelling out the New Year's tasks of the independent investigative agency, said he will step up efforts to establish strict discipline in public service. Instead of correcting wrong government policies, the BAI will concentrate on strengthening its power to prevent mistakes and to raise the efficiency and appropriateness of policies in 1994, Yi said. It will establish an around-the-clock investigative structure and carry out future-minded inspections to expand the authority of the BAI, Yi said.
