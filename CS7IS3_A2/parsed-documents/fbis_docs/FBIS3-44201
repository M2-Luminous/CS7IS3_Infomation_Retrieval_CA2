Generals who were working in the FAA General Staff have now been called to the Defense Ministry in a bid to strengthen the effectiveness of the military [word indistinct] and put an end to many acts of indiscipline that have been affecting the combat morale of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] government's army. Gustavo Costa reports from Luanda: [Begin Costa recording] The recent transfer to the Defense Ministry of some generals who were only connected with the FAA General Staff appears to be the first indication that administrative, organizational, and logistical control is being restored over the structure that had until now been decoratively [decorativamente] led by [Defense Minister] Pedro Maria Tonha "Pedale", allowing the most complete freedom and autonomy to General Joao de Matos, FAA chief of General Staff. According to an authorized military source, this is ultimately an attempt to restore power and authority to the Defense Ministry, which will now also include generals who had previously served under the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA. The Defense Ministry could now play a more interventionist role in the definition of the major policies to resolve Angola's political and military problems, as well as to organize the government forces. Some observers believe that the powers of intervention the Defense Ministry will now enjoy, strengthened by the approval of its new organizational statutes, is the result of a process of limiting the FAA General Staff's present powers. According to independent military sources, the FAA General Staff's methods have been questioned both by the military and by the very leadership of the ruling MPLA Party. In view of that, it has come as no surprise that influential generals have been moved. They had until then been directly connected with the FAA General Staff's higher logistical structures, today blamed for the ostentatious behavior of some officers. In contrast, the defense sector has always done poorly on the operational front. UNITA President Jonas Savimbi views the FAA's logistics sector, which consumes enormous slices of the budget and foreign exchange cakes, as one of UNITA's principal allies. The alleged favoring of commercial transactions with enterprises of doubtful standing supposed to supply various merchandise to the FAA forces, could also be at the root of the criticism that FAA General Staff's Logistics Department has often come under. Some of that department's members and officials are accused of covering up what in Angola is called the vicious cycle of planned losses. That cycle appears to have its rotations numbered, though. According to a senior Defense Ministry officer, uncontrolled spending by the FAA General Staff must now be rigorously accounted for. That source added that, for a start, money mobility has been curtailed and, in future, FAA management will be under the control of the Defense Ministry and will have to abide by its budget restrictions. Just as a decree could be approved to stem rampant disorder and indiscipline in public enterprises and state organs, so the FAA forces and the forces of internal order could henceforth have to openly or privately acquire merchandise by means of public bids. That will depend on whether the value of the merchandise exceeds 100 or 500 million new kwanzas, which at the current foreign exchange rates corresponds to $1,000 and 5,000, respectively.
