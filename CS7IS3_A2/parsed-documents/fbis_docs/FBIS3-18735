And what about [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi? What was his reply to his ally, from whom he receives nothing but daily derision and attacks? Berlusconi restrained himself, forced himself to stay calm, and granted Bossi the tolerance of someone in a very strong position who looks compassionately on the struggles of the weak. "Our political blueprint is so great as to transcend any selfishness and pettiness," Berlusconi told his 4,000 Florentine fans at the rally in the sports stadium. "I understand the difficulties of the parties whose popularity ratings are falling, but that is natural, because within the two alignments it is the more important parts that are gaining strength. We must not alter our stance one iota: The League made a great contribution to demolishing the old system, and now it can make an equal contribution to building the new one." This, Berlusconi explained, because the League acted as a bulldozer. "But when it comes to building, space must be made for cement mixers, cranes, and computers." So the League "must succeed in flanking whoever is particularly well-suited, those who know how to invent and to organize." That is, himself, Silvio Berlusconi, who, having claimed the leadership of the "pole for freedoms," drowned Bossi -- the Bossi who urged people to boycott Forza Italia -- in a torrent of generosity: "We say that our allies' candidates are the blood of our blood, the flesh of our flesh." Then he issued this warning: "Whoever is elected must examine the votes that he has received; and he will see in the proportional quota that the decisive votes in his election were those of Forza Italia." On this sunny Sunday in Turin, Forza Italia was granted 37.4 percent by the guru of the Diakron opinion polls, Gianni Pilo -- himself a candidate in Treviglio -- against the League's 7.4 percent and the PDS' [Democratic Party of the Left] 16 percent. The Italian Popular Party [PPI] and the Pact for Italy each received under 4 percent. Berlusconi discussed the figures mainly in connection with Bossi. They suggest a lower house composed as follow: 356 seats for the pole, 235 for the left-wing forces, and 21 for the PPI and the Pact. The word "Wow" appeared intermittently on the two screens provided for the pleasure of fans who ecstatically witnessed their leader's performance which lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes. The performance ended with further promises to lower taxes and also to distribute "purchase coupons" for health care, education, and pensions. With these "coupons," families will be able to decide whether to seek treatment in private clinics or public hospitals and whether to send their children to private or state schools. Pensions will be provided by means of adequate insurance policies: Only those unable to contract them will receive state benefits. Berlusconi was particularly tough on the underprivileged, but rejected the label of a Robin Hood in reverse who takes from the poor to give to the rich, which [PDS Secretary] Occhetto stuck on him: "I have changed through listening to people's problems," Berlusconi said, "and especially to those of the lowest and the weakest. I see that within me there is no longer the old Berlusconi." Then he again promised to create "1 million new jobs," and this time specified the time scale too: "within the first two years of our government, if we govern." This, as long as the state grants a "tax truce" to businessmen. Berlusconi spoke again about a maximum tax rate of 30 percent, or rather 33 percent, together with exemptions for the most needy and allowances for families with a large number of children. "This," he said, "because we believe that it is a natural right of the state to take one-third of our income. But we believe that to take 50 percent from us is robbery." A 33 percent rate "provides a disincentive for tax evasion and an incentive for investment." [passage omitted]
