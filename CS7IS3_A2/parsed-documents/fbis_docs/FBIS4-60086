The international edition was launched initially in London two months ago as a weekly to cater for the Iranian community in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. Its 12-page format includes a section in English and was said to have proved very popular. The paper is edited in Tehran and beamed for publication by satellite to London as well as New York, which will assist the speed of publication throughout America. Plans were said by ETTELA'AT to be well advanced for a special daily international edition, which could start as early as next week and like the weekly version, will differ in content to the Persian afternoon edition available in Tehran. The London office spoke favorably about the successful launch of Iran's first newspaper to be printed abroad since the Islamic revolution, which is available from newsagents, Iranian shops or through subscription.
