The report is not only a useful guideline and reference for bilateral trade negotiations between the European Union and the United States but also summarizes the obstacles inhibiting the free flow of transatlantic trade and investment and the main trade barriers European business faces in a significant number of U.S. markets. The bulk of the European Union's trade with the United States is not affected by trade barriers. Furthermore, for the relatively small percentage of the trade that does face barriers there will be fewer in the future due to the wide scope of the Uruguay Round and public procurement agreements that were finally concluded in Marrakesh in April 1994. This year, the report also points out the areas where the United States has to implement the Uruguay Round agreements. The faithful and timely transposition of these agreements into U.S. national legislation is of major importance to ensure that the benefits of the Round are capitalized on as soon as possible. It is important that the United States and the European Union demonstrate leadership in implementing the Uruguay Round results which will boost world trade and economic growth, create jobs as well as lowering transatlantic trade friction. The publication of the tenth report follows the United States' publication of its annual national trade estimate report on foreign trade barriers. The Commission services report, however, is not a direct response to the U.S. report. The two reports differ in one major respect: Under U.S. trade law, the U.S. report could lead the United States to impose unilateral trade sanctions due to President Clinton's executive order on identification of trade expansion priorities of March 1994, which reintroduced a super 301 procedure. The Commission services report, however, does not serve such ends. The European Union is committed to full compliance with the multilateral GATT rules and those of the new World Trade Organization (WTO). It urges the United States to do likewise. [passage omitted] The Key U.S. Impediments to Trade and Investment The European Commission services report identifies major horizontal and sectoral areas where access to U.S. markets is potentially threatened or excluded. These are: - Unilateralism in U.S. trade legislation: The U.S. has recently undertaken to renew the super 301 legislation by way of a presidential executive order. No other major trading partner of the EU has similar trade legislation. Such moves point to a renewed impetus in the U.S. towards increased use of unilateral or bilateral trade measures, and are a cause of great concern to the EU. They are largely inconsistent and incompatible with the multilateral trade system -- the backbone of post-war global economic growth. - The extraterritorial application of national trade provisions: These measures can adversely effect trade and investment by clashing with the sovereignty of America's trading partners and thereby lead to insoluble legal conflicts which create uncertainty and deter investment. Examples include the Cuban Democracy Act, reexport controls and the marine mammal protection act. - The extensive use of national security considerations: The United States continues to put forward national security considerations to justify curbs on trade and investment in pursuit of certain protectionist objectives. Measures range from limits on market share to procurement restrictions, such as those contained in the Berry Amendment Legislation, and from unilateral export controls to the screening and possible prohibition of foreign direct investment, for example through the Exon-Florio amendment. A restrictive 1934 act limits foreign investment in radio communications to 20 percent of the capital stock of any corporation in this area of business. - Public procurement and "buy America" legislation: There has been extensive discrimination, and even total exclusion, of non-U.S. controlled companies for certain public contracts tendered at federal and state level. A recent joint study by the EU and the United States pointed out the extent of these measures covering areas such as ports, airports and mass transit schemes. However, the recent EU-U.S. bilateral government procurement agreement signed in Marrakesh has helped to open up substantial parts of the U.S. procurement market. - High tariffs, fees, and excessive invoicing requirements: The Uruguay Round will greatly improve access to each other's markets. However the United States textiles, clothing, footwear, tableware, and glassware tariffs are still excessive with tariff rates as high as 40 percent for some items, higher than many developing countries apply. Tariffs applied for two-door multipurpose vehicles, presently considered by the U.S. as trucks, are burdened with a 25 percent tariff on imports (instead of the 2.5 percent tariff applied to cars), this despite a May 1993 ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade to the contrary. - Tax legislation such as state unitary taxation, car taxes (luxury tax, gas guzzler tax, cafe) which are the subject of a GATT panel request by the EU. The discriminatory luxury tax for example has meant the European manufacturers have incurred almost 80 percent of the tax revenue, while only having a 3 percent market share. Beer and wine excise taxes are also unsatisfactory. - The multiplicity of standards at federal, state and municipal level, as well as protectionist labelling requirements hinder trading opportunities: Multiple standards and standard-making procedures in the United States, some of which are in breach of international norms, and the resulting fragmentation of the U.S. market add up to indirect barriers to trade. The EU and the United States are engaged in consultations in order to reduce such impediments. - The protection of intellectual property: This has caused conflicts, notably the continuing discrimination against non-U.S. products through section 337 of the tariff act of 1930, despite a GATT ruling to the contrary. The agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property has resolved some of the issues provided it is faithfully transposed into us legislation. - The conditioning of the granting of national treatment to non-U.S. controlled economic operators in the United States: Companies with non-U.S. parents are often treated differently to those with U.S. parents regarding antitrust exposure of production joint ventures, or the participation in federally funded R&D. This discrimination is brought about through reciprocity conditions and economic performance requirements, and could make EU investment notably less attractive in the United States. There are no less than 11 bills pending in the Congress with these conditional national treatment provisions. In the same spirit the EU is concerned about impediments to foreign service providers to obtain effective access to the services markets in the United States as well as pressures to discriminate against foreign banks. - Antidumping and countervailing duties: the EU had to request a GATT panel last year after finding that the United States did not respect reasonable countervailing and antidumping procedures and methodology regarding a major part of the EU's steel exports. In a more recent case, provisional dumping duties of over 300 percent have been levied on a European based subsidiary of a Japanese company. The implementation of the Uruguay Round AD/CVD agreements are being carefully monitored by the European Commission. - Agriculture, fisheries, services, telecommunications and broadcasting: In all these sectors, the EU recognises that the Uruguay Round will bring relief to historical trade tension that has prevailed and affected transatlantic trade relations. Nevertheless considerable obstacles will have to be overcome to provide European industry with meaningful and sustained market access. - The maritime and aviation sectors: The EU remains very concerned at the use of direct and indirect protection provided to the United States shipbuilding industry (via the Jones Act). It is also worth recalling the persistently high level of indirect subsidies funnelled into the United States aircraft industries through various federally funded programmes. Conclusion Domestic concerns about the competitivity of U.S. industry continue to exercise considerable influence on the formulation of U.S. trade policy both within Congress and the U.S. Government. The revitalisation of the "super 301" procedures through presidential executive order, proposals to install "green" and "blue" 301 provisions to cover environmental and social concerns, the unreasonable application of anti-dumping and countervailing duty measures against exports from the EU, and the growing proliferation of conditional national treatment provisions either still pending in Congress or already enacted are indicators of a residual undercurrent of protectionism and unilateralism that still exist in the United States. All these measures are anathema to an open world trading system which should be based on one set of negotiated multilateral rules and procedures fairly applied to all contracting parties in the GATT. The signing of the Uruguay Round has removed a significant number of trade irritants between the European Union and the United States. Given the broad balance in EU/U.S. trade flows, there is now a major opportunity to cooperate and work together on the new trade issues of tomorrow. Furthermore EU and U.S. leadership will be essential to continue to remove global trade barriers thereby opening up new opportunities for all trading nations.
