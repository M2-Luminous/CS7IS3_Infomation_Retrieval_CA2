The white paper says, the Chinese Government holds that the intellectual property protection system plays a significant role in promoting progress in science and technology, enriching culture and developing the economy. It functions both as an important institution ensuring the normal running of the socialist market economy and as one of the basic environments and conditions for conducting international exchange and cooperation in science, technology, economy and culture. China considers the protection of intellectual property an important part of its policy of reform and opening to the outside world and of the building of its socialist legal system. Beginning in the late 1970s, China has been formulating laws and regulations for intellectual property rights [IPR] protection, and has been participating in activities organized by the relevant international organizations aimed at strengthening international exchange and cooperation in the field of intellectual property rights. From its inception, China's intellectual property rights protection system was directed towards the world and geared to high international standards. Spurred on by its reform and opening up, China has carried on its intellectual property protection legislation at a speed never before known. The white paper points out that since China joined the world intellectual property organization in June, 1980, it has gained accession to a number of international intellectual property right protection pacts, including the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, the Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits, the Madrid Agreement for the International Registration of Trademarks, the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the Universal Copyright Convention, the Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of Their Phonograms and the Patent Cooperation Treaty. Meanwhile, China has adopted a series of laws and regulations in this regard which include the Trademark Law, the Patent Law, the Copyright Law and the Law on Combating Unfair Competition. The basic framework for China's intellectual property rights protection legal system was completed for the most part in the 1980s, says the white paper. In the 1990s, international economic relations and the international economic environment have already undergone great changes. In November, 1990, multilateral trade negotiation in GATT's Uruguay Round produced a draft agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights. This signaled that a new international standard of intellectual property rights protection was taking form. The Chinese Government actively participated in the negotiations and made unremitting efforts towards their final success. In order to meet the needs of the ever-wider opening up, China has consciously sought to fulfill its international obligation in intellectual property rights protection, endeavouring to bring its intellectual property protection level near the new international standards, and has taken many major measures to further raise its current level of intellectual property rights protection. The Chinese Government's sincerity in its efforts to scrupulously abide by international conventions and bilateral agreements regarding the protection of intellectual property rights, its capacity to fully implement its international obligations have been appreciated and supported by world opinion. The white paper notes that when reviewing the World Intellectual Property Organization's past 20 years of cooperation with China, Dr. Arpad Bogsch, director-general of the organization, pointed out that "China had accomplished all this at a speed unmatched in the history of intellectual property rights protection." The white paper says that as the intellectual property rights protection system has only comparatively recently been introduced in China, and some portion of the population has a rather incomplete understanding of intellectual property rights, China has spared no efforts in publicizing and providing education about the intellectual property protection legal system and in accelerating the training of professional personnel in this field. In China the promulgation of every intellectual property law was followed by widespread publicity through the media and distribution of large quantities of educational video-tapes and separate editions of the law. In order to speed up the training of personnel in this field, the Chinese Government has, in close cooperation with related international organizations, sent people abroad to study or to attend training classes and seminars. Together with the world intellectual property organization, China has held more than 30 training classes and seminars, with the attendance of over 3,000 people. Programs in intellectual property rights education and research have also been initiated at over 70 institutions of higher learning throughout the country, the white paper says.
