Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan has made similar comments in recent days. Gen Chavalit said the bombing of the Karon Royal Wing Hotel in Phuket late Friday night was not politically motivated. It was the result of a business conflict, while the blast at Nakhon Si Thammarat railway station a week earlier was the work of a jealous woman. He said the authorities had to be careful because there would be attempts to mislead them. The minister said opinions were divided over the crackdown on war weapons. Some thought this could be done with even tougher penalties while others believe the crackdown would be unjust if it is not enforced equally in all cases. "Some people don't want to see the death penalty for this crime. We still can't move to amend the law " he said. Chart Thai Party leader Pol Gen Praman Adireksan said it was the Government's duty to apprehend those behind the bombings. "I was a victim of a bomb attack at my house several years ago and to this day no one has been arrested," he said. Pol Gen Praman rejected the claims by Mr Banyat and Deputy Commerce Minister Churin Laksanavisit that the bomb attacks were an attempt to bring down the Government, and most people would interpret this to mean the Opposition was responsible. He asked how the Opposition could stage the attacks since it had no MPs in the South. "Those in Government always think there are people out to get them. "Ousting the Government through illegal means it is an act of rebellion. Even if you only think it, it's rebellion," he said. Some government MPs claim an opposition party is financing sabotage in the South with the cooperation of those loyal to the now defunct National Peace-keeping Council. Pol Gen Praman said the Opposition could only file interpellations or open a debate on the issue. He made three observations: That the South is rich in natural resources, both on land and at sea, that the bombings occur only in that region, and why are government MPs in the South not making more noise about the problem as it is harming their constituencies. He also said it depended on each person's view if calls to replace Gen Chavalit as Interior Minister would solve the problem. As a former interior minister, he said, he did not know what to say about why the Government was unable to apprehend anyone in connection with the burning of 33 schools in the South last year. There has also been about 13 bombings with only one person arrested in connection with the Nakhon Si Thammarat railway station incident. "Why is that so?" asked the Opposition leader. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said all government MPs in the South were very concerned about what has been happening but they had not been "raising hell" because there was no clear information. He said he did not have details to be able to say the bombings were aimed at bringing down his Government. "There is not enough evidence to arrest anyone. It's difficult," he said.
