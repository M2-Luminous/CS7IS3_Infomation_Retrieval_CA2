Katyal: "Yeltsin Renews Invitation to Rao"] [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 29. The Russian President, Mr. Boris Yeltsin, has repeated his invitation to the Prime Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, to visit Moscow -- and proceeding from that, officials of the two Governments are working on plans for a trip in May. This will be the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Moscow, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The last trip at that level was by Mr. V.P. Singh in 1990 when Russia was not a separate republic. Another symbolic gesture, contemplated now, envisages telephonic talk between the two leaders on the newly-established direct line between Delhi and Moscow. A spokesman of the Russian Embassy confirmed that Mr. Yeltsin had written recently to Mr. Rao, but said he would not be able to give the contents or the gist of this confidential communication. Russia, he however, stressed, regarded Kashmir an internal problem of India and supported its territorial integrity. In this context, he said there was no change in the Russian Government's stand. According to details of Mr. Yeltsin's letter available from diplomatic sources, Kashmir and Indo-Pakistan relations figured in it along with several other issues of bilateral interest. In Mr. Yeltsin's opinion, it was impossible to achieve true security in South Asia, without normalising relations between India and Pakistan. Russia, he said, welcomed the resumption of dialogue between these two countries and considered it of utmost importance. It was his hope, Mr. Yeltsin said, that the two countries would demonstrate goodwill and constructive and well-considered approach in regard to their current problems, including Kashmir. Stressing the importance Russia attached to India's territorial integrity, Mr. Yeltsin said that it was a "must" not only for the region, but for the world as a whole. That was Russia's principled position and it, according to Mr. Yeltsin, had been conveyed to Pakistan. The letter, it appears, noted with satisfaction Pakistan's decision to give up its plan for moving a resolution in the U.N. on human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir. Russia, he said, regarded it a step in the right direction. Mr. Yeltsin approvingly noted the additional steps taken by the Government of India to ensure prevention of such violations. This, perhaps, was a reference to the establishment of the Human Rights Commission, intended to probe allegations of excesses by the security forces and other law enforcement agencies, and the decision to allow international human rights organisations to visit Kashmir. Mr. Yeltsin also expressed satisfaction over the handling of the Hazratbal crisis. The letter referred to the problem of trans-border terrorism -- in the context of the activities involving Afghanistan and Tajikstan. India which is a victim of this phenomenon and has been drawing attention of the international community to Pakistan's role in instigating terrorist violence in the Kashmir Valley, would certainly have derived comfort from Russia's views, though expressed in a different context.
