'Arafat will visit the newly-autonomous areas for three days but will spend every night in Amman according to the plans being laid, the sources said. No precise date is yet known. Contradictory rumours have been circulating for weeks about when the PLO chief intends to make his triumphant entry into Jericho. But preparations have been going on nonetheless to hand over control of the Gaza Strip and Jericho to the new Palestinian Authority. 'Arafat is due to return for good to Jericho, but has said he did not want to make the trip until donor countries had fulfilled pledges to help fund Palestinian self-rule. Israeli and Palestinian leaders have been issuing various dates for his return for months. On Sunday the PLO's former negotiator Nabil Sha'th said 'Arafat would arrive within two weeks. Sha'th himself entered the Gaza Strip on Tuesday after spending most of his life in exile. PLO officials said Sha'th would prepare for 'Arafat's arrival either later this month or in early July.
