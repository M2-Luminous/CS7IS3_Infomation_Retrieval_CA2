The DPRK strongly accused the IAEA of committing an act of grave encroachment on the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK, saying that it is a prelude to U.N. "sanctions". On June 10, the IAEA adopted a resolution urging the DPRK to open its "military facilities" and suspend the agency's assistance to the DPRK. In response to the IAEA's resolution, the DPRK Foreign Ministry was authorized to declare as follows: Firstly, we will immediately withdraw from the IAEA. We will consider invalid all the unreasonable "resolutions" adopted by the agency with regard to our issue and will not be bound to any rules or resolutions of the agency hereafter. Without the agency we can develop our independent nuclear power industry and expand international cooperation in the realm of nuclear activities. Secondly, we declare that inspections for the continuity of safeguards which we have accepted in our unique status will no longer be allowed. No unreasonable inspection can be allowed until a decision has been made for us to return to the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty or to completely withdraw from it. Hence, the agency's inspectors will have nothing to do any more in our country. Thirdly, we strongly reaffirm our position that U.N. "sanctions" will be regarded immediately as a declaration of war. The statement said that the DPRK's position will never change until the nuclear issue has been solved fairly through dialogue and negotiation.
