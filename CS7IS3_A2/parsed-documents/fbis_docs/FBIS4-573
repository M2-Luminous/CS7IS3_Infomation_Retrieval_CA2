In a statement published Sunday by his newspaper Concord, Abiola said that the return should begin with the reinstatement of all elected officials of all democratic structures disbanded last November in the aftermath of General Sani Abacha's take-over of government. The remaining results of the presidential election held June 12 last year should also be declared, he said in the statement. The National Electoral Commission (NEC) had published only results from 14 of the 30 states of the federation when the exercise was stopped in compliance with a court order. Later, on June 23, the regime of General Ibrahim Babangida annuled the entire result for alleged irregularities. "With democracy will come openness and transparency. All our national problems can then be brought into the open and solutions found with all participating", Abiola said in the text. Since that election was cancelled, Abiola has campaigned for upholding of the "sacred mandate" that he claimed was given to him by the people in the election. He said that the military, which has ruled for 34 years since the nation became independent from Britain in 1960, has been unable to find solutions to the nation's problems.
