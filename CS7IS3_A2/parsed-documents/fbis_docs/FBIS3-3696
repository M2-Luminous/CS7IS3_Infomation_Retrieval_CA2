Comrade Guo Jinlong said: In recent years, guided by the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the vast number of cadres in Tibet have further emancipated their minds and renewed their mindsets. However, timeworn concepts and outmoded ideas have not yet been uprooted. Under the new situation today, arming the minds of party member-cadres with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and continuing to emancipate our minds and renew our mindsets are important and urgent tasks as well as the basic aspects of the party's ideological construction. He stressed: Party member-cadres must set examples of study. They must be more conscientious about the study and be more assiduous in doing research. Leading cadres must use their own examples to guide the study of party member-cadres at all levels. Comrade Guo Jinlong pointed out: To build stronger grass-roots party organizations in Tibet, we must start with building up the grass-roots party organizations in the sprawling agricultural and pastoral areas. We must firmly strengthen our leadership, throw in more manpower, and spend more time in improving various party branches and their supporting party organs in rural areas. Meanwhile, we must make great efforts to revitalize the weak and listless [ruan ruo huan san] leading bodies as quickly as possible so that grass-roots party organizations in agricultural and pastoral areas can be built into fighting fortresses for launching antiseparatist struggles and leading the masses to wipe out poverty and become affluent. Speaking on the need for organizational and personnel departments to build up themselves, Guo Jinlong forwarded these three requirements: First, they must thoroughly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics so as to thoroughly emancipate their minds and renew their mindsets. Second they must carry forward the fine traditions and change their work style. Third, they must firmly carry out set policies. Lu Huimin, member of the regional party committee standing committee and head of the regional party committee organization department, examined last year's work and elaborated on this year's projects.
