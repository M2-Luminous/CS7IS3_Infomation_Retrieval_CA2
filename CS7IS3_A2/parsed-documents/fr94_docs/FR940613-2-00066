The reorganization consists of (1) transferring the functions of the Division of Nutrition Research Coordination (DNRC) from the Office of Disease Prevention (ODP), Office of the Director, NIH (OD/NIH), to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK); (2) abolishing the DNRC within the ODP, OD/NIH; and (3) establishing the Division of Nutrition Research within the NIDDK. The transfer of the nutrition coordination function is consistent with Title VI of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Pub.L. 103&hyph;43) which reiterates the lead role of the NIDDK in nutrition and obesity research and mandates an expanded NIDDK role in the coordination of trans-NIH nutrition research and translation efforts. Section HN&hyph;B, Organization and Functions, is amended as follows: (1) Under the heading Office of the Director (HNA), Office of Disease Prevention (HNA2), delete the title and functional statement of the Division of Nutrition Research Coordination (HNA24) in their entirety.
