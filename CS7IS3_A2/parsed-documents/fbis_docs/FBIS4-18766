This can be concluded from the draft 1993 constitutional protection report, which the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV] presented to the laender. Under a separate section, the draft concedes special status to the Republikaner. North Rhine-Westphalian Interior Minister Herbert Schnoor, of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, rejected such an -- as he called it -- "exonerating document" for the Republikaner in a letter to Kanther, the interior ministers, and interior senators of the laender. According to information received by Schnoor, "individual Republikaner officials" received letters from the interior minister on their request, stating that the Republikaner were under BfV observation but that there was no decision yet. Schnoor, however, pointed to findings by the North Rhine-Westphalian Office for the Protection of the Constitution, rulings of the Administrative Court of Baden-Wuerttemberg, and the High Administrative Court of Muenster, which offered "sufficient evidence" for regarding the Republikaner as right-wing extremist. If, in his report, Kanther indeed was no longer able to classify the Republikaner as right-wing extremist, he would make it possible for the Republikaner in upcoming court proceedings "to cite the Federal Government as a witness against those laender that are observing them," complains Schnoor to his colleagues. Last month, the Duesseldorf interior minister, in his legal dispute with the Republikaner -- which ended in his favor -- on the lawfulness of their persecution by the North Rhine-Westphalian Office for the Protection of the Constitution, presented to the Duesseldorf Administrative Court eight procedures initiated against members of the Republikaner in 1993 for politically motivated crimes. These included, among other things, the "simulated execution" of a Turk in Muelheim -- which the cardiac victim did not survive, unauthorized possession of firearms, dangerous injury, and aiding and abetting an attack against a home for asylum-seekers in the Bergheim district. There was an attempt to hush up this case with the help of the Republikaner district and land executive committees to "prevent the most grave damage to the future of the party."
