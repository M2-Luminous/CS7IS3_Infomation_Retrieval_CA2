Russian Federation Former General Prosecutor A. Kazannik Warns That Russia Is Threatened by a Regime of Personal Power"] [Text] Sergey Filatov has played a deadly trump card against any ill-wishers. The head of the presidential administration bombastically pronounced: "No power which seeks dictatorship will bother about accord in society." It turned out a ringing phrase, but.... The ideal option for a dictator is one whereby he secures assent to dictatorship. But why did the president's trusty henchman suddenly start speaking about dictatorship just before the signing of the "Social Accord Contract"? Because the closer the "fateful" date comes, the more acutely the question arises: Who is to agree with whom? PRAVDA has already advanced the assumption that it is a pact between mice and the cat which is chasing them. But Aleksey Kazannik, Russian Federation former general prosecutor, has made a still more definite assessment of the situation: Overt dictatorship is approaching in Russia. He declared this at the height of the talk of civil peace and social accord. Here is a dictaphone recording of his reply to the "Novosti-plyus" television program: "I believe that you do not have to have the wisdom of Solomon but simply analyze the state of the president's team and the dynamics of its development in order to arrive at definite conclusions. The first such reason is that the president's whole team, so I have become convinced, has been formed not according to professional and personal qualities but only on principles of personal devotion. Therefore these people are essentially privy to a compact or, if you like, even a conspiracy. "Second reason: Since these people have been selected on such principles, it goes without saying that a certain stable grouping has taken shape. They were closely welded together -- I would even say fused together -- by the blood of the events of October 1993. These people really are as thick as thieves. "Third: I have become convinced that the bulk of these people are professionally incompetent. They cannot work with their head and evidently consider it shameful to work with their hands. Therefore they hold on to the president, as bus passengers hold on to the handrails to stop themselves falling. "Fourth, the president has already subordinated to himself all the power structures -- the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Federal Counterintelligence Service, the Security Administration, the Ministry of Defense, a number of other services.... "The president and his entourage frequently violate the Constitution, laws, and State Duma and Federation Council decrees. All these factors taken together have enabled me to conclude that overt dictatorship is approaching." The warning is so serious that it must make any politician think before he ventures to sign a document which openly curtails citizens' democratic rights and restricts the operation of the Constitution. But Russians had already guessed that which Professor A. Kazannik has proved in a logical and well reasoned manner. As public opinion poll data attest, only one-fifth of our fellow citizens believe that Russia is governed by democrats, while more than half of those polled are sure that there is now undemocratic administration of the country. Incidentally, in an attempt to refute the ex-prosecutor's statement the head of the Russian Federation president's administration has virtually...confirmed it. First, S. Filatov admitted that "the presidential team is selected by the president, who proceeds, inter alia, from personal likes." Second, he confirmed that "the power structures were under the president before the events, and they are under the president now." So what is the presidential team imposing on the country -- social accord or assent to...dictatorship?
