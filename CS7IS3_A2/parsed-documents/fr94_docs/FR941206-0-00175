FR941206-0-00175 FR941206-0-00019 3.1.4.3␣Cooling Coil. Stainless steel (304), 0.25 in.&hyph;ID, equipped with a thermocouple at the coil outlet. 3.2␣Analysis. The following equipment is required: 3.2.1␣Balanced Pressure Headspace Sampler. Perkin-Elmer HS&hyph;6, HS&hyph;100, or equivalent, equipped with a glass bead column instead of a chromatographic column. 3.2.2␣FID. An FID meeting the following specifications is required: 3.2.2.1␣Linearity. A linear response ( # 5 percent) over the operating range as demonstrated by the procedures established in Section 6.1.2. 3.2.2.2␣Range. A full scale range of 1 to 10,000 ppm CH 4 . Signal attenuators shall be available to produce a minimum signal response of 10 percent of full scale. 3.2.3␣Data Recording System. Analog strip chart recorder or digital integration system compatible with the FID for permanently recording the output of the detector. 3.2.4␣Thermometer. Capable of reading temperatures in the range of 30 ○ to 60 ○C with an accuracy of # 0.1 ○C. 4. Reagents 4.1␣Analysis. The following items are required for analysis: 4.1.1␣Hydrogen (H 2 ). Zero grade. 4.1.2␣Carrier Gas. Zero grade nitrogen, containing less than 1 ppm carbon (C) and less than 1 ppm carbon dioxide. 4.1.3␣Combustion Gas. Zero grade air or oxygen as required by the FID. 4.2␣Calibration and Linearity Check. 4.2.1␣Stock Cylinder Gas Standard. 100 percent propane. The manufacturer shall: (a) Certify the gas composition to be accurate to # 3 percent or better (see Section 4.2.1.1); (b) Recommend a maximum shelf life over which the gas concentration does not change by greater than # 5 percent from the certified value; and (c) Affix the date of gas cylinder preparation, certified propane concentration, and recommended maximum shelf life to the cylinder before shipment to the buyer. 4.2.1.1 Cylinder Standards Certification. The manufacturer shall certify the concentration of the calibration gas in the cylinder by (a) directly analyzing the cylinder and (b) calibrating his analytical procedure on the day of cylinder analysis. To calibrate his analytical procedure, the manufacturer shall use, as a minimum, a three-point calibration curve. 4.2.1.2␣Verification of Manufacturer's Calibration Standards. Before using, the manufacturer shall verify each calibration standard by (a) comparing it to gas mixtures prepared in accordance with the procedure described in Section 7.1 of Method 106 of part 61, appendix B, or by (b) calibrating it against Standard Reference Materials (SRM's) prepared by the National Bureau of Standards, if such SRM's are available. The agreement between the initially determined concentration value and the verification concentration value shall be within # 5 percent. The manufacturer must reverify all calibration standards on a time interval consistent with the shelf life of the cylinder standards sold. 5. Procedure 5.1␣Sampling. 5.1.1␣Install a sampling tap to obtain the sample at a point which is most representative of the unexposed waste (where the waste has had minimum opportunity to volatilize to the atmosphere). Assemble the sampling apparatus as shown in Figure 25E&hyph;1. BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P E:GRAPHICSER06DE94.000 BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;C 5.1.2␣Begin sampling by purging the sample lines and cooling coil with at least four volumes of waste. Collect the purged material in a separate container and dispose of it properly. 5.1.3␣After purging, stop the sample flow and transfer the Teflon sampling tube to a sample container. Sample at a flow rate such that the temperature of the waste is <10 ○C (<50 ○F). Fill the sample container halfway ( # 5 percent) and cap it within 5 seconds. Store immediately in a cooler and cover with ice. 5.1.4␣Alternative sampling techniques may be used upon the approval of the Administrator. 5.2␣Analysis. 5.2.1␣Allow one hour for the headspace vials to equilibrate at the temperature specified in the regulation. Allow the FID to warm up until a stable baseline is achieved on the detector. 5.2.2␣Check the calibration of the FID daily using the procedures in Section 6.1.2. 5.2.3␣Follow the manufacturer's recommended procedures for the normal operation of the headspace sampler and FID. 5.2.4␣Use the procedures in Sections 7.4 and 7.5 to calculate the vapor phase organic vapor pressure in the samples. 5.2.5␣Monitor the output of the detector to make certain that the results are being properly recorded.
