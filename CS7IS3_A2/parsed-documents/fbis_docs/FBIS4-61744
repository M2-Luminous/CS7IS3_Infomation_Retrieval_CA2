That is what many of the mass media have been claiming since Ayzderdzis' tragic murder 26 April. Among other things, Ayzderdzis was Korablin's rival in the State Duma elections, and the administration head could not forgive the defeat inflicted on him by his opponent: He did not allocate him official premises for receiving voters and tried to install his own people at the MDK-Bank, which A. Ayzderdzis directed prior to his election to parliament. It has been alleged, either implicity or openly, that Korablin had an interest in the death of the people's deputy. Yesterday the head of the Khimki administration broke the "vow of silence which he had given until the body of the deceased is committed to the earth." He held a press conference. He announced that "someone stands to gain from fueling political passions in the region and from making unfounded criminal accusations against totally innocent people." He claimed that the uproar against him in the newspapers was started six months ago -- while Andrey Ayzderdzis was still alive. "It is being claimed in the press that the MDK-Bank is a financially impeccable firm and that I set up my own bank in the city and did not want any rivals. However, I have not set up any commercial structures, just as I did not run for the Federal Assembly. In Moscow Oblast there are forces which want to destabilize the situation in the region." Yu. Korablin believes that the oblast regional administration to combat organized crime and its Chief Major General A. Kartashev personally are forces of that kind. "Everything that is being written about me in the newspapers today coincides word for word with the content of a report compiled by that department 24 January this year," he said. "Since that time I and my deputies have been tailed and had our telephones bugged. At that time three staffers of the directorate had close contacts with Ayzderdzis and visited the MDK-Bank almost all the time. Kartashev is deliberately misleading the investigation." Yu. Korablin calls this the 10th plausible version of the killing -- the first nine, the head of the administration said, were described in DAILY-KOMMERSANT [as published]. Nor does he discount the possibility that the tragedy might have been the result of personal "feuds" among people involved in commerce. He stated that the MDK-Bank concealed 1.160 billion rubles from taxation last year -- there is a report from the tax inspectorate to that effect. In addition, Yu. Korablin said, summing up, "a criminal group whose head was recently murdered while in prison had become involved in the bank's affairs." The mayor of Khimki stated that the city authorities are organizing an independent investigation into the deputy's murder and have already offered 15 million rubles as reward for information of help to the investigation.
