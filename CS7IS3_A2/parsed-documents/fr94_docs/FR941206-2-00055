FR941206-2-00055 FR941206-2-00041 Smoke-Free Workplace The PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people. Eligible Applicant Assistance will be provided only to the March of Dimes Birth Defect Foundation, White Plains, New York for this project. No other applications are solicited. The program announcement and application kit have been sent to the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation. The March of Dimes Birth Defect Foundation is the most appropriate and qualified institution to conduct the work under this grant for the following reasons: 1. The Genetic Testing and Gene Therapy Survey, completed in 1992, was commissioned, managed, and disseminated by the March of Dimes. Based on 1,000 telephone interviews with a cross section of adults, the survey has been instrumental in the development of public policy and educational interventions since its release. The experience gained by the March of Dimes during the conduct of this national survey makes it the only national volunteer organization with the level of expertise required to undertake and disseminate an analogous survey of reproductive-age women's awareness of folic acid and other pregnancy-related issues. 2. The history of success of the research efforts supported by the March of Dimes is incomparable. The March of Dimes has played a key role in significant advances in the understanding and prevention of birth defects since Dr. Jonas Salk, with funding from the March of Dimes, developed the vaccine that led to the conquest of polio in the 1950's. 3. The March of Dimes is the only volunteer organization which has as its primary goal the improvement of the health of babies by preventing birth defects and infant mortality. This organizational goal parallels the CDC's health promotion and prevention goals outlined in ``Healthy People 2000.'' 4. During the promotion of preventions such as Polio, Rubella and Rh vaccines, a remarkable climate of trust was established between the March of Dimes and women of childbearing age. The credibility and name recognition earned by the March of Dimes through these past efforts greatly increases the likelihood that women will participate in an assessment of the level of knowledge and behavior regarding the consumption of folic acid.
