FBIS3-5650 "dreas046__a94005" FBIS-EAS-94-046-A Document Type:Daily Report 9 March 1994 ANNEX Japan DFAA Directer General Sums Up U.S. Visit OW0803114294 Naha OKINAWA TIMES in Japanese 8 Mar 94 Morning Edition p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0803114294 Naha OKINAWA TIMES Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo -- Ichiro Yoneyama, Defense Facilities Administration Agency [DFAA] director general, held a news conference on 7 March after returning to Japan from his trip to the United States. Referring to the issue of returning Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, he said: "When I proposed to the U.S. side that both Japan and the United States study ways to have the auxiliary airfield returned, the U.S. side said if the jamming problem at Sobe Communications Center is cleared, the United States would consider returning the auxiliary airfield." The U.S. side's response indicated a change in the U.S. position that "until the auxiliary airfield's function of parachute drop training is transferred to another place, it is impossible to return it." The relocation of the auxiliary airfield and measures to clear up the jamming problem are a condition for the return of the airfield. At the news conference, Mr. Yoneyama said: "Both Japan and the United States are studying where to relocate the auxiliary airfield. We intend to discuss this with U.S. Forces in Japan at the earliest date." On the issue of returning Naha Military Port, the U.S. side said, "It is not easy to return the military port, but we intend to tenaciously work for its return." Regarding the issue of abolishing live-firing exercise across Prefectural Highway No. 104, the U.S. side said, "The United States is now studying the possibility of ending the live-firing exercises and will make as many efforts as possible to end them." In this way, the U.S. side repeated its past view. During his stay in the United States, Director General Yoneyama met with Ross [name as published], deputy assistance defense secretary, Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state, and Stockpole, commander of the Pacific Marine Corps, for an exchange of views. During a series of meetings with them, Director General Yoneyama proposed that both Japan and the United States study ways not only to relocate Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, but to return it. In response, the U.S. side said, "If the jamming problem at Sobe Communications Center is cleared, the United States will study the possibility of returning the airfield." Explaining the results of his visit to the United States, Director General Yoneyama said: "The U.S. side was far more interested in resolving those issues than we have thought. The impression I got is that the United States wants to avoid new tensions because of difficult economic issues between Japan and the United States. American officials whom I met had a common perception of the issues. It was significant for me to convey the views of local residents directly to concerned American officials."
