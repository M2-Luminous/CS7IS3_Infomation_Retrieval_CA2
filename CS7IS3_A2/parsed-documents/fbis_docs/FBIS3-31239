Vitaly Churkin said it was "absolutely unthinkable" that Russian forces should be "somewhere on the ground where their lives and safety can be endangered" as a result of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation decision. He recalled that the NATO ultimatum giving Bosnian Serbs until midnight Sunday to withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo or face air strikes had been taken without consulting Moscow. President Boris Yeltsin's envoy travelled to Zagreb from the Bosnian capital, where he met Bosnian government leaders, and Bosnian Serb and United Nations Protection Force commanders.
