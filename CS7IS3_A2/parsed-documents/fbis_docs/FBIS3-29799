Opposition Vanuaaku Pati (VP) coordinator Peter Taurakoto announced the group was considering forming a new political coalition with the Union of Moderate Parties (UMP), which heads the coalition government. The new coalition would help elect a new president of the republic next March 2, when the electoral college meets for the third time, he said. Last week, the island state's electoral college, which consists of 46 MPs and 10 local government council presidents failed twice to elect the country's third head of state. No one party had a sufficient majority to meet the college's two-thirds -- 38-vote -- requirement. Taurakoto explained the opposition's decision followed failure to reach an agreement with former prime minister Walter Lini's National United Party (NUP), which considers itself an "independent opposition" group. Vanuatu Prime Minister Maxime Carlot said last Thursday it was "time to talk" for his government majority and the opposition in order to fill the presidential post. The opposition parties formed an alliance in 1992 that includes the four parties, the VP, led by Kalpokas, Barak Sope's Melanesian Progressive Party, the Tan Union, headed by Vincent Boulekone and Nagriamel, led by Franky Steven. The alliance had planned to vote for a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Maxime Carlot's coalition government. Taurakoto said earlier that if the coalition agreement was reached with the UMP, the new coalition would leave out the two NUP factions -- Lini's "opposition" and minister Sethy Regenvanu's pro- government group. Carlot's government consists of a majority of eight ministers from the ruling UMP and three NUP ministers, who decided not to follow Lini when he withdrew last August from the UMP-NUP coalition government. Regenvanu, the deputy prime minister and NUP minister for justice, culture and women's affairs issued a statement Monday saying that the opposition's decision to join the government was an "indication of desperation." It is an "180-degree turnaround" from an opposition group which, he said, wanted to bring down the government. Regenvanu, who now heads a group of three dissident NUP members of parliament who hold ministers' portfolios, called for the opposition to end its "futile struggle".
