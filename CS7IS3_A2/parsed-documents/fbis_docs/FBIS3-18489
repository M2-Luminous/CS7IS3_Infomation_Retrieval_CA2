By its dedicated participation, the U.S. Administration has made an essential contribution to it, Kinkel said in Bonn. Right down to the final stage of the negotiations, there was close coordination between Germany and its partners, in particular the United States. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher expressly thanked the Federal Government on the telephone. Kinkel stated: "The momentum for a political and peaceful solution to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina must now be used with all one's strength. It cannot and must not be permitted that barbarism returns to Europe." Bonn expects the parties to the negotiations to settle the remaining open questions with good will and with the goal of coming to a lasting agreement.
