However, before that, the 7.5-percent solidarity surcharge that is to be reintroduced in 1995 "must be abolished at the earliest possible date," Rexrodt announced at the meeting of medium-seized enterprises in Bonn today. In fact, the location safeguarding law has reduced the tax rates to the lowest point since the war, "but we must proceed on this path because the taxation of our enterprises is still unfavorable." In front of representatives of 22 associations of medium-sized enterprises, the economics minister confirmed his intention to abolish the property tax on enterprises and the trade capital tax by 1 Janaury 1966. Rexrodt stressed: "Lowering the corporate tax is the best program for the medium-sized enterprises." Tax privileges for risk capital for innovative small and medium-sized enterprises in the new laender might also be useful. As far as the implementation of the 1-billion-mark scheme, promised by the banks for the eastern German economy, is concerned, the majority of the sum should be granted to medium-sized industrial enterprises. Rexrodt stressed: "However, we should jointly think about how more private foreign equity capital can generally be attracted -- preferably in the form of active shares to combine the transfer of capital and know-how." To improve vocational training, he wants to "ensure that the promotion of trade will be maintained at the current level, and that sufficient apprenticeships are available in the new laender." Referring to a reduction of the corporate tax, the minister pointed out that the tax quota in Germany is among the highest in industrialized nations, Rexrodt emphasized. Particularly the taxes that do not depend on the profit represent a clear disadvantage in international competition. Moreover, the trade income tax should be reduced. In return, the communes should participate in the turnover tax. As a result of the reduction of the trade income tax, "the cause for the split top rate of the income tax would also disappear," Rexrodt explained. Since the beginning of the year, it has been 53 percent for private income and 47 percent for business income. The corporate tax is currently 45 percent. According to Rexrodt, this split should temporarily compensate for the special burden on the trade tax until its reform.
