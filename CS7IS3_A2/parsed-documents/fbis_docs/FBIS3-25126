The parties, which have until Saturday to register for the April elections, emerged after four hours of talks to say that while some progress had been achieved, a settlement had once again eluded them. ANC negotiator Joe Slovo said bluntly that the talks had reached deadlock. "Unless serious movement on the side on the Freedom Alliance is forthcoming, I would say there is no hope," Mr Slovo said. Even the implementation of a double ballot would become logistically difficult if the parties stalled for much longer. His colleague, Mr Mohammed Valli Moosa, accused the alliance of shifting the goalposts. He said that while the alliance had earlier insisted on a double ballot as a precondition for a breakthrough, it was now principally concerned that regional constitutions should not be altered by the constitution-making body that will be elected in April. Mr Valli Moosa said that the ANC had asked the alliance for a commitment to flexibility when the parties last met on Thursday last week. "Rather than exhibiting flexibility, the alliance has once again moved the goalposts," he said. Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer struck an optimistic note when he addressed reporters after the talks. He produced a "balance sheet" of negotiations. He said there had been agreement on constitutional amendments involving the fiscal competence of regions, the inclusion of the name kwaZulu alongside that of Natal for the region, a constitutional principle on self-determination and agreement on two ballots if the package as a whole was accepted. He said the alliance had agreed to take part in elections and to renounce violence but not to take part in transitional structures. There was uncertainty on the reincorporation of Bophuthatswana. "I believe that what we have is a situation that provides for acceptable solutions. I make a call on the relevant parties to give final consideration to the proposals," he said. However, alliance spokesmen Rowan Cronje of Bophuthatswana and Mr Walter Felgate of the Inkatha Freedom Party in particular quickly dashed any hopes of a breakthrough. Acknowledging limited progress, Mr Cronje then went on to say the integrity of regional constitutions was a major issue. He said the ANC would not give way on the right of a constituent assembly to rewrite regional constitutions. And Mr Felgate called Mr Meyer's balance sheet a "gross misrepresentation of the real issue". He said the ANC was "totally immovable" on the issue and was asking for a "blank cheque". Mr Valli Moosa said the ANC was committed to the constitutional principles entrenched in the constitution and that any constitution it devised would be within the limits prescribed by the principles. He said that not only were the Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] demanding a mechanism that culminated in a volkstaat, but that both Bophuthatswana and kwaZulu were insisting on self-determination. The negotiators are due to report back to their principals with a view to meeting again before the Saturday deadline.
