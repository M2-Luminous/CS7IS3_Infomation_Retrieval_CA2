The coordination committee of the parties hostile to President Aristide has decided to go on the offensive to try to fill the institutional vacuum. Mobilization is the political fuel the committee intends to use to achieve this goal. During its first contact with the press on 16 March, this assembly of parties, including MDN [Mobilization for National Development] and FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for Haitain Advancement and Progress], terms the absence of a leader in the executive anarchy. The committee's president says this political vacuum can provoke the explosion of a social bomb in the country. Attorney Gregoire Eugene states that the problem of institutional vacuum must be solved in any case: [Begin Eugene recording] We are going to get involved immediately because there is danger in the house. It is urgent. The situation can no longer hold. We are going to launch the great offensive and impose on whomever it may concern the obligation of filling Haiti's institutional vacuum, allowing the country to emerge from its crisis. I am not saying that in filling this vacuum, we are going to solve all the problems, but at least something will be done; there will at least be an organization to help the country emerge from its deadlock. [end recording] The coordination committee intends to interact with other political forces in an effort to devise a unified strategy for facing the power vacuum that has existed since Malval's resignation. Questioned on the attitude of the international community toward such an initiative, Eugene asserts that in case of rejection of their solution by the foreigners, Haitians will have to learn to manage the embargo: [Begin Eugene recording] If the international community agrees with our decision not to remain in this state of anarchy and decides to consider the ambient misery, that is fine. If it is deaf and uneasy, then the only answer is for us to find ways to manage the embargo. That is, unfortunately, what we have not learned to do. It would be necessary that after this embargo, after the experience that we will have faced, we could say blessed be my accounts. [as heard] [end recording] It should be noted that during this news conference, the coordination committee, following the forum at the Visa Lodge, considered the legislators' plan doomed to failure.
