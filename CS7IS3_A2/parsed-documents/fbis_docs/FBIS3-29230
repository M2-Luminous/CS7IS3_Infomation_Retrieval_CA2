Hosokawa, reporting on the negotiations at a session of the House of Representatives, said he and Clinton held "good" talks in Washington on February 11 as they exchanged opinions on various issues, including the international situation. Hosokawa and Clinton agreed not to damage bilateral relations though they failed to strike a deal on a new "framework" to slash Japan's trade surplus and increase the share of imports in its markets, the premier said. He called the talks the beginning of new bilateral relations with greater mutual confidence, in which both countries will make clear what they cannot do. Hosokawa's remarks came after the United States on Tuesday unveiled steps to impose hundreds of million dollars in trade sanctions in a dispute over access to the Japanese cellular phone market. The prime minister pledged further deregulation to make foreign access to Japanese markets easier, in spite of the failed trade talks. He hailed the talks saying that he and Clinton agreed to promote bilateral cooperation on global issues such as the environment, population and AIDS. Hosokawa told Clinton that Japan would do what it could if the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on north korea over its suspected nuclear arms development program, he said. After Hosokawa reported on the trade talks, the lower house session commenced interpellation. In response to a question from Ryutaro Hashimoto of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Hosokawa said he would search for a breakthrough on Japan-U.S. trade issues. He said Japan would improve access to its markets and government procurement procedures. Hosokawa also reiterated his pledge to enact laws by the end of the year for financing a planned tax reduction. The ruling coalition on February 8 agreed to implement from April a one-time 6 trillion yen income tax cut for fiscal 1994 as a means of economic pump-priming. At the same time Hosokawa was forced to abandon his plan to replace the 3 percent consumption tax with a 7 percent "national welfare tax" to offset the loss of revenue from the tax cut.
