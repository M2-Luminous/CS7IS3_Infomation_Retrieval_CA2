This was the 12th successful trial in 13 attempts since the first silver-white 40-250 km range missile was test-fired from Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh in February 1988. The weekend's achievement is a watershed as it was the first user's trial, to be followed by another on Monday and more under battlefield conditions in land firing ranges in other parts of the country soon. While Saturday's glitch-free launch from a movable-launcher established India's credentials as a missile power that can deliver a range of such weapons of tomorrow anytime. The trial should also set the speculation at rest that India was bowing to any pressure to abandon its missile programme under any external pressure. Early this year India had accomplished its "mission" as far as perfecting its capability in the Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) was concerned by successful test-launching of 1,200-2,500 km range Agni. Prithvi's trial came close on the heels of the announcement that low-level quick reaction Trishul and medium-range high-altitude Akash missile are ready for induction in the Army after their user's trials are through. The `fire and forget' anti-tank missile Nag has already made its prowess known to many. If Agni was the first Indian missile in the true ballistic class, Prithvi, one of the most advanced projectiles, is India's own version of Scud. While Scud follows ballistic trajectory, Prithvi's flight throughout is controlled by an on board computer. The last Prithvi trial was conducted on May 30 1993. Prithvi definitely gives India a better option to attack static targets, important defence installations, air defence sites, ordnance factories and large army maintenance areas which should fall in it range. Earlier, in two Indo-Pak wars these installations were attacked by Indian Air Force bombers. In today's advanced world of early airborne warning system (AWACS), and improved radar systems, it is easy to detect an enemy plane and neutralise it. However, in case of theatre ballistic missile, that Prithvi is, it is difficult to detect it on radar and also find out its trajectory and impact point because of its supersonic speed and limited flight time. Covering of 75 kms in four minutes time today was a pointer to the fact that very few weapons could be effectively used against an astra like this. It certainly is an offensive weapon with clinical. [sentence as published] To quote an Indian expert: "Prithvi is extremely accurate (its circular error probability -- CEP -- is lower than most missiles of its class) and four of them can devastate front of an attacking army effectively blunting an enemy attack on the ground." As per some of the international defence journals, Prithvi can carry several types of warhead like high explosive, prefragmented, cluster munitions and fuel air explosives (FAE). The last mentioned can cause four time the damage done by an ordinary nuclear bomb. These journals insist that Prithvi has the capability to carry nuclear and chemical warheads too, a factor on which Indian scientists are tight-lipped. Prof Abdul Kalam, who along with Maj. Gen. V.J. Sundram, is the brain behind the Prithvi project has, however, said more than once that this missile can carry five types of conventional warheads only. Prithvi, which is being projected as the biggest threat to Pakistan's security and the one that could disturb the arms balance in the Indian sub-continent according to Americans, interestingly has most of its components locally made. Only five to ten per cent of its parts like precision sensors microprocessors and special alloy used for its silver-white exterior are imported. Among the munitions developed for Prithvi are the deadly cluster bomblets, which are released while the missile is still in the air. Each of these bomblets is designed to piece armour or shower lethal mental fragments, a capability that is proving to be Pakistan's anethema. The 1.1 m diameter battlefield tactical missile can come in two versions -- the 250 km range type with 500 kg payload and 150 km range projectile with 1,000 kg payload. The target shooting range could be increased or decreased by altering the angles. The only failure in 13 trials so far has been when the missile was commanded to do a 15 degree roll. Perfection has since been in this category too.
