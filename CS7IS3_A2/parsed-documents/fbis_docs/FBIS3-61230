Elections to the Federal Assembly have been held, but the political situation in Russia has heated up to boiling point again. Numerous discussions, of which there have been so many in this century, have been concentrated around ancient Russian problems: "Why did `some' win and `others' lose?" "Who is to blame?" And so forth. Understandably, historians and political scientists will be able dispassionately to answer these and many other questions much later, when the passions have died down, and when the gaze of the observer, his personal evaluations suspended, sees "only the facts." But both "then" and "now" it is useful to know the social attitudes of the voters. And what predetermined precisely this development of events in the country. Weekly public opinion polls conducted by the Institute of Sociology of Parliamentarianism in Moscow over two years now made it possible to note long before the present day many sociopsychological peculiarities and tendencies in the development of the current political situation. Some of them were confirmed once again on the eve of the elections--as a result of a comparative analysis of the figures from two large-scale public opinion polls of the adult city and rural population of Russia (the first poll was taken during 25-30 November, the second poll during 2-7 December). The polls were conducted by the Institute according to a standard methodology in all 12 of the country's main economic regions: Northern, Northwestern, Central, Volga-Vyatka, Central-Chernozem, Volga, Northern Caucasus, Ural, Western Siberian, Eastern Siberian, Far Eastern, and Kaliningrad Oblast, including Moscow and St. Petersburg. The samples--6,000 respondents each--reflect the main sociodemographic characteristics of the general totality of the country's adult population. As the analysis showed, the results of the election to the Federal Assembly depended on two polar and, seemingly, mutually exclusive tendencies. On the one hand, in the society at the level of mass consciousness and self-awareness there was a clear uncertainty and instability of political preferences of the voters. Many "were prepared to vote" but did not know "for whom" and were "considering" right up until the last moment. All this increased the significance and decisive role of persuasion and preelection propaganda. On the other hand, on the level of the mass subconscious, the behavior of the voters was influenced by a fairly rigid "system" of sociopsychological principles that were already in place. And this, in turn, threatened to neutralize the effectiveness of any propaganda unless it corresponded to the expectations of the audience. In other words, people were inclined to perceive only that which corresponded to their views. Therefore the outcome of the elections depended largely on the degree to which the parties and blocs were able to take advantage of these and other tendencies. Judge for yourselves. Both the polls and the elections revealed a fairly high degree of political activity on the part of the country's voters. Incidentally, half of them (52 percent) simply intended to participate in the voting, while another 12 percent were inclined "to participate rather than not participate." The problem, however, consisted in that even on the eve of the elections public opinion was not sufficiently formed. At least by 7 December, 65 percent of Russian voters (according to their own self-assessments) had not made a final decision about whom to vote for, and only 35 percent of the voters had already made this decision. But even the voters who had decided to participate in the elections and named their possible "elected officials" during the poll did not have finally formed opinions either. Approximately 50-70 percent of the supporters of one party or bloc said that they had not finally decided who to vote for. Moreover, many voters did not understand the principal differences in the party programs, and the set of campaign promises for a "better life" among the majority of candidates was fairly standard. It is not surprising that under these conditions a decisive role began to be played not so much by political programs and platforms as by the "acting mastery" of the politicians. It is curious that, according to the assessment of Moscow voters at the end of November, the statements and political advertising they remembered most were those of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (V. Zhirinovskiy)--indicated by 14 percent, the Russia's Choice bloc (Ye. Gaydar)--11 percent, and the Democratic Party of Russia (N. Travkin)--9 percent. The statements of other parties were remembered by many fewer. Incidentally, according to the assessment of 17 percent, "they did not remember anything," and 21 percent--out of principle "did not look, did not listen, and did not read all that," and 21 percent--"found it difficult to determine their opinion." Incidentally, many thought and still think that the ones that could win the election were those that have "money" (this is what 28 percent of the Moscow voters thought), "press, radio, and television" (23 percent), "power" (21 percent), and "the support of B.N. Yeltsin" (20 percent) and not those "who defend the interests of the people" (16 percent) or "who have more of the truth" (9 percent). But nonetheless, as life showed, "money," "propaganda," etc., with all their significance, were clearly inadequate factors. The mechanism of social principles and social expectations of the voters entered into the "fate" of the elections. According to predictions of the Institute of the Sociology of Parliamentarianism, in the elections to the State Duma "in terms of the party slates" the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia led, and it was followed by the Russia's Choice bloc. The basis for this assumption was, in particular, the fact that on the eve of the elections to the State Duma (poll of 2-7 December) 17 percent of the voters who voted were inclined to cast their vote for the LDPR, for Russia's Choice--16 percent, for the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc--13 percent, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation--12 percent, the Democratic Party of Russia--10 percent, Women of Russia--6 percent, the Agrarian Party--5 percent, and the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord]--5 percent. Let me remind you that according to the data of many respected sociology colleagues, the success of the LDPR in terms of the party slates did not significantly exceed the 5-percent mark, and Russia's Choice received barely a third of the votes from Russian voters. It is clear that this is not about the arithmetic precision of the predictions but about tendencies that were observed. And the attempt of the Institute of the Sociology of Parliamentarianism ("Novosti," Ostankino 25 November) to draw the public's attention to the drop in the rating of Russia's Choice met not only with a complete lack of understanding but even attacks from certain upstart "sociologists." Incidentally, now that our Institute's prediction, according to the preliminary results of the voting, was basically right, none of this is of interest any longer. Something else is crucial: a comparative analysis of the data from the two all-Russian polls shows that even at the end of November (the poll of 25-30 November) the level of support for the LDPR from Russian voters was 16 percent of those that intended to vote, and Russia's Choice--also 16 percent. And the key to the analysis of the results of the election must be sought not only in the "good television propaganda" of some and the "poor propaganda" of others, but also in deeper processes in the social psychology. Thus the majority of Russians (75 percent) are dissatisfied with their present life to one degree or another. Of these, 23 percent "are more dissatisfied" and 52 percent are simply "dissatisfied" with it, while another 5 percent "find it difficult to decide" and only 20 percent are satisfied with their life to one degree or another: 8 percent--"satisfied," 12 percent--"more satisfied than dissatisfied." The prolonged economic crisis and the growth of crime have led to a situation where in the structure of the values of the population of Russia there is a marked predominance of an orientation toward a "high standard of living" (73 percent) and "public law and order" (67 percent). Although values of material well-being and order are traditional both for Russia and for the Western countries, never before in recent years has the demand for democracy and freedom of speech been expressed so weakly: "Participation in the adoption of important political decisions" was significant for only 4 percent of the Russian voters and "openness and freedom of speech"--12 percent. I wish to emphasize that all this by no means indicates that the citizens of Russia are against democracy, openness, and freedom of speech. The problem is that the existing living conditions are forcing people to live at a level different from that of elementary social needs. The social situation in the country is becoming fairly tense. The majority of people are finding it difficult to adapt to the current economic situation and feel socially and politically defenseless and alienated. Therefore they frequently do not perceive the changes that are taking place. Thus to the question "can you say that your time has come now?" most of the country's adult population (79 percent) answer "no," with 63 percent saying simply "no," while 16 percent say "more no than yes," and another 11 percent find it difficult to answer this question, and only 10 percent think that now "their time has come" to one degree or another. It is worth paying attention to the fact that support for the LDPR was greater among the disenfranchised, those who, according to their self-assessments, "cannot withstand the so-called liberalization of prices." And there are a considerable number of people who have been impoverished and cannot withstand the "shock therapy" of reforms in present day Russia: 37 percent of the adult population. Incidentally, 45 percent think that this is "difficult but tolerable," for 10 percent--"not as terrible as it seemed," 4 percent note that "this does not suit them," and 4 percent "found it difficult to determine" their opinion.
