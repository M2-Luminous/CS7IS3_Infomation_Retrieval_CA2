This lessens the electricity generation capacity of the National Electric System. The Diez de Octubre plant, in Nuevitas, experienced a temporary fuel shortage that forced it to reduce its output between 26 and 31 March; this situation was resolved last night. The Electrical Union reported that the situation will continue over the next few days, including 2 and 3 April. The outages will continue to be longer than scheduled and in accordance with the outage program designed in each region to cover this period. Maintenance workers at the power plants are working around the clock to complete repairs and increase the output of the National Electric System in the shortest time possible.
