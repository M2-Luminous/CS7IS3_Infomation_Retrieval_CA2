FR941028-1-00005 FR941028-1-00002 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;97&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19 (Regional Jet) Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19 (Regional Jet) series airplanes. This proposal would require various modifications of the passenger doors. This proposal is prompted by reports that some passenger doors froze shut during flight and could not be opened after landing the airplane. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent the passenger doors from freezing shut, and consequently, prohibiting the passengers from exiting the airplane in the event of an emergency. DATES: Comments must be received by December 24, 1994.
