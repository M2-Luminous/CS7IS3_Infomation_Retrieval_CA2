They are all located in China's most developed regions. China has 32,000 km of coastline and some 300 deepwater wharfs which can handle ships of 10,000 DWT [deadwieght ton] and over. In the past few years, both the central and local governments have stepped up efforts to construct ports. The Bohai Sea Rim, the densest port group area in China, has now more than 40 ports along its 5,800-km coast, including Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Tianjin and Qingdao. It accounts for more than 40 percent of the nation's port handling capacity. More large ports, including Huanghua Port in Shandong Province and Yingkou Port in Liaoning Province, will be enlarged and built in the area in the coming few years. In the Chang Jiang River Delta, one of the key construction areas in China, a port group with Shanghai as the center has taken shape. So far, more than 20 well-equipped and modernized ports have been built in the area, with more than 60 wharfs which can handle ships of 10,000 DWT and over. The area now accounts for about one third of the country's maritime cargo turnover. According to local officials, the handling capacity of the Chang Jiang River Delta will double when Shanghai Port, Nanjing Port, Nantong Port, Beilun Port and Zhoushan Port are further expanded or renovated. In south China a number of deep-water ports are under construction, apart from Guangzhou, Zhanjiang, Shantou and Fuzhou. They will include a 100,000 DWT coal wharf, a 50,000 DWT oil transfer wharf and a 50,000 DWT container wharf. An international port system incorporating energy, industry and trade is rapidly taking shape in south China. According to China's transport departments, Qinhuangdao Port in Hebei Province has become the largest energy transmission port in the world. Dalian, Tianjin, Zhoushan and Beilun have respectively become China's largest foreign trade, container, crude oil transfer, and mineral ores and liquid petrochemical products transfer ports. Economists predict that nearly ten ports in China, including Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Nanjing, Beilun, Guangzhou, Huizhou and Zhuhai, will each have a cargo-handling capacity of more than 100 million tons by the end of the century. At the same time, a port construction wave is surging along the coast of the Yellow Sea. Rizhao in east China's Shandong Province has become the second- largest coal port in China. Jiangsu Province will also build large transfer ports for crude oil and coal at Qidong and Dafeng. In addition, statistics show that ports on the Bohai Sea Rim have set up trade relations with more than 160 countries and regions and contribute to more than half of the country's import and export trade volume.
