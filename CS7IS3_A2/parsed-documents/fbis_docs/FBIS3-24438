Nevertheless, the general tone of a majority of the speeches was not equal to the dramatic nature of the president's message. Opening the hearings, Nikolay Gonchar, chairman of the budget committee, noted that despite repeated attempts to resolve the nonpayments problem, the situation remains critical. It is already a question of an insolvency crisis as a whole. On 1 January 1994, overdue accounts payable amounted to more than 16 trillion rubles [R] (7.1 percent of GDP). Overdue accounts receivable reached R18 trillion. State indebtedness for military deliveries totaled R876.4 billion, and for grain purchases--R620 billion. Andrey Kazmin, deputy minister of finance, noted that the nonpayments situation (although, according to his words, their absolute magnitude has decreased in comparison with January of last year) was negatively affected by nonfulfillment of the budget for 1993. Nevertheless, he expressed the firm conviction that in the first quarter the Ministry of Finance will gradually pay off indebtedness to the branches for the past year, thanks to centralized credit granted by the Central Bank to cover the budget deficit. Among other measures in the struggle with nonpayments he mentioned the extension of credit to the end user within the framework of one branch and "intensifying control over pumping money into hard currency and deposit accounts." In contrast to the speech by Kazmin (whom more restrained members of parliament called "a little boy"), the speech of Mariya Paramonova, deputy chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, was greeted more favorably. After noting that the problem of nonpayments is a problem essentially of state enterprises (the net surpluses in the accounts of commercial enterprises total R22 trillion), Madame Paramonova declared that the task of the financial organs is to stimulate the use of free resources. In her opinion, the problem of nonpayments has a structural character, and it is impossible to resolve it only by an interbranch offset. The recommendations of the Central Bank looked somewhat old fashioned to a majority of the deputies: strengthen financial control over the activity of enterprises, enter a line in balance sheets "sold for cash," clarify which kind of enterprises are profitable and which are not, lower the tax rate on profits to 20 percent for enterprises that are experiencing a shortage of circulating funds, with an assignment of part of the income from this tax for their replenishment, reorganize RKTs [cash account centers] into clearing centers, and also restore the priority schedule of payments. All of this, it is true, will require changing at minimum 20 legislative acts. Sergey Ignatyev, deputy minister of the economy, had his own approach to the problem. After self-critically admitting that the government's debts constitute 50 percent of the volume of nonpayments, he declared: As long as the government takes unfulfilled obligations upon itself, inflation and nonpayments will continue. To fight nonpayments, Ignatyev proposed the following scheme: An additional account is opened for each enterprise where it has a settlement account to which resources of the centralized credit of the Central Bank are deposited to pay off indebtedness. After the conduct of settlements, surplus resources are transferred to the main account. Only in this case, in the opinion of the Ministry of Economics, will the long process of paying off indebtedness not cause long-term inflationary consequences. Yesterday's hearing, in fact, was limited to a demonstration of the various approaches of various structures of the executive authority to the problem of nonpayments. It is apparent that neither the executive nor the legislative authority are yet ready to resolve the problem of nonpayments in a radical way--through bankruptcy of insolvent enterprises. They are continuing to search for "milder" ways. The hearings will continue next week, and it can be expected that the positions of their participants will become more radical over time. Commentary The first stage of the hearings "Crisis of Nonpayments in the Country's Economy," which took place in the Federation Council at the initiative of its participants, graphically demonstrated not only a lack in the government of any kind of integral concept for solving the nonpayments situation that has developed, but also the fact that it does not intend to allow legislators to get near a resolution of this question. As early as in the morning, learning of this measure in the Federation Council, First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets announced at his news conference that nonpayments are a matter for the government and not the parliament. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin (who, like Soskovets, also received an invitation to these hearings) also did not consider it necessary to attend them. Attendees at the hearings came to the conclusion on this basis that the executive authority simply had nothing to say. Meanwhile, it can be stated that the first stage of the hearings aroused great interest among high-ranking representatives of the industrial managerial elite. Present in the chamber were Minister of Fuel and Energy Yuriy Shafranik, the heads of administration of many Russian regions, deputies of both chambers, and plant directors--in other words, all those who felt that they were suffering most from nonpayments in the current situation. Taking this into account, the conclusion can be drawn that the initiator of the holding of the hearings--the budget and finance committee headed by Nikolay Gonchar--in fact brought additional political attention to the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly by demonstrating that he is capable of asking sharp questions independently, without asking for the preliminary approval of the executive branch. Grounds for assuming the opposite were provided as far back as the election of the speaker of the Federation Council, when the executive branch succeeded in ensuring the victory of Vladimir Shumeyko. The Federation Council also undoubtedly acquired some moral capital, by showing that it is far more concerned about the situation that has developed in the economy of the country than the government. However, Nikolay Gonchar did not begin to place the committee in opposition to the government. Having reproached the Council of Ministers for not yet developing a concept for combating nonpayments, Nikolay Gonchar declared that this problem will be resolved successfully only in the event that the efforts of the "profile" departments, the legislative, and the executive authorities are united. It is obvious that this is also a bow in the direction of regional leaders who still see in government authority the only method of solving their material problems. The capabilities and opportunities of the Federation Council, judging by everything, remain unclear for them.
