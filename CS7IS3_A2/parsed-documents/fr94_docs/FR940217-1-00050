FR940217-1-00050 FR940217-1-00012 (d) If the Government performs any inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. (e) Unless otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall accept work as promptly as practicable after delivery, and work shall be deemed accepted 90 days after delivery, unless accepted earlier. (f) At any time during contract performance, but no later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of all of the end items (other than designs, drawings, or reports) to be delivered under the contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct work not meeting contract requirements. Time devoted to the replacement or correction of such work shall not be included in the computation of the above time period. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (h) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined as specified in the Allowable Cost and Payment clause, but not additional fee shall be paid. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance work required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. (g)(1) If the Contractor fail to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform replacement or correction, the Government may_ (i) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or make an equitable reduction in any fixed fee paid or payable under the contract; (ii) Require delivery of any undelivered articles and shall have the right to make an equitable reduction in any fixed fee paid or payable under the contract; or (iii) Terminate the contract for default. (2) Failure to agree on the amount of increased cost to be charged the Contractor or to the reduction in fixed fee shall be a dispute. (h)(1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (f) and (g) of this clause, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to: (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified; (iii) The Contractor not applying best efforts toward the accomplishment of the research and development objectives of the contract (those for which success cannot be reasonably predicted at the time of contract award); or (iv) The Contractor not following generally accepted industrial or engineering practices in performing routine operations as part of contract performance. (2) The contractor's liability for failures due to causes listed in subparagraphs (h)(1) (iii) and (iv) is limited to the lesser of: (i) 50 percent of the cost to remedy the failure, or (ii) 10 percent of the contract value at the time the failure occurred. (i) This clause shall apply in the same manner to a corrected or replacement end item or components as to work originally delivered. (j) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under the contract to correct or replace articles not meeting contract requirements at time of delivery, except as provided in this clause or as may otherwise be specified in the contract. (k) Unless otherwise provided in the contract, the Contractor's obligations to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.
