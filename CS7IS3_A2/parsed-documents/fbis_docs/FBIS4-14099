The bottom line of what Gen. Shahaq had to say is that he is not sure the Cairo negotiations will be completed this week. [Begin recording] [Shahaq] I do not think that the negotiations will be completed this week. Progress is definitely being made because we work around the clock. We meet and things are being settled, but there is still work to be done. There is no cardinal issue on which there are differences, but there are many issues for which there are still no answers and with which we are currently dealing -- some of which can become difficult to resolve and therefore important. [Unidentified correspondent] Are there issues that will be finalized after the agreement is signed? [Shahaq] There will be issues that will be resolved after the signing, and agreement must be reached on that as well. If that happens, those issues will be put off and work on them will continue immediately after the signing. [end recording] Gen. Shahaq noted that he does know about any Peres-'Arafat meeting in Cairo at the end of the week and refused to say which issues remain controversial. He merely said that there are no substantive disputes but that the small print must also be negotiated. Asked what these issues are, he said: [Begin Shahaq recording] I do not think it is significant, even for you, because you are not sitting with a list and checking off the issues. We have almost completed the deliberations on civilian issues, but even that is not totally accurate. Last week I mentioned passports, dialing zones, stamps, and currency as issues on which agreement has not yet been reached. There are also other issues on which we are still deliberating. Some of the security issues have also been completed, but I think it is pointless and irrelevant for most people to become involved in the niceties. All the issues have to be resolved. We referred earlier to the issue of crossings and safe passage [last two words in English]. The gaps on those issues are very, very small, and I think they will also be settled this week. I think that when the week ends, we will provide a list of all the issues completed this week. [end recording] On the agreement reached between Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] in the Gaza Strip, Gen. Shahaq stressed that Israel will not accept agreements between the two organizations that permit Hamas to continue attacking Israel. [Begin Shahaq recording] As long as meetings between Fatah and Hamas are devoted to resolving conflicts between them and to the problems of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, they do not constitute a problem for us. If, however, they are meant to provide a distribution of labor between Fatah, which will abide by the agreement, and Hamas, which will take actions not permitted in the agreement, that is not only unacceptable but will not happen and will have an impact on the talks. I think that is clear. We were told that this is not what took place and will also not take place in the future. [end recording]
