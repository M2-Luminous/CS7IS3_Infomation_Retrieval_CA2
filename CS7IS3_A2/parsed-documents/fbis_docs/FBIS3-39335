Unless they manage to broaden participation, making democracy work better, the "bad shepherds," the prophets of hate and discord, will arrive on the scene. A fundamental test, says Delors, is the fight against mass unemployment, which is not a temporary issue but a structural phenomenon. In all probability, Jacques Delors will retire before the end of the year. He has been presiding over the European Commission in Brussels since 1985, witnessing the parabola of these last few years from the front line: The mighty thrust toward political integration has gradually lost momentum, leaving behind it the depressing stagnation of recent times. Delors remains a passionate advocate of the unification of Europe, but he now seems to be conducting a lone crusade. A militant socialist with a solid Catholic background, he now has a serried rank of conservative heads of government to deal with, although this does not seem to have done much to dampen his proverbial fighting spirit. [Gardumi] Mr. President, the proposals you made in your white paper on employment and investment in Europe have been received with great interest in Italy, particularly on the left. However, the governments of the Twelve have not shown the same amount of enthusiasm. Do you not think that European policies for lowering unemployment are still way below needs and expectations? [Delors] We must draw a distinction between the white paper and the decisions of the European Council in Brussels. The white paper is intended as an analysis of what I would call the "European sickness," by which I mean the inability of our countries to maintain the competitiveness required to create the millions of jobs we need. I had already warned the heads of government that we were facing structural problems some time ago, although I also added a note of optimism: Europe has the capacity to solve these problems. The white paper takes up this analysis, this diagnosis, and puts forward recommendations as to what can be done at both the Community and the national levels. The European Council has approved it in general terms, but as the problems are of a structural nature, we cannot solve them overnight. I realize that public opinion is anxious about the future in view of the rising tide of unemployment and all the social problems that it brings with it, such as deprivation and instability, and wants us to move faster. The situation can be changed, but it will take time and a lot of thought. The white paper has opened a window on the medium-term future and has shown that we are not condemned to a decline. It is a plan of action and a framework for thought and discussion. [Gardumi] You propose high investment in major continent-wide infrastructure networks, but the resources are not easy to find. [Delors] It must first be said that these projects do not set out to achieve immediate economic recovery, but to strengthen the economy, thus making it more competitive and capable of creating employment. The plans cover the transportation, power, and information networks serving us all. Some critics accuse them of being an incitement to borrowing, but the venerable theory of public finance states that if a government decides on projects that will benefit three generations, those three generations must all contribute to financing them. In any case, it must also be realized that investment often makes for extra savings. These criticisms are unfounded. Moreover, there are various ways in which private capital can be brought in to supplement public funding. Suffice it to mention what was achieved in the capitalist country par excellence, the United States, under President Roosevelt. It is only the right-wing ideologists who oppose this idea. Do we intend to sit with our feet up while threatened by this tide of unemployment? [Gardumi] The Maastricht Treaty refers to a single currency and joint foreign and security policies. However, never before have there been such great divergences between currencies and national interests. Do you think the goals of the treaty can still be achieved? [Delors] Here again, we must distinguish between the two aspects of the treaty. As far as economic and monetary union is concerned, we got off to a good start. Until September 1992, the convergence between the various economies was increasing, and the currencies were stable within the EMS [European Monetary System]. However, these appearances concealed divergences in the development of some of the economic systems, hence the events of the September in question. To all intents and purposes, we now have to start again from scratch. The fact remains that it is in every country's interest to have a stable currency, low inflation, and a public borrowing requirement kept within reasonable limits. I therefore think that the road to economic convergence can be found, and if it is the deadlines adopted can be met. It must also be borne in mind that the advocates of European integration and those pushing in the opposite direction are engaged in a dramatic race against time. We must be constantly on the alert. [Gardumi] What about the common initiative at the international level? [Delors] I shall be more cautious, more circumspect here, firstly because the decisionmaking processes in this sphere are highly complicated, and then because, notwithstanding two decades of informal cooperation on foreign policy, our countries still tend very much to go it alone. We must put a great amount of joint thought into understanding the proper function of the European Union and its responsibilities, into grasping the real hazards that threaten not only our security but that of our neighbors, and into recognizing threats to peace and freedom. To some extent, this is what the European Commission does, within its sphere of jurisdiction, not so much by its own virtue but because its job is to identify and grasp the common interest. This is what is lacking in the foreign policy field. [Gardumi] Are you not alarmed by this urge, which seems to be spreading more and more, to seek individual national and regional identities? How can a concept of supranational integration be defended in these conditions? [Delors] The problem is that Europe is on the move, but without a precise idea of where it wants to go. In a few years, it could be like a ship adrift at sea, with its rising generations completely alienated. This is why we must never cease strengthening political will, seizing on common interests, explaining everything to the public, acknowledging our responsibility before the European Parliament, and involving the national parliaments. The question facing us is: where do you really want to go? We have to answer it. If this question had eluded us, I should be very worried as to the fate of the Europe that we are building. Making our intentions clear is a risk, but it is one that we have to run. Our democracies are "weary of life," and our contemporaries are seeking a feeling of belonging to something. If the answer does not come from us, the "bad shepherd" will arrive on the scene. [Gardumi] And what might the bad shepherd promise? [Delors] He advocates refusal and rejection of the other, the exaltation of a race or a religion. There is only one means of warding off this danger: an active society and a transparent, more effective democracy. Whatever form of words may have been used, the ultimate goal of all men of progress has always been to deepen the roots of democracy. They have been convinced that society and mankind can be improved a little. If we no longer believe in this, we can hardly be surprised if the boat is adrift. [Gardumi] The war in Bosnia is perhaps the most painful wound in Europe. Do you think that the time has now come to risk greater military involvement in the area? [Delors] I said 18 months ago that without a credible military threat it would be impossible to halt the progress of this ideology of death that goes by the name of ethnic cleansing. I was right, unfortunately. I would have preferred to be wrong. The situation has changed now. We must ask ourselves whether even a highly unsatisfactory peace would not be preferable to the continuation of a war involving weapons of mass destruction. The Serbs and Croats in particular have not yet fielded all their military resources. I would like to say to all those in a position to make decisions: Don't just talk -- do something. [Gardumi] You are regarded as the architect of the Maastricht Treaty. With hindsight, would your approach be the same, or is there anything you would change? [Delors] Excuse me, but I must correct a historical fact. I have been identified as the architect of European recovery, and this flatters me, on the strength of the single act, the 1992 objective, and the financial agreements embodied in what are referred to as packages one and two, but I am not the architect of Maastricht. An examination of the Commission's proposals for the treaty will show that there are great differences between them and the final text. It would therefore be better to put the question to those who had a real say in the final drafting of the agreement, which, quite frankly, is not mine. However, the treaty has been adopted and ratified by the national parliaments, and in some cases directly by the people, so let us implement it as best we can. Nothing would be more dangerous than to throw it open to discussion again now. If it were not implemented, there would be a vacuum. In 1996, the next date for considering the European institutions, its imperfections and the lessons that we have learned from them will have to be taken into account. [Gardumi] Widening the Community, first to 18 and then to 20 or more members, will change its nature. How do you picture the Community of the 21st century? [Delors] There is a contradiction that we have to overcome, or that I at any rate believe we have to overcome. On the one hand, in the face of the collapse of totalitarian communism, we West Europeans have a historical duty to extend our values of peace, pluralism, respect, and mutual cooperation to all the European countries and to enable them all to achieve material prosperity. On the other hand, I consider that the heritage of the Treaty of Rome is still a living force. What is the main message of this heritage? The conviction that no West European country is still strong enough to keep on playing the historical role to which it aspires in view of Europe's contribution to world history, hence the urge to constitute a stronger political unity among those who desire this role. How can these two projects be reconciled? This is the issue that the Commission has been laying before the governments of the Twelve for two or three years. If no answer is forthcoming, the construction of Europe will go haywire. Finding an answer is difficult, I know, but then politics is difficult. [Gardumi] What is your opinion of the process of political renewal under way in Italy? [Delors] It used to be said of Italy that the state did not work but the economy was prosperous. This notion, which was shared by many, has not been reflecting reality for five or six years. The need to adjust the system had thus become imperative. I consider what is happening doubly encouraging. On the economic front, Amato and Ciampi have taken measures that go in the right direction, and business has shown great adaptability, particularly after the devaluation of the lira, so my conclusion is that there is a sound economic base. On the political front, a new republic is awaited that will have great opportunities for redefining the role of the state and the exercise of decentralized powers, and for practicing politics in a way that will rekindle the interest of the public and encourage it to take an active part in public life. Like many observers outside Italy, I believe that the worst moment for your country's image is over. Of course, there is still a lot to be done, and I repeat: Like all of us, Italy has to face what I call a weakening of our democracies. If we do not fight this danger, I say again that we leave the field wide open to the bad shepherds.
