FR941006-2-00176 FR941006-2-00113 A scholarship may cover the cost of tuition and travel up to a maximum total of $1,500 per scholarship. (Transportation expenses include roundtrip coach airfare or train fare, or up to $.25/mile if the recipient drives to the site of the program.) Funds to pay tuition and transportation expenses in excess of $1,500, and other costs of attending the program such as lodging, meals, materials, and local transporta-tion (including rental cars) at the site of the education program, must be obtained from other sources or be borne by the scholarship recipient. Scholarship recipients are encouraged to check with their tax advisor to determine whether the scholarship constitutes taxable income under Federal and State law. (b) Eligibility Requirements. Because of the limited amount of funds available, scholarships are limited to full-time judges of State or local trial and appellate courts, to full-time professional, State or local court personnel with management responsibilities, and to supervisory and management probation personnel in judicial branch probation offices. Senior judges, part time judges, quasi-judicial hearing officers, State administrative law judges, staff attorneys, law clerks, line staff, law enforcement officers and other executive branch personnel will not be eligible to receive a scholarship. (c) Application Procedures. Judges and court managers interested in receiving a scholarship must submit the Institute's Judicial Education Scholarship Application Form (Form S1, see Appendix III). Applications must be submitted by: November 1, 1994, for programs beginning between February 1, 1995 and April 30, 1995; February 1, 1995, for programs beginning between May 1 and July 31, 1995; May 1, 1995, for programs beginning between August 1, and October 31, 1995; and August 1, 1995, for programs beginning between November 1, 1995 and January 31, 1996. No exceptions or extensions will be granted. (d) Concurrence Requirement. All scholarship applicants must obtain the written concurrence of the Chief Justice of his or her State's Supreme Court (or the Chief Justice's designee) on the Institute's Judicial Education Scholarship Concurrence (Form S2, see Appendix III). Court managers, other than elected clerks of court, also should submit a letter of support from their supervisor. The Concurrence (Form S2) may accompany the application or be sent separately. However, the original signed Concurrence form must be received by the Institute within one week after the appropriate application mailing deadline (i.e. by November 8, 1994, or February 8, May 8, or August 8, 1995). No application will be reviewed if a signed Concurrence has not been received by the required date. (e) Review Procedures/Selection Criteria. The Board of Directors has delegated the authority to approve or deny scholarships to its Judicial Education Committee. The Institute intends to notify each applicant whose scholarship has been approved within 60 days after the relevant application deadline. The Committee will reserve sufficient funds each quarter to assure the availability of scholarships throughout the year. The factors that the Institute will consider in selecting scholarship recipients are: •The applicant's need for training in the particular course subject and how the applicant would apply the information/skills gained; •The benefits to the applicant's court or the State's court system that would be derived from the applicant's participation in the specific educational program, including a description of current legal, procedural, administrative or other problems affecting the State's courts, related to topics to be addressed at the educational program (in addition to submission of a signed Form S2); •The absence of educational programs in the applicant's State addressing the particular topic;
