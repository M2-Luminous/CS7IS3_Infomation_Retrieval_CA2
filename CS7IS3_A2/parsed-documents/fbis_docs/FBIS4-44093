Canada has just announced its readiness to offer UNAMIR 350 soldiers and a communication unit. Tunisia has offered 500 soldiers, Pakistan has stressed its readiness to transfer some of its contingents from UNOSOM [UN Operation in Somalia] to Rwanda, and, at last, the United States has already transported equipment for UNAMIR to Uganda. We suggested that the UN secretary general coordinate the operations to ease the arrival of UNAMIR.
