According to the 35-page report, copies of which were distributed to delegates yesterday, Mr Li has adopted a milder stance towards the British Government in spite of icy ties in the wake of the collapse of democracy talks on Hong Kong. The tone and rhetoric of the Hong Kong sub-section are less confrontational compared with the vociferous volleys fired by Mr Li in his NPC work report last year. In Thursday's report, Mr Li asserts that the British side has to shoulder the "full responsibility" for the breakdown of the 17-round diplomatic talks. Noting that the work of the Preliminary Working Committee has already started, the premier says the Chinese Government "is fully determined and has the capability" to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong "in accordance with the schedule regardless of twists and turns". Mr Li reaffirms the determination of Beijing to maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. But he emphasizes that the "colonial rule of the British Government" is coming to an end. "This can never be blocked by any forces," he says. The premier stops short of high-decibel name-calling or provocative remarks about the integrity of Whitehall or the "conspiracy of neo- imperialists". His relatively mild remarks appear to suggest a return to pragmatism on the part of the Chinese Government in the wake of its "disillusionment" over any possibility of greater political cooperation with the British side in the next three years. This is despite a flurry of harsh words about Britain by senior Chinese officials on the heels of the publication of details of the talks and the gazetting of the controversial parts of Governor Chris Patten's political blueprint 10 days ago. Official sources said although China had never ruled out the possibility of an early takeover, it had never considered an earlier date for resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong. On the question of Macau, Mr Li praises Lisbon for the close Sino-Portuguese cooperation on the handover of the enclave. Similar to previous government work reports, the Hong Kong issue forms a part of the section dealing with "the reunification of the motherland" which also covers Macao and Taiwan. The 15,000-character report compares to a 17,000 character document last year. The bulk of the premier's report touches on the economic development of the country, which has seen fluctuations in the past year marked by hyperinflation and austerity measures. In the first section of his report, Mr Li reviews the past year's economic development including the austerity programme. He maps out the strategy of seeking a harmonious relationship between "development, reform and stability" this year. The reports also reiterates the dictum adopted by the politburo in January: "Seize the opportunity, deepen reform, expand the open door, promote development and maintain stability." In the second section, entitled "Maintenance of sustained, high- speed and healthy development of the economy", Mr Li emphasises the need to promote development in tandem with the enhancement of efficiency. In the third section, the premier underscores the significance of speeding up reforms for the development of a socialist market economy. The fourth section deals with the promotion of science, education and culture, while the fifth is on the strengthening of democracy and the legal system. The final part of the report covers diplomacy. Mr Li says Beijing has improved relations with all major countries. But Britain is not mentioned in this regard. Mr Li sets the national growth rate this year at nine percent, and vows to keep inflation within 10 percent. While indicating that major achievements have been made in a wide range of areas, Mr Li concedes much still needs to be done in economic and social spheres. These include tackling soaring inflation, the "irrational" economic structure money-losing state firms, the worsening law-and-order situation, and laxity in fighting social evils as well as corruption. Mr Li assures that the party centre and central Government have already taken measures to solve the problems. Stressing that this year's work should be governed by the 20-character dictum, he calls on the nation to put the national situation before local concerns. "We must seriously handle the relationship between development, reform, and stability," he says, adding the three are "inter-related". "Economic construction is the core of our work. Reform is the impetus for promoting development. Development and reform are the way to ensure stability in the long run. And maintaining stability will guarantee (the smooth implementation of) development and reform." In spite of his somewhat mild stance on Hong Kong, Mr Li speaks in harsher terms on the reunification of Taiwan. "The realization of the peaceful unification of the motherland is the wish of all the people of China. Any attempts and activities to split the motherland, no matter in what form, is in contravention of the interest of the Chinese people. They will all be futile," he says. In spite of the controversy over the three-month-long austerity programme last year, Mr Li maintains in his report that the retrenchment exercise has attained positive results. He reiterates the need to impose macro-level adjustments and controls over the economy to solve outstanding contradictions and problems. Echoing the instructions made by octogenarian leaders Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun, the premier underscores the significance of boosting the centre's authority in macro-level economic control. According to an economist, the central Government should be able to attain a growth rate of around 10 percent in spite of the strong pressure of economic overheating. A veteran legislator said the whole report was "quite balanced" and moderate, adding he expected no major dispute over it at the upcoming plenum. Mr Li also vows before the year 2000 to provide "food and clothing" for the 80 million people who are living below the poverty line.
