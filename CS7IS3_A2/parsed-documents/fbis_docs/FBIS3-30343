He said the convoy left the northwestern town of Banja Luka Tuesday morning and was to travel north through Serb-held territory in order to avoid crossing the Croat enclave of Zepce where several previous convoys have been stopped. The last aid convoy to reach Maglaj, besieged by Serb and Croat troops, arrived there on October 26, five months after the previous one. Janowski said the situation in the enclave was desperate. [passage omitted] In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said Tuesday that Russia was against the international community launching air strikes on Bosnia that could lead to an escalation to the conflict. Kozyrev, who spoke following a meeting with peace negotiators David Owen, of the European Community, and Thorvald Stoltenberg of the UN, added that if air strikes are inevitable then they must be "carried out within the framework of UN Security Council resolutions and the approval of the UN Secretary General and members of the Security Council." He added that such strikes should not be aimed exclusively against the Serbs but against all the belligerants. In central Bosnia, British troops reported seeing helicopters flying over the regions of Novi Travnik and Vitez, where Croat and Moslem troops are fighting, Bill Aikman, spokesman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) said. He said the helicopter flights, carried out by both the Moslem and Croat troops, were noticed Monday and one helicopter from a Croat base in Vitez flew over the camp of the British UN peacekeepers stationed nearby. The flights are in violation of a no-fly zone declared over most of Bosnia by the United Nations. Aikman said that the situation was relatively calm throughout the country Monday except in the capital and central Bosnia. In Geneva, the UNHCR protested to Belgrade Tuesday against the mobilisation of Bosnian Serb refugees in rump Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), and denounced a new wave of ethnic cleansing in western Bosnia. Spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said the mobilisation of hundreds of Serbian refugees to fight on the warfronts in Bosnia was "illegal." She said that often trucks went to the refugee camps at night to take away people by force. She said the UNHCR had also protested to Zagreb about similar actions going on in Croatia with Croat refugees from Bosnia. Foa said the UNHCR was also concerned at a new wave of killing and terror in the Banja Luka region, where Serbs are trying to evict the last Moslems and Croats living in the region and confiscating their property. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, Janowski said in Sarajevo that 19 containers carrying a field hospital donated to the Moslem sector of Mostar by a Moslem South African organisation were expected to reach the enclave from Croatia Tuesday after a six-month delay.
