Janmaat, sole parliamentary representative of the Centrum Democrat party, said of Ernst Hisch Ballin: "For Jews to be nomads, fine, but that they should enjoy public office, no." He added that it was natural that Ballin's parents should flee Germany during the Nazi persecutions, "but why did he come to the Netherlands?" Judicial officials said that Janmaat would be charged with racist and discriminatory comments. A Justice Ministry spokesman said Ballin would make no comment on Janmaat's remarks. In the same interview, Janmaat attacked the junior minister for agriculture, Dzsingisz Gabor, on the grounds that he was born in Hungary. Political life should only be open to "Dutch citizens of at least three generations standing," he said.
