Attending it were delegations from Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine, as well as representatives from the sovereign states' embassies. In the opinion of ARMENPRESS director Gevorka Oganesyan, "the main result of the meeting is that we have managed to do some constructive work after the collapse of the Soviet Union. I recall a similar conference last year, which was quite amorphous in content and at which those attending had major differences. But now, at the insistence of a majority of the agencies, a decision in principle has been made to make really effective use of the new unified information space. In connection with this, an appropriate memorandum to the chairman of the Interparliamentary Assembly was passed." "Our Republic is developing along democratic lines, freedom of speech and the press is developing, and naturally we need an outlet into the international information space," said Akbar Ryskulov, director of the Kyrgyzkabar agency. "We are ready to cooperate with any professional news agency that propagandizes basic human ideals. Furthermore, the more independent we become, the more we regard information integration as important and topical for us, and the meeting at ITAR-TASS and the documents adopted at it will undoubtedly promote the development of this process." Boris Petrov, director of ITAR-TASS in St. Petersburg, said he was deeply satisfied with the course and character of the meeting and the content of the decisions adopted, particularly the proposals to create a permanently functioning council of heads of CIS news agencies. In his view, "the general situation regarding the creation and building of structures to coordinate the activity of the CIS has reached a phase that demands the creation of a similar structure in the information field as well."
