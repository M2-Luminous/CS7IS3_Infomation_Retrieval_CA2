However, despite that, it has been able to surmount the crisis. This was the message of the Saudi ambassador to Great Britain, Dr. Ghazi al-Qusaybi, in a new response to biased media reports being circulated about the Saudi Arabian economy. In his reply, the Saudi ambassador dealt with more than one economic aspect that those reports had raised. He categorically denied the truth of a report that the Kingdom is attempting to obtain loans to defray the state's general budget deficit. He stressed that no negotiations were underway between Saudi Arabia and any Western or non-Western banking institution to obtain loans. Ambassador al-Qusaybi's statements coincided with a study by the magazine, CORPORATE LOCATION, to the effect that Saudi Arabia, among all the Arab nations, was among the top 20 nations in the world that have an appropriate climate to attract investments. The study polled about 10,000 companies in the United States and Britain, and all of them stressed that the economic climate in Saudi Arabia was suitable for investment. Those companies are active in all parts of the world. Half of them specialize in production, and the other half offer services, concentrating on engineering, new technology, and mining industry sectors. Moreover, a study by the Saudi Chamber of Commerce and Industry pointed out that since the beginning of its planning era, the Kingdom has striven to prepare an appropriate investment climate for the private sector through a clearly defined economic policy based on the philosophy of free economy and open markets. A group of regulations, measures, and laws have shared in applying this philosophy, organizing relationships between national and foreign capital on the one hand, and between them and the state on the other. All of that is achieved by the supervision of governmental or specialized private organizations, who work to direct and guide the private sector to available investment opportunities. With regard to the details of all that, Ambassador al-Qusaybi explained that the Kingdom has not requested any loans from international or financial institutions. The ambassador pointed out that the only foreign loan the Kingdom had on hand was for $4.5 billion. This is the amount the Kingdom previously borrowed from abroad; there are no other loans. The Saudi ambassador stated frankly that it was strange that people were talking now about the Kingdom's general budget deficit, since in the past six or seven years, there has been a disparity between expenditures and income in the budget. As for the statement of the Bank of International Settlements that as of November 1993 Saudi Arabia has borrowed more than $2 billion from it, over the past few years, that same bank has set as a kind of general guideline standard for the percentage of indebtedness, either domestically or abroad, that debts should not exceed 60 percent of the gross national product. In fact, Ambassador al-Qusaybi stated, the Kingdom's foreign and domestic indebtedness, as the bank knows, does not even come close to 60 percent. On the contrary, the Kingdom's foreign debts do not exceed $4.5 billion. The Saudi ambassador clearly stated that the Kingdom did not expect anyone to express uneasiness or to inform it of its responsibilities in this important regard. The authorities concerned will continue the pressure of governmental expenditures, but in such a way as to not cause any injury to the citizens. He pointed out that the inflation rate in the Kingdom was one of the lowest rates in the world. As for the price of oil and its influence on the Kingdom's economy, the Saudi ambassador said: "I believe that we cannot be governed by the day-to-day price of oil. Certainly, OPEC will take measures to guarantee that the oil price will remain at reasonable levels. What happened recently should not, in any case, be a measurement for what the oil situation will be in the coming months." Going back to the Saudi Chamber of Commerce study, it stated that private investment in the Kingdom enjoys many encouraging incentives, which have contributed to the private sector's participation in economic activity and to the increase in that participation. These incentives include: - The Saudi Development Fund offers loans up to as much as 50 percent of the project's costs. - Total exemption of Saudi industrial or nonindustrial companies from all taxes pertaining to companies. They are subject to the zakat [Islamic charity tax] at 2.5 percent of available liquidity. - The imported goods required for the industrial project are also completely exempt from customs duties. These imports include machinery, tools, equipment, systems, spare parts, and primary and partially manufactured raw materials. - The state also offers the land required to build factories, as well as workers and officials' housing, on a nominal lease. This has caused the state to build several industrial cities, furnished with all services. - Local production enjoys complete protection by various means, which includes limiting or preventing the importing of foreign goods similar to local production, raising the customs duties on them, and offering various means of financial assistance to Saudi industrial organizations. - The exemption from export fees and all other taxes of products prepared for export is also permitted. - All of these measures are to encourage capital to enter investment fields in the Kingdom. There are also several incentives to foreign capital as well, including: - Foreign capital enjoys all the advantages enjoyed by national capital. The industrial or agricultural project, in which foreign capital is invested, also enjoys exemption from income and company taxes for 10 years. Other projects are exempt for five years. The exemption has the proviso that national capital must own not less than 25 percent of the capital allocated to the project as a whole. - In addition, there are several other incentives, such as direct and indirect support for the agricultural sector, through easy loans, subsidies, favorable prices, and reduction of electricity and water costs, since the state provides the private sector with electricity at a very low cost. The state also bears the expenses for training workers in national factories, either in the Kingdom or abroad. According to the study, all of this stresses the confidence of the Saudi economy in itself while, at the same time, confirming its soundness, especially in the integration between the private sector and the state. However, that is without any impinging on a free economy and free markets. An economy like this is not affected by a crisis or crises, except if the crisis occurs directly and, then, it rapidly transcends that crisis. According to a specialist in this field, the financial straits that affected Saudi Arabia because of the exorbitant costs of the Gulf war were quickly ended, since the 1993 budget was an expansion budget. It totalled 196.95 billion riyals [R] (approximately $65 billion), i.e., an increase of 8.8 percent over the 1992 budget. The deficit was estimated at R27.8 billion ($8 billion), i.e., a reduction of 7.4 percent over the 1992 budget deficit. It is clear from Saudi budget numbers that for the fifth consecutive year estimates of general expenditures for 1993 are higher than estimates for the previous year. This has helped to keep the level of economic growth high for the foreseeable future.
