Sunday Sees Second Round of Presidential Elections on the Peninsula"] [Excerpts] Simferopol -- Everyone has long been aware that trouble was brewing in the Crimea. Trouble with a host of aspects and shades. But the governments and parliaments of Ukraine and Russia watched the alarming process stony-faced, allowing events to run their course as it were. Thus the Crimea came to see presidential elections with Nikolay Bagrov and Yuriy Meshkov in the final lap. Nikolay Bagrov is an experienced politician, a product of the system, a former party obkom [oblast committee] first secretary, now chairman of the Crimean Supreme Soviet. It was he who was behind the revival of a republic in the Crimea and secured its political and economic autonomy. In Ukraine Bagrov is considered a treacherous separatist, a "Red-cum-Brown." Crimean radicals are thought to be irresolute and trying to ingratiate themselves with Kiev. "Do you want to live as you are? Do you want Kravchuk's rapscallions and humiliation? Then vote for Bagrov!" -- that is his political opponents' main idea. Yuriy Meshkov is a man of the squares. Rallies are his element, slogans and war cries his weapons. He has been a fitter, a soldier, a student at Moscow State University's Faculty of Law, and a Prosecutor's Office investigator. He promises the people of the Crimea a sovereign republic, he promises to bring the Crimea back to the ruble zone and to the bosom of Russia, he also promises the good life soon, and that young men will do their military service on the peninsula. He also says that he wants to heed the harassed, impoverished, desperate people. Most of the points in his program are unfeasible. But they are all Joe Public's dream.... [passage omitted] To What Kind of Russia Does the Crimea Want To Return? In the public garden opposite the Crimean Supreme Soviet from morning until evening two dozen citizens, primarily of a venerable age, have been freely cursing Kravchuk and all Ukrainians with their independence and making emotional appeals for the Crimea to be returned to Russia. Yuriy Meshkov is their idol. Zhirinovskiy has spoken here. The gathering warmly applauded the announcement of his intention to become president of Russia and annex [prisoyedinit] the Crimea. It is easy to see in conversation that these citizens cannot stand President Yeltsin, they do not fete Gaydar and his team for their "shock therapy," and their sympathies lean more toward those who "favor the Soviet Union and Great Russia," a disaster for the whole world. The 1.5 million Russians in the Crimea form a heterogeneous mass and cannot be identified with the hysterical women in the public garden. In sober, calm conversation they agree that you cannot regrettably bring back the past and that forcibly carving borders spells a bloodbath. But they cannot resign themselves to the fact that they are cut off from Russia and must accept the supremacy of Ukrainian law and acknowledge Ukraine's right to the peninsula. The Crimean people believe religiously that Mother Russia is waiting with open arms for their "escape from captivity." Presidential candidate Yuriy Meshkov sounds off on every street corner saying that "all matters have been resolved with Russia," from dual citizenship to the Russian ruble's circulation in the Crimea. The Crimean people's separatism has a firm foundation -- the economic collapse in Ukraine. The coupon-karbovanets is bad not because it carries a picture of the Cathedral of Saint Sofia but because it is a Mickey Mouse currency. Enterprises Choke in Tax Noose An entrepreneur from Krasnogvardeysk was puzzled as to how "masochistic" a government has to be to render commodity production unprofitable. And he described how they organized production of electric stoves in conjunction with foreign partners. The goods are in great demand. But taxes have been crushing. He himself bought equipment to manufacture plastic pipes for water supply lines and sewage. Given the current levels of individual housing construction in the Crimea this is a correct, profitable, and necessary business. But the taxes that have been levied from all quarters are so extortionate that the workshop is standing idle. Needless to say, Dnepr water is a boon, life itself for the steppes. But I. Karamelev, director of the "Tavricheskiy" Sovkhoz in Perekop, spoke of how equipment was standing idle at the height of the field work -- there are no spare parts, no fuel, and, most importantly, there is no state interest in ensuring that the land feeds the people. The economy is withering every day. "We voted for Bagrov. All the country people in the rayon," he said. "Because we see him as stability." That was how food producers in the Crimea saw N. Bagrov's campaign to shape an open economy on the peninsula, finally extricating the Crimea from Ukraine's ruinous economic policy. As of this January the republic has had its own bank, established its own tax system, and tried to manage autonomously. Foreboding of Disaster Rashness mixed with a craving for simple solutions has always cost us plenty. Let us ask ourselves the following question: What will happen to the Crimea in the future? What if Yuriy Meshkov becomes president (and he is very likely to be victorious) and starts putting his slogans into practice? How will the already strained Ukrainian-Russian relations develop then? It is naive to think that even the most moderate politicians in Ukraine will agree to disrupt the state's territorial integrity. After all there are also radical forces, like the national self-defense detachments that have fought in the Dniester Region and Abkhazia and do not come under the jurisdiction of official Kiev. Dynamite and the assault rifle are by no means secondary in their arsenal of arguments, and their experience of wrecking lines of communication in the Caucasus and blockading railroads can easily be transferred to the Crimea. And what then? Without water, without electricity, and without reliable railroad communications the Crimea would indeed be a peninsula.... Would things be better for it then? A conflagration is starting before our eyes, threatening to burn hot. Why are we keeping silent? Why do we think that embroiling millions of people in an adventure constitutes democracy? Over many centuries the Perekop Channel [perekopskiy rov] has begun to slowly close up, becoming overgrown with idyllic reeds and losing its defense significance. How I would like to hope that it will not be used for its real purpose at the close of the 20th century.
