Correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna: [Begin Cha recording] Reporting on the status of the replacement of fuel rods to its Board of Governors during its informal meeting held yesterday [3 June] afternoon, the IAEA pointed out that the decisive opportunity [kyolchongjogin kihoe] to examine North Korea's diversion of nuclear material has already been lost. The IAEA reported to its 35 Board of Governors member states that providing additional information, which has been demanded from early last year, and a special inspection of two undeclared facilities are indispensable for determining the exact amount of plutonium produced in North Korea. Thus, full-scale cooperation from North Korea is urgent. At yesterday's Board of Governors meeting, Olli Heinonen, head of the inspection section who inspected the replacement of fuel rods in Yongbyon, stressed that because nearly all of the fuel rods were replaced in the portion where sample-taking is definitely required, the result of analysis cannot be trusted even if samples are taken. Councilor Yun Ho-chin from the North Korean side and Kim Su-kil, researcher in the DPRK Foreign Ministry, who came from Pyongyang, attended the informal Board of Governors meeting yesterday. They repeatedly referred to North Korea's special position of withholding the withdrawal of Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and persistently refused interviews by reporters. [end recording]
