The discussion dealt with the serious repercussions the Cairo agreement will have on the Palestinians in the diaspora. A statement issued by the conferees emphasized that this agreement endangers the status of the diaspora Palestinians, particularly in the camps in Lebanon. In this respect, the secretaries general of the 10 Palestinian factions called on the Lebanese Government and the Lebanese nationalist and Islamic forces to enhance the cohesion and the unity of blood enshrined by the Lebanese and Palestinian people, and to defend the Palestinian people's right to repatriation. In their message to the Lebanese Government, the factions reiterated their rejection of resettlement in Lebanon. The 10 factions said they hope the Lebanese Government will help the Palestinian people in Lebanon solve the problems they face, treat Palestinians as equals with the Lebanese concerning job opportunities, and reconstruct the camps after the United Nations Relief and Works Agency [UNRWA] reduced its aid to these camps. The factions called on UNRWA to continue its task of providing various services to the Palestinian people. Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] sources said other meetings will be held in Lebanon between the 10 factions, the Lebanese Government, and UNRWA representatives to tackle these issues.
