The proposals opens up the possibility of additional support for Norrland. "Understanding of the problems of Norrland is growing in the EU," European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel commented. The Commission is proposing that a new category of support be introduced which will mean that additional support can go to regions with a low population density -- fewer than 7 inhabitants per square kilometer. This would cover large areas of Norrland. It is therefore a proposal which is fully in line with the Swedish Government's demands in recent weeks. The EU Commission has made its proposal after member countries were unable to reach agreement on support for the northernmost regions of Norway, Finland, and Sweden. But when the proposal was discussed by the EU countries on Monday [21 February] evening it ran into opposition chiefly from France and Spain who are opposed on principle to any changes to the EU's current rules. However, the proposal had the support of several member countries. The Commission is proposing that the new category of support, which is being called 1(A), should provide a slightly lower level of support per inhabitant than Objective 1 support, which is paid to poor regions. But it will be a level of support that is higher than that from the other support funds, to industrial and agricultural regions with problems -- so-called Objective 2 and Objective 5B support. Unlike other proposals this would also mean that a new permanent form of support would be introduced. In its proposal, which TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA has seen, the Commission writes that this new form of support could also solve the special problems of the inland regions of Sweden south of Norrbotten. The Swedish Government has demanded the highest possible level of support for Sweden's four northernmost provinces and for Halsingland and Gavleborg province. But Ulf Dinkelspiel has said that the important thing is that the EU recognizes Norrland's special problems. On Monday Dinkelspiel met the EC commissioner responsible for regional policy and probably discussed the new proposal. He was unwilling to say whether the new proposal fits the bill for Sweden. But he looks clearly satisfied, after being criticized at home for making demands that looked too much like ultimatums in the negotiations on regional policy. "There are some interesting ideas in the proposal," Dinkelspiel said. The new proposal states that countries like Finland and Norway can have some regions which are classified as Objective 1 regions and which will therefore receive the highest possible level of support. Other regions which do not fully meet the EU's poverty criteria will receive support according to the criteria of Objective 1(A). Payments from other support funds, such as Objectives 2 and 5B, will not be affected by the new category of support. The EU Commission has also put forward a concrete proposal about the circumstances under which the applicant nations may give additional support to farmers in their northern parts over and above the normal EU support for agriculture. One of the conditions is that such support will only go to agriculture north of the 62nd parallel, which is more or less on a level with Sundsvall in Sweden. But farmers south of this line will also be able to receive support in certain cases. Among the criteria being proposed is that population density must not exceed 10 persons per square kilometer. The size of support will be based on the number of animals on or the cultivated area of each farm. However, the EU Commission is proposing that the applicant countries must foot the bill for all of this additional support, while the Swedish Government wants the EU budget to be responsible for a large proportion of this money. This proposal from the Commission looked to be winning the support of member countries on Monday evening. Dinkelspiel will meet the EU ministers for negotiations today. But yesterday evening it was still unclear whether the meeting will lead to any further agreements. The two sides are close to an agreement on tourists' duty-free alcohol allowances and other regulations covering travelers. On Monday evening the EU countries agreed to give the applicant countries two alternatives for how long they are to be allowed to limit the import of alcohol and tobacco on which tax has already been paid. Either a four-year transitional period with no possibility of extension or a two-year transitional period with a review thereafter which could make an extension possible -- on the lines of the so-called Danish model. This offer will be put to Finland today in a so-called minipackage, which will also include summer cottages, Aland, and the ferries which sail between Sweden and Finland. Yesterday evening it was unclear whether the proposal on regulations covering travelers will also be raised in the Swedish negotiations.
