Among the three areas, negotiations on automobiles and auto parts have been laggard compared with progress made in the areas of government procurement and insurance, thus producing speculation that an agreement in this area will be delayed until sometime after July. According to the top official, negotiations are now focused on the issue of "objective criteria" which is the common issue for all areas, and it has become likely that "the negotiations will proceed in one set" [preceding two words in English]. Director-level meetings in the auto sector on 2 and 3 June are due to be followed by vice-ministerial talks between Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice-minister for international trade and industry, and Jeffrey Garten, under secretary for international trade, on 9 June.
