FR941130-0-00117 FR941130-0-00016 Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking In addition to the changes made to part 682 based on public comment on the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary has revised the regulations to include changes made by the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;382), enacted subsequent to publication of the notice of proposed rulemaking. It is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. However, since these changes merely incorporate statutory changes into the regulations, public comment could have no effect. Therefore, the Secretary has determined pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) that public comment on the regulations is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. Executive Order 12866 These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. The potential costs associated with these regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering the Title IV, HEA programs effectively and efficiently. In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of these regulations justify the costs. The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. Assessment of Educational Impact In the NPRM, the Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed regulations would require transmission of information that is being gathered by, or is available from, any other agency or authority of the United States. Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, the Department has determined that the regulations in this document do not require transmission of information that is being gathered by, or is available from, any other agency or authority of the United States.
