But the mission headed by Ambassador Yasue Katori emphasized the need for "transparency and accountability" in implementing official development assistance (ODA) extended to the Philippines. Hideaki Ueda, a member of the mission, said reports of corruption in the use of ODA in the Philippines have triggered criticism in Japan. He said, however, no particular case was discussed during the talks. Japan is the Philippine's biggest foreign donor, providing 37 percent or about 2 billion dollars of all ODA to the country last year. In a joint press statement, the mission also said the philippines should continue to further "self-help efforts," particularly in the areas of tax reform and agrarian reform. It also expressed Japan's desire for the Philippines to "pay full consideration to the environment impact of development projects." Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo said the Philippines responded by expressing its intention to continue "self-help efforts," particularly in raising counterpart funds related to ODA projects. Manila also said it "recognized the need for greater transparency and accountability in the implementation of ODA" and pointed to parallel efforts toward environmental conservation. The two sides agreed that future Japanese assistance will be channeled to economic infrastructure, support for the restructuring of industries and development of agriculture, poverty alleviation and environment conservation. The mission also expressed support for grass-roots projects in these fields. Ueda said the philippines will be a major recipient of future Japanese aid but could not say how much of Tokyo's 70-75 billion dollar outlay for 1993-1997 Manila would be getting. He also said an early agreement between the Philippines and the International Monetary Fund would make discussions on future assistance easier but said this was not a "precondition" for the grant of Japanese ODA.
