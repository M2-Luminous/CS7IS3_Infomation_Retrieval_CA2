The law will come into force within a year. Under the revisions, the employment of Japanese lawyers by foreign lawyers is still not permitted, but Japanese and foreign lawyers will be permitted, under certain conditions, to set up joint practices. The revisions also ease the strict reciprocity which prevailed till now, allowing the Justice Ministry to use its discretion in accrediting foreign lawyers. The revisions ease the number of years of experience required to gain accreditation, and allow foreign law firms to operate under their own names in Japan. The United States and the European Union have criticized restrictions Japan places on the activities of foreign lawyers as against the principle of free competition.
