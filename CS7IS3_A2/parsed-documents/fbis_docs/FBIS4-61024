At a press conference in Vilnius Monday [2 May], Jursenas said he is glad that "one more Baltic state will be free of a foreign army." The parliament chairman noted, however, that the agreements signed last Saturday in Moscow are not as good as "wanted by Latvia and us." Jursenas said his reservation primarily concerns a permission for Russia to keep its radar base in Skrunda for another several years, although "forward movement is impossible without compromises." Jursenas criticized Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the rightist opposition in the Lithuanian parliament, for calling Latvia the weakest Baltic link that was broken by Russia. The parliament chairman said it is unethical to "criticize a sister of one fate in such a way and to call her names." Jursenas also praised the first all-race election in the "far-away" South Africa. He said the election buried the apartheid system, which has completely discredited itself in the course of years. The South African election was observed by Lithuanian Parliament Vice Chairman Aloyzas Sakalas.
