In the light, portable variant, they were one or several tanks with a flammable mixture that are connected to a nozzle shaped like a gun. The pressure required to discharge the flammable mixture was created either using compressed gas or a powder charge. The shortcomings of this type of flamethrower are obvious. Their combat employment has been associated with a series of difficulties and limitations. Today, we are familiarizing our readers with a new generation of flamethrower -- the capsule flamethrower. The "Shmel" [Bumblebee] Rocket Infantry Flamethrower is designed to destroy enemy protected firing positions, disable lightly-armored vehicles, create fires and blind the enemy using the smoke of fire points. "Shmel" was accepted into the inventory in 1984; series production began a year earlier. The flamethrower is in the inventory of special flamethrower subunits and also in the inventory of the airborne assault troops, naval infantry, and combined arms subunits. "Shmel" underwent serious testing in Afghanistan where it was utilized as a close combat weapon. By way of illustration, if an artillery projectile made a hole in a wall, "Shmel's" thermobaric munition destroyed the wall to its foundation. The flamethrower demonstrated high effectiveness while suppressing firing points in bunkers-caves, etc. Today, a flamethrower is a multipurpose weapon that is capable of not only destroying using high temperature and pressure but it can also lay a smoke screen which permits the crew to change position. Incidentally, under average weather conditions the length of the impenetrable smoke screen created by one round is from 55 to 90 meters. It is interesting that the flamethrower can be utilized even for peaceful purposes. They plan to study the possibility of employing "Shmel" to combat snow avalanches, slush, or ice jams near bridges. Experts think that "Shmel's" thermobaric munition permits it to accomplish these missions. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Technical Specifications of the "Shmel" Rocket Infantry Flamethrower | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Firing range, m |1,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Aimed Range, m |600 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Weight of the flamethrower, kg |11 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Length, mm |920 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Weight of the thermobaric flammable m-|2.1 | |ixture, kg | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Weight of the incendiary mixture, kg |2.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Weight of the incendiary-smoke mixtur-|2.3 | |e, kg | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Number of flamethrowers in a pack, un-|2 | |its | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Crew |1 man | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Weight of the pack, kg |22 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
