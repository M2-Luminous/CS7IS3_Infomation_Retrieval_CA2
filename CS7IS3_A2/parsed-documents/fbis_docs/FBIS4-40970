FBIS4-40970 "drsov120cc_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-120 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 INTERREGIONAL AFFAIRS ITAR-TASS Carries Press Review for 22 Jun 94 ITAR-TASS Carries Press Review for 22 Jun 94 LD2206064094 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 0618 GMT 22 Jun 94 LD2206064094 Moscow ITAR-TASS English BFN ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] [Text] Moscow June 22 TASS -- The Moscow-based press focuses on the 53rd anniversary of Nazi Germany's attack on the Soviet Union, opinion polls taken among Muscovites on attitude to it, and carries reports on Russia's Federation Council decision to bring Russian peacekeepers to the area of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, the forthcoming signing of the framework document of NATO's Partnership-for-Peace Programme in Brussels on Wednesday, on growing unemployment in St. Petersburg, and comments on presidential anti- crime decrees. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) runs an article headlined "The Memories of June 22, 1941, Prompt Us To Keep Our Powder Dry". "However bitter it sounds but we ourselves in many respects provoked the enemy into attacking. Not by aggressiveness or by plans of a preventive strike against Germany, as our foes maintain, but by our unpreparedness, lack of mobilisation, and, to quote Marshal A.M. Vasilevskiy, by fear to cross the line which separates normal caution from a criminal expectations. "Herein is the major lesson of June 22, 1941. This is where history merges with contemporaneity and the events of the past with the most pressing present-day problems of the Russian state and its armed forces". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA also carries an article on the tragedy of Soviet intelligence service whose reports that Germany was going to attack the USSR on June 22 neither Stalin nor his entourage believed. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI runs a series of articles on the subject of the tragic and heroical days of the beginning of the war. According to the findings of an opinion poll taken the newspaper's correspondent nowadays among people on Moscow streets from various age and social groups of the population about their attitude to the anniversary, young people said that, in their view, the Soviet Union's and Russia's contribution to the victory over Hitler and German fascism is being belittled in the West nowadays, while their parents are now more preoccupied with problems of survival and feeding their rather politicised children". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA states that the aggregate number of people who were killed or died during the Great Patriotic War is 43.3 million. "Stalin was preparing an attack on Hitler, and the latter, unknowingly forestalled him by weeks if not days... "Should Stalin get his blow in first, the course and outcome of the war would not have changed. The war remained unjust for Stalin and his top entourage who practised expansion and perpetrated many crimes against their own people and the whole of mankind". The newspaper also runs excerpts from verbatim report about the Fuehrer's remarks under the headline "Adolf Hitler: `When We Shall Assimilate Russian Expanses..." KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Bismarck's grandson, Count Heinrich von Einsiedel-- a German ace pilot who was shot down in the skies over Stalingrad and taken prisoner. While in captivity he became the vice-president of the National Committee Free Germany. "Hitler was a great misfortune for the German people and Stalin constituted the same for the Russian people and the peoples of the Soviet Union. The two made up a critical mass which lead to the outbreak of war. Among other things, Hitler's guilt is that he, resorting to a venture by attacking the Soviet Union, made Stalin the savior of mankind, although, of course, it was the Soviet people who saved the world," Count von Einsiedel said in the interview. TRUD singles out a commentary by Stanislav Shatalin, academic secretary of the Russian Academy of Sciences' Department of Economics and president of the Reform Foundation, on the latest decrees issued by President Boris Yeltsin. Shatalin said "the decrees attained their goal, stirring the lop [as received] of economic stagnation in which Russia has found itself. However, the untargeted nature and ambiguity of a number of positions gave rise to contradictory opinions about the expediencey and effectiveness of the decrees. "As far as the government is concerned, although it constantly states of late that it has an economic programme, still there are so far no strategy or tactics of reforms that would be understandable to the people. Without that, it is not very logical to issue a series of decrees to this effect," he said. Shatalin believes that the government, not the president, should be the initiator of reforms. PRAVDA singles out a report on mounting unemployment in St. Petersburg and on the current auctioning of enterprises there cheaply to foreign firms. The Svetlana Amalgamation, which was once the country's largest enterprise and the pride of national electronic instrument-making, is now up for sale. The government newspaper ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA -- reports that the names of millions of co-citizens -- servicemen, partisans, members of the volunteer corps, and underground fighters -- will be entered in an all-Russia book of memory which is to be published by the 50th anniversary of the victory. The book will consist of 700 volumes which are to be turned over for perpetual storage to the Poklonnaya hill memorial complex. -- Frontpages a statement by Aleksandr Belyakov, governor of Leningrad region, that Russian governors will "insist on a meeting with President Boris Yeltsin in the coming days" to set out their views on ways to take the country's economy out of the crisis. -- Laments that the recent working visit by Russian parliamentary delegation, led by State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin, to Germany, "was passed over in silence" by German news media. -- Points out that Hungarian-made medicines produced by the Gedeon Richter plant may disappear from sale in Russia's drug stores in view of an instruction issued by the Russian Ministry of Health in March that medicines that appear on sale in Russia should undergo quality tests. The Hungarian enterprise is not against yet another series of tests of its medicines but the Ministry did not yet establish a network of laboratories to enact its decision.
