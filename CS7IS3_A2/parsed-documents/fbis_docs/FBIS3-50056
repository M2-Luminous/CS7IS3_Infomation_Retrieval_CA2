The recently approved electoral law does not give this opportunity to members of national minorities in Hungary. Our correspondent Gregor Martin Papucek reports from Budapest: [Begin Papucek recording] The consultative body--also called a minority roundtable--of 13 enthnic groups who enjoy minority status in Hungary decided at its meeting in Budapest today to make a last attempt to resolve the question of direct and independent representation of minorities in the parliament. Michal Mata, the executive chairman of the Union of Slovaks in Hungary, who was present at the meeting, told me that the participants in the roundtable no longer nurtured high hopes. Nonetheless, they will write a letter to the president, prime minister, and the parliamentary speaker. They will also ask a parliamentary deputy to open up the whole problem again in the National Assembly and convey views and proposals of the representatives of the minorities. [passage omitted] The minorities roundtable will thus make another attempt to engage in talks with representatives of parliamentary parties. It makes no secret of the fact that it wants to lobby in order to change the current electoral law. If this endeavor brings no results the minorities are prepared to appeal to international institutions. This is the united view of all participants in the roundtable. True, they would prefer the issue to be resolved at home. But as Michal Mata told me, the minorities roundtable is not willing to accept any solution other then a direct and independent representation of national and ethnic groups in the parliament. Thus some kind of a council for minorities or an ombudsman especially for minorities issues does not come into consideration. This would amount to very little. Such attempts at seeking a solution outside of parliament have recently gained strength in political circles. [end recording]
