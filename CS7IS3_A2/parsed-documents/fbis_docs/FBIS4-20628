This is a part of STA's policy aimed at a substantial buildup of ASCA (Asian Scientific Cooperation Association), an organization consisting of various countries' ministers of science. Moreover, in addition to pursuing as a part of an ASCA project the construction of researchers' international networks, a project which STA launched early this year, STA will hold an ASCA seminar in March in Japan. The seminar will be attended by experts from the various countries involved. The objectives of the information center are to gather and make available data produced by research organizations and researchers of various countries so that they may provide useful information for those recommending international joint research projects or those drawing up government policies. The installation of the information center will not be officially decided until this fall when the ASCA members will assemble in the Philippines for the 13th ASCA meeting. In substance, however, STA plans to start the center's activities prior to that meeting and has begun collecting the following basic data: (1) catalogs of various countries' research organizations; and (2) trends of various countries' science policies. Moreover, at the forthcoming meeting in the Philippines, STA will propose as an ASCA undertaking the global research network project, which was started early this year, with STA playing a central role, as part of Japan's effort to build a network linking research organizations both here and abroad. The first task of this project will be to gather global environmental fluctuation data, including precipitations, vegetation, and oceans, in cooperation with research organizations in Asia. After the initial data gathering has been completed, STA's plan is to propose additional themes for the areas of life science and materials. In the meantime, ASCA seminars, with the participation of experts from various Asian countries, will be held beginning this year. The first two seminars will be held in March, in Saitama Prefecture's Ohmiya City and in Tokyo. The themes will be "Science and Technology and Regional Technical Innovations" and "Use and Control of Microorganisms in Asia," respectively. ASCA draws participants from 24 countries, including China, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, and New Zealand. Each year, alternately a cabinet rank officials' meeting or an administrators' meeting is held.
