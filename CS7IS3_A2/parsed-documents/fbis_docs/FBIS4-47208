In the press department of the president of Kazakhstan, they have said that the summit meeting will from all indications take place in early July. Some observers conjecture on this basis that the sides are attempting to use the intervening time to remove a number of problems related to the package of Russian-Kazakhstani "military" agreements, in particular Moscow's leasing of Baykonur and the Saryshagan exercise grounds in Zhezkazgan Oblast. Negotiations concerning the fate of the latter facility were recently conducted in the "capital" of the exercise grounds--the city of Priozersk--by Deputy Prime Minister Abilsiitov and Russian Air Defense Commander Prudnikov. It is also likely that President Nazarbayev's recent speech in our parliament and his promises to review the Law on Languages concerning the status of the Russian language, and most important--more vigorous "gestures" concerning the Eurasian idea in Kazakhstan and beyond--are compelling Moscow to make adjustments on the fly in its position on the question of dual citizenship. At the same time, very interesting events have been occurring in the country's domestic political life. The first "salvo" of personnel rearrangements and reorganizations of government structures has been followed by a second. Creation of Minneftegazprom [Ministry of the Petroleum and Gas Industry] can rightly be considered the most powerful of those "shots." In the opinion of certain well-informed people, this step, suggested long ago by the logic of the oil intrigue's development, signifies an attempt by the central authorities to tighten control over this priority extractive industry. This was practically unattainable in the structure of the previous Minenergoprom [Ministry of Energy Industry], since the newly founded oil corporations, concerns and joint ventures [JV], which at the moment are working mainly for the future, were constantly "tripping over" the coal and power industry people with their needs of the moment, which does not make them any the less urgent. It would seem that Minneftegazprom, as conceived by the new structure's creators, will make it possible to "resuscitate" oil exploration. The difficulties experienced by geology today are well known after all. The very identity of the new minister--former director of the JV TengizChevroil--is also notable. Now that he is in that position, the American partners of the Atyrau petroleum workers will feel considerably more confident.... At the same time, some people also see the purely political aspects of the ministry's creation. It is worth recalling, for example, that in the past the present head of the Russian Government was in command of this very industry. As for Ravil Cherdabayev's service record, it offers every basis for such comparisons: deputy chairman of the Guryev Oblast Executive Committee, first deputy head of the oblast administration, deputy general director of the production association Tengizneftegaz. And to top it all off--candidate of economic sciences, which is very significant in the context of the shortage of economists on the Olympus of executive government. As for the rest of the country's energy complex, we can take a page from the classics and repeat: Its future is both empty and dark. Judging from the present trend, bringing the power and coal industries under a common sectoral ministry will no longer save the decrepit colossus. Many informed people are inclined to see this as the explanation of why Albert Salamatin, former minister of industry, refused to head Minenergougleprom [Ministry of Power and Coal Industry]. Although, from what specialists say, this man accomplished quite a bit while "sitting" in the Minprom [Ministry of Industry]. And his departure, which at first seemed somewhat strange, to head the Zhezkazgan Oblast administration is by all appearances related to the government's desire to "restore order" in our copper "economy." Incidentally, now that we are speaking about heads. The rumor that sprang up early last week that they would soon become members of the Cabinet of Ministers (see ABV, No. 51) seems not be unfounded. The "purge of the ranks" before "entry" into the government helps to explain the simultaneous replacement of three "governors." We should mention that a similar precedent occurred only at the end of last year, when four oblast hakims were simultaneously removed for various reasons. The striking thing now is that the head of government has removed his deputies in regions with the poorest economic situation (and in the case of East Kazakhstan Oblast [VKO], this applies to the political situation as well). In that same VKO prices of goods and services have quadrupled in the last year and a half, and it takes seven minimum wages to buy the food necessary for elementary survival. Nearly fifty enterprises have been shut down (partially or completely). And all of this against the background of intensifying demands of the population for the region's autonomy, for activation of the Cossacks, and similar sociopolitical ferment. It is not surprising that inhabitants of Rudnyy Altay are more and more frequently inclined to blame all their troubles on the local administration, and probably indirectly on the higher-ups in the executive government. In that context, replacing Amangelda Bektemisov with Yuriy Lavrinenko is apparently supposed to cool off the passions somewhat, since the VKO belongs to the so-called "Russophone" regions. Another question: How long is the inability of the authorities (both local and central) to protect the social welfare of their subjects going to be covered up with ethnic compromises? Last week's retirement of Zaura Kadyrova, minister of social security, proved that this is by no means a rhetorical question. No proof is needed for anyone with even a superficial familiarity with the mores and traditions of the Kazakhstan political elite: This act has no precedent in our homeland. And that also goes for the former minister's interview in the Saturday issue of the government newspaper. The reproaches which Mrs. Kadyrova addressed to the Cabinet of Ministers as a whole and to the finance ministry in particular are quite serious. The latter is essentially accused of having spent up the resources of the pension fund ("2.2 billion rubles were sold to commercial structures at low rates of exchange"). The former minister also made a very significant appeal to the deputies: "I hope that the parliament will restore the pension fund from the budget. It must not be involved in commerce in the true sense of that word." If these hopes are justified, then, in the opinion of many, there will be occasion to speak of the beginning of a government crisis in Kazakhstan. After all, most of the recently elected deputies (as well as their predecessors) are seriously (more or less, of course) concerned with "protecting the interests of the voters." And on 7 March the pensioners were hardly the most vigorous participants in the election. Thus, the "people's choices" have a 100 percent chance of "scoring points" with their constituents. Judging by certain steps taken in the past by our parliamentarians, they will try not to miss that opportunity.
