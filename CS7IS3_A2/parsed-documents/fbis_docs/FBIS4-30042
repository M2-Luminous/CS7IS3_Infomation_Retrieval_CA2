He told parliament on Monday the government had no intention of folding PAL and, pending approval of the government budget, it will receive 1.5 million tala (520,000 US dollars). This would be the government's first direct cash injection for the airline that so far has been funded by government-guaranteed international loans. In April Treasury Department financial secretary Sala Epa Tuioti said PAL had a debt equivalent to about 26 percent of the government's income, posing a threat to the state. He estimated PAL's total debt to be 45.2 million tala. The size of the debt made it "highly unlikely that any commercial lender would offer to make PAL a loan" even with a government guarantee, he said. PAL deputy general manager Muliagatele Gina Moore said Monday the April Treasury report had been a distortion. "Unfortunately this leak has caused substantial damage to Polynesian's reputation at a time when substantial benefits to the economy from tourism and air cargo are just beginning to be felt," she said. She said passenger levels from North American and Australia were at all time highs and its assets were substantial.
