The establishment of a united government implies that Kampuchea entered a new era of peaceful reconstruction. In more than two decades of war chaos, Kampuchea's numerous industries withered and the masses live in dire poverty. The economic base is entirely weak and it will still take a relatively long time to recover pre-war levels. Although this is the case, many people still harbor full confidence that Kampuchea's economy will recover as soon as possible. Some Asian businessmen and investors are sending troops to the Kampuchean market. Singapore had a rather early start in investment in Kampuchea. As early as 1987, with government auth ority Singaporean businessmen began business with some private companies which had special permission from the former Phnom Penh government. By the first half of 1991, Singapore had replaced the former Soviet Union to become Kampuchea's largest trade partner; bilateral Singaporean-Kampuchean trade reached S$330 million, up 38.5 percent over 1990. Singapore exports to Kampuchea petroleum, automobiles, beverages, machinery and electrical products. Kampuchea sells to Singapore rubber, wood, dried fish and rattan products. At present the most luxurious four-star hotel in Phnom Penh, the Jin Baodian Hotel, is a joint venture of a private Singaporean company and the Kampuchean government tourism bureau. It officially opened in 1991 with an investment of S$40 million [Singapore dollars]. Thailand is Kampuchea's greatest investor. Thai businessmen were among the earliest to send troops to Kampuchean markets under the Thai government's strategic policy of encouraging "transformation of Indochina's battlefields into commercial markets." Kampuchean-Thai border trade began as early as the early 1980s, and by the end of the decade the area became Kampuchea's most open and free border trade area. In 1988 Thai-Kampuchean bilateral trade was only $600,000. In 1991 it was $16 million. In 1992 it leapt to $160 million, a nine-fold increase. In the first quarter of 1993, bilateral trade was $183 million. Among Kampuchea's foreign investors, Thai businessmen head the list. Through the end of 1993, Thai enterprises invested in Kampuchea 10 billion baht (approximately $400 million). According to official Kampuchean statistics, between 1989 and April 1992, when the former Phnom Penh government promulgated foreign investment laws, 79 of 300 approved foreign investment projects were from Thailand, or 26.3 percent. At present there are approximately 43 Thai companies investing in plants in Kampuchea. Japan is another of Kampuchea's most important investors. Japanese businessmen are very interested in Kampuchea's abundant forests. At present Kampuchea's largest wood product processing plant was jointly built by Japan and Kampuchea's ministry of agriculture at an investment of $5.5 million; annual wood output is 100,000 cubic meters. In recent years, Japanese-Kampuchean bilateral trade has rapidly increased, of which, Japanese exports to Kampuchea have increased particularly fast. In 1990, Japan's total commodity exports to Kampuchea were $5 million; increasing to $7 million in 1991, and jumped to $230 million in 1992, a more than 31-fold increase. Hong Kong businessmen are relatively keen to set up hotels and restuarants in Kampuchea. Hong Kong trade with Kampuchea is primarily en trepot; motorcycles and industrial machinery are the main export commodities. In 1992, Hong Kong's gross exports were at HK $170 million, a more than triple increase over 1991; imports from Kampuchea totalled HK$4.42 million, up 1.8 times over 1991. Through April 1992, there were 59 projects in Kampuchea using Hong Kong investment capital, or 20 percent of all of Kampuchea's foreign investment. In addition, France is striving to return to Kampuchea. French businessmen deal mainly in food products, tobacco, alcohol and clothing. In 1991, French-Kampuchean bilateral trade was at $7 million; by 1992, it increased to $16 million. French companies anticipated the return of King Sihanouk at the end of 1991, and contracted to repair the palace. They also undertook printing new Kampuchean currency. Through April 1992, French capital was invested in 61 Kampuchean projects, or 20.3 percent of all foreign investment projects. One businessmen after another from other western and eastern alliance countries and regions and Taiwan have gone to Kampuchea to study investment and trade there, although very few have succeeded. Studying the reasons, besides a still unstable political situation and overly backward infrastructure, the Kampuchean government has too many and too strict constraints on foreign investment. For example, it stipulates foreign investors shall not engage in independent trade. Foreigners are not permitted to engage independently in real estate or most construction projects. The government also stipulates a 15 percent mandatory tax on repatriated surplus profits on foreign investments in Kampuchea. According to official Kampuchean information, more than 30 foreign investment banks have been allowed to be established, although only 18 really have gone into operation since there now is no clear economic recovery. Furthermore, the banking industry only transfers accounts, has cash accounts or opens letters of credit. Temporarily, permission has not been given for credit financing. In sum, Kampuchea is an attractive market, but people are still waiting to see whether it can become a new Southeast Asian investment hot spot.
