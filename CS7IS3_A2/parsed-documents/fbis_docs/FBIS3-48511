Korea has difficulties because advanced countries are reluctant to transfer sophisticated technologies for fear of the so-called boomerang effect. The ministry will invite scientists with doctorates and more than five years of research experience, but will waive its standards for scientists with remarkable achievements on a global scale. The scientists will be given air fares, moving costs in addition to their salaries, which are higher than they are receiving in their countries of residence. The ministry hopes to develop the level of science and research under momentum of internationalization, the spokesman said.
