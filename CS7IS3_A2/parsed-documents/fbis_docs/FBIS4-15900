Chief negotiator Djaba Ioseliani told the Georgian radio on Wednesday that the Georgian plan envisages the deployment in the zone of conflict of up to 2,500 UN servicemen. They are to take under control the Russian-Abkhazian border along the Psou River, all mountain passes connecting Abkhazia with the North Caucasus. Peacekeepers are also to be deployed in Sukhumi, Gudauta, Leselidze, the Kodori canyon and along the Inguri River. The Georgian side plans to locate the UN headquarters in Sukhumi. Meanwhile, the Abkhazian side, said Ioseliani, continues insisting on the deployment of peacekeepers along the confrontation line on the Inguri River. I do not know how the talks will proceed, but our plan was approved by the UN and Russian representatives, said Ioseliani. He also said that according to the Russian side the deployment of 2,500 peacekeepers would not be an adequate number. The talks in Geneva continue on April 13.
