Whereas, EO No. 115, dated 24 July 1993, was issued to raise much-needed revenues to finance government infrastructure projects and social services programs; and, Whereas, the legislative and the executive departments have identified legislative and executive measures to replace the oil levy under EO No. 115. Now, therefore, I, Fidel V. Ramos, president of the Republic of the Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the Constitution, and the authority granted to me under Section 401 of Presidential Decree No. 1464 as amended, do hereby order or ordain: Section 1: Reduction of the special duty. The P [Philippine pesos] 1.90 special duty on imported crude oil falling under HS [expansion unknown] Heading No. 27.09, and the P2.00 special duty on imported oil products falling under HS Heading No. 27.10 and 27.11, prescribed under EO No. 115 Series of 1993 and listed in Annex A thereof, are hereby reduced by P0.95 and P1.00 per liter, respectively, effective 1 January 1994. Section 2: Repealing clause. All executive orders, rules, and regulations inconsistent with this executive order are hereby modified, amended, or repealed accordingly. This executive order shall take effect after 30 days following the completion of its publication in two national newspapers of general circulation. Done in the city of Manila, this 23d day of February, in the year of our Lord, 1994. Signed Fidel V. Ramos, by the president, Teofisto Guingona, executive secretary. In effect, this lifts the P1.00 levy. And my statement in connection with this decision is as follows: I have decided today to lift the P1.00 oil levy effective 1 January 1994. I make this momentous decision in consideration of the plight of our people; their welfare has the top priority in our programs of government. But I also want to tell you that this decision challenges all of us to exert extraordinary individual and national effort to overcome our recurring resources problems for good. Progress and development have a cost to be paid. When the family budget for business is reduced, the business suffers before fresh funds come in to replenish -- and so it is with our national development. According to our best estimates, the lifting of the P1.00 levy will mean the delay of vital projects that could have generated 100,000 jobs, the deferment of the construction of some 5,000 schoolhouses, and the possible cancellation of some other vital infrastructure projects. But we can make do without the P1.00 levy as long as recurring alternative sources of revenue come in. This decision also challenges us to strengthen our solidarity, for the real adversaries are poverty and injustice. And in the long run, what is paramount is that we lift the lives of our people so that they will have more job opportunities, better education, and a more healthful condition. The seeds of increased unity have already been manifested in the wake of this urgency. We joined hands to address the problems of the day: The joint government-KRB [Kilusang Rollback -- Rollback Movement] committee working together in a genuine spirit of harmony despite differences; the executive and the legislative dialoguing patiently; the House and the Senate cooperating to enact needed measures; the businessmen and basic sectors helping each other; the NGO's [nongovernmental organizations] and government working hand-in-hand. So, let us continue this spirit of teamwork as we fight poverty and rebuild our beloved Philippines. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] By lifting, Sir, the P1.00 oil levy, does that mean that you have already chosen the recommendations of the joint committee as to what sourcing you will get the replacement for this oil levy? [Ramos] Yes, actually, we did not adopt everything in toto because there were other inputs that were derived from our patient, almost day-to-day dialogues with the Senate and the House, as well as other inputs coming from the public at large, because we also entertained them. And as we work on the combination of inputs during the last three days, we came out with the solution. Insofar as the joint recommendation of the joint committee -- which was submitted by Secretary Guingona together with Senator Herrera, who are the joint co-chairpersons -- the following items were inputted into the so-called alternative sources: The reduction by 5 percent in government maintenance, operating, and other expenses without impairing social services; the generation of revenues by executive action under the so-called alien legalization effort; the increase in the stock transaction tax; the increase in the annual registration of luxury vehicles and recreational vehicles and the like; a tariff on non-essential items, or so-called zero- tariff items; as well as the correction in the tax exemption of married couples. These were among the common recommendations of various sources -- including the joint government-KRB committee -- and also arising out of our meetings with the Senate and the House. [Unidentified correspondent] Will this be enough? The amount, Sir -- will this be enough to cover the P10.5 billion? [Ramos] As I mentioned in my statement, we can make do without the levy and recover some of the delays and setbacks in terms of still meeting the deadlines by the end of the year if the recurring alternative means will come in. That is why there are both executive actions which are one-time as well as recurrent and there are legislative measures that would ensure the recurrence of alternative sources of revenue. I will not mention anymore the other one-time sources, because these were inputted in the consideration of the 1994 proposed budget, such as privatization. [Unidentified correspondent] Thank you, Sir. [Unidentified correspondent] Good afternoon, Mr. President. Now that you announced the lifting of the oil levy, does this mean that a permanent oil price rollback is certain already? [Ramos] Yes, that comes automatically. We will go back to the previous price levels. [Unidentified correspondent] And that is effective when, Sir? [Ramos] Pardon? [Unidentified correspondent] That is effective today? [Ramos] Well, in other words, we go back to the levels of 28 January. Yeah, of course -- effective right now. [Unidentified correspondent] So, now that, uh... [Ramos, interrupting] That there will be no second wave, as some were speculating. [Word indistinct] it is the lifting of the one peso levy. [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, can you give us your reaction to the threats of militant labor groups who are against the tax measures proposed by the joint committee? They still feel that this will burden the poor and still threaten to stage protest actions towards the end of the month and on 1 March. [Ramos] The proposed tax measures are very progressive. For instance, the tax on luxury cars and the so-called affluent consumption. There's also one item I forgot to mention, because this came out of in a recent initiative, and this is the broadening of the value-added tax. Again, this is a progressive measure in that it is not intended to burden the lower classes. [Unidentified correspondent] Okay. Thank you, Sir. [Ramos] Now, on the aspect of militant groups wanting to demonstrate. I have been a demonstrator and rallyist myself during the EDSA [Epifanio de los Santos Avenue] revolution of 1986. So we can be comfortable with that, and we will know how to handle it peacefully. [passage omitted]
