The Agency also retained 26 companies as government-designated importers of wheat, barley and rye for the year that started Friday, they said. It was the first time in nearly a quarter of a century that the Agency accepted applications from firms other than designated importers to enter the rice import business. However, it approved none of the applications. Industry sources said a dozen nondesignated companies filed applications following Japan's agreement in December at the Uruguay Round of global trade talks to partially open its rice market. Under the designated agent system, established in 1957 when Japan was importing rice, the government imports the grain but consigns the actual importing to approved trading companies.
