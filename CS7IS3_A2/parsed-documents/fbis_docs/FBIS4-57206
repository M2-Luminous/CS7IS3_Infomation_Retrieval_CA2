Social Welfare Minister Alberto Cardenas was detained at the IESS headquarters by angry union leaders and workers who demanded his resignation. Cardenas presided over the meeting of IESS officials which culminated at noon with the removal of IESS Director General Italo Colamarco, accused of corruption and incompetence. While the two-hour meeting was being held, hundreds of IESS employees clashed in the streets of Quito with the police who, according to reporters, resorted to a "brutal repression." The clashes occurred in streets near the Zarzuela building in northern Quito, headquarters of the IESS General Directorate and Higher Council, which sustained heavy damage. Despite the presence of a large number of police, a group of IESS labor leaders and employees entered the building and reached the meeting room. They interrupted the meeting in which Jose Maria Aguirre, a close friend of the Ecuadoran president, was being sworn in as the new IESS director and seized the social welfare minister. Amid the confusion and the arguments with the government representatives in the Higher Council, the leaders demanded that Minister Cardenas submit his resignation. The minister replied he was willing to resign and "go home" if the IESS union leadership did the same and resigned immediately. Meanwhile, the street disturbances continued. The police used tear gas to control the demonstrators "with excessive force." The demonstrators responded by throwing sticks and rocks. According to reporters and union leaders, the incidents left at least 18 injured, some from firearms, and many persons under arrest. The Red Cross reported that the injured included two local reporters and a cameraman who were hit by rocks and blunt objects. The crisis in the IESS leadership intensified this week when Minister Cardenas and Colamarco accused each other of incompetence and corruption. The new scandal in the IESS led to Colamarco's removal. He was the fifth director in 21 months in the administration of conservative President Sixto Duran-Ballen. Cardenas, who took office as minister in January, said the removed official was an obstacle to the modernization and reorganization of the IESS. Union leaders say that Cardenas and the government are undertaking a campaign to discredit the IESS workers to bring about its bankruptcy and justify its privatization.
