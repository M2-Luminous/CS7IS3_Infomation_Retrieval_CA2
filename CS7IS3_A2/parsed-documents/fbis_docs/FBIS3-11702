FBIS3-11702 "drlat058_a_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-058 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Mar 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Officials Discuss Human Rights Issue FL2403200194 FL2403200194 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Havana Cuba Vision Network in Spanish at 0200 GMT on 24 March carries live its "Open Agenda" program with host Antonio Resillez and his guests Ambassador Eumelio Caballero, chief of the Foreign Ministry's multilateral department, and Ivan Mora, a specialist of the Foreign Ministry. Resillez begins the program by noting that many Cubans believe that the only thing discussed by the UN Human Rights Commission is the so-called Cuban case. He goes on to point out that the Human Rights Commission discusses other things related to political and social issues, such as child pornography, trafficking of children, etc. In that sense, Caballero says: "I am very happy that this has been brought up in this program for our viewers -- the work carried out by the Human Rights Commission. I myself have sometimes had the perception that the Human Rights Commission is related to the Cuban case only, when that is only a small part of the work that our delegation does in Geneva." In reviewing some of the issues discussed at the Human Rights Commission, Mora says: "Cuba is not sitting on the stand as a defendant regarding Human Rights. When we talk about human rights we must talk about human rights violations that are taking place around the world." Mora goes on to say: "Small countries, like Cuba, are developing different initiatives in defense of the interests of the World, the Third World, defending the interests of the greater populations of the Third World. Cuba has been making headway in this area every year. As a matter of fact, Cuba has received the recognition from the Third World for the sacrifices that Cuba has to face." Answering Resillez's question on how many propositions and resolutions Cuba participated in during the 50th session, Mora notes: "Cuba was the delegation that presented the largest number of initiatives at the 50th session. They totaled 10, six of which were discarded despite the large support by the Third World. Some were even adopted by consensus, such as the issue on the environment, which is an issue of great concern among many countries of the North as well as of the South. Cuba sponsored amendments to approximately 20 resolutions, and cosponsored another 25 resolutions." Mora goes on to say: "We are talking about space gained by Cuba on the international scene, which represents a great deal of respect in the international arena." Resillez asks about the vote on the special rapporteur for Cuba to which Caballero responds: "Something important happened at the session. The fact is that the United States, despite all its capacity to apply pressure and being the power that leads the unipolar world, lost three votes in favor while the number of abstentions rose from 15 to 20. In UN terms, this sends a message. This means that this year, the majority of the commission of 53 members was not dragged by the United States into this vendetta against Cuba. If we add the abstentions, of which there were 20, with the votes in favor of Cuba, in this case against the resolution, which totaled nine, this means that 29 countries, more than half, pronounced themselves against it. I believe this is significant because the United States reached the highest point it could reach on the manipulation of the issue against Cuba, and now the retreat has begun. That is the best reading or analysis." Resillez asks about reaction from other delegations to the secret U.S. Interest Section document. On this topic, Mora responds: "I believe this document favored the vote. In other words, it was an element that supported something we had been saying for several years, which is also recognized by the great majority of the members of the United Nations. The document caused a great deal of bewilderment among the U.S. delegation. It was a scandal where they had been caught red-handed in their action of condemning alleged human rights violations in Cuba, when it was demonstrated through the document that it was all a great lie." In that sense, Mora goes on to say that the document was important because it characterized those people and groups in the United States who are interested in subordinating the revolution to the will of the empire. Regarding the special rapporteur Caballero says: "The Cuban people should not feel complexes or be worried about the fact that there is a special rapporteur or that the Cuban case is on the agenda of the Human Rights Commission." He goes on to say: "The international community, including countries allied with the United States, understand that in Cuba there is no systematic violation or problem with human rights. That is well understood by the international community. Sometimes -- Ivan has seen this -- after voting against us many of these delegates approach us to excuse themselves and to say that they are sorry that they voted that way, but that they had been forced to do so. In other words, there is an understanding on the international arena that we do not have this type of problem in Cuba." Caballero adds: "The most important thing is that just a few days ago, in New York, the Latin American group endorsed Cuba's reelection to the Human Rights Commission." Answering Resillez's question on the group of Nobel Prize Winners who will visit Cuba, Mora remarks: "The Foreign Ministry is studying the composition of the group that will visit us. We reject the imposition of the special rapporteur since it was done violating all the procedures established by the United Nations, but at the same time we have absolutely nothing to hide. That is why we want international personalities, Nobel Prize winners, to see what our actual situation is. It will be a good opportunity for them to see the effects of the U.S. blockade against Cuba."
