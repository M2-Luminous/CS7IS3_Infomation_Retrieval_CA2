The final, decisive battle against this destructive phenomenon of our economy has been declared by the republic's Procuracy, the Chamber of Control, and the Internal Affairs and Security ministries. They have shed light on numerous alarming facts, which we present to readers today and will continue to in the future. Let everyone know who is involved in these filthy and destructive affairs that threaten to lay waste to the country. The criminal threesome took shape all of a sudden. It included D. Kinkladze, the chairman of Gori's Diadema Cooperative, E. Sulashvili, the head accountant of Tbilisi's Bagebi-92 Firm, and B. Leviashvili, a Gori resident of unknown occupation. In October-December 1992, they used false credit advices, tax orders, and expired limited checks to deposit 101 million rubles illegally in the account of a small business called Rkina-Betoni in the Gardabani Branch of Binsotsbank. However, they failed to steal the money, the crime was detected and the money was sequestered. The threesome's fantasy was even grander; they decided to create a commercial bank and obtained the support of National Bank President D. Dvalishvili and Georgian Rescue Corps Deputy Chairman G. Arveladze. Although the Argobank (that's what they decided to call it) did not have the money required by the capital fund or the necessary facilities, the former [Dvalishvili] readily registered it, and on the basis of a letter from Arveladze he granted it a billion rubles in credit for half a year, because it was supposedly part of the Rescue Corps. Of course, everything went according to the scenario: Argobank deposited funds in various companies and cooperatives; in return it obtained U.S. dollars and divvied them up. For their crime, Kinkladze and Sulashvili are in jail; Leviashvili fled to Moscow and is being sought. In the same spirit of the times, Irakli Shavliashvili, the general director of Trialeti Cooperative in Tbilisi, assumed the mantle of someone concerned about his country and sent a touching letter to the government in 1992: "Lend me two billion rubles after I deliver a ship full of sugar to Batumi Harbor." Attached to the letter was former Vice Premier P. Koguashvili's resolution directing the appropriate officials to issue a letter guaranteeing the loan. The boastful and hypocritical Shavliashvili, armed with the letter, actually obtained the Head of Government's resolution as well, ordering National Bank President Demur Dvalishvili to speed up the documentation and thus speed up the transaction. As always, Demur Dvalishvili did just what he was told. National Bank Vice President N. Pipia was also hasty, failing to realize that the credit was supposed to be issued after the sugar was delivered to Batumi, and he directed Industria-Bank Board Chairman Z. Gendzekhadze to issue a two-billion ruble loan to Trialeti. Shavliashvili was lying in wait, and on that same day he transferred 1.98 billion rubles to Moscow, where it was converted, and 4,541,863 U.S. dollars wound up in the Warsaw Branch of Amerbank. To this day no one knows what happened to the money and whether there is any real chance for the state to get it back. Shavliashvili was restless, and like a spider he spun new webs of deceitful manipulation. He signed agreements with Tbilisi firms such as Guri, Medasi, Lasha, and Bani and Company, such that these companies deposited 2.618 billion rubles in Trialeti. Naturally, these firms had obtained the money through state credits. In all the cases, the loans were issued for the purpose of bringing food into the republic. One bitter economist had this to say: "If food had really been brought in with the money which Georgia's banks loaned out, we would have enough for several years." People who have looked into it also say that the job shouldn't have been turned over to private persons, that the state ought to have a monopoly on it. Many also say that state banks ought not to grant loans to companies and cooperatives; that should be the commercial banks' job. It's certainly something to think about. Keep in mind also that bankers are profiting from it and have got rich. Readers probably want to know what happened to I. Shavliashvili. Irakli Shavliashvili and his associates, presidents Zaal Godadze and Akaki Berdzenishvili of Medasi and Petra, skipped the country after getting their hands on billions, and are now in hiding. The Security Ministry has been asked to help find their whereabouts. For years, money has been drained out of the National Bank by using a shabby, primitive trick--supposedly to bring food into the country. Because nothing was done to see that the money was spent as intended, sharpsters had a clear field and could easily turn credit into hard currency. In this way, a few people are getting rich while thousands and hundreds of thousands are getting poor. I. Iashvili, the President of Ika, is among those newly enriched. The National Bank granted 500 million coupons in his name. He, in turn, deposited the money in a firm called 002/1, from which he was supposed to receive food and industrial goods. In fact, however, he got what he was trying for--U.S. dollars. A. Adeishvili, chief of the Saketerzetmshenproekt Administration, also got in on the currency boom. He asked T. Sigua, the former chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers, and R. Gotsiridze, the former Vice Premier, for a loan of 1.2 billion rubles. His request did not use the notorious phrase "to acquire food"; he used a more original trick--the idea of bringing in fuel--and he promised to "help the citizens who had been cheated by the Imedi Firm." That is how he hooked the gullible. The President of the National Bank readily complied with R. Gotsiridze's resolution and authorized the state's commercial Agromretsvbank to issue the requested amount of the loan to the Administration. Adeishvili pulled another clever trick. He really did pay 88 million rubles to the citizens who had been cheated but used the rest of the money for his personal purposes; an investigation is underway. There have been some particularly alarming cases of fraud owing to the National Bank's encouragement. The president of its creative firm Saburtalo-93 is G. Lomidze, who ought to earn a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for it. To be more specific, G. Lomidze wrote an authorization and from the National Bank's Clearing Center he took 10 million coupons' worth of transfer documents to the Borzhomi Branch of Binsotsbank, in which he had opened an account. He put an 8 in front of the 10 million coupons to yield the enormous sum of 810 million coupons. The Borzhomi doughheads "failed to notice" the inserted number (in such documents, you know, the amount is also written in words) and gave him the whole amount. By a prior arrangement, the swindler transferred 800 million to the account of the Forvard Brokerage Firm on the Caucasian Stock Exchange. The purpose this time, again, was a "noble" one--to bring food in for hungry people, although that was the furthest thing from the so-called president's mind. The greedy and vengeful G. Lomidze pocketed 11,300 dollars. In turn, Forvard set up its next lightning swindle: along with three other brokerage firms on the Caucasian Exchange it carried out another 800-million-ruble commodityless transaction, causing a considerable loss to the state. But that wasn't the end of G. Lomidze's fraudulent odyssey. This time, he got his hands on documents transferring 19 million coupons to various organizations. Using the same old method, he put a 7 in front of that number. Again, the personnel of Borzhomi's Agrobank were gullible enough to give him 719 million coupons. At Lomidze's request, 700 million coupons were deposited in the account of a company called Sameba--naturally, for the purpose of buying food. Then, as a result of an unauthorized deal between that firm and Saburtalo-93, he pocketed 10,000 dollars, but distributed 19 million coupons to three firms for the intended purpose. In this way, Lomidze easily got his hands on 1.5 billion coupons. A comment: It has been determined that the blank passport with which G. Lomidze acted had been stolen along with some others from the passport desk of Tbilisi Vakskiy Rayon's Internal Affairs Department, and criminal proceedings have been instituted. The firms mentioned above, moreover, were doing their financial dealings without being registered with the Tax Inspectorate. Nobody checked on their activities, which is why they were able to operate so successfully. Now let's look at the "heroic deeds" of the firm called Andria, and its President V. Kavtelidze. It is located in Tbilisi's Vakskiy Rayon. This executive had no trouble getting things going, obtaining a 1.5-billion-ruble loan from Tbilisi's Samepo Bank. He was also motivated by "good intentions"--bringing food in for the hungry people. Kavtelidze distributed the funds this way: he transferred one-third to various firms in order to appropriate them later. In fact, he pocketed 37,500 dollars instead of buying food. He transferred the remaining billion to a company called Berika for "commercial purposes." In fact, he was merely slaking his lust and readily sacrificed his country and its people. We could talk endlessly about the National Bank's anti-national policy. Other banks are guilty of the same, including rayon-level banks. The Shulaveri Woolen Mill obtained a loan of 2.75 billion coupons from Marneuli's Agrobank. The entire sum (supposedly to procure wool) was transferred to Tbilisi's Kristal-LKG Corporation, which in turn deposited it in the account of a firm called Kapital-Plus "to buy food with." A. Lysenko, the General Director of Kapital-Plus, added it to other monies and transferred more than 1.5 billion coupons to seven brokerage firms on the Caucasian Stock Exchange, again "to buy food." In fact, however, he obtained and pocketed 27,432 U.S. dollars. As a result of a commodityless transaction of about 11,000 dollars, the Tatishvili Brothers' Mukhranis Veli Company issued it for "meat that was procured"; in fact, nobody procured a single kilogram of meat. This is not the only commodityless transaction by the Tatishvilis, along with other crimes. G. Galidava, the president of the firm called Uta, and his bookkeeper K. Chachua, established contact with that criminal gang through G. Gogsadze, a broker on the Caucasian Stock Exchange. They deposited 380 million out of 500 million coupons borrowed from the bank, supposedly to buy meat; instead, they acquired 7,500 U.S. dollars. Now the Tatishvilis' depredations are at an end; they are in custody. The same fate has befallen other criminals who were in league with them. G. Dolidze, the President of the KG Benevolent Corporation in Telavi, has shown himself to be an outstanding swindler and money-grubber. Using false tax orders and limited checks, he managed to deposit over two billion rubles in the Telavi, Signakhi, and Lagodekhi branches of Agromretsvbank, which he then transferred to various firms and corporations supposedly to acquire wine-making materials, but the deal fell apart, he was caught in the act, his hopes were dashed, and he got no dollars. V. Bilikhodze, the chairman of the Universali Cooperative in Ozurgeti, used false limited checks to steal 450 million rubles from the bank in a short time. Investigative agencies have also received information about the improper use of credit funds on a large scale by firms named Kvatakhevi, Gigi, Achiko and Company, and others. Other commercial outfits are also being investigated. After learning these facts, readers can easily see why our country is in such a predicament and why the treasury is empty. Some questions: What motivated the National Bank and other banks when issuing credit? Were they obligated to monitor the proper spending of the credit funds? And does the republic have a mechanism to provide that monitoring? Finally, what role is assigned to the republic's government and Finance Ministry in this regard? These questions are all of concern to anybody who cares about the country's fate. The Shavliashvilis, the Tatishvilis, the Lomidzes, the Kinkladzes, the Adeishvilis, and all the greedy people who stand behind them are ruining the country.
