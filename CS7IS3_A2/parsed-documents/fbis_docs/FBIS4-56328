Malan explained that U.S. Treasury bills were purchased as collateral for Brazil's external debt principal. The average unit price of the T-bills that will mature in 2021 and 2022 was $0.153 per dollar. The real cost of the transaction was not disclosed. Malan explained to the Senate Economic Affairs Committee that the securities were bought on the international secondary market after the U.S. Treasury's refusal to put out a special issue for Brazil as long as the country did not sign at least a short-term agreement with the IMF. As the purchase of such a volume of securities could have prompted much speculation and caused Brazil great losses, the BC bought them little by little in deals that were arranged with the utmost secrecy between December 1993 and March 1994. The purchases were made from top-notch institutions that usually operate with Brazil. It is not known how many banks -- Brazil does not operate with brokers -- participated in these transactions. Malan guaranteed that Brazil was not burdened with the payment of surcharges and commissions. The profit obtained by the sellers was based only on the difference between the purchase and selling price of the T-bills. Besides the $2.4 billion as collateral for the principal, Brazil had to disburse $373 million as collateral for interest. This latter amount was invested in bonds placed on the market that will yield semi-annual interest. The BC president told senators that Brazil will institute a more efficient management of its foreign exchange reserves. Now that an agreement with creditor banks has been reached, the country will not only be able to place reserves at higher interest rates, but also may repurchase and resell the T-bills that were issued on 15 April based on market quotations. With the exception of Senator Eduardo Suplicy (PT-SP) [Workers Party-Sao Paulo], the committee members at the hearing were satisfied with the agreement's terms.
