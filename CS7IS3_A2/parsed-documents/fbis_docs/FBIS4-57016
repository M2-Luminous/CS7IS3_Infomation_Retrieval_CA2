FBIS4-57016 "drlat092_b_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-092 Daily Report 11 May 1994 Haiti Jonassaint's 11 May Inaugural Address Jonassaint's 11 May Inaugural Address FL1205004694 Port-au-Prince Radio Nationale in French 1735 GMT 11 May 94 FL1205004694 Port-au-Prince Radio Nationale French BFN [Speech by Emile Jonassaint at his installation ceremony as "provisional president" at the Legislative Palace in Port-au-Prince on 11 May -- live; passages within quotation marks in Creole] [Text] Mr. President of the Senate of the Republic, Gentlemen Deputies, Honorable parliamentarians including both senators and deputies, dear colleagues of the Court of Cassation of the Republic and members of the judicial power, Mr. Commander in Chief of the Haitian Armed Forces, distinguished members of the High Command, Officers, Noncommissioned Officers, Soldiers, Ladies and Gentlemen Dignitaries of the State, Reverend representatives of the Episcopal Conference and the Protestant Church, Rosicrucian and Freemason brothers, dear Voodoo friends, citizens: "Today, Haiti says it will not die. [applause] It must live so all its sons can suck at its breast. Courageous men and women have decided to administer a serum to the country until it leaves the hospital bed of total and complete embargo, which tries to weigh it down. We do not promise miracles because the sickness is serious and the medicine is very expensive. But we call on all fellow citizens to be patient. We ask them for a chance so the doctor can work on them to bring recovery, but the sick person must want to be treated. The sick person needs the important surgical operation of elections. The sick person needs the vitamins of unity. Let us hold hands to save our country. Haiti is ours, it is mine, it belongs to all of us. All of us together must save it." [applause] It has been said with good reason that roses and lilies do not have a future, but that the fate of mankind places itself above that of the bird that sings and dies. [applause] I had the distinguished honor of speaking in Arcahaie on behalf of the Senate of the Republic 41 years ago on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the creation of our bi-colored flag. After briefly recalling the terrible sufferings endured by our ancestors in Africa, in the holds of slave ships, and in the land of Saint-Domingue, I spoke of our soul, thirsty for justice, peace, and love, with a sincerity that seems to have moved a great number of my fellow citizens. Today, there is only one remedy that can cure all the diseases of Haiti. It is love. [applause] As has always been said by a great radio station director, we must bury every hatchet. We can no longer continue to kill one another. It is no longer possible. In the current state of affairs, we must all, together, look at ourselves and say our mea culpas because the responsibilities are shared. There is not just one guilty person. We are all guilty to one extent or another. [applause] It is time that we got rid of the mortal certainty that any solution for our country will come from elsewhere, that any progress will necessarily be imported. We alone know our realities, our real needs, our objectives. Those who pretend to want to help us must take that into account. Still, it is necessary that we ourselves know these needs, that we listen in our land to our people, to ourselves. God helps those who help themselves. It is through this contempt for our deep realities, this misunderstanding of our problems, this lack of knowledge of our objectives that we are sinking under the weight of injustice by our foreign partners. If the painful situation that we are facing today has any merit, it is to make the majority of Haitians aware that the solution lies within themselves. It is because of this search for a Haitian solution that the parliament has decided to call on the president of the Court of Cassation to temporarily fill the function as head of state, following the duly observed defection of the executive power. It is my duty to answer history's call positively. [applause] In fact, for you and with you, I accept this challenge. I am calling on the patriotism of all the nation's sectors to help me bear up under the challenge. The national context and the current international context are extremely difficult -- internally, an impoverished and hungry nation, destroyed and nonexistent infrastructures, a weak and still weakening economy, uncontrolled commerce, stalled industry, an underequipped Army, a fragmented society, shaken institutions, a devastated ecology, a country to which everything seems to be lost. Everything remains to be won, however. Externally, a desorientated New World Order, a misinformed foreign opinion, a delinquent humanitarian policy, corrupt international law, [applause] a disjointed planetary system deprived of a global strategy in which a double standard is mercilessly applied, according to special interests or media surveys. The man of good faith observes, frustrated. To quote Charles (?Melon), president of the French parliamentary group, French Democratic Union: The triumph of illusion and trickery, seduction over reason, humbug over argument. At a time when it is appropriate to criticize the elite and the established order, they are accused of all sins, relying on the ineffectiveness of denial and abusing the credulousness of the crowds. The real reasons for the problems are then displaced. The people, blinded, swoop down on the designated fall guy. This facet of demagoguery is handled brilliantly by several modern leaders under the standard of democracy and human rights. It is an imposture. I earnestly implore the international community to grant this country the deadline needed for restoration of truth. May it pause to observe, allowing the provisional government to make emergency decisions and take measures on the local level for the protection of the fundamental rights of its citizens, especially in the case of the clandestine departures of refugees, risking the lives of men, women, and children at sea. In addition, despite the abuses the Republic of Haiti suffers through the blind ambition and self-importance of some of its sons, today, I make the solemn commitment to respect the sacred principles of the law and the clauses of our international commitments. [applause] A little more than 50 years ago, in the magazin LE TEMPS of Port-au-Prince, Doctor of Philosophy Abbot (Gingrat) asked this question: Where is the truth about social problems, about moral problems, and about religious problems? He answered by saying: The man, the demigod who could answer these questions and answer peremptorily by invoking universal persuasion and the death of all doubt would resolve the enigma and cure the diseases of this world. [applause] This is the reason, this is the reason [repeats himself] we ask all our fellow citizens to unite because one single man cannot solve the problem of Haiti. I take this opportunity to offer my keen congratulations to our valorous officers and soldiers who intervened, who said no at a moment [words indistinct] was reigning in the country. [applause] To the honorable members of the parliament, I can say only one word because in order to thank them, as I have said many times before, I would have to use the language of the gods, or at least the one of [word indistinct] or of what St. Jean (Chrysostome) called the golden mouth. I will just tell them thank you. Tomorrow, history will remember their gesture, and all those who, today, pillory and hold them up for public condemnation will bow before their courage and their patriotism. [applause] A final, parting word, because we must be brief. May we all fulfill our duties with love, truth, and justice so that fellowship and peace finally prevail in our unfortunate country. [applause] May the God of our hearts, of the universal church, of the eternal religion bless us and help us! [applause] May the protective gods of the homeland and all our [word indistinct] surround us with their protection as an impenetrable rampart, now and forever. [applause]
