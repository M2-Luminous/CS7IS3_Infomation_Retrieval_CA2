[Landsbergis] I am happy that two most important tasks begun by my colleagues and myself have been accomplished successfully -- Lithuania's admission to the European Union and the withdrawal of Russian troops. [Mankevicius] What have been the greatest failures in the opposition's political strife this year? [Landsbergis] I do not think that we have suffered any final defeats. However, we have had a few failures: To influence the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] leadership or its extreme forces. The latter's pressure on the LDDP leaders allows for more cooperation with the opposition. [Mankevicius] The congresses of Sajudis and the Homeland Union (Lithuanian Conservatives) proposed that early elections to the Seimas [parliament] be held already this year. Would not this be another mistake of the right-wing forces? [Landsbergis] First of all, I do not agree with the assumption that we made a mistake then. Our political rivals were assuming power without any elections by taking over control in the former Supreme Council. The elections were understood as a possibility for testing whether the Lithuanian people really agreed with this. People may have believed that such an outcome would bring better results, and, therefore, a few more people voted for the LDDP than for other parties. We, as well as the LDDP, did not predict such results. However, we see similar processes in neighboring countries, where Landsbergis or Sajudis have no influence. These are the specific regularities of the transitional period, mass psychology, and the influence of communism. It is very difficult to hold early elections against LDDP's will. This can be determined only by the LDDP itself and the president if the latter decide that it is more favorable for them to hold new elections now rather than in a few years.
