This came out in a statement this morning by the government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis, who stressed that President Kliridhis is still awaiting clarifications he requested through his letter to the UN secretary general. Mr. Kasoulidhis recalled that in the past too, Denktas appeared to have accepted some things, while in practice it was established that this had not been the case. Mr. Kasoulidhis further noted that at the president's private meetings with the political leaders, DISI [Democratic Rally], AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People], and DIKO [Democratic Party] maintained that the Greek Cypriot side cannot refuse to go to the talks.
