Even if the talks took place and were true, there is an unwritten rule that they are never talked about, claimed Meciar. Meciar said that former Foreign Minister Milan Knazko had to travel to Croatia on Meciar's order to withdraw Kovac's promise of cooperation in arms production. Kovac allegedly sent a letter to Taiwan promising to recognize it if Slovakia received $500 million. "This would cause an immediate political conflict with China. We were essentially opposed to it," Meciar said. After the first talks with Czech President Vaclav Havel, Kovac requested that the Slovak government pay 18.2 billion Slovak crowns [Sk] ($550 million) for the National Property Fund (FNM) and Sk24 billion ($800 million) for the Czech deficit. "I disagreed with the request, and the shares worth Sk178.2 billion ($5,400 million) eventually arrived in Slovakia gratis," Meciar added. The meeting between the Slovak delegation and American President Bill Clinton, which was preceded by careful preparations, was a wasted opportunity, Meciar said. The talks with Clinton were a historic chance for Slovakia to resolve its security and economic interests. Meciar said he had not had a chance to speak because Kovac delivered a 34-minute speech. The American party reacted negatively, as well. "I felt ashamed," Meciar commented on the meeting.
