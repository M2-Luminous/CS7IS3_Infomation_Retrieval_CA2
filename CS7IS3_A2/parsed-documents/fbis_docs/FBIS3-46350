Gyaincain Norbu, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party committee and chairman of the autonomous region, delivered a speech in which he summed up the meeting by stressing major tasks for the region this winter and next spring. His speech covers four aspects: first, the main results of the meeting; second, problems concerning how to convey and carry out the guiding spirit of the meeting; third, major tasks to be carried out this winter and next spring; and fourth, problems concerning how to improve the work style and strengthen the campaign of building a clean government. Attending the meeting were leaders of the autonomous regional party committee including Raidi, Guo Jinlong, Danzim, Yang Chuantang, Buqiong, and Li Guangwen, Political Commissar Hu Yongzhu of the Tibet Military District, leading cadres of provincial-level party members, standing members of the regional commission for discipline inspection, and all the comrades who attended the fifth plenary (enlarged) session of the fourth regional party committee. Raidi, executive deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party committee Standing Committee, presided over the meeting. The meeting conveyed the guiding spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the meeting of the CPC Central Committee on rural work, and the national meeting on the work of united fronts. It examined a report by the CPC Advisory Group of the Tibet Autonomous Region and adopted a resolution that such a group will no longer be established. Raidi, executive deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party committee Standing Committee, offered a report entitled "Conscientiously Study and Comprehensively Carry Out the Guiding Spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and Work Hard To Establish a Socialist Market Economic System." The meeting concentrated on great events and political affairs. It was a meeting for unifying thinking, enhancing understanding, sizing up the situation, fostering faith, and strengthening the sense of urgency in seizing opportunities in order to lay a solid ideological foundation for accelerating the pace of reform, opening up, and economic development. It was also for emancipating the mind, invigorating the spirit, and promoting unity and progress. Talking about the major results of this meeting during his speech, Deputy Secretary Gyaincain Norbu said: The greatest result of this meeting is that we have enhanced understanding, unified thinking, reached a consensus, fostered faith, and strengthened the sense of urgency in building a socialist market economic system. Major expressions of the meeting can be found in further deepening the understanding of the necessity to build a socialist market economic system, in defining the basic principle of accelerating the pace of reform and opening up as well as establishing a socialist market economic system in our region, in finding out the gap, and in strengthening the sense of responsibility and urgency in accelerating the reform and promoting the economic development. Major expressions of the meeting can also be found in further understanding the importance of the role of farming and animal husbandry as the foundation of the national economy, in paying attention to two important things [economic development and stable situation] simultaneously, and in strengthening and improving party leadership. Comrade Gyaincain Norbu added: During the discussion, all of us have profoundly felt that the largest obstacle in establishing a socialist market economic system lies in ideology and in understanding problems. Our comrades said that in changing the economic system, it is necessary to first change our thinking. Only by following the standards of the "three conducive causes" ["conducive to developing the productive forces of our socialist society, increasing the overall strength of our socialist country, and improving the people's living standards"], by being bold in our endeavors and experiments, and by working hard under the new system, can we realize the goal of achieving new results in our economic and social development. We all believed we can achieve social stability and national prosperity based on strong material foundation only by seizing opportunities and unswervingly carrying out the drive of reform, opening up, and modernization. He continued: All comrades believed the greatest gap between the region and the hinterland and coastal areas lies in emancipating the mind; in having a sense of urgency; in carrying out the tasks; in over-emphasizing the special conditions in Tibet; and in our tendency to "wait, depend on, and ask for" subsidies from central authorities. If we do not change this situation, we will bring about even greater passive and graver consequences. As leading cadres of the party, we have great responsibility during the course of establishing a new system. We should take the lead in our march, seize opportunities, and organize and lead the people in our great drive of reform and opening up. Deputy Secretary Gyaincain Norbu said: During the course of building a socialist market economic system, it is imperative to attach great importance to the role of farming and animal husbandry as the foundation of the national economy, follow the guiding spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Meeting of the CPC Central Committee on rural work, continue to maintain the party's basic policy in agricultural and pastoral areas, unswervingly deepen the reform of the economic system in rural areas, and promote rapid and sound economic development in agricultural and pastoral areas. We should firmly foster the ideology of paying equal attention to two important things, that is, economic development and stable situation, actively launch the campaign of anti-splittism, and create favorable a social environment for establishing a socialist market economic system and accelerating the pace of reform and economic development in our region. While talking about how to convey the guiding spirit of this meeting, Comrade Gyaincain Norbu said: The Fifth Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Fifth Autonomous Regional CPC Committee is an important meeting, representing the fact that our region has entered a critical stage in carrying out reform of the economic system. Therefore, it is extremely important to do a good job in conveying the guiding spirit of the meeting. The general requirement for this work is to conscientiously study the documents, formulate concrete measures, and guarantee comprehensive implementation. The major goals of our work lie in profoundly understanding the great significance of the "decision" [decision of the CPC Central Committee on some issues concerning the establishment of a socialist market economic structure] and its essence, in correctly appreciating the necessity of establishing a socialist market economic system in our region, in comprehensively understanding the thread of thought, major principle, and main tasks of the reform of the economic system in our region, and in sizing up the situation, seizing the opportunities to accelerate the reform and economic development. He also urged leaders at all levels to study and formulate a plan for accelerating the drive of reform and opening by taking into consideration actual conditions of their localities and departments. He said that it is necessary to attach importance to making gradual progress in reform and to losing no opportunities in achieving breakthroughs in important links so as to spur the whole situation of reform. Concerning some major tasks to be performed in this winter and next spring, Deputy Secretary Gyaincain Norbu said: It is a completely new undertaking to build a socialist market economic system. We need a great theory as our guidance. Great efforts should be made to systematically study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the "decision." At present, it is particularly important to study well Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. He stressed: The economic work of our region this winter, next spring, and next year should be carried out in accordance with the guiding spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the National Meeting on Economic Work. It is necessary to continue to strengthen the role of farming and animal husbandry as the foundation of national economy, concentrate on increasing the incomes of people living in agricultural and pastoral areas, strengthen the leadership over the work in agricultural and pastoral areas, exert great efforts in developing village and town enterprises, increase input in farming and animal husbandry, attach importance to the fundamental construction of water conservancy projects in farmland and grassland, pay attention to disaster-prevention and disaster-relief, and make a good arrangement for the requirements of people's livelihood so as to lay a foundation for reaping a good harvest in farming and animal husbandry next year. Various enterprises at all levels should concentrate on enhancing economic results, improving management, tightening disciplines so as to accomplish this year's production quotas and lay a good foundation for the management of next year's production. Comrade Gyaincain Norbu said: In carrying out the reform of the economic system in our region, it is necessary to insist on the standard of productive force, seize the opportunities, exert an all-out effort, and make breakthroughs in some key points. We should maintain steps in unison with other parts of the country in improving our system. We should proceed from Tibet's realities and make active and stable efforts in our work. Greater efforts should be made to accelerate the pace of reform in nine aspects, including state-owned enterprises, finance and taxation, banking industry, price, economic relations and trade, circulation, housing system, social protection, as well as work in farming and pastoral areas. Comrade Cyaincain Norbu pointed out: Reform, development, and social stability are interactive and mutually supplementary. In order to guarantee the smooth implementation of reform next year, it is imperative to pay attention to the following points: Prevent splittist elements at home and abroad from instigating riots among people by making use of reform and price reform in particular; it is necessary to take into consideration the state's guiding spirit of reform, conduct thorough investigation and analysis of the realities in our region, and extensively seek opinions of all circles while formulating a plan for reform; and, before introducing a reform policy, try to do a good job in propaganda work among people so as to make them understand, support, and participate in such reform. During his speech, Comrade Cyaincain Norbu also said: In carrying out the tough work of anti-corruption, it is necessary to resolutely implement the directives of the CPC Central Committee and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection concerning opposing corruption and rectifying the work style of the party, strengthen the clean-government drive, and ensure to achieve the current-stage results of anti-corruption. In conclusion, Comrade Cyaincain Norbu said: The upcoming year of 1994 is extremely important for our region to carry out the socialist modernization drive. Party organizations at all levels should work with best spirit and lead people of all nationalities in the region in establishing a socialist market economic system and accomplishing other tasks. The meeting was concluded with the majestic music of the "Internationale" at 11:30 in the morning.
