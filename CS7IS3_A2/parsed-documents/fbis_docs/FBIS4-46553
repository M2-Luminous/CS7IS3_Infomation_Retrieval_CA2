Well, perhaps they are not as serious as here, but nonetheless it is a pleasure. Since production at the defense enterprises in America is being cut back sharply, they are looking for new clients. Frederick Shapu decided to take advantage of the moment. Just a few months ago, the U.S. Department of Defense declassified its technological developments in the area of digital, that is, wireless telephone communications. Incidentally, they have been used for a long time in the U.S. Army, but their use was forbidden for civilian purposes. Such an opportunity has now appeared. So Shapu flew to Novosibirsk in order to propose his investment project to develop the same system of telecommunications here. In his words, the ICT Group company is in a position to free us of virtually all communication wires and cables: Telephones, TV channels, and faxes will all be digital. In discussing the potential of his company, Frederick Shapu emphasized the following. First, he said, this is not just another toy for the rich: For example, the installation of a digital telephone will cost a client no more than the installation of a regular telephone. However, the quality of communications will be absolutely incomparable. Second, local enterprises would manufacture the equipment; that is to say, new jobs will appear here. This is to say nothing about Novosibirsk not being required to make any financial outlays--he will invest the money. I do not know if everything is indeed as lucrative as Shapu says, but the oblast administration undertook to work on the proposal of the American businessman with local enterprises. If they turn down this scheme, for some reason, another proposal may very well be made by the American workers of military plants: Russian proletarians, let us unite!
