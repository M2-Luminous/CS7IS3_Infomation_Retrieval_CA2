[Churkin] I believe that this was a very interesting conversation in which all the problems in the former Yugoslavia were thoroughly examined. This was not a meeting at which decisions would be taken. We need further contacts before we can report some progress. What I have detected is that at least in this phase, when, as is my understanding, the Serbs are in the initial stage of examining the confederation concept and other elements connected to it, President Milosevic has a rather flexible attitude. I am particularly encouraged by this and convinced that this initiative and the Muslim-Croatian arrangement in Bosnia-Herzegovina could be incorporated in the search for an overall political solution to the problems. [Rodic] Did you bring any new proposals? [Churkin] I offered some thoughts and impressions after the talks that I have held in the last few days; however, this is part of a continuous process. I am travelling to Zagreb today. I believe that the attitude of President Milosevic toward these issues is very flexible and constructive and I am satisfied that he is also thinking about ways not to reject the new ideas but to examine all possibilities that will contribute toward the overall political solution, bearing in mind also the idea of confederation.
