Vostrikov under the rubric "Flight Safety: Special Case": "Pickup"] [Text] An Su-17MD fighter/bomber taxied out to the runway. Major A. Koval, military pilot 1st class, was to make a flight in the aerobatic area. Takeoff, climb and arrival at the zone. Out of a steep climb, the pilot went into a wingover and created an angle of attack when pulling out of the descent that was close to the maximum allowable so as to come out with the minimal loss of altitude. He felt increasing G-forces, however, at an altitude of 2,800 meters at a speed of 800 km/hr and an angle of dive of 30� with a virtually immobile control stick. He looked at his instruments--the indicator for the angles of attack was off the scale. He needed only a few seconds to assess the situation and make the correct decision. Through the vigorous pushing of the stick away from himself, he brought the aircraft out of the area of supercritical angles of attack and thereby averted entry into a stall mode. He reported what had happened to the flight operations supervisor, and on command curtailed his fulfillment of the assignment and returned to the airfield. The aircraft had still not landed and specialists had already begun to discuss the possible causes for what had happened. Some suggested that the aircraft could have gotten into wake turbulence. Others felt that a G-force pickup had occurred, which was possible in this flight mode with vigorous piloting and the pulling of the stick toward oneself at a rapid rate. Reference was made to instructions. The opinion was expressed that an unsanctioned triggering of an SAU [automatic control system] actuator had occurred. The final answer, however, should have been provided by the "black box"--the on-board recording device (BUR). The section of the flight where the precondition to a flight accident arose (Fig. 1, AB) was carefully analyzed in the decoding of the entries. The aircraft, at an altitude of 5,100 meters at a speed of 590 km/hr, went into the wingover (Fig. 1, 1-1) with the creation of a roll angle of 180� and the pulling back of the stick. The aircraft, in an upside-down position, began to curve in trajectory energetically through the large angles of attack. In a near-vertical dive (Fig. 1, B) the angle of attack increased to the maximum allowable value in operation (Fig. 1, C) owing to the movement of the stick for pitch. It later increased to a critical value (Fig. 1, K) with a virtually immobile stick. The aircraft was in the area of supercritical angles of attack for about three seconds, and only thanks to the pilot's vigorous pushing of the stick from 15� to 8� did he get out of it. That is the general picture of the dynamic of the aircraft's behavior on the section of the flight under consideration, but the causes were still not clear. The specialists carefully checked out all the variations. Analogous situations were considered to confirm the first variation-- getting into wake turbulence. The typical traits of that are arbitrary changes in the normal G-forces, and chaotic changes in G-forces and speed within small limits of about their average values, conditioned by the effects of disturbances from the wake turbulence. A comparison of the recordings (Figs. 1 and 2) made it possible to be convinced that the overshoot of the angle of attack was not caused by wake turbulence. As for the second version--a manifestation of G-force pickup--the data from the recording gear testified that there had been no vigorous movements of the stick for pitch before the arbitrary increases in the values of the angle of attack. This version was thus also invalid. The third version--violations of the functioning of an SAU actuator, which could have deflected the stabilizer into a non-standard position and created angles of attack greater than those allowable--was rejected after the decoding of the entries for the movement of the stick for pitch X[.sup]p[/] and the angle of deflection of the stabilizer �[.sup]st[/], as well as a comparison of their values with standard ones (Figs. 3, 1 Fig. 1. Fig. 2. and 2). Analysis showed that the control system was functioning normally, and the stabilizer had not been deflected by the SAU actuator mechanism. Fig. 3. Continuing the research, and in particular analyzing the materials of flight testing, specialists established that such a phenomenon had taken place, but at angles of attack greater than allowable ones. They were within the permissible angles on this aircraft, but close to the maximums. What was the essence of this feature? It can be observed only at Mach values less than the unit value, and is characteristic of aircraft with a swept wing at large angles of attack, when the linear dependence between the coefficients of the longitudinal moment M[.sup]z[/] and the lift force Cy is disrupted (Fig. 4). These phenomena, as flight practices show, are manifested most often at Mach values of 0.7--0.9. The aircraft was at Mach 0.76 in this instance. An involuntary pull-up is an outward manifestation of instability in G forces n[.sup]y[/]. The cause of this is an impermissibly strong displacement forward of the center of pressure as a consequence of the development of a tip stall in the flow on the wing, as well as interference between the fuselage, wing and empennage. A tip stall on a swept wing causes a redistribution of loads across its span, which leads to an increase in the lift factor of the blade-root cross- sections and a decrease at the wingtips. The pressure center of the wing and the aerodynamic focus are thus displaced forward. The latter causes changes in the coefficient M[.sup]z[/][.sup]Cy[/] and the appearance of neutrality and instability in the aircraft. A number of design refinements have been made to eliminate them, making it possible to delay the development of tip stall in the flow. These include the installation of special fences on the wing, the geometric and aerodynamic twisting of the wing, the use of leading-edge flaps, deflectable tips etc. Fig. 4. These measures made it possible to obtain satisfactory characteristics for longitudinal stability and controllability up to the maximum angles of attack in operation. This case, however, which has received the name of "stall pickup" in the technical literature, has called into question the completeness of the research that was conducted in the past, and has brought about the necessity of additional work to evaluate the behavior of the aircraft at maximum angles of attack. Local G-force instability is an undesirable phenomenon in the operational realm of flight modes. It creates preconditions for unintentional losses of speed, transition to supercritical angles of attack and the entry of the aircraft into intolerably large G-forces. Enhanced attention of the pilot and great precision in actions with the control surfaces in piloting are required in this case. It should be remembered that countering the arbitrary fluctuations of the aircraft using deflections of the ailerons or control surfaces when getting into a "pickup" mode and stall not only do not have any impact, but can also lead to a spin. It is thus essential, when reaching angles of attack greater than those allowable, to leave the ailerons in neutral position and not to permit any slip using the rudder. Only the vigorous pushing of the stick away from oneself can bring the aircraft out of the critical zone. These were indeed the actions that were recorded by the on-board recording gear in this instance. This confirmed the good training of the pilot and his profound knowledge of the practical aerodynamics of the aircraft. COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.
