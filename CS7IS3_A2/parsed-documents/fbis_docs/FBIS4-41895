And not by waving a magic wand, but by implementing Kuban's status as a special zone. It is no accident that Russians are interested in the processes under way here, and the local authorities, while divulging their experience in dribs and drabs, are improving on it and borrowing innovations from others. Graphic evidence of that is provided by the recent holding in Krasnodar Kray of a session of the council of the Association for Socioeconomic Cooperation among the Republics, Krays, and Oblasts of the North Caucasus, the conference of heads of organs of state power in the south of Russia, Abkhazia, and the Crimea, the all-Russia scientific and practical conference "Local Self-Government and Regional Economic Practice in the New Political and Economic Situation," and the second international "Partnership for Progress" conference. The interest in discussing purely economic and managerial problems leaves no time for any political statements, while the cards-on-the-table attitude displayed in the latest moves are disarming the opposition in the shape of those who love political intrigues. Thus, a signing ceremony and an exchange of texts of treaties of friendship and cooperation between the Kuban and the Republic of Ingushetia has taken place in the presence of journalists. [Ingushetia President] Ruslan Aushev's comment was that people still engage in politics even when they are living badly. The president of Ingushetia shared his faith in the republic's economic prosperity. But this is something that can only be dreamed about for the time being. Currently more than half of the local able-bodied population is unemployed. It was the search for investment that brought the president to Krasnodar. And he wanted to check his position against what his neighbors had achieved so as to make use of their experience in preparing a document on the creation of an economic development zone [zona ekonomicheskogo blagopriyatstvovaniya] in the republic. Russian Federation components are not doing any the worse for being harnessed together. A wide range of issues regarding the general agreement between the Russian Government and the regions was examined at the Association's council session -- on the development of the program for a unified transport system for the North Caucasus, and on economic cooperation and the provision of epidemiological safety in southern regions. The Kuban and the Crimea have also agreed to jointly build a bridge over the Kerch Strait. The returns on many projects will only be visible in the future. But it is also important that they have not been dictated from on high but are being implemented according to the plans of the new leaders and entourages that have arrived at local level. These people came up with the initiative to set up the Association, which is reviving centuries-old interregional ties and establishing new ones. Any country or region can become a member of the socioeconomic commonwealth, and actual membership of the Association does not mean recognizing the independence of certain regions. The discussion at the scientific and practical conference of the problems of distributing functions between the federal and local authorities, and of ties between the regions and the center and organs of local self-government was also dictated by life. Mayor Valeriy Samoylenko of Krasnodar noted in this connection: "There is a kind of situation in society whereby policy is still made in the capitals, while the economics is done -- or not done -- at local level. Organs of local self-government are now coming in for the greatest pressure from the population. They have become a kind of lightning rod at a time of socioeconomic tension".... The kinds of bolts that are hitting the "lightning rod" were explained by Ilya Demenko, general director of the kray administration's Finance, Budget, and Control Department. "Under the Russian president's edict, the regions themselves should be concerned about supplying the population with bread. The Kuban is the country's breadbasket, and you would have thought that this task could have been resolved here without any particular bother. But the question arises: Where will the billions of rubles to buy grain for the agrarian sector come from, if kray, city, and rayon budgets are all out of kilter? This has been a stumbling block when it comes to solving other problems too. Politicians provide payments from federal pockets on the basis of population sizes, but the central authorities use as their basis obsolete figures that take no account of migration processes...." The governor of the Kuban has signed a decree beefing up the pre-existing norms for controlling resettlement. People will now only be able to come here to live on receipt of official invitations issued by local administrations. Residence permits continue to be the main mechanism for regulating migration for the time being. Were they to be abolished, other levers would be sought. The kray administration has already passed a decree on the recruitment and utilization of foreign labor in the Kuban under license. In order to close off channels for illegal immigration it has been decided to set up a special center from where illegals will be resettled in other parts of Russia. These enforced measures have become possible thanks to the Kuban's being granted special status as a Federation component. The kray is indeed special. It not only enjoys a favorable climate, but has become a Russian border region and the country's southern gateway to the Mediterranean and the Near East. This means that this is the place where bridges of economic cooperation should also be built with the states of Europe and America.
