"This fits into the longstanding practice of constantly changing the tax laws," the German Economic Research Institute (DIW) in Berlin says. The fact that Russia is not making progress is primarily due to the failed economic policy. All positive approaches are "overcompensated for by escalating misdevelopments in central fields of economic policy." The forecasts for an economic upswing are, therefore, extremely restrained. Despite the speedy reduction of corporate taxes, there is no sufficient security for investors in Russia. One can hardly see any progress in the necessary restructuring of the Russian economy. The liberalization of export quotas, which has now been promised, is only patchwork, too, because, in the view of the DIW experts, all energy exports -- the main source of foreign currency -- are not affected by it. The research institutes DIW (Berlin), IWH [Halle Economic Research Institute] (Halle), and IW [Institute of German Economics] (Kiel) have listed the consequences that Russia is facing because of that. Their devastating assessment of the situation: Indications are accumulating that mass unemployment is unavoidable. The joint expert report judges Moscow's policy harshly. Even though one can still notice "reform rhetoric," in reality there is "no strength for the necessary structural change." The lack of concepts of those who guide the economy can be seen in the overall economic data. Thus, in 1993 the GDP declined by 12 percent, after it had gone down by double-digit rates during each of the three previous years. With a drop of 16 percent (1992: minus 18 percent), industrial production is hit particularly. The authors of the report criticize the fact that, nevertheless, private consumption increased slightly last year. Looking at the overall economy, one cannot speak of a decline in the standard of living at all. Given the collapse of the economic performance, the unchanged level of consumption logically leads to a decline in investments (most recently minus 15 percent). This expresses an "avoidance of structural change." The same goes for the labor market. There, the unemployment rate of 5 percent does not adequately reflect the obsolete structures. The report describes the financial markets as completely insufficient. The defects are the result of marked neglect in terms of order policy. The financial system is abused to preserve inefficient structures. One consequence: The illegal export of capital, which was estimated at at least $15 billion last year. At the end of 1993, foreign debts amounted to $80 billion.
