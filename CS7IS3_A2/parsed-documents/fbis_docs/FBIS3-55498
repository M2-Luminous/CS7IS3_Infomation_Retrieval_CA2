As before it remains a powerful state, a great power which is only passing through a difficult stage, apparently, just as other East European countries, Romania's Defence Minister Lieutenant-General Niculae Spiroiu emphasised in an interview with ITAR-TASS. According to him, it concerns the selection of a new social, political and economic system by the people of Russia, and it does not at all mean that Russia has lost some kind of battle. As far as ensuring security is concerned, after the disintegration of the Warsaw Treaty Organization its member states were left in a vacuum. That why it was natural for them to strive to improve their state of affairs. A kind of competition started to join NATO, the minister said. I presume that at the NATO summit in Brussels a decision will be adopted within the American initiative network of "partnership in the name of peace" and provide these states certain support in the sphere of security, Spiroiu noted. This initiative will be a step ahead, according to him. Russia's apprehensions in connection with the widening of NATO are very well understood by us, the head of the Romanian defence department indicated. That is the reason why we consider that Russia should participate in programmes of cooperation with NATO. If Russia is not included in the new structures of security, then they will not get the needed trust in them and will not become sufficiently effective. The Russian Federation cannot be excluded from this process. There is a need to create a system of equal security for all in which Russia will acquire its place and role corresponding to its importance. Any kind of discrimination would only lead to suspicion, tension and potential hot spots of instability, the Romanian defence minister said.
