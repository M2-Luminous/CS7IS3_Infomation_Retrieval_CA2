[passage omitted] The privatization in agriculture has helped remarkedly increase the country's food output without depending on government's investment. In 1988, Vietnam's food output was only 19.5 million tonnes, and it had to import more than 450,000 tonnes of rice. By 1993, its food output had reached nearly 5 million tonnes, enough not only for domestic consumption and reserve, but also for export. [passage omitted] By August 1993, there had been nearly 9,400 non-state businesses in sectors other than agriculture. They included limited liability companies, joint stock companies, private enterprises, co-operatives and production groups with a combined capital of 3,144 billion VN dong (roughly USD 300 million). The non-state investment capital in 1993 made up 26 per cent of the country's total investment capital of 30,800 billion VN dong (roughly USD three billion). However, investment by private businesses accounted for only 40 per cent of the population's savings. Thanks to the development of the private economic sector, 400,000 jobs have been created each year. That means to generate one job, investment capital of six million VN dong (approximately USD 600) was needed, compared with the direct foreign investment capital of USD 110,000. In 1991, the private economic sector remitted to the state budget through taxes VND 870 billion (nearly USD 87 million), accounting for 15 per cent of the total taxes collected in the whole country. The private sector's taxes increased to 1,746 billion VN dong in 1992, and 2,600 billion VN dong in 1993.
