The president, or the PT [Workers Party]? The PT spent more than 72 hours in meetings this week, if you add the hours of meetings of its national executive board in Sao Paulo to gatherings of its federal legislators in Brasilia. The more the PT talks, the more complicated the situation gets. So far, nothing new. The PT spent what seemed to be endless hours debating the main issues faced by the party in its 13 years of existence. The difference this time is the question mark behind the heated debate on the participation of the 36 deputies and Senator Eduardo Suplicy (Sao Paulo) in the constitutional revision and the development of the PT platform. It is a question mark that is eating away at the party and making its candidate for president vulnerable vis-a-vis the bloc of opponents. Such questions leave the party--which began the 1989 election campaign in third place but is now stabilized at the top of the polls--at 30 percent, thus facing the same dilemma as five years ago. Since then, the PT has expelled its more radical faction, the Socialist Convergence, talked to businessmen during meetings lubricated with whisky, and visited military officers. All this without, however, realizing that it was still held prisoner by the radicals. Or, what is worse, the radicals, in order not to appear so, have become indecisive. They are the tucanos of the PT. At the executive board's meeting on Tuesday 8 February, they poked their beaks outside. The date that had been set to decide, finally, whether or not the PT legislators could or could not participate in the constitutional revision assembly ultimately went down in party history as the day of postponement. A party with a profile of firm positions, the PT opted to put off the decision until 17 February. "We chose that date because Lula wants to attend," the coordinator of the party's platform, Prof. Marco Aurelio Garcia, confirmed. In favor of PT participation in the revision, Lula, the party president, had only five of the 20 votes. Fourteen others voted for postponement, and only one is adamantly against the revision. Having caught a bad cold on his fourth caravan trip--this one to Amazonia--Lula was resting at home. While convalescing, he was weakened by another virus: the political agreements virus. Although prevented from voting on the reform of the Constitution, the PT legislators were able to vote on the Social Emergency Fund (FSE), part of the plan developed by Minister of Finance Fernando Henrique Cardoso. So the PT was not in on the revision, but was voting. This confusion came about because the executive board would not accede to Lula's wishes and those of the majority of its congressmen and senators. Nor would Lula accept the executive board's radical posture. So the candidate sent a message to the board, which was meeting at the Hotel Comodoro in Sao Paulo, asking for them to postpone everything until the 17th, the eve of the start of yet another caravan trip, this one to the South. Garcia does not agree that in that discussion on the FES things were all that simple. "Even I, who is considered soft [preceding word in English]--I did not think they should vote," he said. "But that will be resolved next week." Until then, the legislators, the executive board, and Lula are locked in an arm-wrestling contest. The "it" in this dispute that resembles a game of blindman's buff is Lula's candidacy, which urgently needs alliances and a platform to guide it to victory. "There are two distinct roads the PT can take," suggests Sao Paulo Deputy Jose Genoino. "It could expand its alliances with a platform that does not create obstacles to shut out other parties or keep it from governing; or else decide that Lula will govern merely by mobilizing the public." The second hypothesis Genoino considers to be a mistake. In this arm-wrestling phase, the executive board was clever when it opted for a confrontation with the party's legislators instead of trying to force the adoption of a platform as happened in other elections. By attacking the deputies, the factions on the left, which have representatives on the executive board, played games with people's vanity. Another strategy used by the radical is an older one--uniting the other schools of thought. Or uniting dissenters from those groups, like the Hour of Truth, the most leftist part of Articulation, which is Lula's faction. The Hour of Truth was against PT participation in the revision. "The attack on the delegation was reinforced by the anticongressional sentiments of the PT rank and file--sentiments shared by the general public," a party congressman revealed. Seven legislators drafted a manifesto and accepted the decision of the radicals. Ten others remained on the fence. The majority threatened to break with the executive board. From Belem, Lula tried to put the house in order. He sent (in different words) the following message: those who are dissatisfied had better leave. The party president accepted the position taken by the executive board and was insisting that the legislators do the same. The 19 rebels then began to negotiate. At the meeting with the executive board in Sao Paulo, the leader of the legislative delegation, Jose Fortunati (Rio Grande do Sul), withstood the fire from the radicals. The payback came out of the meeting of the delegation on Tuesday 8 February. The deputies accepted the order to obstruct the revision, but would disobey the ban on voting, provided they do so as a tactic of obstruction. "That is not much," complained Deputy Joao Paulo (Minas Gerais). "Calm down, Joao Paulo"--asked his colleague Pedro Tonelli (Parana)--"the executive board did not realize that if you give us an inch, we can take a mile." That same evening, the PT deputies voted against Minister Fernando Henrique's plan. But they did vote. As the legislators see it, Lula let the conflict go on because he is holding back an argument in his favor in order to negotiate later on, in what will be the most important negotiations. In April, the Ninth National Encounter will decide, among other things, the policy on alliances. Lula needs to shove the tucanos, beaks and all, down the throats of the radicals who are in the PT leadership. In other words, to do a kindness today so as to win tomorrow. Lula is counting on some factors in his favor, such as the good will of PSDB President Tasso Jereissati and the almost-discarded candidacy of the finance minister. The slate may also include the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party], with which the PT has already reached an agreement, and the PC do B [Communist Party of Brazil]. What we do not know is how the most radical wing, the unrelenting opponent of alliances (especially with social democratic parties) will behave when this subject is on the table. Or whether Lula will be able to convince them as easily as he expects. His leadership is also being tested on platform issues such as the foreign debt, anti-inflationary policy, and the military budget. Depending on the degree of radicalism that prevails at the April meeting, his candidacy could either be consolidated or weakened. These differences, Garcia admits, are wearing down the party and opening a breach through which opponents can attack. "The disagreements are being mishandled and are certainly hurting the campaign," said the professor, now one of Lula's most influential advisers. Garcia emphasizes, however, that those discussions are about programs. "No one in the PT is obliged to furnish an auditor's report to prove he can be a candidate; in this party, the debate is about ideas," he boasted. That is precisely one of the questions in the voters' minds: who will prevail, the man, or the ideas? "Lula is bigger," Garcia answered. Even while extolling the differences and their content, Garcia admits that the controversy about the revision will leave scars even among those "colleagues," who, until then, worked closely together. On Tuesday 8 February, he himself became irritated with Jose Genoino. The deputy, reacting to pressure from the executive board, had attacked the PT platform which, the legislator complained, "worships the State." As mentor of the text that will be voted on in April, Garcia was furious. "Look, why didn't he pick up the telephone and tell me so, why didn't he ask for a meeting to tell me what he thinks?" he asked. "They use their access to the press to call the executive board bureaucratic, to attack this or that, but I could play that game too if I wanted and it would be pure nitroglycerine, because I have all the documents," he threatened. Among the closest advisors are some who argued on Wednesday 9 February that Lula should take a hard line toward all this squabbling. "It is time for him to blow the whistle," said one of them. In the afternoon of that same day, during an interview in Sao Jose dos Campos (Sao Paulo), Lula was still mild-mannered in his comments, despite urging autonomy for the legislative delegation. No one expects the members of a big party to hold identical opinions. That does not happen anywhere in the world. "People should look at the cost-benefit ratio of all this, and consider whether it helps the party or helps X, Y, or Z," Garcia observed. Anyone who is working on Lula's image in the business community would be the first to close out the balance sheet in the red. "The party is going through a divisive phase; Lula is a negotiator and will certainly put an end to this, said businessman Oded Grajew, one of the people in charge of setting up meetings between Lula and representatives of business. Grajew, a former president of the Brazilian Association of Toy Manufacturers (Abrinq), recalls that he has often been forced to yield or accept defeat. "A president can be neither a dictator nor a puppet," he advises. [Box p 28] Preaching to the Choir--Professor Analyzes Style of PT Documents No Brazilian political party produces more documents than the PT. There are folders stuffed with papers--directives, programs, proposals, opinions, press releases, and so on. The petistas write as much as they debate in interminable meetings. And every meeting of its directors or officers ends up in written form. One of these papers, specifically the "Directives For the State Government Platform of the Sao Paulo PT" ended up in the hands of Maria Otilia Bocchini, a professor at the School of Communications and Arts at the University of Sao Paulo (USP). A scholar and expert on social linguistics, she made a surprising discovery. The party writes plenty, but the voter understands very little of it. "The texts are not clear, they are written only for the initiated," she observed. Herself a card-carrying petista, Maria Otilia decided to suggest some changes to the PT editors. And she did so in a very original manner: she put it in the form of a document. With good-humored language, she extracted some "pearls" from the platform adopted by PT candidate for governor Jose Dirceu. On two sheets of paper, under the title "The PT Way To Write Documents," she listed, under 11 topics, the flaws and examples of stodginess she found in party language. Using sarcasm, Maria Otilia's 11 commandments prescribe exactly what should not be done when writing for the "masses"--since that is the party's intended audience. "That was the method I chose to call more attention to the defects," she argues. In the third commandment, "Use a tangle of idle chatter, choose words and expressions whose meanings are elastic, vague, and imprecise," she suggested a simpler text for the title of the document. "PT Objectives in the 1994 elections: elect Lula president and win the governor's mansion." Compare this with what the petistas preferred: "In 1994, the Brazilian people will have an historic opportunity to inflict, via the ballot box, a strategic defeat on the dominant sectors of society." According to Maria Otilia, petistas "preach to the choir, repeat themselves, use obscure expressions and titles, and conceal their thoughts behind difficult words." Evidence of this last observation can be found in the latest document from the PT oven. On 8 February, the party put out a press release entitled "PT Continues Its Obstruction" about the party's participation in the constitutional revision. In other words, after two days of debate, the PT released an ambiguous paper over its internal division. In it, the executive board confirms its position against the revision, but speaks of a "maximum agenda" and actually postpones the final decision until 17 February. The fear of appearing to have a limited vocabulary is the principal cause of this frustrated attempt at sophistication in language. Or perhaps they prefer to complicate things so no one really will understand them.

The end result is zero." - Jose Genoino, PT deputy from Sao Paulo: "I am afraid the radicals will botch Lula's campaign. They have really hurt the PT." - Jose Paulo Bisol, PSB senator from Rio Grande do Sul: "There are both utopian groups and forces worried about governability. That sparks conflicts within the party." - Luiz Gushiken, PT deputy from Sao Paulo: "As president, Lula will be bigger than the PT because his electorate will exceed the boundaries of the party."
