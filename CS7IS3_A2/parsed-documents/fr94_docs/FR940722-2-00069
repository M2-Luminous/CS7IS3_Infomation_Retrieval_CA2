SUMMARY: The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces that fiscal year 1994 funds have been awarded to the 34 eligible metropolitan areas (EMAs) that have been the most severely affected by the HIV epidemic. Although these funds have already been awarded to the EMAs, HRSA is publishing this notice to inform the general public of the existence of the funds. In addition, HRSA determined that it would be useful for the general public to be aware of the structure of the HIV Emergency Relief Grant Program and the statutory requirements governing the use of the funds. The purposes of these funds are to deliver or enhance HIV-related (1) outpatient and ambulatory health and support services, including case management and comprehensive treatment services, for individuals and families with HIV disease; and (2) inpatient case management services that prevent unnecessary hospitalization or that expedite discharge, as medically appropriate, from inpatient facilities. The HIV Emergency Relief Grant Program was authorized by Title I of the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;381, which amended Title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act. Funds were appropriated under Public Law 103&hyph;112. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, CONTACT: Individuals interested in the Title I HIV Emergency Relief Grant Program should contact the Office of the CEO in their locality, and may obtain information on their CEO contact by calling Eric P. Goosby, M.D., Director, Division of HIV Services, at (301) 443&hyph;6745.
