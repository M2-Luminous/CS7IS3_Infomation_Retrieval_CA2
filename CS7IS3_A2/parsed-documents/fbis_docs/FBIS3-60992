Villagers arriving in the southeastern provincial capital of Diyarbakir on Tuesday, said that 400 houses in the Cizre district of Dicle had already been evacuated at gunpoint. They said the remaining 600 houses in the same district were also being evacuated. Local officials in Diyarbakir said they had not heard of the development but would look into claims. Villagers, who refused to be identified for fear of retaliation, said they too had applied to local officials but were given no explanation. The village guards, they said, were brought to Cizre from the villages of Silopi and had settled down in a nearby neighborhood. The Cizre district has come to be known as a PKK stronghold. Villagers claim that their lives are threatened and that they are forced to listen to the guards. The fate of the evacuated houses is not yet known.
