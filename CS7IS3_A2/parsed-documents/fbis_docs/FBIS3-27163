On 18 Feb, Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic announced that the process would be completed 24 hours before the deadline set by NATO's ultimatum. Izetbegovic, the Bosnian Muslim leader, after a meeting with UN peacekeepers on 18 February, said that the Muslims would also withdraw their heavy weapons from Sarejevo or place them under the control of the UN peacekeeping forces from 19 February. He thought that the crisis in Sarajevo would be concluded very soon. The above-mentioned conditions hopefully provide some light for a peaceful settlement of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is facing a crucial turning point. Since NATO issued its ultimatum, which was mainly aimed at the Bosnian Serbs, and demanded that they withdraw all of their heavy weapons from an area with a 20-km radius surrounding Sarajevo by 0000 local time on 21 February, or place those weapons under the control of UN troops. Bosnian Serb leaders have repeatedly said they are willing to comply and that they started the process on 11 February, but that the scale was not large. According to an estimate by UN troops, the Bosnian Serbs have about 300 artillery pieces in the Sarajevo area, while the Muslims have about 150. By 14 February, artillery withdrawn by both sides or handed to the places specified by UN troops accounted for only about 10 percent. The Bosnian Serbs moved slowly, and the main reason was because they thought the Muslims, who have better infantry, were adjusting their lines in those areas evacuated by the Serbs; the Muslims were also slow to withdraw their heavy weapons, and there were differences between Serb political and military leaders on whether to continue the withdrawal. When the Serbs hesitated and entered an impasse with the West, Churkin, a special envoy sent by Russian President Yeltsin, again arrived in Belgrade on 16 February carrying with him a proposal from the president, which said that if the Serbs withdrew all of their guns or accepted UN supervision, Russia would participate in the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina and would immediately send 400 Russian peacekeeping troops from Croatia to Sarajevo, and would add another 400 troops, who would guard positions vacated by the Serb gunners. This move by Russia satisfies the main demands of the NATO ultimatum on the one hand, and, on the other hand, enables the Serbs to have a sense of security and a path to back off, therefore, it immediately received a general welcome from various quarters, except the Bosnian Muslims, and it brought about important factors contributing to the development of situation. Can bombing by the West of positions held by the Serbs be avoided? A spokesman with the UN peacekeeping forces said that the Serbs had begun a large-scale withdrawal of heavy weapons on 17 February, while some other heavy weapons had been handed over at five designated points in Sarajevo; the Muslims were also handing over their heavy weapons at two other designated places, which would see the arrival of peacekeepers stationed there. Observers said that the possibility of an air strike had diminished, but the danger still remained. Although the Serbs declared that they would complete their withdrawal by 2400 on 19 February, the NATO countries said they would "look at the results" when the deadline set by the ultimatum expires, and that "any heavy weapons which have not been withdrawn or placed under control will be hit immediately." In addition, in the past, incidents have erupted in Bosnia-Herzegovina at crucial moments, and the commander of the peacekeeping forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina has said repeatedly in the past two days that he was most worried about sudden incidents taking place at this time. Once vicious incidents erupt, it is difficult to deal with the situation. Will NATO really take military action outside its defense zone for the first time since its founding? Can an air strike in Bosnia-Herzegovina be avoided? People are watching closely.
