"We regret that the United States one-sidedly evaluated the intellectual property protection situation of its trade partner according to its domestic laws, despite international efforts to resolve all disputes at the multilateral level before the launching of the World Trade Organization (WTO)," Foreign Ministry Spokesman Chang Ki-ho said in a statement. The U.S. Trade Representative placed South Korea on the priority watch list on Monday, claiming that Seoul had failed to improve its laws on protection of intellectual property rights [IPR]. "We want to clarify our government position that we will continue to implement the agreements, both bilateral and multilateral, on IPR protection," the statement said.
