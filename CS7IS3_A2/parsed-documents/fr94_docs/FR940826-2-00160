FR940826-2-00160 FR940826-2-00081 11. The Return will be allocable annually out of Partnership profits and will be payable to the general partner when profits are realized by the Partnership or, to the extent not previously paid, upon the liquidation of the Partnership. The rate of the Return may be more favorable to the Partnership than prevailing market rates for comparable types of ``borrowing'' because a Partnership would receive the benefits of the prime rate or the rate at which the Treasury borrows. 12. The Partnerships' net profits and losses will be allocated to the general partner and the limited partners in the same proportion as the amount of their respective paid-in capital that was employed to make the investments giving rise to such profits or losses, except as previously described with respect to the Non-Allocable Portion, if any, and except that, unless otherwise specifically provided in the limited partnership agreement, the capital accounts of the limited partners will not be reduced below zero and any additional losses will be allocated to the general partner. 13. Each Partnership will send its limited partners annual reports regarding its operations and current valuation of Partnership assets. As soon as practicable after the end of each tax year of a Partnership, a report will be transmitted to each limited partner setting out information with respect to the limited partner's share of income, gains, losses, credits and other items for federal income tax purposes, resulting from the operation of the Partnership during that year. 14. The general partner of a Partnership may purchase units which it may offer to new Eligible Employees joining The Travelers Group after closing of the Partnership. The sale of these units by the general partner will have no dilutive effect on the interest of already existing limited partners because the units will have already been issued and sold at the closing of the Partnership. Applicant's Legal Analysis 1. On behalf of the Partnerships, The Travelers requests an exemption under section 6(b) and 6(e) of the Act from all provisions of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except section 9, certain provisions of section 17, and sections 36 through 53 of the Act, and the rules and regulations under those sections. 2. The Travelers requests an exemption from section 17(a) to permit a Partnership: (a) to purchase from Smith Barney, or another affiliate of The Travelers, securities or interests in properties previously acquired for the account of Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers; (b) to purchase interests or property in a company or other investment vehicle in which Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers already owns securities; (c) to sell to Smith Barney or other affiliates of The Travelers securities or interests in properties previously acquired by the Partnerships; (d) to invest in investment companies, investment partnerships or other investment vehicles offered, sponsored or managed by Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers (referred to as ``Travelers Sponsored Vehicles''), or to purchase securities from Travelers Sponsored Vehicles, except that The Travelers will not invest more than 15% of the assets of any Partnership in Travelers Sponsored Vehicles; (e) to invest in securities of, or to lend money to, entities with which Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers have performed investment banking or other services and from which they may have received fees; (f) to purchase interests in or lend money to a company or other investment vehicle (i) in which Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers or their respective employees own 5% or more of the voting securities or (ii) that is otherwise affiliated with the Partnership or The Travelers; (g) to purchase securities that are underwritten by Smith Barney or by another affiliate of The Travelers (including a member of a selling group) on terms at least as favorable to the Partnership as those offered to investors other than ``affiliated persons'' (as defined in the Act) of Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers; and (h) to participate as a selling security-holder in a public offering (i) that is underwritten by Smith Barney or by another affiliate of The Travelers or (ii) in which Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers acts as a member of the selling group. 3. The Travelers also requests an exemption from section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder, subject to the conditions specified below, to permit a Partnership to make an investment in an entity in which a Partnership, Smith Barney or another affiliate of The Travelers, or any ``affiliated persons'' (as defined in the Act) of the Partnership or an ``affiliated person'' of such person also invests or participates or plans concurrently or otherwise directly or indirectly to invest or become a participant. 4. The Travelers requests an exemption from the requirements, contained in rules 17f&hyph;1(a) and 17f&hyph;1(c), that the custodial agreement between The Travelers Group and a Partnership must be in writing and transmitted to the SEC. Requiring a written contract and transmission to the SEC would unnecessarily burden The Travelers and cause unnecessary expense to The Travelers. 5. The Travelers requests an exemption from the requirements, contained in rule 17g&hyph;1(d), (e), and (g), that a majority of the board of directors of the entity controlling the general partner who are not interested persons take certain actions and make certain approvals concerning bonding and request instead that the actions and approvals required by the rule to be taken by the board of directors may and will be taken by officers and directors, regardless of whether they are ``interested.''
