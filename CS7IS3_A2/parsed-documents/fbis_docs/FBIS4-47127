For the first time, the head of state visited the headquarters of the Russian Federation's Foreign Intelligence Service. He gave a 30-minute speech to the operational staff, and he spent more than two hours in a circle of the service's managerial personnel. The KURANTY editorial staff learned about some of the details of this meeting and the impressions and opinions of its eyewitnesses. On the whole, the experts give a very high evaluation to Yeltsin's excursion into intelligence. However, to make the picture complete and to realize the importance of this meeting, we will look back two and a half years ago. Iron Feliks did not last on what seemed to be his permanent pedestal. He crashed to the ground in such a way that the subunits of the once monolithic KGB went flying in various directions. The elite intelligence service--the First Main Directorate--which was called on to resolve extremely important tasks, mainly abroad, was also knocked out of it. A serious reform of the special institution was started--it began to be called the Central Intelligence Service when the Soviet Union was still in existence. The Gorbachev-Yeltsin dyarchy generated the idea of creating "an original Russian" intelligence service under the conventional designation "Federal Security Agency." Specialists note that the period of time from Putsch No. 1 to the Belovezha Agreement is marked by black days on the calendar of the country's intelligence service. The operational staff basically remained silent, although it can be imagined what went on in the heads of the employees. Many could not take it--they went into civilian work. But, in one way or another, a nucleus of professionals was preserved nonetheless. They were all assembled under the abbreviation FIS [Foreign Intelligence Service] and were told: "Get down to work." However, doubts among the workers remained--what did the high leadership of the country have in mind for them? Moreover, these doubts were somehow stirred up little by little both at home and abroad. Bayonets in the Ground? It was said "Get down to work." But how? All of the foreign political guidelines were disrupted, there were no enemies, including the principal one, which was presumed to be the United States. The "fraternization" of Moscow with Washington led to a sharp drop in Russian intelligence activity not only in the United States, but also in practically all of the countries of the world. The financial squeeze forced the FIS to reduce to a minimum the level of work in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. There were persistent rumors that the Americans are insolently pressuring the Russian leadership with respect to a reduction in intelligence functions of the FIS against them, but R. Gates, director of the CIA at that time, bluntly told his Russian colleague, Ye. Primakov, of the need to veto agent and operational work of the Russian intelligence service on U.S. territory. In assessing those "cursed days," professionals recognized that the lack of demand for intelligence was very clearly felt then, and this brought on gloomy predictions regarding its future. Approximately the same mood prevailed among employees of the Russian intelligence service right up until Yeltsin's visit. The Paralysis Is Being Abolished. And so, on the sunny day of 28 April, a presidential motorcade drove up to the FIS headquarters--a complex of buildings whose main building resembles the NATO citadel in Brussels. The 800-seat hall is over filled, although the operational personnel who remained in their offices were not deprived of the opportunity to hear the president on a local radio relay. According to the testimony of eyewitnesses, Yeltsin, dressed in a perfectly tailored blue suit, headed for the rostrum without hurrying. Thousands of eyes gazed intently at the powerful figure of the president in the expectation--what has the eminent guest brought with him? The tension in the hall was replaced by goodwill and approval from sentence to sentence. In the middle of the speech, the attendees, with an expression of pleasant surprise on their faces, listened to the speaker and agreed with him in a majority of cases. "You know better than I that there are forces abroad that would like to keep Russia in the condition of a manageable paralytic," Yeltsin said. "But I am convinced that only a powerful, democratic, and prosperous Russian state will become a factor in acquiring new prospects peacefully. It is our common task to make Russia such a state." Diversity of Opinions. One common positive moment exists in the rather broad range of evaluations of Yeltsin's speech among intelligence employees: The president for the first time openly recognized the importance and necessity for such a specific service as the FIS. His speech can in full measure be called conceptual. Yeltsin demonstrated real knowledge of the subject, and he assessed the functions of the intelligence service and the quality of its information very highly. Global problems facing the country were publicly tied in with the tasks of intelligence for the first time. The importance of such a statement of the question was that the president, in a rather tough form, made clear the need to receive valuable, timely, warning intelligence information. "I expect that in the future your operational information, analytical conclusions, and recommendations will receive only good marks... We expect intelligence data from the FIS that are necessary for making fundamental state decisions on questions of Russia's foreign and domestic policy, the conduct of our economic policy, and the support of scientific-technical progress." (From B. Yeltsin's speech of 28 April in the FIS.) At the same time, although encouraging statements were made and firm guarantees were given of the "necessary concern for each intelligence officer," no one will say now how all of this in fact will be implemented. Some specialists think that the train has already left--the outflow of qualified personnel from the intelligence service has assumed an irreversible character, and many of the functional directorates of the service have been bled white. But, to continue to keep intelligence on a financial hunger ration is equivalent to transforming it into something of a toothless department. It is not accidental, after all, that CIA patriarch Allen Dulles in his work "The Craft of Intelligence" wrote that a poor intelligence service cannot achieve hoped for results. It is also not entirely clear to professionals how it is possible to fulfill the task assigned by the president to systematically keep abreast of the situation along the entire perimeter of the Russian borders with neighboring countries. The fact is that Moscow has signed numerous treaties with a majority of the now independent states surrounding Russia about not conducting intelligence activities against each other. Yeltsin talked about the legal basis for the FIS, but experts emphasize that the Law of the Russian Federation on Foreign Intelligence, under which the signature of a "nonpolitician," Khasbulatov, still stands, requires significant revision. For example, Article 9 of this act concerning contacts of the FIS organs with the Russian public became outdated a long time ago. Diverting Parallels. But what about our overseas friends-rivals? Judging by everything, they did not like the fact that their recommendations on stopping all Russian intelligence activity on U.S. territory were not heeded in Moscow. Then the Ames case came to light, which seemed to form Washington's position on this score: They said, we seemed to have come to an agreement, but you, so-and-sos, are recruiting CIA employees. In the meantime, there was no mention on the part of the United States about any reduction in the work of the American intelligence services against Russia. The U.S. President regularly visits Langley, and not just once a year, in order to give his blessing to the intelligence activity of CIA agents. Here is what he said, for example, during his last visit to CIA headquarters on 4 January of this year: "The conclusion of the Cold War has strengthened the security of the United States, but, after all, it is precisely intelligence, acting in very different ways, that helped gain victory in this confrontation." But what follows further is a quotation from Yeltsin's speech, and compare: "The period of global confrontation in international politics has ended, but its inertia is strong today. The Cold War has turned into a scattering of hot and smoldering conflicts... Military force factors can once again be activated at any moment." Curious coincidences in the views on what is occurring, is it not true? And again Clinton: "But today's renewed peace also remains full of dangers and, judging by many events, it is becoming even more complicated and difficult to correctly understand the processes that are occurring." He is seconded by Yeltsin: "I understand very well that, perhaps, there has not been a more difficult period for the FIS than the present one. And this is determined most of all by the present international situation. Its main feature is the large scale and the high speed of changes that continuously further complicate an already complicated world." These theses were pronounced at different times by the leaders of different countries, but their thoughts are absolutely identical. Somebody, probably, can reproach Yeltsin for plagiarism (he made his speech almost five months later than Clinton). But it is exactly this kind of plagiarism, it seems, that the FIS employees expected from the Russian president--there is a desire, at least in words, to be on an equal footing with colleagues from the CIA.
