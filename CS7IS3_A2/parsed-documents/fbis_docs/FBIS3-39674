Thanks to their advanced on-board systems, Belgian F-16's were able to carry out precise aerial bombardments against traditional targets, the Air Force staff said in a statement. The current absence of electronic countermeasures (ECM) -- until the delivery of the first systems, which will take place at the start of next year -- could also be overcome, the Air Force explained: Either by having recourse to electronic warplanes owned by other countries, or by "borrowing" or "renting" certain items of ECM equipment from other NATO partners, thanks to a mutual support procedure. The use of ECM pods does not require specific training for pilots, the Air Force staff said. As for the ability to carry out precise bomb attacks on targets -- such as the artillery pieces surrounding Sarajevo -- the Air Force stressed that its F-16's were already able to carry out precise air attacks against traditional targets. In order to carry out so-called surgical attacks on very small targets and limit damage to the surrounding area to a strict minimum, it would be necessary to use guiding weapons and systems which were not yet available to the Air Force, the statement added. It nevertheless noted that Belgian pilots could very soon start to be trained in using this type of weapon, thanks to the purchase of AGM-65 "Maverick" air-to-ground infrared missiles, which the government approved last year. While waiting for these missiles, Belgian F-16's could carry out precision attacks using laser-guided bombs, by modifying the current bombs using a "relatively cheap" guiding kit. However, another (allied) plane or ground troops would have to "illuminate" the target with a laser beam, the Air Force noted. Training in this technique could be done in a short period of one to two weeks, according to the Air Force. The Air Force said that therefore it was "totally capable of and qualified to" participate in integrated operations in the former Yugoslavia, and "will do so if the political authorities so decide," the statement continued. The Air Force staff noted, however, that it would be "useful to acquire some additional equipment" through the mutual support procedures while waiting for the command systems to be delivered, in order to "reduce risks" and "increase the efficiency" (of its planes).
