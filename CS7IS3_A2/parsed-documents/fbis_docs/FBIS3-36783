Another three economic agreements were signed by heads of Ukrainian and Lithuanian ministries and departments. Kravchuk and Brazauskas praised the documents at a news conference and described them as "historic and upgrading the Lithuanian-Ukrainian relations." Asked whether the Ukrainian striving to join the Partnership for Peace program will influence its relations and negotiations with Russia, Kravchuk said it won't happen since Russia may also join the program. As for the Black Sea Fleet, the Ukrainian president noted "it is a vitally important problem for Ukraine, and it should be settled on a mutually beneficial basis, which is being done. Russia is a Ukrainian foreign political priority. One should distinguish the state policy from the policy of the opposition. We stand for good-neighbourly peaceful relations with Russia." Both presidents called for the expansion of Ukrainian-Lithuanian economic relations, which have not reached a worthy level. Kravchuk suggested Ukrainian use of the Klaipeda port to "give Ukrainian goods way to northern Europe via the Baltic Sea and Lithuanian goods -- to the south via Ukrainian Black Sea ports".
