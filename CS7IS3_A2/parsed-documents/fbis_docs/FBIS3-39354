It was a logical step for a country which had always felt in tune with the goals and objectives of Western democracies. Today Austria is on the last lap of an exhausting marathon to become a full member of the European Union [EU]. Despite some remaining pitfalls, the signs are that membership will be won at the beginning of 1995. Before then, however, there is much work to be done and time is running out. A great deal is at stake and failure would result in a serious setback for the EU and the other European Free Trade Association applicants. It would also adversely affect the hopes of the new democracies of Central and East Europe. On the positive side, Austria has negotiated satisfactory terms with the EU which allow it to retain its higher environmental standards. It is also to continue its antinuclear policy. This is especially important to an electorate who, in 1978, voted against commissioning a nuclear reactor near Vienna. In addition, agreement has been reached on the regional fund and relative financial benefits. Arrangements with Japan worth 62 billion schillings ($5bn) on Austrian-made components in imported Japanese cars have also been confirmed. The Austrian interpretation that Maastricht is compatible with neutrality has also been accepted. Austria adopted permanent neutrality in a constitutional law passed by parliament in 1955. This means it will never accede to military alliances, nor permit the establishment of foreign military bases on her territory. Most Austrians associate neutral status with peace, stability and prosperity. With the end of the Cold War, neutrality cannot have the same meaning as in the past, nor offer the same guarantees of security for the future. With the prospect of increasing regional and ethnic conflicts Austria's position is more vulnerable than ever. Its security can be found only within the framework of a common policy with the European Union. As regards EU membership, Austria will agree to join the Western European Union [WEU] as an observer. It is keen to develop comprehensive security arrangements emerging out of the EU, WEU, NATO and CSCE. Austria intends to make a full contribution and to show solidarity with its partners. Despite this progress, some hard-core issues are yet to be settled. The most delicate of these relate to agriculture, secondary residences and transit traffic. Several problems remain. Does the internal market come into effect immediately on entry or will Austrian produce and markets be granted a transitional period? The government is pushing for a transition of four years because there are adaptation problems for many farmers who would go to the wall, or have to be supported by generous subsidies. The question is whether the EU would be prepared to share the burden. Austria will be a net contributor to EU coffers and a suitable arrangement seems likely. The second agricultural problem concerns quotas for future Austrian production in the Union, namely beef, milk, sugar, pork, wine, wheat and other agricultural products. On this the EU has so far failed to make a satisfactory offer. A solution will probably be found. On the delicate issue of transit traffic, the EU must agree to continue with the present valid agreement. Secondary residences is more a psychological than an economic or political question. Here one has to respect the Alpine people's wishes not to be submerged or destroyed by rich city people. These last points are essential preconditions if the government is to go ahead with a referendum, which could take place on 12 June. Austria is prepared to negotiate beyond the March deadline and even into the autumn to achieve the best deal for its farmers and the Tyroleans. This is vital not only for their well-being but also for a positive outcome to the referendum. If the coalition government of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats feels its conditions have not been met and the referendum is likely to go against membership, it would prefer to wait. Much hinges on Austria, because then Sweden and Finland would be unable to organise their own referendums. Austrian negotiators, however, are optimistic all will work out on the day. Polls show a consistent, albeit narrow, pro-EU majority. They show that Europe is now seen as the most important Austrian issue -- above immigration, jobs and terrorism. Pundits are predicting a 55 per cent majority in favour of Europe, but many voters are still undecided and the government cannot count its chickens before they hatch. The small Green Party is divided, but opposed to Maastricht. Joerg Haider's Freedom Party is difficult to assess. The new Liberal Party is pro-European. Come 28 February, exhausted negotiators will sign an agreement with the EU. It is inconceivable that this will falter over 50,000 tonnes of milk, or six or nine years for transit traffic, or Ecu50 million more or less of subsidies. After June, Austria can look forward to becoming a full member of a united Europe -- which is where it has always belonged.
