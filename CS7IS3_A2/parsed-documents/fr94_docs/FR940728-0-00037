FR940728-0-00037 FR940728-0-00012 Department of the Air Force 32 CFR Part 855 Use of United States Air Force Installations by Other Than United States Department of Defense Aircraft AGENCY: Department of the Air Force, DOD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of the Air Force has added provisions for alternate use of Air Force airfields by commercial air carriers that have contracted to participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program. It is necessary to identify the CRAF Alternate as a purpose for which the Air Force will grant civil aircraft landing permits. The availability of Air Force airfields for use as alternates by CRAF carriers is intended to encourage greater participation in the CRAF program, which is structured to meet military airlift requirements during military emergencies that involve US forces. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mrs. R. A. Young, HQ USAF/XOOBC, 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Room 5C966, Washington DC 20330&hyph;1480, telephone (703) 697&hyph;5967. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of the Air Force has determined that this proposed rule is not a major rule because it will not have an annual adverse effect on the economy of $100 million or more. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, Installations & Environment) has certified that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612 because this rule does not have a significant economic impact on small entities as defined by the Act, and does not impose any obligatory information requirements beyond internal Air Force use.
