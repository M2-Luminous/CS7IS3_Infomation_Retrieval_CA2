FBIS4-31453 "dreeu111__a94022" FBIS-EEU-94-111-A Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 ANNEX Poland Walesa's Office: No KGB Files on Solidarity Walesa's Office: No KGB Files on Solidarity LD0806120094 Warsaw PAP in English 1144 GMT 8 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY LD0806120094 Warsaw PAP English BFN [Text] Warsaw, June 8 -- The documents handed to President Lech Walesa by Russian President Boris Yeltsin during his official Polish visit in August 1993 do not contain files of the Committee of State Security (KGB) on the Solidarity trade union movement leaders, the presidential press office has told the Polish Press Agency (PAP). This information is connected with the recently-published book of Boris Yeltsin suggesting that he had given Walesa the KGB files. Last month, President Walesa told the "Wiadomosci" main TV news bulletin that the suggestions included in the book are a misunderstanding. In August 1993, Yeltsin gave Walesa the copies of the archival documentation of the so-called Suslov commission on the introduction of martial law in Poland in 1981. In 1993, the eight documents were published in Poland in the book "The Documents -- The Suslov File." The presidential press office also released the text of a conversation between Krakow's radio station "RMF" Moscow correspondent Waldemar Gontarski with press spokesman of the Russian state committee for Russia's archives Nikolay Berezovski. The latter was asked whether Walesa had published all Suslov files and whether there was any evidence against the Polish president. Berezowski is quoted as telling Gontarski "why don't you believe your president, after all President Boris Yeltsin handed over the file to Lech Walesa in the presence of a great number of journalists." "As an official representative of the committee for the Russian Federation's archives I have grounds to state that President Lech Walesa tells the truth when he says that (Walesa) has published the complete Suslov file."
