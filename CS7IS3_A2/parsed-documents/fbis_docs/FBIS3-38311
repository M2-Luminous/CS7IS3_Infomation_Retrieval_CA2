Speaking before the plenary session of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, Galanos argued that Turkey did not comply with the Council's principles, nor did it respect democratic processes, human rights or international law and order. In an interview with the Cyprus radio, the House president warned that this time he did not intend to put Turkey's membership of the Council to the vote and asked that double standards policies for existing members and new members be abolished. He believed it was high time this matter was dealt with directly to avert the possibility of allowing the Turkish Cypriots to upgrade their representation to the Council and consequently pave the way for recognition of their illegal administration in Cyprus' Turkish-occupied areas. Turkish troops invaded and occupied 37 per cent of the republic's territory. Turkey has refused to comply with U.N. resolutions calling for the immediate withdrawal of its troops from the island. "We are fighting a big battle in the Council of Europe," Galanos said and advocated an enlarged Cypriot representation to carry on the battle for Cyprus. Meanwhile, the island is playing host to Lord Finsberg, rapporteur for the Cyprus problem at the Political Committee of the Council of Europe. Lord Finsberg, here for contacts to prepare a report on Cyprus, met Monday [31 January] with President Glavkos Kliridhis. Later in the day, he had a meeting with U.N. secretary-general's resident representative to Cyprus Gustave Feissel. He told Cyprus radio after the meeting that judging from what he had heard at his meetings here, he believed talks on the Cyprus issue would yield good results.
