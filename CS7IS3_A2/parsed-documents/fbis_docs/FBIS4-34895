Lula will tell them that he intends to finance his economic program through the creation of solidarity funds. Although the Lula administration will seek agreement with the richest sectors of Brazilian society, it will also tax large fortunes by regulating existing constitutional article. For Lula, who arrived in Bonn this evening, this is not a new measure; it is in practice in several European countries, including Germany and France. One of the main concerns of the German reporters who met with Lula today was how an eventual PT administration will treat foreign investments. "I want investments that will produce results in the social field. Germany is a good example of this," Lula said. Nearly all German investments in Brazil are in the productive sector. Today in Mainz, Lula met with Rudolf Sharping, president of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), with whom he discussed the foreign debt. PT government platform coordinator Marco Aurelio Garcia calmed Sharping by saying: "The PT criticizes the foreign debt agreement signed by the Brazilian Government, but will respect it as long as it does not affect our exchange reserves or our government program financing." The PT government program requires funds to fight unemployment and misery, and to help education and the land distribution problem. Even though the PT belongs to Socialist International, it is contacting the European Social Democratic parties which are traditionally closer to the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] of Leonel Brizola and the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] of Fernando Henrique Cardoso. SPD President Rudolf Sharping was unable to explain quite why his party financed the trip of the PT candidate and his delegation to Europe. Sharping merely said the SPD is open to contacts with other Brazilian political parties. Lula said that although the PT does not belong to the Socialist International, it has always maintained good relations with the German SPD and other European social democratic parties which are concerned with social aspects.
