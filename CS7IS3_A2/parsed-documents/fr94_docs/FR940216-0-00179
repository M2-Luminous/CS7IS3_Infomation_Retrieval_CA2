FR940216-0-00179 FR940216-0-00010 (ii) The minimum NO X emissions reduction, for each gallon of averaged gasoline, shall be increased by an additional 1.0%. (2) In the event that a covered area for which required NO X emissions reductions have been made more stringent passes all NO X emissions reduction surveys in two consecutive years, the averaging standards for NO X emissions reduction for that covered area beginning in the year following the second year of passed survey series shall be made less stringent as follows: (i) The required average NO X emissions reduction shall be decreased by 1.0%; and (ii) The minimum NO X emissions reduction shall be decreased by 1.0%. (3) In the event that a covered area for which the required NO X emissions reductions have been made less stringent fails a subsequent NO X emissions reduction survey: (i) The required average NO X emission reductions for that covered area beginning in the year following this subsequent failure shall be made more stringent by increasing the required average and the minimum NO X emissions reduction by 1.0%; and (ii) The required NO X emission reductions for that covered area thereafter shall not be made less stringent regardless of the results of subsequent NO X emissions reduction surveys. (n) Effect of benzene survey failure. (1) On each occasion that a covered area fails a benzene content survey series, conducted pursuant to ยง80.68, the benzene content standards for that covered area beginning in the year following the year of the failure shall be made more stringent as follows: (i) The average benzene content shall be decreased by 0.05% by volume; and (ii) The maximum benzene content for each gallon of averaged gasoline shall be decreased by 0.10% by volume. (2) In the event that a covered area for which the benzene standards have been made more stringent passes all benzene content survey series conducted in two consecutive years, the benzene standards for that covered area beginning in the year following the second year of passed survey series shall be made less stringent as follows: (i) The average benzene content shall be increased by 0.05% by volume; and (ii) The maximum benzene content for each gallon of averaged gasoline shall be increased by 0.10% by volume. (3) In the event that a covered area for which the benzene standards have been made less stringent fails a subsequent benzene content survey series: (i) The standards for benzene content for that covered area beginning in the year following this subsequent failure shall be the more stringent standards which were in effect prior to the operation of paragraph (n)(2) of this section; and (ii) The standards for benzene content for that covered area thereafter shall not be made less stringent regardless of the results of subsequent benzene content surveys. (o) Effect of oxygen survey failure. (1) In any year that a covered area fails an oxygen content survey series, conducted pursuant to ยง80.68, the minimum oxygen content requirement for that covered area beginning in the year following the year of the failure is made more stringent by increasing the minimum oxygen content standard, for each gallon of averaged gasoline, by an additional 0.1%; however, in no case shall the minimum oxygen content standard be greater than 2.0%. (2) In the event that a covered area for which the minimum oxygen content standard has been made more stringent passes all oxygen content survey series in two consecutive years, the minimum oxygen content standard for that covered area beginning in the year following the second year of passed survey series shall be made less stringent by decreasing the minimum oxygen content standard by 0.1%. (3) In the event that a covered area for which the minimum oxygen content standard has been made less stringent fails a subsequent oxygen content survey series: (i) The standard for minimum oxygen content for that covered area beginning in the year following this subsequent failure shall be made more stringent by increasing the minimum oxygen content standard by 0.1%; and (ii) The minimum oxygen content standard for that covered area thereafter shall not be made less stringent regardless of the results of subsequent oxygen content surveys. (p) Effective date for changed minimum or maximum standards. In the case of any minimum or maximum standard that is changed to be more stringent by operation of paragraphs (k), (m), (n), or (o) of this section, the effective date for such change shall be ninety days following the date EPA announces the change. (q) Refineries, importers, and oxygenate blenders subject to adjusted standards. Standards for average compliance that are adjusted to be more or less stringent by operation of paragraphs (k), (l), (m), (n), or (o) of this section apply to averaged reformulated gasoline produced at each refinery or oxygenate blending facility, or imported by each importer as follows: (1) Adjusted standards for a covered area apply to averaged reformulated gasoline that is produced at a refinery or oxygenate blending facility if:
