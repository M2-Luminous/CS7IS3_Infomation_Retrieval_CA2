FR940920-1-00094 FR940920-1-00008 Based on the new data submitted and on the final choice of which test data to utilize, the EPA may promulgate final emission guidelines that are more or less stringent than those proposed today. The following sections IV.F.4.c through IV.F.4.j present the EPA's rationale for selecting MACT for each pollutant for MWC's at small MWC facilities. c. MACT for Sulfur Dioxide for Small MWC Plants. Uncontrolled SO 2 emissions from MWC's are typically about 160 ppmv, and the MACT floor for SO 2 for small MWC plants is 120 ppmv. Therefore, MACT will require SO 2 reduction of about 35 percent compared to uncontrolled levels. Dry sorbent injection/ESP systems can achieve greater than 50-percent reductions in SO 2 , and can satisfy the MACT floor requirements. Retrofitting a new SD/FF system would achieve greater acid gas control and small additional reductions in other MWC pollutants, but the associated costs of such retrofits at small MWC's would be prohibitively high (greater than $10,000/Mg of acid gas reduction). Although the MACT floor requires SO 2 control to only 120 ppmv, the incremental cost of operating a DSI/ESP system to achieve 80 ppmv (about a 50-percent reduction) versus 120 ppmv is small and results in improved cost effectiveness. Therefore, the MACT guideline proposed for SO 2 is more stringent than the MACT floor and is proposed at a level of either 80 ppmv or 50-percent reduction (24-hour averaging period), whichever is less stringent. The EPA recognizes that costs associated with the proposed acid gas control retrofit requirements for small MWC plants are not insignificant. Small MWC plants represent about 10 percent of the national MWC capacity to be retrofitted with acid gas control systems, and their associated cost burden would be about 15 percent of the national cost of the proposal. On a national basis, the retrofit of acid gas controls to small MWC plants would cost about $60 million annually and the retrofit of acid gas controls to large MWC plants would be about $340 million annually. As discussed above, the MACT floor for small MWC plants is 120 ppmv and would require about 35-percent SO 2 control (reduction). This could be achieved by application of a DSI/ESP scrubbing system. The proposal, however, goes beyond the MACT floor requirements and would establish MACT at 80 ppmv or 50-percent SO 2 reduction based on the application of a DSI/ESP at its full optimal capability. Even at optimal conditions, acid gas scrubbing on MWC units at small plants has a higher control cost ($/Mg acid gas removed) than for MWC units at large plants. In fact, acid gas control costs for small plants ($/Mg acid gas removed) are more than twice those for large plants. In the final regulations, the EPA is considering the alternative of establishing acid gas control requirements for small MWC plants at the level required by the MACT floor (120 ppmv or 35-percent reduction). The EPA requests comment and data supporting the achievability of a 120 ppmv MACT floor level (24-hour geometric average, corrected to 7 percent O 2 ) without the use of a scrubbing system. Additionally, the EPA requests data and information on alternative acid gas control technologies that could be applied to MWC units at small plants to comply with a 120 ppmv floor level at a lower cost than a DSI/ESP system. Because some MWC units at small existing MWC plants are operated at a low annual capacity factor and because the cost effectiveness of acid gas control is sensitive to annual capacity factor, the EPA requests comment on the appropriateness of subcategorizing MWC units at small plants by annual capacity factor before determining the MACT floor. The reanalysis after subcategorizing by annual capacity factor may conclude that MACT for low capacity MWC units is less restrictive than MACT for high capacity MWC units at small existing plants.
