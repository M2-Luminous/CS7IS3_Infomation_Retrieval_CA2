Including Slovenia in the NATO framework would mean increasing the distance from the harrowing confines of the former Yugoslavia. The administration as well as the parliament have already decided in favor of Slovene observer status in the North Atlantic Council for Cooperation, in which East and Central European countries and the former Warsaw Pact members cooperate with NATO. The concept of Partnership for Peace offers new opportunities which would eventually pave the way to regular NATO membership. This Western military alliance is supposed to satisfy two demands: that of the former Warsaw Pact members seeking new security assurances and that of Russia opposing NATO expansion to its borders.
