The report on the electricity sector recommended a new rate per kilowatt hour that the INDE [National Electricity Institute] sells to the EEGSA [Empresa Electrica de Guatemala, S.A. -- Guatemalan Electric Power Company]. This will lead to an increase when the new rates take effect. De Leon Carpio indicated that "I already have the report," adding that the Guatemalan people can be certain that he will analyze the report carefully with his advisers. Nevertheless, he said "we will continue with the subsidy, as recommended." He said his government has a policy of subsidizing the direct customer and that "this policy will have to continue until it no longer can be maintaisned." He said he is very aware of the country's situation so he does not want to economically harm the poorest people.
