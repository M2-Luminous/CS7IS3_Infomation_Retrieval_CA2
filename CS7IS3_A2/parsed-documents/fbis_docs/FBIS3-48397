Having formulated this policy on 22 January, the NUB is going to discuss concrete curricula in the course of education and to implement them from April at the earliest. For those who visited North Korea in the past in connection with North-South dialogue including high-level talks and sports talks, the Agency for National Security Planning conducted prior education. However, no education was conducted in advance for separated family members and businessmen who wanted to contact North Korean residents in a third country. According to the new policy, the separated family members and businessmen who want to visit North Korea or to meet their relatives and friends living in North Korea will be required to attach to the request for visit to North Korea a statement on personal background, the exit report and permit, North Korean side's memorandum on insurance of personal safety, and a certificate of completion of education by the NUB.
