The prime minister-designate said that equally serious problems are waiting to be solved in all ministries. [Szombathy] After the signing of the coalition agreement between the MSZP and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], you said that you were expecting a congress of clarifying debates on 26 June. Were you surprised that there were hardly any objections and the coalition agreement was ratified with an overwhelming majority? [Horn] There must be a misunderstanding here because the ratification of the coalition agreement was the chief goal of this congress. We made this clear at the very beginning, indicating that it is impossible to change the text of the agreement, that it can only be rejected or accepted. Naturally, debates on accepting the text and on the document must not be banned at a congress; in fact, it is actually positive to give ground to this since this is a democratic and highest level party forum. Many contributors expressed doubts but the skeptical people also supported the agreement. The debates had taken place prior to this because the coalition agreement was a result of a very serious teamwork in the background, it was not prepared by two or three people. In February, we were given authorization to assert the party's program in the talks. [Szombathy] Previously, it was said that, as opposed to the SZDSZ delegation's mandate, the MSZP's leadership would also have to have the list of political state secretaries approved by the congress. [Horn] This remark is justified but I asked the congress to grant me some time to select the political state secretaries. The coordination talks are under way, therefore, the congress gave authorization, so I will submit the list of political state secretarial names to the national board of directors. The postponement has simple reasons: It was decided at the last minute which party will provide the ministers and state secretaries in the various ministries, and personnel issues were decided at the last minute. These issues cannot be ignored when the political state secretaries are selected. I would like the Socialist ministers themselves to decide whom they wish as MSZP-member state secretaries and with whom they would prefer to work together. [Szombathy] On 26 June, MSZP members to fill the positions in parliamentary committees were also selected. Why did Matyas Szuros, former Socialist chairman of the parliament, not get any positions in any of the committees? [Horn] The nominating committee drew up the list of names of committee officers and members. In the course of this, Szuros was not nominated for any of the positions. It would be good if Szuros could, for example, think about representing or leading the Hungarian section of the Interparliamentary Union, but this will be his decision. [Szombathy] It might have been noticed that Janos Hajdu, whose running in the elections created a big stir, was not given a position either. [Horn] I cannot determine this because I was not part of the nominating committee. I do not know if his name was raised at all. [Szombathy] You have indicated that the new government might still have surprises when the country's economic situation is examined. If this is so, is it possible that the government's room for maneuver will become narrower, and can operational problems arise? Will unpopular measures be inevitable? [Horn] They cannot influence the government's operation -- I did not mean these kinds of surprises -- only its room for maneuver. I could not by any means accept measures that reduce our popularity because, however bad the country's situation is, it is not so catastrophic that the only solution would be unpopular measures. There is a way out, a possibility to solve the problems but only through emphasizing social sensitivity. I will not by any means be a partner to any such measures that would unilaterally damage the situation of the society's decisive majority. On the basis of what I have learned so far, we will not take such measures. One factor has to be taken into consideration: The situation of citizens and their equality of opportunity will not improve to the extent they would expect. If they have faith in the new government then the tasks can be resolved step by step. People can be certain that their situation, living conditions, and sense of security will significantly improve within four years. Achieving this would indicate the government's successful operation. [Szombathy] As a result of the coalition agreement, the MSZP received a large number of ministries that control critical areas and are interested in distribution. In your position as prime minister, at which ministries and between which ministries do you expect the biggest debates or crises? [Horn] I do not think that I could name any ministries that do not have difficulties at the moment, be it defense, industry, or the environmental ministry. The problems are big and the demands are huge everywhere. The expert public has great expectations and it is difficult to meet these. All ministries have serious problems awaiting urgent measures. The level of these difficulties is the same in all areas and ministries.
