FR940511-0-00020 FR940511-0-00009 FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY 44 CFR Part 206 RIN 3067&hyph;AC23 Disaster Assistance; Hazard Mitigation and Relocation Assistance AGENCY: Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). ACTION: Interim rule. SUMMARY: This interim rule increases the Federal share for eligible hazard mitigation and relocation assistance projects from a maximum of 50 percent to 75 percent, increases the total amount of grant assistance available for each disaster, and places restrictions on property acquisition and relocation projects. The intent of the changes is to carry out the Hazard Mitigation and Relocation Assistance Act of 1993, which provides new flexibility in hazard mitigation and relocation assistance to States. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 11, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert F. Shea, Chief, Program Implementation Division, room 417, 500 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646&hyph;3619. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The President signed the Hazard Mitigation and Relocation Assistance Act (the Act), Pub. L. 103&hyph;181, on December 3, 1993. The Act amends Section 404 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act), 42 U.S.C. 5170c, to increase the Federal contribution to 75 percent, to increase the limit on Federal expenditures, and to place restrictions on property acquisition and relocation project grants. This interim rule amends 44 CFR part 206 to implement the Act. We amend the definition of grant to include the newly established limit on the total grant award. The Act states that the grant award for hazard mitigation shall not exceed 15 percent of the total estimated Federal grant assistance (excluding administrative costs) provided under the Stafford Act. Grant assistance is available under Sections 403, 406, 407, 408, 410, 411, 416, and 601 of the Stafford Act. FEMA will estimate the amount of assistance provided under these sections based on available data summarized in the damage survey reports and the Disaster Management and Projections report. FEMA will include in this total the cost of mission assignments to other agencies that provide functions that would normally be funded as grant assistance. The Act increases from 50 percent to 75 percent the maximum Federal contribution of the cost of hazard mitigation measures, and increases total grant awards from 10 percent of Section 406 to 15 percent of the total estimated Federal assistance under the Stafford Act. Under the Act, FEMA must restrict the eligibility of projects involving property acquisition and relocation assistance for property owners and structures. An eligible applicant must enter an agreement with the Director of FEMA that provides assurances that the property will be dedicated and maintained in perpetuity for uses compatible with open space, recreational, or wetlands management practices, and no future Federal disaster assistance in any form will be sought or given with respect to the property. No structures can be built on these properties unless they are public facilities and functionally related to open space usage and are open on all sides, or are rest rooms. The Director may approve other structures, in writing and before construction begins. The Director's approval will be granted rarely, and when granted, buildings must be compatible with open space, recreational, or wetlands management practices and be in accordance with sound floodplain management. The Act makes the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 inapplicable to properties damaged by flooding during the 1993 Midwest Floods when certain conditions are met. We define the conditions under which acquisition of certain properties in nine midwestern States is not subject to the Uniform Relocation Act. The intent and effect of this provision is to simplify and speed the acquisition and relocation process in the nine States severely affected by the Midwest Floods of 1993. National Environmental Policy Act This rule is excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR part 10, Environmental Consideration. No environmental assessment has been prepared.
