This will be the key phrase at the forthcoming Atlantic alliance summit in Brussels. But even this phrase, which indicates the alliance's possible opening toward the East, is not undisputed. It was not the French or the Germans who voiced doubts, but the British. During the marathon talks on the communique, which always precede important conferences, London was worried that the gradual inclusion of "interested" East European countries could turn into a slide leading to incalculable risks. This is, of course, something everybody wants to avoid, including the U.S., who coined the phrase quoted above. The Partnership for Peace model, envisaged as a number of bilateral agreements with the former frontline states of the Warsaw Pact, is double-edged. It provides for military cooperation that remains below the threshold of the NATO guarantee for mutual assistance and does not exclude consultations in the event of a threat to political independence and security. The states will not be under the "roof," but under its shadow. The heads of state and government are highly interested in including Russia in a comprehensive security structure -- but not in this specific partnership model. The school of thought trying to achieve this as well will not succeed. On the other hand, any signs indicating that Russia is actively excluded from the European security framework are to be avoided. It is doubtful whether this will succeed. Russian politics thinks in conspiratorial ways as a matter of principle -- the changes have left this unaltered. The fear of being isolated spreads quickly, and it can be spread quickly -- refusing a visa can be enough. Following Lithuania's formal application for membership, Yeltsin once again explicitly warned NATO against "expansion." His Brussels statement that he would have to "build a Berlin Wall" on the Russian border, if necessary, has never been denied. The question, discussed since Travemuende, as to whether the Partnership for Peace model with bilateral agreements and operative measures is the final or the starting point for NATO expansion will not be answered after the summit either. For the alliance, this process, which goes far beyond the club-like character of the Cooperation Council, is a great achievement. But on the other hand, the countries of East Europe know that there is no alternative to a formal integration into the alliance and its guarantee of assistance. The terminally ill Hungarian [Prime Minister] Antall summed it all up like this: "Yeltsin is ill, Zhirinovksiy is healthy." Speaking in Brussels in December, Ukraine Chief of Staff Lopata described Moscow's policy of trying to destabilize his country. He quoted a proverb: "When it gets cold in Moscow, Kiev freezes over." The East Europeans cannot help but be dissatisfied. The worst thing that could happen to these states is that the past is continued in a new "intermediate Europe." In Warsaw, Prague, and Budapest, where all sorts of crises have led to a high level of clear-sightedness, one speaks of the West's historical and moral failure. This is also said with a view to the Balkans. And this has had its effects. Lopata said there are two schools of thought in Ukraine: One wants to orient itself toward the West, the other toward Moscow. All the countries in our eastern vicinity will get to this crossroads tomorrow or the day after. These states are looking for support from West Europe and the United States. But their aspirations could well end in a repetition of old tragedies. Germany would be involved in this tragedy. For, unless partnership with NATO can be turned into membership, that is, if NATO's opening up remains limited and does not offer any real security, Germany will lose the historic opportunity of being "surrounded by friends" -- as Volker Ruehe put it -- for the first time since it became a nation state. Germany would not be able to push through this vision against its partners' will in NATO's Arthur's Round. But even Germany does not vehemently speak out for this opportunity, which is dependent on the given times and situations, and which, like the "window" with which it is compared, is already closing again.
