Considered as salaries earned in Romania are salaries paid in money and in kind, received by employees from persons or legal entities who reside or are headquartered in Romania, as well as salaries received from abroad by persons who conduct their activities in Romania. Not subject to the provisions of Para. 1 and 2 are salaries and compensations in foreign currency, established as net amounts, paid by Romanian public institutions to Romanian personnel conducting their activities in diplomatic missions, consular offices, and other forms of Romanian representation abroad. Article 2 Salary income and other taxable salary-related rights include all payments received during a month, independently of the period they cover, and which are obtained from: a) Salaries of any sort; b) Raises of any sort; c) Compensations of any sort; d) Profit sharing incentives, rewards, and bonuses of any sort; e) Social security payments in case of temporary work disability and maternity; f) Rest leave periods; g) Any other earnings in money or in kind received in payment for work, from employing persons or legal entities, including those obtained on the basis of collective work contracts, with the exception of those in kind paid to hired household help; h) Payments to employees in the form of indexing or compensation for price and rate increases; i) Payments to founding members of commercial companies formed with public shares, as apportionment of net profits, in accordance with Art. 30 of Law No. 31/1990. Products tendered as payment in kind are evaluated at their sale price per unit for products produced in-house and at their purchase price for other products, and in the case of services, at the rate charged for those services. Prices and rates are those in effect at the time of the payments in kind. Article 3 By derogation from the provisions of the previous article, salaries and other salary-related rights or discrepancies from those paid in the past on the basis of final court judgements, on direct initiative of the employing persons or legal entities, or as a result of procedures stipulated in Art. 13 of the present law, are deferred from the tax for the months to which they apply, and are cumulated with the rights received during the respective months. The provisions of Para. 1 also apply to salary differentials for periods previous to the months in which they are paid on the basis of salary regulations, as well to vacation compensation when the duration of the latter is greater than a calendar month, and to payments made on the basis of the provisions of Art. 2, letter (i).

Payments for inventions and innovations during a calendar year are tax deferred over the 12 months of the year, cumulating with other compensations of this nature paid by units during the respective year, even if their value covers a period greater than one year. If the payments cover a period shorter than one year, they are tax deferred over the months which they cover. These rights are not cumulative for taxation with other income from units in which employees serve their basic function. Article 5 Not included in taxable monthly incomes and not taxed are: a) Payments based on work contracts, on statutes and legal provisions, as a result of shifts or transfers of employees to other locations in the interest of their job, payments covering moving expenses in the interest of the job, as well as compensation attendant to new hires; b) Payments to employees for work during layoff notice periods; c) Assistance received under legal conditions from social security and welfare, as well as salary assistance for births and the death of employees; d) Pensions of any sort; e) Allocations, compensations, and any other payments of this nature to persons with children, with the exception of those in Art. 2, letter (e), as well as support allocations to persons who were entrusted with or assigned family placement of minors; f) Free meals and therapeutic nutrition dispensed in kind according to law.

Article 7 Income taxes are calculated monthly, at each work site, on the total income received during the past month by each employee, on the basis of the following rates: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Taxable Monthly Income |Monthly Tax | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Up to 2,700 |5% | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2,701 -- 3,000 |135 + 8% over 2,700 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |3,001 -- 4,000 |159 + 14% over 3,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |4,001 -- 6,800 |299 + 17% over 4,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |6,801 -- 11,000 |775 + 18% over 6,800 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |11,001 -- 16,400 |1,531 + 19% over 11,800 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |16,401 -- 27,700 |2,557 + 20% over 16,400 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |27,701 -- 38,600 |4,817 + 21% over 27,700 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |38,601 -- 54,900 |7,106 + 22% over 38,600 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |54,901 -- 82,400 |10,692 + 25% over 54,900 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |82,401 -- 110,000 |17,567 + 28% over 82,400 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |110,001 -- 137,500 |25,295 + 32% over 110,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |137,501 -- 157,400 |34,095 + 36% over 137,500 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |over 157,400 |41,259 + 40% over 157,400 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The portion of the total taxable monthly income that exceeds 300,000 lei is taxed at the rate of 60 percent. When these tax rates reduce the net monthly income of an employee at the unit where he serves his basic function to under 7,600 lei, the tax is reduced so as to ensure this amount of income. Income in the form of salaries and other salary-related rights received by employees for work performed outside of their basic functions and outside the units which hold their work cards is taxed separately at each work site at the rate stipulated in Para. 1 of this article, with the tax increasing by 30 percent. In the case of salaries and other salary-related rights in foreign currency, the tax is calculated by an exchange to lei at the exchange rate valid on the last day of the month in which the payment is made, after which the tax in lei established on the basis of the rates in Para. 1 is converted, withheld, and deposited in the budget, in foreign currency, at the same exchange rate. Together with indexing, as well as for salary compensation allowances, the government will appropriately modify the taxable monthly income categories stipulated in Para. 1, the amounts established by Para. 2 and 3 of the present article, as well as the amount indicated in Art. 6, letter (c) of the present law, so as not to annul the effect of the indexing or compensation. Article 8 The income tax is calculated by payers and is withheld monthly from the amounts due on the second 15-day period of the month. For the monetary rights stipulated by Art. 4 of the present law, taxes are calculated and withheld at each payment, by cumulating the amounts paid previously during the same month by the same payer. If the payer has a bank account, the income tax is withheld and disbursed together with the collection of the amounts to be paid for the second half of the month. When the amounts for payment of salaries in Rumania or to or from abroad are collected, banks must verify the withholding and disbursement of the income tax to the budget of the central public administration. Article 9 Excess income tax is returned to employees by the payer within 30 days of the date when the overpayment is discovered. Reimbursement of the amounts withheld in excess, can be made for a period of three years following the date they were withheld. Income tax not withheld in time or in legal amounts is withheld by the payer of the income from the respective employees for a period of three years following the date of discovery. Withholding can be carried out in equal installments over a maximum of 12 months from the time of discovery of the failure to withhold. If the income tax can no longer be recovered from the respective employee, it is paid by the payer of the salary. Article 10 Persons or legal entities who have employees as part of their activities must file every six months, with the financial agency within whose jurisdiction they reside or are headquartered, a report of the calculation, withholding, and disbursement of income tax to the budget of the central public administration. Specialized economic entities, defined according to law, will file this report with the Ministry of Finance. Article 11 An increase of 0.3 percent for each day of delay is charged for failure to disburse income tax on time (see Government Ordinance No. 14 of 17 August 1992, published in MONITORUL OFICIAL, Part I, No. 209 of 26 August 92, whose provisions became effective on 1 September 1992). Article 12 Audits of the calculation, withholding, and disbursement of income tax are conducted by the fiscal agencies with whom the salary payers must file reports one the calculation, withholding, and disbursement of income tax. Article 13 Within 30 days from the date of income tax withholding, employees can file complaints with the persons or legal entities that employ them, against the manner in which the provisions of the present law are implemented by these persons or entities. Within 30 days from the date of the filing of the complaint, the person or legal entity acting as employer must recheck the manner in which the taxable monthly income is determined, and in which the tax is paid, and must issue a decision that will include the results of the reexamination. The decision will be communicated to the respective employee. Article 14 Within 30 days from the date when the decision is communicated by the employer, the employee can file an appeal addressed to the general directorate of public finances and state financial control in whose jurisdiction the person or legal entity resides or is headquartered, with the directorate being under obligation to resolve the appeal within 30 days from the filing of the appeal. The appeal is resolved through a decision communicated to the respective employee. Within 30 days from the communication of the decision of the general directorate of public finances and state financial control, the employee can file an appeal with the Ministry of Finance, who must resolve it within 40 days from its filing. The resolution of the Ministry of Finance is final and is communicated to the respective employee. Article 15 Challenges and appeals regarding income tax are exempt from the stamp tax. Article 16 In soundly justified cases, the Ministry of Finance can allow installments or the postponement of income tax payment, and installments, postponements, reductions, or exemptions of payment of late penalties. Article 17 The following are offenses unless they are considered infractions according to penal law: a) Failure to file a report of the calculation, withholding, and disbursement of income tax within 15 days from the closing of a six-month period; b) Refusal to make available to fiscal agencies, documents regarding the calculation, withholding, and disbursement of income tax to the state budget. The offense under letter (a) is fined by 50,000 to 150,000 lei, and the offense under letter (b) by 100,000 to 200,000 lei (also see Part IV of the Appendix to Government Ordinance No. 23 of 21 August 1992, published in MONITORUL OFICIAL, Part I, No. 213, of 28 August 1992).

Banks will execute these instruments without the consent of the payer.

Article 21 In order to generally assure the same amount of net income, the supplements established in the form of percentages of salary rates are maintained at the same level and will apply to basic salaries.

Article 22 The salary rights granted after the present law becomes effective are established as gross amounts. Article 23 The rights of compensation granted as part of social security and paid vacation for the care of children of up to one year of age, continue to be calculated on the basis of established rates, applied to the gross salaries that constitute the basis of calculation. Similarly, social security pensions, military pensions, and supplementary pensions continue to be calculated on the basis of existing rates according to law on the date of application of the present law. If both net and gross salaries are included in the period considered for pension determination, the basis of calculation of the pensions is the average of these salaries determined according to law.
