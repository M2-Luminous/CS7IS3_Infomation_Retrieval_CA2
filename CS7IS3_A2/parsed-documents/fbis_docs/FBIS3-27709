Ocampo's designation to the powerful finance portfolio has been floated around for quite sometime. Apparently, Malacanang has received favorable feedbacks on him, especially from the business community. The finance post was vacated in May 1993 when the nomination of then Finance Secretary Ramon del Rosario Jr. was rejected by the Commission on Appointments [CA]. Leung, a competent technical man who shuns publicly, was not keen on being named the permanent finance secretary, a Malacanang source said. Leung has been an old hand in the finance department having served as assistant finance secretary during the Aquino administration. President Ramos scouted for candidates for the finance portfolio from the private sector. But his efforts were unsuccessful because of the sad fate of Del Rosario at the hands of the CA. The president appointed Leung to two important positions -- as president of the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) and chairman of the Central Bank board of liquidators effective 1 February 1994. The Board of Liquidators has the task of disposing of the assets and liabilities of the old Central Bank. The president also designated DBP Vice Chairman Alfredo Antonio as officer in charge of the DBP, effective 1 February, said Ocampo.
