"China's ambitious program of trade and economic reforms has contributed greatly to bringing China more closely into line with the world trading system," he told the 1994 China summit meeting which opened here today. In his speech entitled "Global Multilateral Trading System: The Role of the People's Republic of China," he said that observing the Chinese economy in the process of reform, one could see that China is essentially doing "autonomously" what the world trade organization would in any case oblige it to do. "China is to be congratulated on its most recently announced program of liberalization and reform," he said, since "China's economic reforms have given a far greater role to market forces and have led to a rapid liberalization of its foreign trade regime. "I am sure that producers, traders and consumers the world over, including those in China, are keen to see full implementation of these and other announced reforms." He said that given the magnitude of China's economy and the likelihood that China would assume a leading role in shaping the global economic environment of the next century, it was of critical importance that close attention be paid to the manner in which China proceeds with its full integration into the world trade organization.
