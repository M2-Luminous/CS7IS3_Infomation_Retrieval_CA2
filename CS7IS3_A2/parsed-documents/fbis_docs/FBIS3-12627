He said Iran as the great neighbour of the two republics is concerned about problems of the region and feels its responsibility to help settle the crisis. Tehran puts emphasis against escalation of the almost six-year-old conflict and calls for peaceful steps to put an end to the fighting, he said. "The Islamic Republic of Iran denounces occupation of Azerbaijani territory," said Va'ezi, adding "we believe the Armenians should withdraw from all occupied areas and obstacles should be removed through political talks." He said Iran held consultations with Russian officials to hold a quadruple meeting involving Tehran, Moscow, Baku and Yerevan, to help end the crisis. Asked about his talks with his Armenian counterpart, Lypartian who visited Tehran earlier this week, Va'ezi said that issues related to the region and Karabakh and ways to end the crisis as well as issues of mutual interests were the topics of the talks. "We informed the Armenian side about the problems possible escalation of the fighting could pose for Iranian interests," he added. He said that he believes the Armenian side has seriously taken into account Tehran's position.
