The decision was taken upon the demand of Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov. Later, the president presented his explanations for the postponement of the vote to a parliament closed-doors meeting. Earlier Meshkov had been repeatedly calling on the lawmakers "not to heighten temperature" on the peninsula. Amid mounting tension in the Crimea, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk disbanded on Thursday law enforcement ministries of the self-style peninsula republic. According to a presidential decree which was signed on Thursday, Crimea's Interior Ministry was reorganised into a department of the Interior Ministry of Ukraine directly subordinated to Kiev. Thus all local police forces with their premises, weapons, transport means and other property were made responsible only to Kiev. Similar decrees have put under Kiev's control, Crimean Security Service and Ministry of Justice making bringing their status down to that of departments of respective Ukrainian ministries. By these decrees Kravchuk also appointed heads of the aforesaid departments. The regional parliament fired back and formally confirmed the appointment of Valeriy Kuznetsov full-fledged interior minister of the Crimea. Earlier he was appointed to the post by Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov. Earlier today the Crimea-based Black Sea Fleet reported that for the past 24 hours some 1,000 Ukrainian home guards and special forces had been dispatched to the Crimea including a group of saboteurs now deployed close to Sevastopol, the main base of the Black Sea Fleet. In his angry message the Ukrainian president today warned the Crimean parliament against "the revision of basic principles of relations between Ukraine and its integral part -- the Republic of Crimea". "The violation of these principles might lead to conflict situations and other unpredictable consequences", Kravchuk stressed. The Ukrainian president was even more resolute in his telephone conversation with President Boris Yeltsin that took place later in the day. The Ukrainian president's press service quoted him as saying that "Ukraine would take appropriate measures to preserve territorial integrity of the state". The Crimean parliament at its closed-doors meeting decided to postpone until Friday the discussion on reintroducing items of a 1992 draft constitution of the Crimean Republic which envisaged greater autonomy of the republic from Kiev. The lawmakers voted against a proposal to send a delegation to Kiev for negotiations with Ukraine's leadership. In retaliation to President Kravchuk's decrees bringing Crimean law enforcement bodies under direct control of Kiev, the lawmakers appointed Vladimir Lepikhov chairman of the Crimean Security Service, and Lyubov Yeliseyeva-Bora minister of justice.
