She has said that, despite the special efforts of several government institutions, the Army must deal with the extensive border across which arms and all types of goods are smuggled in; for this reason, it is impossible to have complete control, although civilian and military authorities do everything possible. Asked as to whether this problem could lead to a crisis at a time when the URNG [National Guatemalan Revolutionary Unity] is disarmed and disbanded, she has said the Army could not predict whether this situation would occur. She has recalled, however, that El Salvador experienced a great deal of problems once peace was signed due to the large number of arms that had remained in the country. She has said these problems are not expected to appear in Guatemala, because a large number of arms have been seized in Puebla, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Guatemala City. We know, however, that they possess a considerable number of arms and that they even sell arms illegally to the people to make a profit. As to whether these arms will end up directly in the hands of common criminals, she said the rebels have many of them and do with them whatever they pleas. She again recalled the Salvadoran case, where this did indeed occur. Vargas has said the Army, once peace is signed, expects more moves of common sense from the rebels regarding arms, thus showing their willingness to live in peace by taking those arms out of the Guatemalan market. She has said the government's Peace Commission, where the Army is represented, deals with aspects related to arms control, an issue which, in addition to a military advisory role, will surely be included on an agenda.
