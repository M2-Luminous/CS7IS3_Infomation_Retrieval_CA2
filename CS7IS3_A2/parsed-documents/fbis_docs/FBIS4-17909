This was disclosed at a Tuesday briefing in Alma-Ata [Almaty] by a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. He said Nazarbayev is not letting Eastern Turkestan, an organization of separatists from several Central Asian countries claiming territories in North China, to engage in subversive activities against China from Kazakhstan. The Kazakh leader also views Taiwan as an inseparable part of China. The spokesman said that the calls made at a Tuesday rally in Alma-Ata organized by the Nevada-Semipalatinsk movement and Eastern Turkestan to stop nuclear tests at Lobnor test ground are senseless because no nuclear tests are conducted there. The official said Li Peng invited Nazarbayev to visit China at a time suitable for him for the final settlement of remaining border problems.
