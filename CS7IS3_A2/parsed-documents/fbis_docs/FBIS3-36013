He spoke about the political course he is going to pursue as head of state. [Begin Hryb recording] I will do everything possible to make the work of the Supreme Soviet constructive and fruitful. I am addressing our opposition: We could eliminate this critical situation only through joint efforts. I am not for the establishment of single viewpoints on various issues, however, I am against idle criticism. I am appealing to you to show and prove through your actions and not by words alone that we are concerned with the destiny of our people. Only consolidation -- but not confrontation of all forces -- can help us. I want to stress that Belarusian mass media can play an important role in the consolidation of our people and can lessen the tension in our society. I wish our mass media to be critical and honest. I was elected Supreme Soviet chairman in a very complicated and difficult period. I know that our disabled people, pensioners, families with many children, students, servicemen, workers of the agricultural and industrial sectors, and scientists are living through hard times. However, I will not begin my work on this post with empty promises. I can promise one thing: I will always remember that laborious Belarusian people, who deserve a better life, support me. I will do everything possible to improve living standards of every Belarusian citizen and family. I hope for your understanding, your civil wisdom; I appeal to you for your support and comprehension. The destiny of Belarus, our Motherland, is currently in our hands. As for the relations of Belarus with foreign states, they will be prolonged and based on mutual respect, good neighbor relations, and mutually beneficial cooperation. [end recording] Later, lawmakers listened to the speeches of their colleagues on miscellaneous issues. After the speeches, People's Deputy Vasil Ivanavich Shaladonow, general prosecutor of the Republic of Belarus, took the rostrum and proposed including the issues on electing a new chairman of the Constitutional Committee and on criminal responsibility of two judges -- Eduard Klimyankow and Mikhail Klopaw -- into the agenda of the 13th Supreme Soviet session. The deputies agreed and these issues were included in the session's agenda. Next, Supreme Soviet Chairman Myechyslaw Hryb read the issues to be discussed by the deputies at this session. People's Deputy Alyaksandr Lukashenka criticized the deputies for not paying attention to what happened in this assembly hall the week before. It is necessary to conduct early Supreme Soviet elections and not to hide our heads in the sand, said Alyaksandr Lukashenka. Some deputies proposed discussing economic issues because the industrial and agricultural sectors are in a critical state.
