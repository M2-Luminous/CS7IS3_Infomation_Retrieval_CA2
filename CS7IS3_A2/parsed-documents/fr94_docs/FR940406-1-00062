FR940406-1-00062 FR940406-1-00018 48 CFR Parts 44 and 52 [FAR Case 92&hyph;40] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Contractors' Purchasing Systems Reviews and Subcontractor Consent AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing amendments to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to increase certain dollar thresholds regarding Contractors' Purchasing Systems Reviews (CPSR's) and Subcontractor Consent. These revisions are a result of recommendations submitted in response to the FAR Council's request for industry's views on the FAR. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before June 6, 1994, to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW., Room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 92&hyph;40 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Linda Klein at (202) 501&hyph;3775 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, Room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 92&hyph;40. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background We raised the threshold for performing CPSR's from $10 million to $25 million to recognize the effects of inflation on this threshold which had not been changed since 1980. The $25 million threshold will reduce administrative burden on both the Government and contractors by reducing the number of reviews performed annually and focuses the Government's attention on large dollar procurement systems. We raised the $10,000 threshold stated in the clause at 52.244&hyph;2(a)(4) to $25,000 for notification to the contracting officer on proposed subcontracts involving fabrication, purchase, rental, installation, or other acquisition of special test equipment or any items of facilities to recognize the increased costs of this type of equipment and the effects of inflation. We also raised the threshold in the clause at 52.244&hyph;2(b)(1) requiring additional information on certain subcontracts from $10,000 to $25,000. This increase recognizes rising hourly wage rates and contract costs. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. , because the rule reduces burden on contractors by reducing surveillance and by increasing dollar thresholds at which contractors are required to provide notification of intent to subcontract. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. (FAR case 92&hyph;40), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) is deemed to apply because the proposed rule contains information collection requirements. Accordingly, a request for approval of a new information collection requirement concerning Contractors' Purchasing Systems Reviews and Subcontractor Consent is being submitted to the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. Public comments concerning this request are invited through a notice document in this Federal Register issue. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 44 and 52 Government procurement. Dated: March 28, 1994.
