SUMMARY: Notice is given of the appointment of two new members and the reappointment of one member to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Scientific Advisory Panel established pursuant to section 25(d) of FIFRA, as amended (86 Stat. 973 and 89 Stat. 751; 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.). Public notice of nominees along with a request for public comments appeared in the Federal Register of February 24, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Robert B. Jaeger, Designated Federal Official, FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel (7509C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 819, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA (703) 305&hyph;5369. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Congress mandated that the Scientific Advisory Panel would consist of seven members, selected from candidates nominated by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Congress also mandated that the terms of appointment would be staggered. List of nominees, including biographical data, appeared in the Federal Register of February 24, 1993 (58 FR 11229). Six comments were received in response to the Notice. I appoint Dr. Mary S. Thrall and Dr. Charles C. Capen to serve as members of the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel. Dr. Thrall is Professor of Pathology at the College of Veterinary at Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at Colorado State University. She will provide the experience and technical background needed in the area of clinical pathology. Dr. Capen is Professor and Chair, Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Ohio State University and will provide expertise in endocrinology. My decision to appoint Drs. Thrall and Capen is based upon several factors, including comments received, their expertise in many facets of laboratory animal bioassays, particularly interpretation of clinical chemistries, hematology, clinical pathology and endocrinology, the consequences of such effects in relation to potential adverse effects in humans, the need for a disciplinary mix, and the need for broader scientific views. Furthermore, I reappoint Dr. John T. Wilson to an additional year on the Panel. Dr. Wilson is a pediatrician and pharmacologist with an extensive background in developmental and clinical pharmacology, clinical toxicology, immunology, and endocrinology as they relate to laboratory animals and to human infants and young children. He has provided invaluable scientific counsel to the Agency in addressing the concerns for pesticide residues in food and exposure to infants. Meetings of the Scientific Advisory Panel are always announced in the Federal Register at least 15 days prior to each meeting, in accordance with the directives of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
