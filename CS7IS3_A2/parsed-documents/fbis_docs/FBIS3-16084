This time more than half of the adult population came to the polls in Tatarstan, where the elections to the Federal Assembly were held again after the failure of December 12. On the eve of the elections President Mintimer Shaymiyev said that the republic had radically changed the political course. After the signing of the intergovernmental treaty with Russia, the people of Tatarstan decided to send their representatives to the federal parliament. Preliminary results will probably become known today, while the official results will be announced on Tuesday, a spokesman for the elections headquarters told ITAR-TASS. A little more than 37 per cent of electors came to the polling stations in Chuvashia. This figure reflects a tremendous difference in opinions, Chairman of the Republican Electoral Commission Anatoliy Ukhtiyarov believes. In a number of rural areas some 75 per cent of the adult population took part in the voting, while in Cheboksary the figure was 19 per cent, and in Novocheboksarsk even less than that. Thus, even before the preliminary results are announced, it is clear that repeated elections will be held in Chuvashia late in March. The struggle will be continued by the candidates who win the first and the second place. Today it will be known whether or not the rural areas of the republic managed to elect deputies in their constituencies with the first attempt. It is obvious now that the elections to the regional and city dumas were a success in the Kostroma region. Most constituencies managed to exceed the "25 per cent plus one" limit. In the evening it became clear that more than one third of the electors agree with the need to form new bodies of power to replace the soviets. Along with elections to the Duma, Kostroma became the first city in Russia to hold a referendum on the "city constitution," which is a kind of local government regulations. For the Constitution to become valid, it should have been supported by 50 per cent of Kostroma residents. However, only 25 per cent of the city residents came to the polling stations, and the referendum actually did not take place. Elections to the territorial legislative assembly and local government bodies failed to attract the needed number of electors in the Altay region. According to the preliminary results, received by ITAR-TASS at the regional electoral commission, 36.8 per cent of officially registered electors took part in the voting. Fifty candidates were vying for 15 seats in the legislative assembly of the Jewish autonomous region. The results show that the elections did take place in 12 constituencies. According to local government regulations, the assembly will be given the status of a local legislative authority, Chairman of the Regional Electoral Commission Yakov Sherman told ITAR-TASS. In three constituencies of Birobidzhan, where less than 25 per cent of electors turned up, repeated elections will be held. Birobidzhan March 14 TASS -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Gorelkin -- The 12 seats in the legislative assembly of the Jewish region were distributed in the following way: Four went to heads of local administrations, six -- to senior officials of industrial enterprises, one -- to a medic and one to an economist. An electoral campaign is going on in other Russian cities. It entered a decisive stage in the Novgorod region, where elections to the duma will be held on March 27. 143 candidates will vie for 27 seats. It will not be easy for residents of the Novgorod region to make a choice. This is also true of residents of the Novosibirsk region. However, according to the results of public opinion polls, only 40 per cent of them are going to take part in the voting on March 27 during the elections to the regional Council of Deputies. So far as the Chechen Republic (Chechnya) is concerned, its authorities refuse so much as to discuss elections and are very far from holding them. Movladiy Udugov, head of the information and press department of the republic, said laconically in a telephone interview with ITAR-TASS: "I know elections are taking place in some regions of Russia. As for us, we are getting prepared for the end of the Uraza celebrations." According to Udugov, Chechnya is more concerned now over the growing number of the acts of subversion and provocations, obviously aimed at again destabilising the situation in the republic. Khabarovsk March 14 TASS -- Elections, held on Sunday in the Khabarovsk region, revealed the names of 18 out of 25 deputies to the regional duma. Two thirds of the duma have been elected, and the new representative authority will soon start functioning. Candidates from the democratic choice bloc again suffered a crushing defeat. Only one of fifteen candidates was elected to the regional duma. Members of the Communist Party did not win the support of electors either. They will also have only one representative in the duma. Most deputies are industrial managers of various levels, as well as heads of local administrations, lawyers and servicemen. As a rule, they were all nominated by groups of electors. "On the whole, the results of the elections may be described as positive," Viktor Tsirfa, chairman of the regional electoral commission, told ITAR-TASS. "The defeat of the Democratic Choice, of other political parties and movements, can hardly be regarded as accidental. People are tired of confrontation, of the endless settlement of scores. I think, a large number of heads of state enterprises and business structures, elected to the duma, will make it possible for the new authority to work in a constructive way. In seven constituencies, where less than 25 per cent of electors came to the polls, or where most electors crossed out the names of all candidates, repeated elections will be held next autumn."
