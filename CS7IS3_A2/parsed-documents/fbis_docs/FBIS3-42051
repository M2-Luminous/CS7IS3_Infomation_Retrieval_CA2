Paek Nak-wan, director-general for European Affairs, met with Georgiy Toloraya, minister at the Russian Embassy in Seoul, and explained South Korea's interest in the matter and requested Moscow to disclose the scope of the sale. Latest press reports quoted a senior official at the Russian Pacific Fleet Command as saying Russia signed a contract to sell North Korea 10 Golf II class submarines not long after it exported four Fox-Trot class submarines to the communist country. The Golf II submarines are similar to the Fox-Trot types in size, but excel them in speed and cruising range and can carry three SS-N-5 ballistic missiles. Reports said that the sales were under condition that North Korea use the vessels for scrap. ``If these reports turn out all true, I hope that the vessels will indeed be used for scrap only,'' said Paek, ``but we express concern that North Korea might try to use the submarines for other purposes.''
