The federal Government says it has agreed to extend the mandate for providing peacekeepers to the UN force in Bosnia and Croatia for another six months. But it has refused to increase the number of soldiers Canada is providing. Michael McCullough reports: [McCullough] Canada's commitment to keep troops in Bosnia and Croatia was due to expire at the end of this month. For a time there seemed to be some legitimate doubt concerning whether or not Canada would renew that commitment. There were concerns about costs estimated at $180 million a year, and Prime Minister Cretien openly wondered if, given all of the dangers Canadian soldiers faced, it is really worthwhile. But it is worthwhile according to Foreign Affairs Minister Andre Ouellet. He says Canada will commit to keep its soldiers there for another six months and provide assistance in a number of other ways. [Begin Ouellet recording] We will continue financial support for various international humanitarian aid agencies and make military flights available to the United Nations to deliver that aid. [end recording] [McCullough] Ouellet also downplayed the fact that while Canada has agreed to maintain its current troop strength, it has turned down the UN's latest appeal for additional soldiers.
