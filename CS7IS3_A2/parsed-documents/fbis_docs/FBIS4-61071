There were brief pieces on the evening news about the Council of Ministers Presidium session, but how much interesting information they contained! Now we know that our ministers and vice premiers, when they meet on Thursdays, are "not playing with toys but running the country!" (V. Chernomyrdin). And that attendance is a very strict matter for them. If people fail to show up, the ruling is brief -- "take explanatory notes from all of them, including the deputy premiers." In short, it is stern! Out of curiosity we attempted to know just which of the vice premiers would be reprimanded? It turned out that it was none other than Aleksandr Shokhin who could expect a scolding. IZVESTIYA was told in the other deputies' reception offices that their bosses had attended the Presidium session. People may even have been angry with Shokhin. The fact is that the government has been unable for the second week running to conclude the hearings on the fulfillment of its own 9 March 1994 decree "On the Russian Economy's Position and the Prospects for its Development in 1994," where one of the main reporters was the Ministry of Economics representative. This question was on last Thursday's agenda and, we were told by the government's press service, "its examination was not completed." Shokhin was on vacation at the time, and the report was delivered by his first deputy -- Yakov Urinson. But at the last, scandalous, Presidium session the matter was removed from the agenda altogether. Owing to the absence of many government members, the television explained. Incidentally, the minister of economics and one of his deputies may succeed in finding good reasons to explain away their absence. As of last Thursday he has been taking part in a session of the Interim Committee of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington as part of a large government delegation. Admittedly, this alibi might be undermined by the fact that the session officially ended on Wednesday the 27th. And it has to be said that some delegation members were already back in Moscow Thursday morning. But not all. Viktor Vladimirovich Gerashchenko also failed to make it to the Presidium session. But we must assume that the head of the Central Bank and the vice premier will not simply be taking it easy in the Americas.... The premier is also said to be unhappy with the State Committee for the Management of State Property. Chubays, admittedly, did not blot his attendance copybook. But his deputies allegedly slipped up and failed to supply certain papers in time. ...The most interesting aspect of this story is -- who will collect the reports? But how could there be any doubt -- it will, of course, be Vladimir Petrovich Kvasov, leader of the government apparatus. To be honest, I would give a month's salary to be a fly on the wall when the ministers present their explanations. And so what if they are ministers? God himself has ordered them to obey Kvasov; after all, the leader of the apparatus has also been elevated to ministerial rank by the current premier. And what about the vice premier? What about Viktor Vladimirovich Gerashchenko?... Of course, as they say, it will not be easy for Viktor Chernomyrdin to handle the collective of ministers and vice premiers entrusted to him....
