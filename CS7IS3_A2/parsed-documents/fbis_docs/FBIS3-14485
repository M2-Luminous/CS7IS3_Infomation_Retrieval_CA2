[Begin recording] [Rabinovich] It does not necessarily mean a desire to compromise on this basic equation. Rather, it is an acknowledgment that after many months of haggling over this issue, the negotiations will be better off if their scope is expanded. In this sense, an agreement on the equation is almost devoid of any significance. I do not want to belittle it, of course, but it does not have any merit per se, and I think both the Americans and the Syrians now realize it. [Correspondent Itay Engel] By the way, what was the level at which the decision to alter the format was made? Have the Syrians agreed to it? So far, we have only heard our prime minister's remarks on this matter. [Rabinovich] Just last week, the U.S. peace team visited Damascus. Their visit followed the prime minister's U.S. visit and talks in this vein. The matter was presented to President al-Asad by the U.S. peace team, and we have been told that his reaction was favorable and positive. The reaction has generated some of the present optimism concerning this track. [Engel] Will the revised format help the Israeli-Syrian negotiations out of the bind? Will it lead to a breakthrough? [Rabinovich] I think the revised format of negotiations is all you said, but above all, it shows that the negotiations have reached a degree of maturity, that the Syrian approach is now more realistic in that they now realize that negotiations cannot consist of the two parties reiterating their respective stands and eventually reaching a verbal agreement. A true agreement is first and foremost one which changes the reality. To secure a change, the agreement must address that reality. In the reality of Israeli-Syrian relations, questions such as security, water, and a genuine implementation of the agreement are no less important than the verbal and legal formulations on which the negotiations had focused until recently. [Engel] Is there an envisaged time frame for the signing of a joint declaration of principles that will pave the way for negotiations on details? [Rabinovich] I do not want to give rise to expectations of a fast breakthrough. The negotiations are difficult and complicated, and even if we manage to change the format and the climate, I would not want to create an expectation of an imminent breakthrough. This process will benefit if it is conducted in a new format and if it gathers momentum when the talks are resumed at the end of April. I hope to see results in the subsequent weeks and months, but it would be definitely premature and wrong to start speaking of dates and deadlines. [Engel] Thank you very much, Professor Itamar Rabinovich. [end recording]
