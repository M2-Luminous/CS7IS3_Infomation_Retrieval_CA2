In a move to distance itself from a potentially costly bilateral row, the ministry sent a document to a construction industry organization, saying each company is responsible for coping with the suit, which it says is a civil case, according to its own judgment. The document was dated June 6 and sent to the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors as a simple liaison. The document is in effect designed to make clear to the United States that the ministry has nothing to do with the case, a senior ministry official said. "We drew up the document to remove the misunderstanding within the U.S. Government that the ministry is behind the alleged bid-rigging and the companies' handling of the issue," the official said on the condition of anonymity. "The industry should also supply clear accounts on the case for an accurate understanding by the U.S.," he said. The U.S. Government is seeking a total of 1.1 billion yen in compensation from some 70 Japanese construction companies for the alleged overcharge for work done at the base at Atsugi near Tokyo. Rampant alleged collusion to rig bids in construction contracts, a practice called "dango," has been criticized by the U.S. as a major obstacle to the U.S. companies' entry into the Japanese construction market. The U.S. is expected to start filing suits in autumn after the new U.S. fiscal year begins. U.S. officials recently visited Japan to seek talks with the companies involved, but many of them refused meetings, the officials said. Washington wrongly views the cold shoulder as a move orchestrated by the ministry, they said. The ministry stressed in the document that it has given no instructions or advice to the companies concerning the case.
