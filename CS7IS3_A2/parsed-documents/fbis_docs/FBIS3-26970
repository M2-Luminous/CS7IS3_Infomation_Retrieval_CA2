Thus, the U.S.-Japanese trade conflicts that have been boiling for some time have eventually come to an "end." [variant version reads "U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced here today that he was sure that Japan had failed to fulfill the 1989 bilateral U.S.-Japanese agreement on telecommunications products, and so Japan might be subjected to retaliatory actions." -- rewording paragraph] Five year ago, the Japanese Government agreed that cellular phones produced by the U.S. Motorola company may have access to Japan, and Japan also promised that by 15 February 1994 the company's products would account for one-third to one-half of Tokyo's cellular phone market. Motorola, which is headquartered in Champion, Illinois, announced a few days ago that owing to the many restrictions imposed by the Japanese Government and by business circles, the company's products accounted for only 5 percent of the Tokyo market, which is a far cry from Japan's promise. In fact, the cellular phone trade is just a miniscule portion in terms of the economic interests of these two largest industrialized countries in the world. However, since the announcement of the trade sanctions was made on 11 February after the breakdown of the U.S.-Japanese summit talks, the dispute has become particularly eye-catching. The issue of where will U.S.-Japanese trade go from here has become a major topic of discussion and concern here. [variant version reads "Kantor added: `We have said many times that we are determined to achieve results in carrying out our trade agreement.' He stressed that the United States would announce within 30 days certain trade sanctions that had been contemplated." -- rewording paragraph] Because it failed to reach an agreement on the eight months of talks on a framework for U.S.-Japanese trade, President Clinton's meeting with Prime Minister Hosokawa last Friday [11 February] became the sides' first unsuccessful summit meeting after World War II. During the negotiations, the U.S. side insisted on using numerical targets as the yardstick for measuring the two countries' trade relations and said that Japan should first open for the United States its markets for automobiles, auto parts, telecommunications products, medical equipment, and insurance, but Japan stated that this was unacceptable. The negotiations ended unsuccessfully. U.S.-Japanese trade relations over the last 20 years show that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan has soared drastically. The $1.3 billion trade deficit in 1971 soared to $21.6 billion in 1983 and to $54 billion in 1992. It is estimated that the trade deficit in 1993 would reach $60 billion. Meanwhile, the United States has also started to solve this problem through various channels of negotiations. The "market-oriented negotiations in individual sectors" during the early eighties involved telecommunications products, medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, timber, and automobiles; and during the latter part of the eighties, the United States tried to adopt the so-called "Super 301" section of the trade law to eliminate the trade barriers that Japan had imposed on U.S.-made supercomputers, satellites, and timber products. Ever since the 1990's, the United States has started to tackle structural issues concerning U.S.-Japanese investment and trade -- issues such as investment barriers, antimonopoly measures, trade exclusivity, and so forth. The Clinton administration has described the framework negotiations on U.S.-Japanese trade -- which started last July -- as the first U.S.-Japanese trade negotiations that paid attention to results, but Japan was offended by the U.S. attempt to "manage trade" using numerical targets. In President Clinton's words, the 30 or so bilateral trade agreements that the United States and Japan have reached during the last decade or so are just "for show" because they have achieved nothing substantial in opening up Japan's markets. According to U.S. Government statistics, compared with other industrialized countries, the Japanese market is the smallest for foreign goods. Among other goods, [foreign] telecommunications products, insurance, and automobiles account for 5, 2, and 3 percent, respectively, of the Japanese market. Because expanding exports to Japan is one of the measures that the United States is pursuing to create job opportunities at home, President Clinton said that the United States can no longer wait. He said that while the U.S. sanctions on Japanese telecommunications products would be "just a coincidence," they may explain where the problems lie. In their talks with the press, White House officials have tried everything to avoid using the phrase "trade war." Observers here maintain that U.S.-Japanese economic relations have developed to such an extent that they need each other and that neither side can gain in a large-scale trade war. Laura Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said on 14 February that the time "is not yet ripe" for waging a trade war with Japan. She added, however, that a trade war might occur and so the "Japanese should think thrice." Observers here maintain that the United States has yet to state clearly what actions it will take following the failure of the U.S.-Japanese summit, and that the United States wants Japanese business circles to exercise pressure on the government and to force it to concede and that it also wants to force the Japanese yen to strengthen and affect the Tokyo stock market. Currently the U.S. Government may have these options: restating the "Super 301" section of the trade law through an executive order of the President; demanding that the GATT conduct a special examination of Japan; accusing Japanese companies in the United States of violating the "antitrust law"; and classifying light trucks and sports cars imported from Japan as trucks so that the tariffs imposed on them can be raised from 25 percent to tenfold [shi bei -- 0577 0223]. What moves Japan may take after the United States has contemplated taking retaliatory measures remain to be seen. [variant version reads "what moves the United States and Japan will take during the next 30 days merit attention." -- rewording last sentence]
