This leaflet notes that it is the Israeli Government that is fully responsible for the massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs. This leaflet, like other leaflets disseminated in Judaea and Samaria today, does not at all refer to the possibility that this massacre was carried out by a private individual as an act of insanity. This leaflet calls for two things: to strip the settlers in Judaea and Samaria from the weapons given them by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], and to declare three days of mourning in the territories, as of today, in the wake of the killing of about 50 Palestinians, residents of Hebron, in the Cave of the Patriarchs this morning. Another leaflet was issued by Fatah, and it, too, denounces the massacre. This leaflet calls on the world to defend the Palestinians who, as the leaflet puts it, are not sufficiently protected by IDF soldiers, and are thus exposed to slaughter by the settlers. Yet another leaflet, jointly drafted by two Rejectionist Fronts -- the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine -- categorically calls for a halt to the Israeli-Palestinian talks in the wake of this morning's massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs. This leaflet also calls for a reaction by the Palestinian street. We have yet another manifesto, circulated by a Jewish organization. The Kahana Hay organization has issued an announcement to the press, terming it a Purim deed in Hebron. The Kahana Hay members are mourning the death of martyr Barukh Goldstein who consecrated the name of God by his death, as Samson did at the time. Goldstein did what the Jews in Persia did, as noted in the Book of Esther, when they struck at all their enemies and did as they pleased with their foes. This is an excerpt of the statement to the press issued by Kahana Hay.
