In a statement, Gen Viljoen accused the ANC/South African Communist Party alliance of deliberately destabilising the homeland with the full knowledge of the South African Government. "There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the majority of the people involved in the unrest in Mmabatho are bused in by the ANC." The "sudden" military activity near the border by the South African Defence Force could also be seen as intimidation, the general added.
