Due to Russia's failure to implement the terms of the contract, western countries are worried that Pyongyang might use the submarine for military purposes, the sources said. According to the contract, Russia must send military experts for on-the-spot observation to confirm that the submarine is used only as scrap iron and not for military reasons. The sources said North Korea began dismantling the submarine it purchased from Russia some months ago, but without on-the-spot observation by Russian experts, the North Koreans could use the submarine for military purposes. For example, Pyongyang could use the parts in its own submarines or try to improve its military technology by examining the Russian sub, according to the sources. Concerned about this possibility, Japan recently asked Russia to dispatch military experts to North Korea to observe the submarine's dismantling, ITAR-TASS reported from Tokyo Thursday. Russia contracted with North Korea, through the mediation of a Japanese trading company, to sell 12 decommissioned submarines and has delivered one so far. The Russian Navy Command earlier clarified that the dismantling of the submarine will be observed by Russian military experts and that it must be used only as scrap iron.
