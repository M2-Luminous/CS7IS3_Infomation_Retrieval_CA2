Fernando Ramirez De Estenoz, first deputy foreign relations minister, and Lionel A. Hurst, Antigua and Barbuda permanent UN representative, signed the agreement on behalf of their respective governments in a solemn ceremony at the Cuban permanent mission at the UN. In a brief speech after the exchange of the corresponding documents, Ramirez said that this event is a historical moment for the two countries. He added that it was not a mere diplomatic ceremony, but a step forward for the Caribbean peoples. He pointed out that his country expects to become part of the Caribbean commonwealth because of its blood, race, culture, geographic position, and traditions. Cuba is a Caribbean nation and gladly joins said community, he said. Ramirez stressed that this agreement is a modest contribution toward the integration of the Caribbean people to ensure that collectively we will occupy the corresponding place in the international community. Meanwhile, Ambassador Hurst emphasized the transformation process that began in Cuba in 1959 and its biggest achievements in the fields of sports, health, and education, and its steps to join the regional commonwealth. He added that the current step will contribute to peace and the peoples' self-determination.
