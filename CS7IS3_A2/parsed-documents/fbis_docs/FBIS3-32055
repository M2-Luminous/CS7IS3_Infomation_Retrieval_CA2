De Molina said that Guatemala is facing difficult moments so the austerity policy will continue to increase fiscal revenues by improving the efficiency of the functioning of the Ministry of Finance. President Ramiro De Leon Carpio thanked the outgoing minister and deputy ministers for the work done and the cooperation given to the president during the seven months working for his administration. Meanwhile, Richard Aitkenhead made a brief recapitulation of the evolution of the Guatemalan economy during the time he served as minister of finance. Regarding economic stabilization, during the three years Aitkenhead served as finance minister, the overall government public debt with the Bank of Guatemala was reduced from over 3 billion quetzals in 1990 to approximately 2 billion quetzals until January of 1993; while the level of deposits went from 300 million to 900 million quetzals. Regarding economic growth, Aitkenhead expressed that in the last three years the economy grew by 4 percent, which means that during this period the economy grew more than during the 1980's. Aitkenhead explained that the greater macroeconomic stability permitted an increase in investment and confidence in the economic agents, which coupled with the growth in public investment from 600 million quetzals in 1990 to about 1.5 billion quetzals in 1993 has allowed a new cycle of improvement to begin in the per capita income of Guatemalans. Another accomplishment was that, through the Tax Modernization Program, tax revenues went from 2.360 billion quetzals in 1990 to 5 billion quetzals in 1993. The new minister confirmed the appointments of Estuardo Mendez Herbruger and economist Arnoldo Escobedo, who resigned his post four months ago, as first and second deputy finance ministers, respectively.
