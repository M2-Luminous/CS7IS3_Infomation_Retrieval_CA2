FBIS4-6093 "dreas074_a_94015" FBIS-EAS-94-074 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Defections From Parties Threatened, Reported Defections From Parties Threatened, Reported Watanabe `Having Second Thoughts' OW1804102394 Tokyo KYODO in English 1013 GMT 18 Apr 94 OW1804102394 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe was apparently having second thoughts Monday [18 April] about his plan to split from the Liberal Democratic Party now that his bid for the premiership seems unlikely to succeed, political sources said. Watanabe is backpedaling as the ruling coalition is seen more in favor of naming Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the sources said. In a meeting with LDP President Yohei Kono, Watanabe said, "I understand your feelings, so please give me a little bit more time to think this issue over," an LDP official said. Watanabe, 70, also admitted to wavering over whether to split from the LDP, citing major differences with the ruling coalition over security issues. He heads the LDP's third largest faction. He said, "I can tie up with the Japan New Party whose policies do not differ from ours. If I had the courage to leave and cooperate with such parties as Komeito, which took a big step forward in approving a policy to join UN peacekeeping forces, I would end up pursuing the same policies as the Liberal Democratic Party." Kono appealed to Watanabe to stay in the LDP, saying, "Unless the coalition decides to revamp its combination of political forces and accept you, your defection will be of no use." "Let us do our utmost to strip the coalition of its power by criticizing its policy contradictions and inconsistencies, while seeking public understanding of LDP policies," Kono said. Kono was apparently referring to coalition differences over a plan to hike the rate of consumption tax later this year and to map out the specifics of contingency plans to respond to UN Security Council resolutions to slap sanctions on North Korea over its alleged nuclear arms program, the sources said. Coalition deputies banded together Monday afternoon to discuss their differences on these issues as a prerequisite to agreeing to launch a fresh coalition government to be led by Hata. The deputies aimed to eliminate gaps over a proposed policy platform document whose adoption would mandate instituting a tax system with greater emphasis on indirect taxes and accepting possibly tough UN resolutions to penalize North Korea for its refusal to accept full checkups of its nuclear facilities. Watanabe expressed his intention Sunday to quit the largest opposition party in a bid to seek the premiership with the backing of his own faction and some potential supporters in the coalition. Kono, who has himself vowed to run in the Diet election to nominate the head of government as his party's official candidate, urged Watanabe on Friday to drop his ambitions for the premiership, but Watanabe turned down the request. Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, the largest party in the seven-party coalition, said Monday he is opposed to nominating Watanabe as the coalition's candidate for the premiership, party officials said. Murayama also expressed opposition to Watanabe being invited even to join the next cabinet in a position such as deputy prime minister, they said. So far, only about 20 LDP members are expected to quit and follow their boss if he decides to leave. Meanwhile, five LDP House of Representatives members who voiced support for Watanabe's bid for the premiership left the party on Monday. These rebels -- Seiichi Ota, Taku Yamamoto, Shizuo Sato, Koji Kakizawa and Shokei Arai -- are the members of the former LDP policy study group, called the "Liberals." They were followed by another LDP lower house member, Kenji Kosaka, who said he will join Shinseito, a key party in the coalition. Another group of five LDP renegades -- led by Michihiko Kano, former director general of the Management and Coordination Agency -- on Monday formed a new party called the New Party Mirai (Future). Kano hinted at his readiness to vote for Hata in the Diet vote. Fumihiko Igarashi and two other Japan New Party legislators told reporters they decided to quit the party and become independents.
