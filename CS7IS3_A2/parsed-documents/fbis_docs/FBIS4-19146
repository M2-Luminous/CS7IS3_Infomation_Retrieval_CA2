This "definition of one's political position" toward the protecting power, Austria, was resolved by the SVP Committee during an extraordinary session on domestic policy development. The meeting with Foreign Minister Alois Mock (Austrian People's Party) is to take place within the next few days, SVP Chairman Siegfried Brugger announced after the session. Thus, the SVP has once again made it clear that it does not make light of the political swing to the right after the elections and the likely participation of neofascist ministers in the new Italian Government and that it is seriously concerned about the future of South Tirol's autonomy. The SVP committee unanimously adopted a resolution calling on the future government to "observe all national and international obligations undertaken by Italy toward South Tirol." If this is not the case, it will not only turn to the protecting power, Austria, but also to all the relevant European bodies. "In this respect, we are placing great hopes in democratic Europe," Brugger said. In view of South Tirol's historical experiences with Italian fascism, "the development in Italy are being noted with great concern," the party committee stresses. There is above all alarm at the "reawakening of fascism." And not without reason: With a view to the government formation, neofascists in Bolzano have called for changes of the autonomy statute and said that fascist dictator Benito Mussolini was the "greatest statesman of the century." The alleged democratic transformation of the neofascists, which is manifested by the change of their name to National Alliance, is not believed in South Tirol. In the SVP's opinion, it is nothing but "a feint" -- a wolf in sheep's clothing. Therefore, only "a clear opposition and an unshakable no" to a government with neofascist ministers can come from the SVP, Chairman Brugger announced. While the SVP is still displaying a wait-and-see attitude toward Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia Movement -- it is still too "vague and undefined" -- it does not want to deny that there are "positive aspects" in the Northern League regarding the discussion on federalism initiated by it. In Bolzano the attitude toward this discussion is positive, provided that South Tirol's special autonomy is not touched, but it is further developed in accordance with real federalism. However, the SVP rejects the idea of a greater region that would correspond to the old "Tre Venezie" plan, which was rejected long ago.
