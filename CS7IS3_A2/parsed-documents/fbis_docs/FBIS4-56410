Sanin was greeted at Jose Marti Airport in the capital by her Cuban counterpart Roberto Robaina, Colombian Ambassador to Cuba Ricardo Santamaria Salamanca, and Cuban Ambassador to Colombia Jesus Martinez Beaton. Just after her arrival in Havana, the chief of Colombian diplomacy laid a wreath at the monument of Cuban national hero Jose Marti at Revolution Square, and later she headed to the headquarters of the Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry to begin official talks. Sanin's visit was preceded in the past few weeks by visits by the Colombian ministers of health, mines, and agriculture and a meeting here of a joint intergovernmental commission for economic and scientific-technical cooperation. This reflects an intensification in relations between Havana and Santa Fe de Bogota. During her visit, Sanin will have a busy schedule of activities that includes a visit to the National Library to donate books and to the House of the Americas to donate several works of art.
