Al-Hariri, who began an official visit to Britain on Monday, during which he met with Prime Minister John Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, said that Syria and Lebanon are agreed on signing together with Jordan a peace agreement with Israel. Al-Hariri said it is early to talk about a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin before reaching an agreement on a full Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory and before a halt to the shelling of civilians in southern areas. The Lebanese prime minister described the matter as not personal. Asked about the possibility of Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat visiting Lebanon, al-Hariri said that "'Arafat has to submit an application for the visit, and we will consider it." Asked whether the visits Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine--General Command, makes to his forces' positions in southern Beirut are conducted with permission from the Lebanese state, al-Hariri said that "he has not looked at Ahmad Jibril's passport." Al-Hariri renewed his rejection of [Palestinian] settlement. He was answering a question about whether he was being subjected to international pressures to settle the Palestinians, especially as Lebanese officials always talk about his rejection. Al-Hariri said that "it is Lebanon which is raising this question, because the Constitution does not allow that, nor does the present government. Our position on settlement is attributable to its adverse effect on the demographic situation in Lebanon, and hence on the political situation." Al-Hariri pointed out that the Gaza-Jericho agreement did not talk about the future of 300,000 Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon. On the al-Ta'if accord, al-Hariri said that "any constitution or agreement can be developed. I emphasized that in my speech at the Chamber of Deputies. I stressed that this change and development must be based on common coexistence, balance, and political participation." On the extent of Lebanon's willingness to request the Syrian forces' withdrawal from its territory if Israel agrees to withdraw, al-Hariri said: "We will study this question at the right time and in the light of new developments. The Syrian Army is playing a positive role in safeguarding security and restoring stability in most parts of Lebanese territory." [passage omitted] On the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the Lebanese prime minister said that the fate of this agreement is to be decided by the Palestinians and their institutions. The Lebanese official is expected to leave London for Beirut tomorrow.
