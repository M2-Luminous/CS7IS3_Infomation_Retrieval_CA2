The factory is located about 15 km from Angkor Wat and the owner was not present when the factory was raided. The Khmer Rouge took all valuables at the factory and continued robbing other people in the vicinity. The bandits spent about 45 minutes looting until government troops arrived and exchanged fire with them. A Khmer Rouge soldier was wounded and two houses were destroyed. The bandits fled southward heading for Tonle Sap and robbed people along the way. Relief officials in Siem Reap are worried about their security because it is possible that the group will return as government soldiers are preparing operations to flush out the Khmer Rouge from Angkor Wat because their presence affects tourism. There was also a report from Phnom Penh that government troops are preparing to take the Khmer Rouge headquarters in Pailin. Major General Por Vannak, a high-level military officer of the Cambodian Army, said in Ratanakmondol, a government stronghold about 40 km east of the Khmer Rouge command post, that government forces were only two km away from the Khmer Rouge stronghold. Maj. Gen. Por Vannak said the Khmer Rouge stronghold had been encircled. A private of the government Army, Mei Tit, said many houses in Pailin raised white flags yesterday when the government forces were about to launch attacks on the first day of the operation to take Pailin. The Cambodian Government issued a warning several months in advance that it would launch an operation to take Pailin because the Khmer Rouge refused to negotiate in order to end the decade-long civil war.
