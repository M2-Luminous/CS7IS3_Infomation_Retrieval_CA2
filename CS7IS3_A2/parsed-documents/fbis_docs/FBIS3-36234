In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS, Grachev described as one of the main results of the visit the signing of a protocol of intent to set up Russian military bases in Georgia. Under the protocol, Russia will establish three military bases in this Caucasian republic -- in Vazeani, Akhalkalaki and Batumi -- by July 1, 1994. They will be staffed mostly with land and Air Force troops. Aleksandr Galkin, head of the Russian delegation to the talks with Georgia, said that Georgia wants Russian troops to stay in the republic after 1995 when an agreement on their presence in Georgia expires. Galkin said that Russian military presence in Georgia is indispensable for ensuring stabilisation of the situation, protecting the rights of the Russian-speaking population and providing assistance to Georgia to establish its own armed forces. The agreement on Russian military bases in Georgia has been signed for ten years. After that it can be prolonged by mutual consent. The number of troops and weapons at the bases will be specified by a special working group later. However, Grachev believes that Russia should keep up to 23,000 troops in the Transcaucasia, including two thirds of them in Georgia. The sides also agreed that Russia will train military specialists for Georgia. According to Galkin, georgia will need at least five years to establish its own armed forces.
