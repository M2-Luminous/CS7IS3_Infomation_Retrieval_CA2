FR941216-1-00093 FR941216-1-00012 (a) Items in this division are those for which the principal hazards are fragment and blast, either individually or in combination, depending on such factors as storage configuration, type of packing, and quantity. The designated minimum distances that are specified are based on the limiting range of fragments for which protection by distance is to be provided and shall be used for inhabited building and public traffic route distances. (b) The fragment hazard from items within a specified minimum distance category varies with existing conditions, but is essentially the same for one as for many items or components. For these items, the required separation distances are influenced heavily by packing, state of assembly, charge/weight ratio, and caliber. Items in this division usually explode progressively when involved in a fire or otherwise initiated. Therefore, the distances prescribed shall not be lessened if the quantity to be stored is less than the maximum quantity specified by the appropriate table. Use Appendices H through K to this subpart for determining quantity/distance for Hazard Division 1.2. ยง184.56 Hazard Division 1.3_mass fire. Items in this division burn vigorously with little chance of being extinguished in storage. Explosions shall normally be confined to pressure ruptures of containers and shall not produce propagating shock waves or damaging blast overpressure beyond the magazine distance specified in Appendix L to this subpart. A severe hazard of the spread of fire may result from burning container materials, propellant, or other flaming debris being tossed about by the force of pressure ruptures. ยง184.57 Hazard Division 1.4_moderate fire, no blast. Items in this division present a fire hazard with no blast hazard and virtually no fragmentation hazard beyond the fire hazard clearance ordinarily specified for high risk materials. Separate facilities for storage and handling of this division should not be less than 100 feet from other facilities, except those of fire-resistive construction, which may be 50 feet from each other. The Q/D's for Hazard Division 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5 or 1.6 individually or in combination are not affected by the presence of Hazard Division 1.4. Use Appendix M to this subpart for determining quantity/distance of Hazard Division 1.4 material. ยง184.58 Hazard Divisons 1.5 and 1.6. (a) This section describes Q/D standards for EIDS (substances) which are hazard classified 1.5, as well as ammunition items loaded with EIDS which are hazard classified 1.6. Refer to Appendix N to this subpart. (b) Substances (1.5) and items (1.6) in these divisions are designed to have a very low probability of detonating under normal storage and handling conditions. In order to be so classified, these A&E shall meet stringent tests prescribed in TB 700&hyph;2. (c) Quantity/distance separations for Hazard Division 1.6 ammunition shall be based on the storage location and configuration. This information is detailed in Appendix O to this subpart and footnotes thereto. A maximum of 500,000 NEW shall be permitted at any one location. Any special storage configuration and siting approved for Hazard Division 1.1 ammunition or explosives may be used for storage of like explosive weights of Hazard Division 1.6 ammunition. (d) Blasting agents designated as Hazard Division 1.5 for transportation are considered to be Hazard Division 1.1 for Q/D purposes (storage). (e) When Hazard Division 1.6 is located with Hazard Division 1.1 or 1.5, Hazard Division 1.6 is considered Hazard Division 1.1 for Q/D purposes. When Hazard Division 1.6 is located with Hazard Division 1.2, Hazard Division 1.6 is considered Hazard Division 1.2 for Q/D purposes. (f) When Hazard Division 1.6 is located with Hazard Division 1.3, add the explosives weight of the Hazard Division 1.6 to the weight of Hazard Division 1.3 and consider as Hazard Division 1.3 for Q/D purposes. ยง184.59 Airfields. (a) These provisions do not apply to explosives items installed on aircraft or contained in survival and rescue kits such as signals, flares, egress systems components, squibs and detonators for jettisoning external stores, engine starter cartridges, fire extinguisher cartridges, destructors in electronic equipment, explosives components of emergency kits and equipment, and other such items or materials necessary for safe flight operations. (b) These Q/D requirements shall be applied: (1) To any airfield at which A&E are handled or stored. (2) In conjunction with airfield clearance criteria as prescribed by DoD Components and 14 CFR part 77. Airfields, heliports, and seadromes not used exclusively by DoD Components, combat aircraft parking areas, ammunition and explosives cargo areas, alert hangars, and shelters shall be located as prescribed in Appendix P to this subpart. (3) In separating ammunition and explosives facilities from inhabited buildings, public traffic routes, and other ammunition and explosives facilities, in accordance with Subparts D and F of this part. (c) In applying the requirements prescribed in Appendix P to this subpart, distances shall be measured as follows: (1) Loaded aircraft to loaded aircraft. Measure the distance from explosives on one aircraft to explosives on adjacent aircraft. (2) Ammunition and explosives location to taxiways and runways. Measure from the nearest point of the A&E location to the nearest point of the taxiway and to the centerline of the runway. (d) Separation distances between the following areas and from these areas to other targets shall be determined by applying Appendix Q to this subpart: (1) A&E cargo areas. (2) A&E storage facilities.
