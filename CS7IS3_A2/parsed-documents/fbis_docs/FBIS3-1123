Bulger] [Text] Johannesburg March 19 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] central committee said on Saturday [19 March] it rejected President F W de Klerk's suggestion that it take part in provincial elections in Natal/kwaZulu. It also rejected a suggestion that IFP members be included in the candidate lists of the National Party. The central committee said in Ulundi the IFP stood by the constitutional demands it made in December, 1993 and that it would not enter the elections until its bottom-line constitutional demands were met. The IFP also decided to establish a national action committee to devise programmes to give people constructive ways of opposing the interim constitution.
