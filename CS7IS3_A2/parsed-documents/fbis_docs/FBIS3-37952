This was stated at a news conference of the Polish and Latvian presidents in Riga. According to President Guntis Ulmanis, Poland as the largest country in the region could become a guarantor for the unity of the Baltic states. Imperial voices in Russia pose a real threat, it was said at the conference. Asked to comment on Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's statement that the states of Central Europe should consider their aspirations toward NATO, Lech Walesa replied: We have already done that. I suggest Kozyrev should consider it and not hamper our intentions. According to Walesa the West does not know about a large concentration of Russian troops in Kaliningrad Oblast. One has to ask publicly, what purpose is it serving, how much does it cost and who is threatened by it. During his visit to Riga, President Walesa today visited the Latvian Saeima and met its speaker. He also continued talks with the Latvian president and met Latvian defense and foreign affairs ministers.
