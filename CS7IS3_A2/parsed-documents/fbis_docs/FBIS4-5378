FBIS4-5378 "dreas069_d_94021" FBIS-EAS-94-069 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 South Korea Government Examines Funds for Postreunification Government Examines Funds for Postreunification SK1104140694 Seoul CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean 11 Apr 94 p 1 SK1104140694 Seoul CHUNGANG ILBO Korean BFN [Text] It was learned on 11 April that under the basic policy of annually collecting reunification funds -- which may reach hundreds of million and billion of won -- in preparation for the approach of the immediate reunification of the Korean peninsula, the government has begun to study concrete measures on the form of fund collection, the principle for using funds, and subjects of fund collection. The government has decided to formulate a policy to prepare for the period after reunification as they do not rule out the possibility that the North Korean system may suddenly collapse due to the recently increasing number of North Korean escapees. A relevant government official in charge of security-related affairs said that "the present confirmed position of the government is to collect annually reunification funds in preparation for the approach of the immediate reunification," and that "the government will decide on the total amount of reunification funds only after studying concrete measures, such as the method of collecting funds, principle for using funds, and subjects of fund collection." Another relevant government official in charge of security-related affairs said: "The government has just established a Unification and Security Policy Coordination Council, which Chongwadae [presidential office] will directly operate. We can say that this is related to the serious move recently shown inside North Korea. The reunification funds can be spent, in the form of emergency funds, on the fulfillment of major projects that will be carried out during the period after national reunification." Although the government has studied plans to collect funds -- which, so far, have been dependent upon people's donations -- it has had difficulties making decisions due to President Kim Yong-sam's proposed principle of prohibiting people from donating funds in a quasi-tax form. The official said: "It is difficult to estimate the funds necessary for reunification, it is even more difficult to appropriate funds -- which would total hundred millions and billions of won -- from the government's budget or its reserve funds. Therefore, the government will collect funds from people in the form of donations or from bonds for national reunification. It will carry out the plans as soon as possible when there is consensus among people." The government also believes North-South cooperation funds would be needed more in case the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved and progress is made in North-South relations. Accordingly, it has studied plans to increase North-South cooperation funds, which presently totals approximately 100 billion won. Reunification funds are different from North-South cooperation funds in that the former are funds to prepare for the period after national reunification.
