There were an average of 222,000 registered unemployed in Austria, some 30,000 more than the year before. This is an increase of 15.1 percent. Social Affairs Minister Josef Hesoun sees this development embedded in the international situation. His press spokesman said that Austria is "right at the bottom of the list on a Europe-wide basis." Calculated by OECD methods, Austria's unemployment rate goes down from 6.8 to 4.2 percent on paper. Austria's economic experts had predicted 7 percent, the ministry was more precise in its forecast. For Hesoun, the new record unemployment figure is a "serious situation," which should be countered by an active labor and economic policy. For the 1994 super election year, funds for measures to avoid unemployment were increased to a new high -- from 4.7 to 5 billion Austrian schillings. So far, these funds were used mainly for retraining, various employment programs, subsidies to companies, and lately for job funds. All employees and employers of privately owned companies contribute to these. Unemployment contributions were increased at the beginning of this year. [passage omitted].
