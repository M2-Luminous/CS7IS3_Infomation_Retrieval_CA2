Wang Yang noted that last year various levels of auditing organs stepped up effective auditing of financial and taxation departments; key enterprises; grain enterprises; overall investment funds for agriculture; new basic construction projects; and grain procurement funds; they thus made a positive contribution to accelerating Anhui's economic development and won the praise of the provincial CPC committee and provincial government. Wang Yang pointed out: This year marks the most intensive introduction of new reform measures in 14 years of implementing the policy of reform and opening up. Therefore, when arranging this year's auditing tasks, auditing organs must perform their auditing tasks from the perspective of helping to establish a socialist market economic system. The main auditing targets for this year include auditing financial and monetary departments; key enterprises; auditing of fixed assets investments; agricultural funds; foreign investment funds; and government departments. Wang Yang pointed out that it is necessary to vigorously promote the establishment of auditor offices to meet the requirements for establishing a socialist market economy. Auditors offices can fulfill a useful function by helping to transform enterprises, checking enterprises' finances and inventories, determining property rights, sorting out debts, assessing property, and verifying corporate shares. Auditor offices can also fulfill a great function by helping to understand problems at Sino-foreign joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises, an can improve enterprises' management, raise efficiency, and protect their legitimate rights. Therefore, all levels of auditing organs are required to support auditor offices and step up supervising, providing guidance, and managing auditors offices. To do an efficient job, Wang Yang said auditing departments must study well, do a good job in reforming their departments, explore new auditing methods, and understand the important points of the economic structural reform. Lastly, Governor Fu Xishou raised three requirements. First, he said developing a socialist market economy requires strengthening supervision through auditing. Supervision through auditing is an indispensable part in our efforts to build a socialist legal system. The establishment and improvement of a socialist market economic system needs to be standardized and protected by a sound legal system and, therefore, requires us to enhance and improve the administration of justice and the enforcement of administrative and other laws. It is very important to exercise supervision over the enforcement of auditing laws. Second, the governments at all levels should further enhance their leadership over auditing work, support auditing organs to independently exercise the right of supervision over auditing work according to the law, support subordinate auditing organs in reporting their work to superior auditing organs, support auditing organs in solving problems, and proceeding from the requirements for ensuring the healthy development of the economy, provide guidance to auditing organs to carry out major auditing work. Third, it is necessary to step up the building of the contingent of auditing workers, to further raise the auditing quality; to maintain and encourage honesty, fairness, strictness, and the spirit of dedication, to firmly foster a consciousness of subordinating themselves to and serving the central task of economic construction, to further improve their work style, and to enhance their dedication and sense of responsibility so as to fulfill their tasks splendidly and ingeniously.
