The U.S. official defined these five states as Iran, Iraq, Libya, Cuba, and North Korea. In a commentary on this, the JANA local affairs editor said: It seems that these five states, which the U.S. official described as rebels, are the independent states which have not made their independence subject to the will of the West. What should occur is the complete elimination of all weapons of destruction from all states. If these weapons are harmful to humanity, as is the case, humanity must be saved from them. This must be applied to all states, and not by pursuing a policy of double standards. It would be more appropriate for those who make such statements and calls to get rid of their nuclear weapons and the Israeli nuclear arsenal, which they do not only disregard but even reinforce by supporting and developing it, because if these states which give the appearance of being keen on world peace and security did not possess weapons of mass destruction, the others would never have thought of possessing these weapons. Libya is a peaceable state which does not possess such weapons, nor does it have the capacity to possess them. It has never considered doing so. The International Atomic Energy Agency has attested to this and commended Libya for it. The continued accusations against Libya by western officials are a form of terrorism and blackmail.
