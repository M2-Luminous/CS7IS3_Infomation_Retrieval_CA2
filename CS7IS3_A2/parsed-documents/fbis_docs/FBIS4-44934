Singh Deo, today said foreign newspapers would not be allowed entry into India till the Cabinet had examined the issue in all its implications, reports UNI. Replying to a two-day debate in the Rajya Sabha on the working of his Ministry, Mr Singh Deo said the final decision would have to be taken by the Cabinet as his Ministry alone was not competent to decide the issue. He said the Government's current stand was based on a Cabinet decision of 1955 which had disfavoured the entry of foreign newspapers. The Jawaharlal Nehru Cabinet had taken the decision following the recommendation of the first Press Commission which had studied the issue of ownership of newspapers. It had recommended against permitting Indian editions of foreign newspapers even with Indian equity participation. He informed the House that the issue had been debated in the country and there were some court cases. Mr Singh Deo said the study to be conducted by the Centre of Media Studies would be completed in eight months at a cost of Rs one million [rupees]. At the same time, students of the Film and Television Institute of India were also making their own studies into this matter as a part of their course. He said Doordarshan's own coverage would increase vastly with the launch in 1995 of INSAT-2B, which would be devoted totally to telecommunications and information including radio and television. He said there were reports that there would be 118 foreign networks beaming into India very soon and so the Ministry had written to the owners of the foreign channels and also to Indian missions abroad to apprise them of the country's point of view. Talking on the expansion of Doordarshan, he said the Metro channel was being received terrestrially in Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Hyderabad and Lucknow. In the second phase, this will be received terrestrially in all State capitals and two mega cities, and all other cities in the third phase. Mr Singh Deo announced that the Supreme Court had vacated the stay imposed by Delhi High Court on the scheme for private producer participation in the satellite channels. However, the apex court had ruled that any scheme drawn up by Doordarshan will have to be shown to it. He said the Government would draw up an appropriate scheme for participation of private producers since Doordarshan alone could not produce the programmes to fill the 14,400 hours of telecast time available per year.
