People expected a great deal of achievements from the council; yet, in its final report the council practically failed to plunge a scalpel into the work of reviewing special corporations, thereby inviting strong criticism that the report "has had the teeth taken out of it." Looking back on the report, Mr. Suzuki says: "I received a great cut in my marks for that. I feel great remorse." What on earth was the "wall of bureaucrats" which Mr. Suzuki bumped against? "Obstruction" Was Made in Such Way [Suzuki] People ask me what grade I will give to the final report and whether it is a passing grade. But I would not have submitted the report if I had thought it to deserve a failing grade. The latest one was named the "final report." In a strict sense, the report was so named simply because it was submitted last, and the Third Administrative Reform Council presented six reports in all by then. Therefore, I would like to have the council evaluated through all of the reports. When the securities financing scandal took place, the Third Administrative Reform Council fulfilled the task of establishing a watchdog agency, and it also proposed enacting the administrative procedures legislation. Proposals we made in the three-year period were all good. However, it is a matter of deep regret that, among the proposals, I received a great cut in my grade over one related to the issue of reviewing special corporations. It was not fulfilled due to obstruction by "zoku Dietmen" [group of Diet members who exercise in a particular field the policymaking expertise and contacts generally acquired through service as chairman or vice chairman of the appropriate party policy deliberation committee] [SHUKAN GENDAI] The Third Administrative Reform Council was inaugurated in October 1990 and studied the way administration should be toward the 21st century. Its final report advocates a shift "from bureaucratic leadership to private autonomy" and calls for installing an "ombudsman's panel on regulation" to further ease control and establishing the "New Civil Service System Deliberation Council" intended to study and discuss the public servant system. The report also carries a proposal that a study be made on reorganizing government ministries and agencies. Naturally, strong resistance was expected to be made from bureaucrats who were anxious to protect their vested rights, and the issue of reviewing special corporations agonized Chairman Suzuki until the last moment. There are 92 public corporations and business foundations categorized as special corporations, and many of them have now lost their reasons for existence due to mutually overlapping business activities. The council attempted to reduce their number through amalgamation and abolition; however, in the end it could neither practically mention special corporations by name nor indicate reform procedures in its final report. A reporter who covered the Management and Coordination Agency made the following remarks in this connection: "Concerning the measure to merge and abolish special corporations, 34 were picked for the measure from among 92 corporations in a midterm report in April. Hearings began to reduce the number to a little over 10 in May, when the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] zoku Dietmen and bureaucrats launched a large counterattack. "Upon learning that they would be summoned to the hearings, bureau and division directors made prior visits to zoku Dietmen to `ask for their instructions.' Then, zoku Dietmen applied pressure on them, saying, `Do not attend the hearings.' The officials thus refused to attend hearings. Then came the general elections, through which the LDP became an opposition party. The council thought that it got a good chance, but it was already too late. Hearings for checking assigned tasks of respective corporations are indispensable to naming special corporations in the report, but it was too late for the council to hold the hearings in time for the October report." [Suzuki] I thought that Japan's politicians had an aptitude for seeing, speaking, and acting from high perspectives. However, they forgot the people and the nation and spoke from the standpoint of the business world and on the basis of their sectionalism. This is indeed regrettable and unpleasant. No sooner had I intended to take countermeasures than the general election campaign began. I was asked to be prudent until the end of the election on the grounds that it would disturb the election if I dealt with the politicians and did this and that during the campaign period. So I waited, and what I saw was the shift of power to the other side. However, I think that it is an unusual practice for the administration not to attend meetings (hearings) one-sidedly in obediance to the zoku Dietmen's voice, and there should not be such a practice for anything in the world. This unexpectedly revealed that politics so far had essentially been for the business world despite politicians' remarks that they stood on the side of the people. [SHUKAN GENDAI] Mr. Ken Moroi (chairman of Chichibu Cement Co.), a member of the Administrative Reform Council, made the following remarks in this connection: "Zoku Dietmen form a group in each government ministry and agency to serve as a kind of protective body whose coalescence with administrative and financial officials is now being called into question. At that time, officials did not show up in the hearings, manipulated by the LDP zoku Dietmen. There is not this kind of resistance now because Japan has a coalition ruling camp at present." Mr. Haruo Nishihara (former chairman of the Private Universities Association), a member of the Administrative Reform Council, also said as follows: "I heard that there was zoku Dietmen resistance in some [LDP] divisions, but the resistance was rather made by bureaucrats and the workers of respective special corporations. Those workers stressed that `our corporation is engaged in national programs, and so you should not pick us.' However, there came a change of government, and the Hosokawa cabinet was formed. The council intended to set about its task again in earnest, but there was not enough time with only three months left before the final report." [Suzuki] I got many demerits for this; however, to make up for them I passed burdens to ministries and agencies concerned, asking them to study the directions given by the report and work out policies within the next two years with regard to all 92 special corporations. I was obliged to take such a step, and as chairman, I feel great remorse for this really clumsy development. Well, when I think cool-headedly, I feel that it is the Administrative Reform Council's system itself that is making administrative reform difficult. In carrying out administrative reform, the council has to make its proposals through the administrative organization, and efforts end in failure unless the proposals finally pass through meetings of administrative vice ministers at respective ministries and agencies. No single line provides for such a process in the Administrative Reform Council Installation Act, but the proposals cannot be presented even to the cabinet conference without the consent of all attending these meetings. Officials participating in the proceedings have gained their rights and expanded their spheres of influence through longtime habits. They are not as large a family as one that was once formed around the former Japan Railway, but anyway they like measures to enlarge their power. On the other hand, they are opposed to curtailing their power through rationalization even if it is a good step for the nation. They consider only their rights. The most hateful thing for successive vice ministers and bureau directors was to see any of their sections pared down during their term of office. They feared that their careers might get hurt and their names remembered unfavorably because of such a measure. All this must be tided over in carrying out administrative reform; therefore, I cannot help saying that administrative reform is being carried out amid the self-contradiction contained in the system itself. Administrative reform and political reform are so closely connected that they are frequently likened to a vehicle's two wheels, and I felt keenly that strong political power is necessary to make administrative reform really effective. The Japan Railway Corporation, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corp., and Japan Tobacco and Salt Public Corp. were privatized when Mr. Doko led the Provisional Council for the Promotion of Administrative Reform. The steps were possible because Mr. Doko was great, but they were also possible because Prime Minister Nakasone stood firm. Bureaucrats hinted at their resignations to show their opposition, but the prime minister accepted all of their resignations without hesitation. This is how political power was used when the steps were taken. Mr. Miyazawa, too, was eager for administrative reform. When we were tackling the special decentralization system (the pilot autonomous body system), he was thinking before I did about what my council should do, and it was rather me, not him, who was queried. He asked, "Mr. Suzuki, how will you handle such a case?" Mr. Miyazawa was a distinguished statesman, but he was not quite active in pushing things forward. That is his personality. [SHUKAN GENDAI] A council member said as follows in this connection: "There was resistance from bureaucrats and zoku Dietmen, but another reason [for the failure of the final report] was that Mr. Miyazawa was not very eager for administrative reform. There was also concern among council members that if they put forward too ideal a plan, the chance for its realization would be small and so they gave consideration to producing a realizable plan." [Suzuki] Administrative reform is carried out under a system with such self-contradiction. However, Japan's successive prime ministers were not accustomed to using a top-down approach based on leadership. For example, during the Gulf war, Japan could have shown a quicker response to the war if its politics had been oriented toward a top-down formula. It was not the prime minister alone that should be blamed for the delayed response. The delay took place because the entire Japanese politics was ruled by a bottom-up formula, a system in which decisions are made through a bottom-up process. Consciousness reform has not yet been accomplished, and in this sense the work of decentralization will indeed be difficult. Centralized power politics does not accord with the current age. People talk about decentralization, but they do not cooperate once the actual work begins to promote it. When Mr. Hosokawa (the incumbent prime minister) was serving as chief of the "Affluent Life Division," the Administrative Reform Council proposed what was called the new basic autonomous body. The bottom lines of this basic autonomous body are that "local administration ought to be carried out by localities themselves" and that the main objects of local politics are problems closely connected with livelihood. Then the following question arises: Which should be chosen as basic autonomous bodies, the prefectures or the cities, towns, and villages? It is naturally cities, towns, and villages that are closely connected with livelihood. However, there are now 3,300 cities, towns, and villages across the nation. Some autonomous bodies have populations of 300 or less than 1,000. In such circumstances, it would be difficult to adequately carry out work for the residents' health and welfare. Therefore, the council began studying a plan to make the size of the basic autonomous body at least equal to the scale of the old han [a feudal domain] with a population of about 300,000. As soon as the study began, the heads of local autonomous bodies raised vehement opposition to merging towns and villages. Opposition was particularly fierce from prefectural governors although they should be in the position to promote decentralization. After all, they intend to defend their spheres of influence. A village chief is a village chief, whether he is the chief of a large village or a village of 300 people. Prefectural governors are essentially opposed to building cities designated by cabinet orders as well, on the grounds that the step decreases their power. Abandon Control, Central Rule Why will such a thing happen? It is because while working, they hold a zero-sum game concept, a notion that when power is conferred upon one, someone else is losing an equal amount of power. Reform means building a new world, and so the central government should assume large strategic areas such as national defense, the stability of international money, and international contributions, while the prefectures carry out things necessary for the regional economy, entrusting practical issues closely connected with daily livelihood to cities, towns, and villages. Therefore, I would like to ask them to think with a plus-sum concept, not with a zero-sum concept. In addition, local politics from now will find the need to adopt prefectural incorporation and the doshu system [doshu--a local administrative unit, wider than the prefectural area, now being conceived in a decentralization plan] because the prefecture alone is too narrow for carrying out local politics. Affairs to be handled by local politics should not be limited to those entrusted from the central organs. It should also study how to deal with education through the adoption of the doshu system and prefectural incorporation, whether it is good to continue the conventional uniform education enforced across the nation, and what industrial policies will be effective under the doshu system and prefectural incorporation. Some people may feel a fear as to giving greater power to the heads of local autonomous bodies because of the so-called general contractor scandal involving them. Therefore, lest a similar incident should occur again, my council recommended that cities, towns, and villages be made the center of the basic autonomous bodies, that budgets and competent workers be distributed to these areas, and that politics be carried out before the eyes of residents. Corruption without exception takes place in hidden places as seen in the Kyowa, Sagawa, and general contractor scandals. This is why it is necessary to promote basic autonomous bodies where residents can see politics before their eyes. Japan has thus far carried out very good policies, but we are now in utterly different circumstances. We have brought about the second-largest economy in the world by striving to chase and outrun West Europe under the motto of building our nation through the increase of production. In doing so, we needed to make regulations and standards, develop people with equal ability, and carry out concentrated mass production. However, Japan's method of earning foreign money by mass-producing and exporting specific items was completely denied in the Japan-U.S. Structural Impediments Initiative talks as well. Japan has now reached a point where it has to make a great turnabout, because it can no longer bring up its next generation with its regulated society and centralization of power. It must decentralize itself by abandoning its central rule and make a great turnabout by taking the position of deregulation in principle and regulation as exceptional. Political measures in this direction have actually been taken a little faster, but the real work is yet to be done with regard to various systems. It is the prime minister's job to translate our reports into action, and Prime Minister Hosokawa is indeed flexible like a lithe bomboo. If he had been like a pine tree, he would have already broken in half, but he always regains his original form like a bamboo tree. As for me, I believe I have run at full speed, and it is now the prime minister's turn to show the power of execution.
