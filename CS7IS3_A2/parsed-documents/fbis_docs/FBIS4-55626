Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who in 1992 lauded the new constitution as "superstable," now calls the Senate wasteful and claims he would have fought against its inclusion if he wasn't so busy working on the split of Czechoslovakia. Klaus' Civic Democratic Party (ODS) played a dominant role in drafting the constitution and getting it approved. President Vaclav Havel says he only supports the Senate because it's in the constitution. The opposition parties are absolutely opposed to it. Originally conceived as a basis for a stable democratic system and a possible compromise post for outgoing deputies of the Czechoslovak federal parliament, it has now become a thorn in the side of the political establishment. Despite the lack of political will to establish a Senate, the upper chamber seems firmly on its way to being formed in late-1994 elections. The three small parties that ensure Klaus' coalition government a majority in parliament are pushing for a Senate electoral system that will benefit non-mainstream parties by having three representatives elected from each district. Although he says he would rather not deal with the issue, Klaus is holding out for a one-senator-per-district system that will clearly benefit his popular Civic Democratic Party (ODS). The issue has rocked the four-party governing coalition with stormy meetings and no easy resolution in sight. The origin of the Senate dates back to late 1992, when the federation was falling apart. Federal parliamentary deputies agreed to vote themselves out of their jobs, as long as they could be included in a new Czech Senate or have some other political function. When the Czech National Council--by then the supreme elective body of the new independent country--turned around and voted the proposal down, Klaus seemed to favor the inclusion of federal deputies in a new Senate. Instead, the federal deputies were sent packing, and the Senate remained nothing but a few lines in the new country's constitution. In a regular Sunday radio address, Havel said the constitution should be upheld at all costs but couldn't help adding that he has "never been a friend of the bicameral parliamentary system." As president, Havel has roughly the same powers that a Senate would have under the Czech constitution--if it existed. According to article 46 of the constitution, the Senate can veto laws passed by the Chamber of Deputies, the existing lower house of parliament. However, as in the case of a presidential veto, the lower chamber can override the decision with a simple majority vote. Apart from that, the Senate can do little. It has no say on budgetary matters and cannot adopt constitutional laws, election laws or international agreements. Politicians from both the government and opposition ranks have questioned the need to spend more money in order to set up such a weak upper chamber in a relatively homogeneous country of 10 million. The opposition Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) has proposed that the Senate be abolished from the constitution altogether. "It's too expensive for our state and wasteful for our parliamentary democracy," said CSSD deputy Eva Fischerova. "We don't think it's necessary." No cost estimate exists for the new body, according to Miroslav Havel of the Finance Ministry. "For now," he said, "they can all philosophize at the political level, but we don't have any figures [on how much] it will all cost yet."
