At present, it is necessary to vigorously open new channels for capital accommodation and boldly adopt the new means of funds, B shares, and B bonds to attract foreign investment. To this end, Liu Jinbao submitted a motion to the congress. He said that use of foreign capital is a major policy for accelerating China's economic development. With the major readjustment of the international economic structure since the 1990's, marked changes have taken place in the demand-supply structure of international capital, which has the following new trend: The flow of international capital has markedly decreased and there is an increasing demand; many developed countries have become the focus of international capital; and accommodation of international capital through securities has become the main form of international capital flow. In view of the above new circumstances, Liu Jinbao said, China should diversify its use of foreign capital based on strengthening macroeconomic management in this field. Besides taking foreign loans and running three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises, three new forms of funds, B shares, and B bonds should also be adopted. Funds have the characteristics of low risks and high earnings and are welcome by medium and small international investors. As for the fundraisers, funds are different from bank loans, which do not increase the state's debt burden and can also reduce the cost of fundraising and increase efficiency. Liu Jinbao said that B shares can be expanded from the following four aspects: The B shares issuers should be extended from enterprises obtaining foreign exchange through exports to efficient ordinary domestic enterprises to attract more foreign investment; the scope of trade of B shares issuers should be further expanded; the markets and prices for A and B shares should be unified; and a number of well-known foreign securities companies should be selected to set up exchanges in Shanghai. This can reduce the intermediate links and and increase market operation efficiency. While issuing B bonds, the scale should not be too big in the early stages and the capacity of foreign exchange and bearing capacity of the inhabitants and units should be taken into full consideration. It is necessary to gradually establish the second tier market for B bonds and strengthen their circulation. Liu Jinbao said that operation of the abovementioned new forms of capital accommodation can further broaden the channel of the use of foreign capital and also improve China's securities market and create conditions for it to converge with the international market at an early date.
