No matter how good the arguments for deregulation are, however, they will not produce any tangible results. Why? Because the problem lies in the procedural law. Introduction The Committee on Economic Reform recently issued its interim report on deregulation. The report calls for freedom in principle with no exceptions, and proposes the strengthening of functions of third-party organizations and ombudsmen (OTO [Office of Trade Ombudsman]) to accomplish deregulation effectively. Can we really carry out deregulation? My view is that the current conventional arguments for deregulation produce a limited effect. In carrying out administrative reform, the current method -- a committee approach -- cannot achieve success unless the administrative authorities support it. This approach is being used by force of habit because of the long reign of the former regime. We need to free ourselves from this way of thinking. Although there are strong expectations for supervisory organizations and OTO, their functions, status, and degree of independence are unknown. If worse comes to worst, these organizations will be a mere addition to the already enormous administrative structure, and result in a net increase in the number of government employees and the amount of their work. Also, the proposals in the report seem too inclusive and can be interpreted as a message to all of the ministries to share the pains of adjustment equally. They don't provide a clear picture of in which areas deregulation will be focused or how it will be carried out. Japan subscribes to the separation of three powers. What's important is to reform Japan's economic and political systems by using more effectively the roles of legislative and judicial powers and thereby achieving a dynamic check and balance between the two. What I want to stress here is the use of judicial power in solving the problem. Speaking of the judicial solution, however, I think that the existing legal framework contains numerous restrictions, and that it does not necessarily serve as a means to protect the rights and interests of the citizens. To make it easier for people to bring about administrative litigation, we need to make the procedural law more consumer-oriented. To support this kind of change, we have to promote further "disclosure of information on deregulation." All Too Inclusive The first paragraph of the interim report raises a question: "Why is deregulation necessary?" Here, it says, "Each area needs to be examined equally, and no `sanctuary' should be allowed to exist. Even in examining such areas as welfare, education, labor, and finance, this tenet should be applied." In the next paragraph, the report states that "economic control should be based on freedom in principle." Then, it goes on to say, "Control measures over entry, plant and equipment investment, and imports that have been employed for the purpose of adjusting demand and supply will be abolished at the earliest possible time." All this is quite amazing because if it is done, all the problems of Japan will be solved immediately. Declaring "freedom in principle and control as an exception" means that administrative functions themselves are deemed unnecessary. Proposals for "reform," including administrative reform, have been made many times in the past. But this is the first time a report has advanced a principle clearly to this extent, except for the final report of the Committee on Administrative Reform issued recently. In this sense, the current report is epoch-making, indeed. The problem, however, is that the report lacks basic strategies to implement its grand principle. The current committee approach requires consultation with the administrative authorities in carrying out the administrative reform, and thus is up against a big wall. In fact, the majority of the committee members are former government officials. As ministries and agencies have the essential information, they expend great efforts in ground work to make ambiguous all the points that are unfavorable to them, watering down the final plan. The interim report, which proclaims the epoch-making principle in general, does not specify the effective date for abolishing control over entry or over plant and equipment investment; it simply states that such control "shall be abolished at the earliest possible time" and that "flexibility will be introduced in regulatory control." This will permit the government officials to evade their responsibility on one pretext or another in the future. As a reference, the report lists about 500 related laws and regulations. Indeed, the list does seem all too inclusive and looks like an index to a compendium of laws. Does this mean that all the ministries will share the pains of adjustment? Who is going to review and examine each of these laws and regulations, and how? As it stands now, a person in charge of each of these specific laws and regulations is going to review its contents. The review will require manpower, and conclusions to be drawn from such a review seem self-evident. What's necessary is to present a concrete vision of why deregulation will be carried out and what kinds of industries and socioeconomic structure Japan should strive to build. Based on such a vision, we need to restructure our strategies to ensure steady progress in deregulation. Just as the restructuring of the political world became possible, we also need to change the basic framework for system reform in the economic world. Corporations Will Also Benefit From Deregulation One of the reasons for strong resistance to deregulation pertains to the issue of employment -- a fear that abolition of official regulations may increase unemployment. To be sure, deregulation may cause unemployment in certain industries and corporations in the short run. However, once such deregulation is thoroughly carried out, new growth sectors will surely emerge. They will absorb the excess labor and may even increase overall employment and productivity. Therefore, it is important to make steady progress in deregulation so as to provide business opportunities to new businesses and to facilitate labor mobility among industries. Some people might argue that the domestic industries have grown big because of protective regulations and the increased public spending. Furthermore, they might say that because of such regulations, new industries, and innovations were born through these regulatory webs. In the postwar years, however, the steps taken to liberalize and open the market made it possible for Japan to become an economic power. Liberalization increased competitive pressure on the domestic front, urging the major industries to invest in plant and equipment for mass production. This in turn expanded the domestic market, serving as a driving force for a continuous increase in productivity. In speaking of deregulation and import liberalization, people tend to emphasize the benefits to consumers. However, the beneficiaries are not limited to consumers. In fact, corporations benefit from such deregulation and liberalization. Most goods and imports that are used by corporations are partially finished products, not consumption goods. Lower prices in these intermediary goods benefit the corporations. In fact, Japan's import liberalization in the 1960's was made possible largely by the desire of corporations for lower prices in raw materials. By switching the energy source from coal to oil, Japan was able to cut its energy cost and to build its heavy and chemical industries. If the cost of fuel were high, the cost of electricity would have been higher, which would increase the manufacturing costs and the prices of such raw materials as plastics and synthetic fiber. In a sense, inexpensive raw materials made it possible for Japan to achieve the high economic growth of the 1960's. Currently, Japan's unemployment rate is inching up gradually. Because of this, "subsidies for employment adjustments" are being provided even to such key industries as home appliances and automobiles, increasing the number of white-collar employees and engineers who receive 70 percent of their wages and stay home. An anomaly in the export sector attests to the severity of the current recession. Manufacturing companies have surplus labor, and the banks have bad assets. Being unable to borrow funds, the companies have been slow to restructuring their businesses. And, even if a corporate executive wants to make a drastic move in restructuring and writing off bad assets, he becomes hesitant because such a move will certainly be accompanied by reductions in dividends and capital, leading to a management responsibility issue. Also, the tax system stands doggedly in the way of mobilization of real estate transactions, as taxes on land values and transactions are prohibitively high as if they were penalties. Also, in order to revitalize Japan's agricultural industry, mobilization of farmland is needed. What's needed now is to promote mobilization immediately in the labor, financial, stock, and real estate markets. The solution to the current recession can surely be found by untangling the rigidity of the current system. The subsidy for employment adjustments is too passive as a policy to be taken at present. Instead of making the existing enterprises retain their excess labor, we need to create new industries that will absorb the excess labor. Changing the direction of incentive giving will be the shortest cut toward revitalizing the economy. Making it possible for venture businesses to borrow money at low interest rates, and considering providing them with preferential tax treatments -- there is a room for government supports. What's most important, however, is to open up business opportunities by eliminating entry control completely. This will immediately make corporations and citizens optimistic about their future. Redeployment of human resources by companies and accelerated disposition of bad assets -- that is, ways to mobilize human resources, funds, and land -- need to be promoted aggressively. This is why deregulation is urgently needed now. Domestic Industries as Main Pillars Restructuring is most needed for the domestic industries. The Maekawa Report was based on a premise that the competitiveness of the export industries had to be weakened to reduce the trade surplus and thereby to reduce frictions with foreign countries. However, it used a double standard in dealing with deregulation issues, leaving the domestic industries almost untouched, probably because of their large capacity to absorb labor. The premise of the report has reached the limit now that the exchange rate is close to 100 yen per dollar. Unless restructuring is carried out, Japan will never be able to come out of the vicious circle of adjusting to the strong yen. In the past, Japan has taken pride in its world-renowned competitiveness in such manufacturing industries as semiconductors, automobiles, and home appliances. However, this outstanding competitiveness has resulted time after time in a vicious circle; it leads to a rapid increase in exports, which in turn, sooner or later, is going to raise the value of the yen, to which the companies have to make bloody efforts to adjust themselves. Then, once Japan tides over the strong yen, it is looked upon warily again by the United States and Europe. We are no longer in the era [when we can afford to repeat the vicious circle] of "tiding over" the strong yen. Such domestic industries as agriculture, finance, construction, distribution, energy, electric power, and gas have long benefited from protection. They are the underlying cause for price differentials between here and abroad, making it difficult for consumers to share the net profits from the strong yen. In many cases these industries are "exempt" from application of the Antimonopoly Law, including these sections on cartels and the resale system. Even today, when Japan is a major economic power, such exemption is permitted. In such sectors as electric power and gas, "local monopoly" has been allowed, the reason being their public utility status. In the areas of agriculture and construction, an enormous structure of vested interests has been created by politicians, bureaucrats, and businessmen, using public works projects and subsidies. Such protection of domestic industries has outlived its historical mission. Inequality is limited between the continuing protection of the domestic industries and the pressure on the export industries for their adjustment efforts and sacrifices; it goes beyond the structural confines of these industries and their markets. Such export industries as automobiles and home appliances are comprised of assembly-type companies that have a vast array of domestic companies under them. Every time the value of the yen increased, these companies requested and promoted reductions in production costs from their subcontractors that manufacture parts for them. But the effectiveness of this method has reached its limit. If the export industries continue to be low, the Japanese economy itself will become shaky and weakened. For the Japanese economy to find a way out of this stalemate and to revitalize itself, a major change needs to be made so that the domestic industries can become a driving force for growth. Also, it is important for the export industries to grow out of their single-minded emphasis on cost reduction and instead to strive to develop their own technologies and management know-how so that they will not have to flinch when faced with another increase in the value of the yen. To do so, we have to build a socioeconomic structure that will widen the room for originality and creativity, stressing the principle of self-responsibility. Some people say that deregulation takes a long time. But once it's done, it can be achieved in a remarkably short period of time. At present, there are lively new entrants to the international communications sector. Thanks to this, charges for international telephone calls, which used to be fixed at about 10,000 yen per a few minutes, have been declining rapidly. Besides, requests for approval of reduced charges continue to be filed. By choosing night-time calls for discounts, for example, consumers can enjoy much reduced rates and a variety of services. Nowadays, operators will look up telephone numbers in London, free of charge. Once deregulation begins, therefore, it will change the existing situation completely and improve the quality of services as well. Indeed, the "age of consumers" has arrived. As long as the right objectives and structure are presented, restructuring can be achieved at an amazingly swift speed. What hinders such a possibility is the existence of restrictive regulations. Information Disclosure as a Starting Point To make real progress on deregulation, it is necessary to promote disclosure of information so that the public can grasp its current status and overall picture. Journalists have been asking me often lately, "I understand the importance of deregulation and opening up of the market. But where should we start?" This question aptly indicates that the public doesn't have much basic information on deregulation. Although the grand principle has been presented at the general level, it is not clear what kinds of problems have beenmanifested in which areas, or what sort of insider information the authorities have on these problems. Unless such information is disclosed, the public will remain in the dark on specific issues and be forced to subjugate themselves to government officials. Another reason why I want to stress the importance of information disclosure relates to the procedural law. From the beginning, the framework of Japan's administrative laws has not been constructed in favor of plaintiffs, the citizens. Under this framework, if a plaintiff doesn't have enough pertinent information, he will not be able to win his lawsuit. Therefore, what matters most is disclosure of information relating to the regulations. This is a starting point for deregulation. Revision of existing laws, especially of the procedural law, is necessary to make the system more consumer-oriented. The framework of existing administrative law espouses the concept of the existence of "official power." This concept was established, modeled after German public laws, prior to the World War II by professor Tatsukichi Minobe (Tokyo University). According to this concept, decisions made by an administrative agency (such as a decision to levy taxes or to disapprove an application for a license, for example) are considered valid until such decisions are later revoked, or if they are clearly invalid. In other words, even if an administrative decision is illegal, the people subject to the decision are bound by it. In sum, the concept upholds the administrative power over citizens. It is an interpretative legal doctrine that was born the effort to give relief to the citizens under the constitution granted by the Emperor, and that was considered as democratic during the prewar period. However, the concept has been rigidly followed even after the Constitution of Japan was established [after the war]. This is quite odd in this age when human rights are to be respected most. In reality, however, the legal views of administrative officials as well as of judges have not changed much. Given the existence of "official power," decisions made by the authorities are presumed legal for the time being, and, therefore, the burden of proof rests with the citizen who brings his complaints in an administrative litigation. As people say that "one with the burden of proof will lose his case," this burden is quite heavy, and the chance of winning such a lawsuit is almost nil for the citizens. Furthermore, there are rigid requirements in place regarding the competency for bringing about a lawsuit. "Competency requirements for plaintiffs" set restrictive conditions, making it not necessarily possible for anyone to bring a lawsuit. Also, because of such restrictive conditions as "benefits of litigation," the subject matter to be judged at a court must be clear and concrete. However, as it is not quite clear if any contestable decisions exist in the case of notification or administrative guidance, an intent for litigation may be turned down even before it comes to court. Also, as influential ministries and agencies issue their administrative guidance in person or on the phone, actual complaints can hardly be presented in the form appropriate for litigation. Unable to bring a lawsuit, therefore, the people must remain quiet in desperation on one hand, and the regulations remain intact on the other. Let's assume that one was able to bring a lawsuit after solving all of these technical problems for litigation. In reality, however, suing an authority requires lots of courage, money, and knowledge. And the litigant may be most likely considered as being disrespectful of authority and accused of having disturbed the existing order of the industry in question; he could be "ostracized" as a result. Therefore, to bring a lawsuit against an authority, some kind of a system is needed where, for example, company A can pursue a lawsuit, representing the entire automobile industry. To solve the aforementioned problems and to streamline the procedures for litigation, it also seems important to have a full-scale examination of the legislative framework, adapting eagerly such new ideas as "litigation by representatives." Litigation Funds for Freedom in Business Operations What kind of strategy can we think of in order to dismantle regulations under the existing law? I would like to propose establishment of "litigation funds for freedom in business operations" as a highly effective means to this end. For example, if each of 2,000 corporations listed on the stock exchange market, or their presidents, contributes 1 million yen (it could be out-of-pocket money) to the funds to foot the bills for litigation, the total amounts to 2 billion yen. Then, an annual report is issued, summarizing the results of lawsuits financed by the funds. It will raise public awareness, and at the same time can be usee as leverage to promote information disclosure. The litigation funds have the advantage of limiting the number of freeloaders because successful litigation by an individual against an authority to ease a regulation will also benefit a third party in the same situation. Besides, there is a tendency in Japan to discourage administrative litigation, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, if there are no such cooperative funds for sharing the cost of litigation, no one is willing to bring a time-consuming lawsuit. Some time ago, Yamato Transport filed an application for a trucking license with the Ministry of Transport [MOT]. The application was flatly denied, and the company was unable to make much progress in this matter for six years. Becoming increasingly flustered, the company finally decided to take the matter to court. Then, all of a sudden, the ministry granted a license, and the matter was resolved. The reason for this is that "if the matter goes to court, the MOT has to prove the `reason for not granting a license'" (per Mr. Akio Ogura, NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, 17 October 1993). This case proves that litigation is the final resort, and that it is quite an effective tactic. Law and Economics Many suggestions on deregulation have been made on the general level in the past. A private-sector, Hiraiwa-style forum (headed by Professor Iwao Nakatani), in which I participated, proposed establishment of the "doctrine of legal regulations" and enactment of the "basic law on regulations." The objective of this proposal was to reaffirm the superiority of judicial power over administrative power. However, I'm not sure if this kind of straightforward approach can break down the fortress of administrative authorities. As mentioned earlier, the reason the fortress of administrative authorities can't be dismantled is that the current framework of procedural law does not favor citizens. As long as this situation continues to exist, the authorities will never be ordered to submit evidence or required to explain clearly the need for a particular regulation. In the long run, however, this means that the administrative organs in Japan will miss the opportunities for tensions and challenges. It is unfortunate for the citizens at large that the proud administration of Japan is losing its innate vitality. In Japan, the basic law does not serve adequately as a check against administrative control. Defying the possibility of misunderstandings, I should say that administrative laws in Japan are written so simply that they can be interpreted quite flexibly, like molding clay, by the authorities. Also, as a rule, administrative officials have been trying to resolve problems by persuasion, rather than by issuing edicts. Such being the case, the authorities probably have not assessed the economic effects of regulations in a strict sense. Because of these reasons, the ultimate point of contention is at the level of how each individual regulation is applied. It is important to put the substantive laws in order, but what's equally practical is to stress equality in procedural matters so as to guarantee the correct ways of applying and interpreting the substantive laws. In this respect, courts of law should be used actively and flexibly. To do so, it is important to promote restructuring, including that of the legal framework, so as to create a consumer-oriented system. However, legal scholars do not seem to have developed their awareness on this issue. Also, there are no specialists in legal matters in the Hiraiwa Committee who are independent from administration. More than ever, there seems to be a need for legal scholars to acquire knowledge of economics. In the United States, where the arguments for deregulation were initiated, the importance of [the connection between] "law and economics" is well recognized. Economists are required to have common-sense knowledge of the law, and legal scholars of economics. This is the point stressed by Dr. Coase, who received the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1991. Without being armed with law and economics, arguments for deregulation, no matter how good their general theorems are, will be of "no practical use" in terms of specifics. Japan has also entered the era when procedural law must be thoroughly reviewed from the consumers' perspective in cooperation with legal scholars. Without such an effort to make a drastic remedy by enacting a set of laws regarding administrative procedures and information disclosure, the committee approach will result in a repeated submission of impractical proposals.
