Wang Guofa, vice governor of the provincial government, made a speech at the conference. After summing up the province's achievements in rural financial affairs made over the past years, the conference pointed out: Now, problems in the management of rural financial affairs, which are in urgent need of solution, still exist. That is, the accumulated funds of agriculture are still being drained, the funds obtained by some localities according to a unified plan are not well managed, there are more instances of illegally interfering in the management and the flow of accumulated funds, the problems due to the raising of the interest rates by the collectives and the problems relating to "two debts" prominently exist, the rural areas fail to effectively manage their financial affairs, some localities have abolished county- and township-level agricultural economic centers, some localities delegate the rights to the management of rural financial affairs to towns and townships, and some localities "wean" the rural areas from the management of their financial affairs. So, the rural areas are lacking in basic work conditions and basic organizations. To this end, the conference urged: To strengthen the management of the rural financial affairs in 1994 and 1995, we should win a victory in the overall battle of "six cleanups and six changes." "Six cleanups" indicate: Square accounts to solve the problems due to complicated accounting; clear up collective property to protect and expand the collective sector of the economy; clear up internal and external debts to eliminate rural debt chains; eliminate the raising of interest rates to solve the problems of being heavily in debt; eliminate the peasants' burdens to resolutely end the activities of wantonly collecting funds, asking for charges, and apportioning expenses; and clear up excessive staff members to solve overstaffing. "Six changes" indicate: Implement the provincial people's congress "regulations" on management of funds, "regulations" on contracts, and "regulations" on the auditing work of the rural areas, as well as the "regulations" on the peasants' burden as stipulated by the state and the province -- both old and new accumulated funds used to be "owned and managed by communities" in the past and will be "converted into stocks and managed by townships"; change the decentralized management of the funds obtained according to the unified plan into centralized management; change the peasants' burdens from unitary shares to collection of funds from various channels; the basic work relating to the management of financial affairs has been changed from management at will to standardized management; change the ways for management of rural financial affairs from unitary administration to legalization; and change the ways for sorting out rural financial affairs from periodic cleanup to regular auditing examinations. The "six cleanups" and "six changes" will be conducted among villages, communities (groups), collective economic organizations and their subordinate enterprises, enterprises, institutions, township-level enterprises, and town- and township-level financial affairs stations and offices. The conference stressed: The governments at various levels and all departments concerned should upgrade their understanding and realistically strengthen the leadership over the work relating to the cleanups and changes. On the basis of deeply conducting investigations and study and firmly grasping the implementation of the laws and regulations, we should strengthen the setup of the rural financial affairs management organizations. In the course of conducting the organizational reform, the governments at various levels must not reduce the staff and funds of the rural economic stations, still less "cut the subsidies to them."
