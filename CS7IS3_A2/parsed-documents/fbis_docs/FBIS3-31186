Security Council Karel Kovanda said at the meeting of the Council today. "The threat of unleashing air strikes cannot be seen in isolation but as part of wider measures, he said, adding that "on its own, it will not solve anything because the solution will have to involve all three parties to the conflict," he said. [quotation marks as received] "The threatening stance has been agreed on to prevent Sarajevo from suffocation and provide it with a chance to come under U.N. supervision if the parties involved so wish," he said, adding that the U.N.'s threatening stance will help the parties to the conflict negotiate a solution. "Allow me to say that we recognized it as a matter beyond doubt that since last summer, secretary general has had the powers to authorize air raids on heavy artillery positions responsible for attacks on civilians," Kovanda said, referring to the demands for a new document on the issue. Contrary to the Western states, who are opposed to any such move, Russia repeatedly proposed that the Council adopt a new resolution on Sarajevo.
