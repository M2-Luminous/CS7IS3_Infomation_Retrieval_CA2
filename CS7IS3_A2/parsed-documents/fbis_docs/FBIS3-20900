The Double Challenge: Upheaval in Germany's Industrial Research Infrastructure--Requirements for Political Action 1. Upheaval in Germany's Industrial Research Infrastructure Industrial research is an important element for a competitive, modern industry; it combines knowledge of basic research with the requirements of industrial production. Industrial research is therefore an essential part of the technological innovation capability in the economy. The industrial research infrastructure in the united Germany today faces a double challenge: Challenge 1: Industrial research needs a technical and functional adjustment to the altered tasks; this is a result of the progressive technological development and altered dynamic of the world market, which further reinforce the pressure for innovation in industry. First, new subject concentrations are emerging in research and technology, to which the industrial research establishments and government R&D funding measures must react. Second, it is becoming clear that industrial research institutions today, more than before, must be understood as active intermediaries in networks of various industrial partners and research establishments, and that in so doing basic research and application development must cooperate more closely than before--in local as well as globalized industrial connections. Challenge 2: Simultaneously, an internal German adjustment of capacity and structure is necessary. As a result of the change in systems, industrial research in the new laender has lost its customers almost completely and is in total upheaval, and largely in dissolution as well. The sharp economic decline of the global economy, which now has also reached western German industry, further led to reduced utilization of western German industrial research as well. Despite the already completed downsizing in eastern Germany, the declining demand is today faced with a relatively large overall German supply potential for industrial research that lacks industrial contracts. To this is added a structural problem: Both research systems contributed similar strengths and weaknesses; today a heated, cutthroat competition is under way, in which eastern German suppliers are clearly finding poorer starting conditions. In order to assure an overall German industrial landscape that is aimed at the future, is innovation-oriented and benefits industrial competitiveness, two urgent tasks must be mastered at the same time: - In the short term: The creation of improved competitive conditions for the remaining industrial research establishments in eastern Germany--assuming that an approximately equal distribution between old and new laender is politically intended. - In the medium term: A stocktaking, specific adjustment and further development of the entire German industrial research landscape. The following part of the research report called "Industrial Research Establishments in the FRG With Special Consideration of Structural Adjustments in the New Laender" is meant as a contribution to the discussion of requirements for political action in this field. In the following the outlined discussions will be shown as having several steps. The argumentation rests on results of the studies, carried out jointly by the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems Technology and Innovation Research (ISI) and the Institute for Economic Research Halle (IWH) in 1991/92 on this subject, which are documented in the other sections of the research report, and on assessments of newer results of innovation research. 2. Restructuring of Industrial Research: Elements of New Political Efforts A debate on the future of industrial research in Germany must take the following aspects into account: - Support for research and technology is a long-term investment and does not help overcome the current economic crisis. - New technological concentrations and the increasing interlinking of technologies will mark industrial research services in the future. - New functions of technical research and industrial innovation are developing. - Regions need a mix of industrial research at the "middle" level of technology and a "wide range." - Industrial research in eastern Germany needs preferential treatment in order to have a chance to adjust to the double structural change. - A stocktaking and specific restructuring of the entire German industrial research landscape is necessary. These aspects can only be briefly commented on in the following. A systematic analysis and the design of future structures for industrial research in Germany will require significantly greater efforts than were possible within the framework of this underlying study. Support for Research and Technology Is a Long-Term Investment and Does not Serve to Overcome the Current Crisis The discussions outlined here for the support of research and technology are not suitable for helping to overcome the double crisis of the German economy in the early 1990s, which consists of the basic adjustment crisis of eastern German industry and the current economic slump in the western German economy. Strengthening the technological innovation capability of industry is a permanent task, whose results become effective only in the medium and long term. Planning horizons for stabilization, reorganization and expansion of the industrial research infrastructure must therefore have a perspective of at least five to ten years. The buildup of the existing infrastructure in the old laender took place over three decades before it reached its present size, and the establishments were able to assume their present functions in the scientific and industrial innovation system. For the infrastructure plans for industrial research in the area of the new laender today this means--after an urgent, initial guarantee of a minimum potential in the upheaval phase of 1989/72, as was shown by the fate of many "research companies"--that the foreseeable requirements must be the determining ones at the end of our decade and in transition to the next millennium. These requirements cannot be exactly specified in advance, however, partly because the positions of the German economy in the world market in five years and later are uncertain, and partly because technological developments cannot be adequately assessed. However, we can indicate a few elements in the foreseeable shifts in concentration and altered function of industrial research in the coming years. New Technological Concentrations and Their Increasing Interlinking In the last few years the question of the potential development of science and technology is again being discussed and studied in leading industrial nations, above all in the United States and in Japan, as well as in Europe and in other OECD nations. A whole series of studies on evaluating the so-called critical technology fields for the medium-term future have now been published. They contain more or less extensive lists of technologies (for example the Commerce Department of the United States: "Emerging Technology: An Appraisal of the Technical and Economic Possibilities," 1990; "Report of the National Committee for Critical Technology" of the United States, 1991; Ministry of Economics of the Netherlands: "Experiment in Technology Forecasting," 1991; Economic Planning Agency, Japan: "Technology and Products in the Year 2010," 1992; Science and Technology Agency, Japan: "Future Technology in Japan," 1992). Such studies were produced with the general objective of being able to concentrate research activities and government followup measures to those areas of technology, where a decisive influence on the future problem-solving capability of the national economies in question is addressed. Such studies are also under way in Germany at this time (one with medium-term and one with long-term perspectives), which have not yet been concluded, however. What information regarding the innovation process from medium and long-term perspectives, and thus for the tasks of industrial research, can be obtained from such studies, and what bottlenecks can be perceived? This is, of course a prognostic and synthetic question, to which there is no ultimate answer, founded on data. In general terms, the innovation cycle can be sketched as that of "intelligent" technology. The universally cheap resource of petroleum in the postwar era is replaced by the universally cheap resource of the "chip." In the discussion of bottlenecks, greater attention must be paid to the demand factors. Technology monitoring (and sometimes also technology policy) is tempted to limit itself to the description and consideration of the potential supply of natural science technology solutions and the institutions which offer them. Which technology and which research infrastructure will be important in the future depends to a great extent on the anticipated social, ecological and economic problem pressure, from which important demands on the science and technology of the future are formulated. For the purpose of clear arrangement and description, it is possible to distinguish those fields of technology, which in all corresponding foreign studies are regarded as essential for the future innovation capability (a new assessment by the ISI and the project sponsor, the Federal Ministry for Research and Technology [BMFT], undertaken at the request of the BMFT, will soon appear): - Advanced materials, - manufacturing and production technologies, - information technology and electronics, - biotechnology, - and, above all, technologies in their respective overlapping areas, such as microsystem technology, nanotechnology, molecular electronics. Technology at the beginning of the 21st Century cannot be divided according to conventional aspects, however; this applies particularly to application areas. Applications such as future telecommunications result from progress in both microelectronics and photonics and are not conceivable without contributions from software development. This cooperation by technologies is not basically new, but is spreading more and more and now requires consequences for the research, technology and innovation policies. It must be studied whether the research infrastructure (including the industrial one) and the existing research administration in Germany must be adapted to the objectively existing interlinking. New Functions of Technological Research and Industrial Innovation Develop The OECD recently stressed (as a result of its "Technology/Economy Program") the altered role of industrial research in the industrialized nations: As an "intermediary body," it will in the future not only provide the transfer of knowledge from research to industrial application, but must also feed back the requirements of industry to basic and long-term-oriented research. Beyond that, it will have to meet the--seemingly paradoxical--double challenge of being increasingly active "on the spot" in local technology-oriented networks as well as cooperate in "globalized" technology development contexts ("techno-globalism"), since the production of knowledge and innovations more and more frequently takes place in international connections. This is the result of a structural change for technological innovations, which now no longer takes place in "new" technology fields (such as modern biotechnology), but on a broad front, and to which the industrial and industrially applied research in the new laender must also submit (see also Box 1). Michael Gibbons of the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) spectacularly called this supplementation, observed by many innovation researchers, of the innovation process by a second mode the "transition from mode 1 to mode 2 of the knowledge production:" Mode 1 describes a more traditional, "linear," discipline-bound, primarily internal (within a company or research institute) manner of producing technological innovation through "applied" research and development (which in certain fields will continue to be of importance); mode 2 describes a new form of science-based innovation processes, which overcomes the conventional separation of pure and applied research. Elements of the new form of science production are: - Research in connection with application and application development with feedback to the research base, - production of "transdisciplinary" knowledge, - heterogeneous form of activities and participating actors, - variety of organizational and institutional forms, - immediate industrial utilization of the possibilities of new technical facilities and equipment in research, - greater demands for quality and efficiency control. To begin with, these are very general conclusions, which need more precise analysis and specification for individual fields of technology, research institutions and various industries. It is certain, however, that a view, organization and promotion of industrial research that is largely oriented toward traditional divisions of industrial branches, such as dominates traditional "joint industrial research," will no longer do justice to the interconnected character and "transdisciplinary quality" of increasingly science-linked innovation processes. Box 1: Market Opportunities for Eastern German Industrial Research: Modern Technological Strategies Necessary. In a market for industrial research in Germany, which is overcrowded in some fields and which furthermore is marked by a decrease in research contracts from the economy and restrained government support for industrial research, it is particularly difficult for these establishments and enterprises in the new laender to become permanently established: In view of the extremely unfavorable starting conditions (interrupted relations with former industrial partners, the lack of capital, uncertain property conditions, obsolete facilities, the danger of losing qualified personnel) they regard themselves as exposed to a fierce, cutthroat competition, although in part they are highly efficient and willing to achieve. A future-oriented market strategy includes market analyses and operating systems, sufficient investments and long-term business strategies, particularly innovation and technology strategies. It is precisely in these areas that eastern German enterprises have major shortcomings. Short-term survival strategies (such as low-price policies) do not create any prospects. What is decisive is the correct positioning of one's own work with respect to the demands of technological innovations in industry--right now these are undergoing a radical process of change: World-market-capable products from a high-price economy such as the German (and other western European ones) will be even more technology-intensive in the future than in the past. The "technological intensity" of the products today increasingly also includes intelligent interconnection of technologies of very different origin; at the same time, more and more often knowledge from basic scientific research flows directly into the development process for new products (or methods). The growing "interlinking of technology" and "science-basing" creates new challenges for industrial research and development; small and medium-sized enterprises, above all, thus end up under pressure to adjust and are looking for support. Industrial research establishments can provide help here and thus find a market, if they meet the following demands: - Technological interconnection. Intelligent products require the combination of the most varied technologies; industrial research must visibly be able to practice interface management. - Interdisciplinary cooperation. More than before, representatives of various disciplines in the engineering sciences, the natural sciences and technology management must be ready for and capable of cooperating. - Network orientation. One enterprise is increasingly less able to offer all the know-how about technology-intensive products: Formal and informal cooperation between various partners (companies, research facilities, engineering bureaus, etc.) in technology networks becomes more important. - Simultaneous regional and global orientation. Industry-related research needs strong roots in the regional research and industrial environment, but in the respective field of expertise it must maintain active connections with leading worldwide developments, for instance through international research cooperations. Regions Need a `Mix' of Industrial Research at the `Middle' Level of Technology and a `Wide Range.' The conclusions in the preceding step do not make regional potentials in industrial research at the "middle" technological level, which are frequently based more on the traditional, "linear," model, superfluous. Practical experience proves--and many innovation and regional research studies confirm--that they continue to form a stabilizing element in modern industrial structures, whose backbone are active, company-internal R&D potentials. In the old laender such capacities have been built up over decades with massive use of public funding from the Federal Government and the laender; many of these research establishments today form the foundation for continued development toward "science-based" technological innovations. Which "mix" of industrial research establishments from various fields of technology and with varying technological "range" is regionally or nationally necessary? It would take a great deal of expense systematically to compare, quantitatively and qualitatively, the existing infrastructure of industrial research in the old laender with the establishments in existence right now in eastern Germany, in order to draw conclusions for planning decisions; this expense could not be justified in the framework of the analyses undertaken for this report. But just a glance at the industrial research infrastructure "mix" of an old land, which is very active in this respect, makes it clear how large the gap is that yawns between the situation there and the conditions in the new laender (see Box 2). The desire to build such an infrastructure from scratch in each of the eastern German laender would take an extraordinary effort. Box 2: Industrial Research in the Old Laender--Example: Baden-Wuerttemberg The beginnings of government support for industrial research in the region of the Land of Baden-Wuerttemberg go back far into the 19th Century. Today, the land (9.6 million inhabitants) counts the following among its industrial research establishments: - 13 Fraunhofer Society institutes, - 10 joint industrial research institutes, - Eight contract research facilities at universities, - Two large research establishments, - about 100 transfer establishments of the Steinbeis Foundation (usually) at technical colleges. These facilities are financed by research income (contract research, research funding) and by institutional funding from the Federal Government and the land (in proportions varying according to the institution). The Fraunhofer Society institutes in Baden-Wuerttemberg (1,500 employees) work in the following fields of work, among others: Information technology, production automation, biomethod technology, energy technology, construction technology, sensor technology, materials. The budget of the Baden-Wuerttemberg institutes was DM 300 million in 1989, approximately one-third of which was financed on the basis of industrial cooperations. Divided by industry, the joint industrial research establishments operate in the following fields: textile and process technology, clothing industry, textile chemistry, chemical fibers, tanning, pigments/paints, industrial glass, precision mechanics/watch technology, microtechnology, fine metals/metal chemistry, synthetics. The budget volume for these establishments was DM 46 million in 1989, DM 14 million of which were based on industrial cooperations. The contract research institutes at the universities ("An institutes"), which have only been around for a few years in this form, are active in the following sectors: microelectronics, information science, natural sciences-medical research, laser technology in medicine, application-oriented knowledge processing, solar energy and hydrogen research, manufacturing technology. In 1989 the budget for these institutes was DM 49 million, DM 18 million of which came from cooperations with the business sector. The large research establishments (Stuttgart Research Center of the Aerospace Research Institute, DLR, in the fields of materials, construction methods, energetics, and Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center, KfK, in the fields of environmental technology, materials research, handling technology, microsystem technology, nuclear technology), earned about DM 30 million in income in 1989 through industrial cooperations (with a total budget of DM 780 million). In connection with the shrinking institutional support for these establishments from the federal government, they will make efforts over the next few years to expand their share of the contract research market. The technical advisory services and transfer centers of the Steinbeis Foundation (founded in 1971), in the which professors and graduates from technical colleges in the region offer technological advice and development projects in the fields of flexible automation and production technology, process technology, electronics/microelectronics, software engineering and CAD/CAM, in 1989 earned more than 90 percent of their DM 65 million budget from industrial cooperations. Industrial Research in Eastern Germany Needs Preferential Treatment in Order to Have a Chance to Adjust With the Double Structural Change The collapse of industrial research in the new laender has already taken on dramatic proportions. Of the approximately 75,000 researchers active in industry at the beginning of 1990, at the present time--as reported by representative surveys at the beginning of October 1992--no more than 15,000 are left in the new laender. The number of industrial researchers in the new laender, compared to the old laender, has thus reached a ratio of 1:15. While in the old laender there are seven researchers for every 100 industry employees, in the new laender there is only one. In addition, it must be taken into account that of the remaining R&D employees one in three works in a job creation position. So far, it has not been possible to halt the decline of R&D potentials. An extensive inquiry among privatized research establishments and privatized enterprises gave the result that, from the end of 1991 until April 1992, a 25 percent decrease in R&D potential took place, and these companies feared an additional decrease by mid-1993 by up to 60 percent. In Trust Agency enterprises, as well, a more rapid drop in R&D employees than in general employees is taking place, as confirmed by reports from the Trust Agency itself. About half of all industrial R&D employees in the new laender are still working in Trust Agency enterprises. Although the Trust Agency is trying to enforce preservation of the R&D potential when selling the companies, increasingly more buyers of industrial enterprises are refusing to take over R&D employees. The number of enterprises which function as "extended workbenches" for their mother companies, is growing. The present development in industrial research runs counter to the desirable industrial buildup in the new laender. Where there is a lack of creative research there is also a lack of innovation, and where no innovations are being brought out there will also be little investment. Successful innovations presume immaterial investments and result in material replacement, rationalization, and expansion investments. For that reason R&D must not be regarded as a labor policy task, but as a necessary investment for the future. Although basically an original task for the economy, the federal government and the laender agree that in view of the extent and the special problems of structural change in the economy in the new laender, the process of restructuring and reorganization and expansion of efficient R&D potentials must be accompanied by subsidies over a longer period through government measures. In this sense many attempts at economic and technology policy are being made to promote the innovation capability of eastern German enterprises. The BMWi [Federal Ministry for Economics] and the BMFT are making a large amount of funding available. But it is still not clear whether these subsidies will also be available in the medium term (three to five years) as a prerequisite for self-supporting reconstruction in the new laender. In the future it will primarily be the laender which must bear special responsibility in this process. A glance at the abundance of existing subsidy measures being offered by the governments in the old laender (see Box 3) makes it clear how much eastern Germany still needs to catch up, although the governments in the new laender are apparently becoming active in this field, as was documented at another place in this study. A research landscape is soon destroyed. Rebuilding it is many times more expensive than keeping it. For this reason it is proposed - that research potentials be supported on site for a longer, but defined period of time. The research establishments need fundamental or basic financing (decreasing), since only a minor part of the overall costs can be financed from project support; - that a gradually decreasing financial subsidy be assumed for the next three to five years for the enterprises still under Trust Agency management. Limiting the subsidy to enterprises with fewer than 1,000 employees is here counterproductive for maintaining the R&D potentials. - that the subsidy rate in certain cases be increased to 80 percent for enterprises, which due to their limited financial opportunities cannot generate the required 50 percent of their own funding and for that reason cannot claim any subsidies; - that equal starting conditions be created for eastern German industrial, independent, research establishments by conveying ownership of the movable goods as well as property needed for the business. In addition, cancellation of old debts and liquidation loans is indispensable. - that the support of contract research from west to east (AWO) be expanded. Utilization of eastern German industrial research by companies in the processing industries in the old laender has been less than satisfactory until now. With exactly DM 50 million (as of August 1992), one can only speak of a beginning of support in awarding contracts to researchers in the new laender. Measured by the annual amounts given away by enterprises in the old laender to external research establishments, the above amount, at not quite one percent, is very low; - that the equality of eastern German R&D facilities in competing for the granting of contracts be assured. To that end, more eastern German scientists should also sit on expert panels.

In the former GDR industrial research was organized completely differently, but it also had--something which is crucial here--comparatively high-quality research resources, above all in human capital. Today, more than two years after the German unification, the all-German industrial research is facing a challenge with respect to volume: The uncontrolled decline of industrial production in the new laender is accompanied by a continued cutback in industrial research in eastern Germany. The sharp economic slump in the global economy, which has now reached the western German industry as well, also causes a shrinking demand for the services of western Germany industrial research. To this is added a structural problem: A comparison of technological specialization models in eastern and western Germany for the year immediately before the unification shows that both research systems demonstrate similar strengths and weaknesses, so that there were scarcely any positive complementary effects. On the contrary; a violent cutthroat competition began, in which eastern German workers clearly had the inferior starting conditions. What could have happened even at the time of the German unification must take place now: The entire German industrial research infrastructure should be subjected to a thorough stocktaking - on the demand side, meaning with a view to the foreseeable (as well as desirable with respect to industrial policy) industrial demand for research work, - on the supply side, meaning with a view to existing and development-capable potentials, - institutionally, meaning with a view to proven or obsolete financing, organization and cooperation models, respectively. Since this has already in part been done as regards the eastern German infrastructure, this challenge applies particularly to the western German system. It should be connected with the attempt to describe the entire German market for research and development services in terms of quantity as well (see Box 4). Several reasons argue in favor of such a revision: - Until now there has been no sufficiently detailed, in terms of quantity and quality, and at the same time clear picture of the entire German infrastructure of industrial research, but such an overview represents an indispensable foundation for planning and decisions in research and innovation policy. - There are accumulating indications that the spending for research and technology development in Germany is stagnating or even declining. The public research budgets have grown disproportionately with the German unification, that is to say, in relative terms they have shrunk. Research spending by the economic sector hardly grew in real terms in the last three years--after high growth rates in the 1980s--and the number of employed research personnel in the old laender from 1989 to 1991 dropped by 2.9 percent a year (according to the Expert Report on Economic Statistics 1992). Under these conditions there is also a stagnation of external R&D spending by enterprises--and hence the field of action for industrial research. - The system of government actors is fragmented; there is a lack of coordination between department politics and of a clear division of duties between regional, national and European R&D policies. - There are scarcely any long-term and strategically designed guidelines, either in industry or in research and technology policy. - The mobility between the subsystems of the research system (for example between industrial research, economic research, academic operation) and in international connections is insufficient. - The politically offered incentive systems are now no longer sufficiently capable of adjustment or creative; it is felt that their concepts are no longer specific enough. In the event the proposed extensive stocktaking of the business-oriented research system should finally lead to a reorganization, several factors are unavoidable: - A restructuring of industrial research must take place with a view to the position and opportunities of German industry in the world market. In so doing, one must balance which weaknesses in the technological performance profile can realistically be overcome by the industry and by government support for industrial research, and which market sectors will remain unconquerable. - The existing industrial structures and industrial concentrations in eastern and western Germany, insofar as they are competitive or harbor strong potential for future success, must be treated as constants in the decision about research infrastructures. - The restructuring must treat German industrial research as a part of the larger infrastructure of the European Community and also with a view to Central and Eastern Europe. It is of basic importance here that the state cannot "execute" this restructuring process but should primarily moderate and, during recognizable bottlenecks, provide support through institutional funding for necessary research facilities and time-limited subsidy programs. Box 4: Development of the Market for Research and Development in the Old Laender An exact description of the market for R&D services creates difficulties in several respects, which are mentioned elsewhere (see PROGNOS/ISI: "R&D Cooperations by Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, Basel/Karlsruhe, 1991). Including the new laender makes little sense, since the corresponding data are still incomplete and the dynamic of negative change continues to be strong (See Expert Report on Economic Statistics: "Research and Development in the Economy, Results and Assessments 1991-92"). The data available for the old laender show stagnation, after impressive growth in research spending in the economy in the 1980s and an absolutely and relatively significant growth in external research tasks since the beginning of the 1990s. This is undoubtedly a reflection of the slowdown in economic growth. Experience in innovation research ("interlocking technologies," "science-linking") allows for the assumption, however, that the proportion of external R&D spending (about 10 percent) reached today will no longer decrease but perhaps might even grow. More precise analyses here show that the predominant part of external company spending flows not to government-supported research infrastructures but to other companies--a clear indication of the interconnection of industrial technology! As is well known, the entry into the R&D market is made easier for government-supported institutions through programs which offer financial support for cooperation between industry and science. Under these framework conditions it cannot be anticipated that eastern German establishments should rapidly be able to capture, on their own, an appreciable share of the all-German R&D market.
