According to information from diplomatic circles in Washington, the United States supports Russia's coordination role through the United Nations. This development came to light following Lamb's recent visit to Moscow. The State Department coordinator and Assistant Secretary of State Steven Oxman will visit Athens and Ankara next week in an effort to secure assurances that the two governments will fully support the efforts of the UN envoys for progress in the proximity talks. Their visit to Ankara is particularly important because it will aim at strengthening Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and her party in light of the election on 27 March. It is well known that the U.S. Government is concerned about the possibility of the Turkish prime minister's influence weakening, which would seriously affect Cyprus and Greek-Turkish relations.
