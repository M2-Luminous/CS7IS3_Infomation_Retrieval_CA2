"As of today, we still intend to unveil it by around January 20," the government's top spokesman told a news conference. He cited the talks among the ruling parties and Diet debate on political reform as potential stumbling blocks to the release of the new measures to stoke up the languishing Japanese economy. Asked if the package will include income tax cuts, Takemura said the government will take high public expectations of such cuts into account in working out details of the pump-priming measures. Earlier Monday, a government source predicted the government will have to delay the announcement of the additional stimulus measures beyond January 20 because of conflicting views in the coalition on whether the consumption tax, now standing at 3 percent, should be raised to finance proposed income tax cuts. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the timing of the announcement of the income tax reduction should be decided by February 11, when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is scheduled to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington.
