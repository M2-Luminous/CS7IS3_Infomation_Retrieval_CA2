It is part of Hom District in Vientiane Province. In the past the production and the life style of the people were very close to nature: they engaged in slash and burn agriculture, 90 percent of the people were malnourished, and they died from malaria and diarrhea. Their condition was very serious. But because of the efforts of the central echelons of the party and state the Lao 89 project was started. This development project of the UN drug prevention organization has continued from 1989 to the present and has brought a change of direction. Pha Lavek has begun to develop, overcome its past troubles and progress toward a new life. There has been development on many sides, both material and spiritual, for the progressive Hmong. Mr Wanna, the deputy district leader of Hom District, Vientiane Province reported to me that Pha Lavek included 10 villages and a population of 4,500. Before 1989 the communication routes between the localities and central authority were broken. The government used aircraft to transport food and medicine to help the people each month. But with the start of the drug prevention project, funded at no cost by the United Nations, there has been development for 3 years, and Pha Lavek has made progress. Goods production has been developed substantially, for example: an economic base has been built, and a communication route reaches from Vientiane to Pha Lavek--the road from Tha Bok to Pha Lavek is 42 km long and vehicles travel it conveniently both in the dry season and the rainy season. Now there is daily passenger service from Vientiane to Pha Lavek to Long San. Project officials also completed a new road 29 km long from Pha Lavek to Nam Gnouak (Vang Gnasai) which could be traveled in the dry season, and they completed a 44 km road from Pha Lavek to Ao Sai in Sai Somboun District which could be traveled in the dry season. As for agricultural production, before 1989 there were only 60 hectares of wet-field rice land while there were 386 hectares of dry-field rice land, and 90 percent of the population was engaged in slash and burn rice cultivation and opium cultivation for which they moved on every year. Now the area of wet-field rice has increased to 208 hectares, and the Hmong people have generally come down to build permanent homes on the plains and cultivate wet-field rice and raise animals and commercial crops more and more. Only 100 hectares of dry-field rice land remain in Pha Lavek. There are more than 3,000 head of cattle and buffalo being raised, and there are many pigs and poultry of various kinds. With regard to commercial crops the people in some villages are working to raise coffee on 2 hectares, peanuts and soybeans on 6 hectares, and are raising Job's tears experimentally on 2.5 hectares. They are also raising many hectares of various vegetables. Another outstanding development is that in addition to raising the wet season rice crop on wet-field rice land, in Ban Pha Lavek Village and Nam Pang where conditions are right for irrigation they experimented with raising dry season rice on 2 hectares, and it appears to have been very successful. All this has allowed them better to meet the demand for food of the people of Pha Lavek--they can supply 70 percent of their food. Education and public health are being broadened. In Pha Lavek now there is one secondary school. In the 1993 to 1994 school year there are more than 40 students in the first through third years of secondary school. There are six primary schools, and there are more than 1,000 students in the first through the fifth primary grades. Public health and education in hygiene for the people are being expanded broadly. A hospital was built according to standards with funds from the project and the people from three locations. In addition many houses have toilets. There are medical personnel and medicine assigned to 10 villages. Therefore it is clear that illiteracy among children of school age and illness and death among the people have been attacked and reduced. Another outstanding development which occurred in early 1994 was that 21 drug addicts received treatment to end their addiction completely with assistance from the project and the Thai drug prevention organization.
