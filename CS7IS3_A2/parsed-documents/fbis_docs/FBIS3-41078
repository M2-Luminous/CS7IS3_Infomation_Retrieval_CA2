Of those investigated, 60 percent were charged with crimes related to drug trafficking, terrorism, and kidnapping. The Office of the Prosecutor General has developed legal procedures for the early termination of criminal proceedings and penalty negotiations, and in this way has put an end to crimes going unpunished and delays in nearly 9,000 investigations. In just 18 months the Office of the Prosecutor General has held approximately 12,000 special early verdict hearings and has sentenced almost 9,000 accused persons. According to Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Jose Sintura, the use of penalty negotiations is increasing, and is having a direct impact on unclogging the judicial backlog and preventing crimes from going unpunished. Sintura told EL TIEMPO that even though most of the negotiations (60 percent of the hearings) were held for persons charged with crimes in the jurisdiction of regional or special prosecutors, the use of early verdict hearings is rising for ordinary crimes. "Of the 12,000 early verdict hearings the Office of the Prosecutor General has held, most are related to crimes handled by regional judicial officials--drug trafficking, extortion, terrorism, homicide for the purposes of terrorism, and kidnapping--but we are also beginning to see a significant increase in the negotiation of penalties for ordinary crimes like petty theft, personal injuries, embezzlement, etc." Only 30 percent of the 12,000 settlements of negotiated penalties reached in the last 18 months by regional or special prosecutors and sectional or ordinary prosecutors have been overturned by judges. Sintura stated that negotiated settlements are rejected basically because of judges being overly legalistic. "For example, there are cases," he said, "in which a judge annuls a settlement reached between the accused and the prosecutor's office because a member of our staff forgot to list the penalty of a fine, which in any event is clearly stipulated in the law." Sintura admits, though, that on other occasions prosecutors have made mistakes that lead judges to annul the settlements. "In some cases they do not properly support the charges, or they poorly describe the crime or seek inappropriate penalties," he added. The deputy prosecutor general believes that with last November's reform of the Criminal Procedures Code, negotiated penalties are going to increase considerably, for now they will be easier to use. "With these new amendments," said Sintura, "this type of settlement will be reached directly between the accused and the prosecutor. After the hearing a document will be sent to the judge so the judge can verify its legality. That will make the negotiations smoother, as the judge's intervention will not be as direct." According to Sintura, the early verdict procedure has enabled society to convict a number of criminals against whom the state had no evidence. The Ochoas and Urdinola Of the 12,000 hearings held by the Office of the Prosecutor General, the deputy prosecutor's office has handled the eight most sensitive cases. Sintura conducted the sentence negotiation procedures with Ivan Urdinola Grajales, Gonzalo Mejia Sanin, Fabio and Jorge Luis Ochoa Vasquez, and some others as well. "In some of these cases we had no solid evidence, and if not for the criminals' confession, which grants them some benefits, it would not have been possible to win a conviction," said the official. "This office has conducted eight early verdict hearings. The most difficult to date was Urdinola's case, as we knew that the automatic sentence reductions provided by the law would not let us put him away for many years, and second, because the evidence we had against this man was quite rudimentary," added Sintura. Sintura says that the sentence of four years and seven months (the actual time) that Urdinola has to serve was "essentially based on his own confession and on some documents U.S. officials provided. If we had taken this case to court without his confession, we could not have gotten a verdict." He explained that a negotiated penalty also offers the prosecutor's office the advantage of the possibility of conducting other investigations against persons with whom penalties are being or have been negotiated. "We conduct very specific negotiations with very well-circumscribed charges so that we can pursue other investigations; for example, Jorge Luis and Fabio Ochoa confessed to cocaine trafficking between 1974 and 1990." "If the prosecutor's office demonstrates that between 1991 and 1993 they distributed more cocaine, we can bring another case against them that has nothing to do with the negotiated penalty," says Sintura. "In Urdinola's case," he added, "charges and penalties were arranged for drug trafficking, and he was told that a homicide charge against him was not included in this negotiation." "He obviously always wanted the homicide charge to be included in the negotiation. But the position of the Office of the Prosecutor General was clear: homicide charges were not negotiable unless he made a confession; as he did not confess to the homicide charges and claimed to be innocent, we are now moving forward with that case," said the deputy prosecutor general.
