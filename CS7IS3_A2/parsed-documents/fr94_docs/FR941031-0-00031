FR941031-0-00031 FR941031-0-00011 The other purpose that requiring the full approval of an NSR program might serve would be to ensure that NSR would become a contingency provision in the maintenance plan required for these areas by sections 107(d)(3)(E)(iv) and 175A(d). These provisions require that, for an area to be redesignated to attainment, it must receive full approval of a maintenance plan containing ``such contingency provisions as the Administrator deems necessary to assure that the State will promptly correct any violation of the standard which occurs after the redesignation of the area as an attainment area. Such provisions shall include a requirement that the State will implement all measures with respect to the control of the air pollutant concerned which were contained in the State implementation plan for the area before redesignation of the area as an attainment area.'' Based on this language, it is apparent that whether an approved NSR program must be included as a contingency provision depends on whether it is considered as a ``measure'' for the control of the pertinent air pollutants. As USEPA noted in the proposed rulemaking regarding these redesignation requests, the term ``measure'' is not defined in section 175A(d) and Congress utilized that term differently in different provisions of the Act with respect to the PSD and NSR permitting programs. For example, in section 110(a)(2)(A), Congress required State implementation plans to include ``enforceable emission limitations and other control measures, means, or techniques *␣*␣* as may be necessary or appropriate to meet the applicable requirements of the Act.'' In section 110(a)(2)(C), Congress required that State implementation plans include ``a program to provide for the enforcement of the measures described in subparagraph (A), and regulation of the modification and construction of any stationary source within the areas covered by the plan as necessary to assure that national ambient air quality standards are achieved, including a permit program as required in parts C and D.'' (Emphasis added.) If the term ``measures'' as used in sections 110(a)(2) (A) and (C) had been intended to include PSD and NSR there would have been no point to requiring that State implementation plans include both measures and preconstruction review under parts C and D (PSD and NSR). Unless ``measures'' referred to something other than preconstruction review under parts C and D, the reference to preconstruction review programs in section 110(a)(2)(C) would be rendered mere surplusage. Thus, in sections 110(a)(2) (A) and (C), it is apparent that Congress distinguished ``measures'' from preconstruction review. On the other hand, in other provisions of the Act, such as section 161, Congress appeared to include PSD within the scope of the term ``measures.'' Contrary to the comments in this proceeding, USEPA does not believe that the fact that Congress used the undefined term ``measure'' differently in different sections of the Act is ``irrelevant.'' Rather, this indicates that the term is susceptible to more than one interpretation and that USEPA has the discretion to interpret it in a reasonable manner in the context of section 175A. Inasmuch as Congress itself has used the term in a manner that excluded PSD and NSR from its scope, USEPA believes it is reasonable to interpret ``measure,'' as used in section 175A(d), not to include NSR. That this is a reasonable interpretation is further supported by the fact that PSD, a program that is the corollary of NSR for attainment areas, goes into effect in lieu of NSR. 1 This distinguishes NSR from other required programs under the Act, such as enhanced inspection and maintenance and reasonably available control technology, which have no corollary for attainment areas. Moreover, USEPA believes that those other required programs are clearly within the scope of the term ``measure.'' 2 1 USEPA is not suggesting that NSR and PSD are equivalent, but merely that they are the same type of program. 2 USEPA also notes that, in the case of the Indiana areas, the possible contingency provisions include volatile organic compound (VOC) emission offsets for new and modified major sources; VOC emission offsets for new and modified minor sources; increasing the ratio of emission offsets required for new sources; and VOC controls on new minor sources (less than 100 tons per year). Furthermore, Indiana's construction permit program requires that, prior to constructing any source in any attainment or nonattainment area in the State, it must be demonstrated that the resultant emissions will not exacerbate an existing air quality violation or cause a new violation. This is consistent with USEPA's PSD requirements as specified at 40 CFR 52.21(k) and is provided for in Indiana's State implementation plan (see 40 CFR 52.793(b)). USEPA disagrees with the commenters' suggestion that USEPA's logic in treating NSR in this manner means that other applicable part D requirements, including those that have been previously met and previously relied upon in demonstrating attainment, could be eliminated without an analysis demonstrating that maintenance would be protected. As noted above, Indiana has demonstrated that maintenance would be protected with PSD in effect, rather than NSR. Thus, USEPA is not permitting NSR to be removed without a demonstration that maintenance of the standard will be achieved. Moreover, USEPA has not amended its policy with respect to the conversion of other State implementation plan elements to contingency provisions, which is that they may be converted to contingency provisions only upon a showing that maintenance will be achieved without them being in effect. Finally, as noted above, USEPA believes that the NSR requirement differs from other requirements, and does not believe that the rationale for the NSR exception extends to other required programs.
