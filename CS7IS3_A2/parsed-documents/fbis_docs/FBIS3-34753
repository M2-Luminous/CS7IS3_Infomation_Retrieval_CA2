This year, the holy month of Ramadan begins after the expanded National Dialogue Committee completed the accord document, which is just waiting to be signed. The delay may have been an act of God so the signing of the document would coincide with the early days of this month, during which human beings are closest to God. I take this religious and worthy occasion to urge all official and unofficial media to call a halt to vituperation and turn a new leaf in the life of our united Yemen and our pioneering democratic exercise. [passage omitted] I would like to say how grateful and thankful I am to our steadfast and patient people who have borne all manner of distress and weathered the consequences and ill effects of the crisis. I would also like to reiterate that we are readily available for a joint effort with all the partriotic, unionist, benevolent, and dedicated forces to maintain the unity of the country and entrench the democratic choice, and work together toward the resolution of all issues and problems our homeland and people are facing in a responsible and brotherly spirit that puts the interests of the homeland before any parochial interests.
