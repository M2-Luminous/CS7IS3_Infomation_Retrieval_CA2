The British Foreign Office understands the complexity experienced by Latvia in search of a solution to the question about the future status of the people, who are not citizens of the republic. But it regards that the integration of the ethnic minorities constitutes an important prerequisite for ensuring long-term stability in the region, and therefore, expresses concern over some of the aspects of the draft citiznship law, which was adopted after its third reading in the parliament on June 21, the British Foreign Office spokesman indicated.
