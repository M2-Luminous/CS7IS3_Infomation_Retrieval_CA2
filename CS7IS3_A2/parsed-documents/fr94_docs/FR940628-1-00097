FR940628-1-00097 FR940628-1-00016 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under ยง8 of the Act, after an order is implemented, a person subject to the order may file a petition with the Secretary stating that the order or any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or an exemption from the order. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides that the district courts of the United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries on business are vested with jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that purpose is filed within 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this proposed action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Only those wholesale handlers, retail distribution centers, producers, and importers who have annual sales of $750,000 or more of cut flowers and greens and sell those products to exempt handlers, retailers, or consumers would be considered to be qualified handlers and assessed under the order. There are approximately 900 wholesalers, 150 importers, and 200 domestic producers who would be qualified handlers. The majority of these qualified handlers would be classified as small businesses. As defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] small agricultural service firms, which would include the qualified handlers who would be required to pay assessments under the order, have been defined as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000. Statistics reported by the National Agricultural Statistics Service show that 1993 sales at wholesale of domestic cut flowers and greens total approximately $535 million while the value of imports during 1993 was approximately $382 million. The leading States in the United States producing cut flowers and greens, by wholesale value, are California, which produces approximately 60 percent of the domestic crop, followed by Florida, Colorado, Washington, New York, Hawaii, and Pennsylvania. Major countries exporting cut flowers and greens into the United States, by value, are Colombia, which accounts for approximately 60 percent, followed by The Netherlands, Mexico, and Costa Rica. During the first three years the order is in effect, the rate of assessment may not exceed 0.5 percent of the gross sales of cut flowers and greens. After the order has been in effect for three years, the assessment rate may be increased or decreased by no more that 0.25 percent each year when recommended by two-thirds of the members of the National PromoFlor Council (Council) and approved by the Secretary. However, at no time may the assessment rate exceed 1.0 percent of gross sales of cut flowers and greens. Notice and comment rulemaking would be required to change the assessment rate. Although the maximum assessment collection is expected to total about $10 million annually, the economic impact of a 1.0 percent or less assessment on each qualified handler would not be significant. While the proposed order would impose certain recordkeeping requirements on qualified handlers, information required under the proposed order could be compiled from records currently maintained. Thus, any added burden resulting from increased recordkeeping would not be significant when compared to the benefits that should accrue to such businesses. The proposed order's provisions have been carefully reviewed, and every effort has been made to minimize any unnecessary recordkeeping costs or requirements. Although the order would impose some additional costs and requirements on qualified handlers, it is anticipated that the program under the proposed order would help to increase the demand for cut flowers and greens. Therefore, any additional costs should be offset by the benefits derived from expanded markets and sales benefiting all segments of the floral industry. Accordingly, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the provisions of the proposed order would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Paperwork Reduction Act In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 [44 U.S.C. Chapter 35] the forms, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements included in this action have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Information collection requirements that are included in this proposal include: (1) A periodic report by each qualified handler who handles cut flowers and greens. The estimated maximum number of respondents is 1,250, each submitting an average of 12 responses per year, with an estimated average reporting burden of 10 minutes per response. (2) An application requesting postponement of assessment payments. The estimated maximum number of respondents is 25, each submitting an average of 4 responses per year, with an estimated average reporting burden of 20 minutes per response. (3) A refund application form for persons who desire a refund of their assessments. The estimated maximum number of respondents is 210, each submitting 1 response prior to the initial referendum, or an annual average of 70 respondents, with an estimated average reporting burden of 15 minutes per response. (4) An exemption application for wholesale handlers, retail distribution centers, producers, and importers of cut flowers and greens with gross annual sales under $750,000 and would be exempt from assessments and recordkeeping requirements. The estimated number of respondents for this form is 500, each submitting one response per year, with an estimated average burden of 15 minutes per response. (5) A referendum ballot to be used to determine whether qualified handlers favor continuance of the order. The estimated number of respondents completing this ballot would be 1,250, each submitting one response approximately every 3 years, or an annual average of 417 respondents, with an estimated average reporting burden of 15 minutes per response. (6) A nominee background statement form for Council member and alternate member nominees. The estimated number of respondents for this form is 50 for the initial nominations to the Council and approximately 17 respondents annually thereafter. Each respondent would submit one response per year, with an estimated average reporting burden of 30 minutes per response.
