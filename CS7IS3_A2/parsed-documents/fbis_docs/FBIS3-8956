Tomorrow morning Moravcik will hand President Michal Kovac a proposal for the composition of the new government. "However, we are expecting the deciding word from President Kovac," Moravcik said, adding that he did not foresee any problems, because the composition of the government had been consulted with the president at intervals. "Personnel changes are continuing in the ministries, the committees are sitting which write off property, and privatization (approved by Meciar's cabinet) is continuing," said Roman Kovac, leading representative of the Democratic Union of Slovakia, and formerly deputy premier in Vladimir Meciar's government until he (and Moravcik) resigned several weeks ago. He said that this situation was "unbearable," and that when President Kovac appointed the new government on Wednesday [16 March], its first interest would be to concern itself with the situation and carefully look into the legality of these steps. At the last session of Meciar's government, privatization projects were approved for the Piestany spa and the prospering Chemosvit Svit company, and the "privatization" of pharmacies and other property continued, Kovac added. Moravcik said that representatives of the parties which decided on the fall of Meciar's cabinet and established the new government had decided on an early election date for the end of September and the beginning of October. If the new coalition is unable to push through new elections through a constitutional law, Moravcik said, it will try and establish an autumn date through calling a referendum by parliamentary decree. Meciar is pressing for a June election date, which the hitherto opposition has rejected. Negotiations between Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) leaders and those of the Democratic Left Party (SDL, which has taken part in composing the new government) took place today but without success.
