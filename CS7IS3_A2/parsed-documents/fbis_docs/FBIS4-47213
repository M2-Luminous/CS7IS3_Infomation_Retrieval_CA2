The Law "On Rehabilitation of the Victims of Mass Political Repression" and decisions on the possibility of a change of nationality and on the prohibition against retirees being dismissed in connection with their having reached retirement age were drawn up and adopted with his direct participation. [Omarova] Vitaliy Ivanovich, three months have elapsed. The election passions have subsided and cooled. How do you evaluate the election results today? [Voronov] The election results came as a surprise neither to me nor to my fellow thinkers. Part two of the "Marlizonskiy ballet"--dissolution-elections--was performed precisely. In organizing and conducting the elections and tallying their results the executive made practically no mistakes.... [Omarova] I don't know about you but I personally have the impression that the elections were lost by the opposition three years ago, when the Supreme Council adopted the law on the administration chiefs.... [Voronov] Three years ago there was no question either of an opposition or of administration chiefs. It should not be forgotten that the institution of administration chief was introduced on 18 January 1992 for the "transitional period" up to 1995. But this system of state power was subsequently enshrined in Chapter XV of the 1993 constitution. For this reason alone I voted against its adoption.... There was no opposition then, nor is there such now.... There can be opposition to some policy or program. The leadership of Kazakhstan does not have an integral program. Remember what became of the government's hefty Anticrisis Program? A statement of economic policy for 1994 on one-fourth of a page of newspaper! [Omarova] Certain highly progressive deputies opted at that time for the administrative positions offered by the president. Everyone is free to choose for himself, naturally, but what had changed? The legislators lost their best, and the executive authorities did not, alas, acquire in their person new faces.... Yet we need to change the system.... [Voronov] Truly, the system of state power needs to be changed. As long as there is a Gauleiter structure of administration of the state and a personnel policy according to the "shuffling of the old pack" principle is pursued and as long as the authorities have an opportunity to adopt unlawful decisions and perpetrate illegal actions (even anticonstitutional actions such as the notorious Operation Noose) with impunity, there will be no improvement in either the economy or in policy.... Changing the system without the presence in society of interested and powerful political forces, an independent press, and the desire of the people themselves, on the other hand, is impossible. Although the chief of state still has, in my opinion, an opportunity to rely on healthy forces and rectify the situation. [Omarova] The elections to the Supreme Council and the councils of various levels showed that the people are tired and that the struggle for deputy's seats was conducted, in the main, by three parties--the Union of Popular Unity of Kazakhstan, the Socialist Party, and the People's Congress of Kazakhstan--and also the trade unions, both official and independent. All the other parties and movements managed to elect only individual deputies. It is obvious that the lack of experience and the absence of real leaders took their toll, or was it entirely a question of the nomenklatura that, having consolidated, took revenge for previous defeats? [Voronov] I would not say so. The people are tired not of elections, the people are tired of indigence, deception, and the mockery of the authorities. And had ceased to believe in these authorities. And it was a struggle not between parties and movements but between the "power party" (to which of the grassroots associations only the SNEK [Union of Popular Unity of Kazakhstan] pertained) and all the rest.... The nomenklatura in Kazakhstan was never defeated. Just look who is running the state currently. Eighty percent of that same party nomenklatura that has become "market and anticommunist." Individual failures are of no consequence. It is another matter that even the nomenklatura is heterogeneous and is itself torn by contradictions connected primarily with access to the shareout of the "public pie" called privatization. [Omarova] Parliament has turned out to be quite variegated. Can it justify itself? How professional is the Supreme Council with this breakdown, when there are practically no lawyers or economists? [Voronov] Parliament should not be justifying itself.... Parliament should be performing its main functions: legislative and supervisory. And performing them to a high standard. Professionalism depends not on the presence of lawyers or economists in the Supreme Council but on the work of professional politicians in it. There are in Kazakhstan, I very much regret to say, very, very few professional politicians (regional and republican) of stature.... There are even fewer people prepared for law-making activity. The new parliament began work in violation of the constitution, and not only its professionalism but also its probity, more precisely, legitimacy, was thereby immediately called in question. I am talking about the fact that the Central Election Commission and then parliament also recognized the authority of all the elected deputies, despite the noncompliance by the majority of them with the requirements of Article 68 of the Constitution (all candidates undertook in their statement consenting to run to abide unconditionally by the demands of this article and to resign their positions). In addition, according to the reports of certain deputies, they have been invited into oblast administrations, where they have been insistently advised against leaving their positions; do not move to the capital but take leave to discharge your deputy's obligations, which is anticonstitutional. [Omarova] Whatever you may say about the masses, it is hard to exaggerate the role of the individual. And we have to speak about this. Whom among the deputies today might you cite as leaders, who influences parliament's adoption of laws that are vitally necessary for our society? [Voronov] There are, in principle, many leaders, but mentioning them by name is not the best thing to do. The elaboration and adoption of laws needed by the people of Kazakhstan can only be influenced by daily painstaking work in the groups of deputies, factions, commissions, and committees. What account the present formal leaders will give of themselves in them is hard to say.... Perhaps they will, on the contrary, perform a destructive role. [Omarova] The president of the country has declared repeatedly that reforms are progressing here. Perhaps parliament also should have waited before adopting a decision on no confidence in the policy of the government (read: the president)? [Voronov] The institution of the presidency is now four (!) years old here. The present president has been in the main roles in the state for approximately 10 years. In such a length of time many states, even postsocialist states, have achieved pretty good results in reforms. The day when it will be necessary to answer to the people is not far off, the 1966 elections are coming right up.... Soon our people, objectively more civilized than the Americans in 1776, in my opinion, will also come to an understanding of the proposition of the U.S. Declaration of Independence of universal significance: "All men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness...." [Omarova] But market reforms objectively cannot fail to encounter serious difficulties? [Voronov] But the pilfering of the state treasury and the natural resources, the arbitrary action and lack of responsibility of the bureaucracy, corruption, "plunderization," and so forth--are these the market? Can reforms leading to the constant deterioration in the situation of the people be considered legal (that is, market)? It is being suggested to the people that they rely only on themselves, endure, tighten their belts, and such here. If the country is sliding into the abyss, everyone should suffer, and government officials should not be paid high salaries. There should be no talk today about the prestige and responsibility of public service.... In a destitute country ministers should not be driving around in Mercedes but in small cars and only on official business. Not flying in Boeings but on regular scheduled passenger aircraft.... Neither Somalia nor Vietnam permit themselves such things. Why did the parliament of the powerful FRG discuss not so long since the question of whether Chancellor H. Kohl's automobile was not too expensive? Even in the Chile of the times of Pinochet (under a fascist regime) and now, when the country is developing rapidly, officialdom has not permitted itself to "grab" Mercedes at public expense because market reforms truly have been undertaken there. Even now, according to eyewitnesses, there are fewer imported cars there than in Kazakhstan (in Almaty even, perhaps). It seems to me that the Supreme Council would be a big market supporter were it to bring under control and place within a legal framework the super-market reforms of the executive. And this is its sole chance of survival.... [Omarova] The first steps in this direction have already been taken, we recall the statement of the Supreme Council on legislative policy. And this despite the fact that many people were speaking about a "pocket," pro-president parliament. [Voronov] Our long-standing forecasts that parliament would not be a "pocket-presidential" parliament are being justified. It is formed mainly by administration chiefs, who have long objectively constituted a particular team. And this is why. One process is, in principle, under way single-mindedly and successfully in the state: the so-called privatization undertaken by the State Property Committee. The administration chiefs, however, have been distanced from it, and the numerous conflicts between them and the territorial authorities of the State Property Committee bear this out. And the chiefs (or their people in parliament) have yet to have their "market" say.... [Omarova] And would you be having your say about this had you been reelected a deputy? [Voronov] I always try to speak my mind and say what I and my fellow thinker-colleagues consider right. I spoke about this to the president twice as his assistant, and I have not since been admitted to him.... I am sure that my deputy friends will say all that needs to be said from the parliamentary podium. Better than I could, perhaps. [Omarova] What should we expect from parliament? What is your forecast? [Voronov] Forecasts are a thankless task. In my opinion, before the 1966 elections there will be either another executive or yet another "self-dissolution".... Although a dissolution, most likely. Parliament now is like a clean sheet of paper. It will not assume our (12th Supreme Council) "sins." Nor will it assume the sins of the executive. With the constantly deteriorating position of the people it will simply be forced to "play to the electorate," lest it be swept away by a wave of popular anger, and, consequently, to make claims against the executive (and the judiciary, for that matter), which is not accustomed to rendering account. And we are seeing this in an analysis of the first months of work of the supreme legislative body.
