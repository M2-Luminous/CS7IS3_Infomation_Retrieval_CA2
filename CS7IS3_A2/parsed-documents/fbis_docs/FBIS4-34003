In his first speech at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, the Cuban president regretted that his country is being excluded from that forum to take place in Miami, Florida, in December. He said that it will be a good opportunity for demanding the end of the economic blockade against Cuba. During the speech, Castro, clearly alluding to the United States, asked: "What can we expect today from an invariably expansionist, egotistic, and hegemonist power?" The Cuban chief of state, who wore a white guayabera instead of his usual military uniform said: Ibero-American summits have reaffirmed the decision of the countries of the region to meet "without asking others for permission and without irritating exclusions." He noted that Washington's proposal is aimed at congregating the chiefs of state of the continent in the city of Miami, mecca of Cubans who have lived in exile for the past three decades. Castro said: "The alleged landlords of this hemisphere have prohibited Cuba, a country that has endured aggressions and a blockade for more than 30 years, to participate in that meeting" in Miami. The Cuban chief of state complained: "How much cowardice, mediocrity, and political misery that exclusion reveals." Castro added: "There has been an Alliance for Progress and the Initiative for the Americas. No one remembers them now." [passage omitted] Castro spoke in favor of establishing hemispheric cooperation mechanisms to combat drug-trafficking, but he cautioned that this must not be done at the expense of the sovereignty of countries.
