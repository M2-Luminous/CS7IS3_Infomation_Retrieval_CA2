They claim that "a special inspection of two military sites must be made". Commenting on this, an analyst of MINJU CHOSON today says: What Hata said is a very unreasonable balderdash intended to put a brake on the implementation of the agreement reached between the DPRK and the IAEA with much difficulty after repeated negotiations. The inspection agreed upon this time is not routine and ad hoc inspections pursuant to the safeguards agreement but an inspection under the special situation in which the DPRK temporarily suspended the effectuation of its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty. We do not think that the foreign minister of a country put his nose into our inspection issue, not knowing this. Hata's claim for "special inspection of two military sites" reveals his sinister intention to spoil the agreement on inspection for guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards which was reached with much difficulty and force a "special inspection" upon us at any cost. His rigmarole is nothing but a petty trick to divert elsewhere the attention of the world from Japan's nuclear armament by obstructing the solution to our nuclear issue and aggravating the relations between the DPRK and the IAEA and between the DPRK and the United States. We warn that Japanese Foreign Minister Hata and his likes must act with discretion, clearly knowing what the "special inspection" means and what consequences it will entail.
