On other occasions, the rumors were mere speculation. Moreover, in the case of Paraguay, the risk of an interruption, or even the reversal of the democratic process, cannot be rejected. But today the possibilities for a traditional coup are very few. This is not, however, because of the democratic characteristics of a certain protagonist who could head a military revolt. Oviedo has proven, with sufficient evidence, that democratic norms and procedures are dead letters for him. But he is aware that it is not suitable--nor does he right now have the reasons to do so--to interrupt the process. He has the necessary power to allow him to project himself into the future. The fact is that he is one of the powers behind the government. The current and inconclusive transitional scenario permits this play of parallel powers. Referring to the current scenario, Diego Abente Brun says: "Civilian and political freedom will presumably be maintained and expanded, but the contest to guarantee that the election results will not endanger the hegemony of the military and/or the governing party will be limited. This scenario of continuous and gradual liberalization is what at other times has been called restrictive democracy." ("Scenarios for the Future" in Abente Brun, Diego (compiler), "Paraguay in Transition." Caracas, Nueva Sociedad, 1993, page 234). Eternal Transition In other words, and in this respect, an inconclusive transition and restrictive democracy are one and the same. Abente Brun's description corresponds to the phase that we are now experiencing. But what is even more worrying is the fact that it is a scenario that can be projected to 1996 [municipal elections] and 1998 [presidential elections] if certain substantial changes do not occur in the judicial branch and the Armed Forces. If the two branches are not purged of party politics, especially the Electoral Court, the 1998 elections could be a repetition, even including an improved version of its vices, of what happened in 1993. Therefore, from the perspective of those who are trying to outline the game plan for the current power elite for the years after 1998, the most important thing is not a coup d'etat (it would cause many problems with the international community: read loans). They will try to overcome all possible obstacles in an attempt to ensure that there are no institutions that will effectively guarantee the free play of democracy, but will maintain the facade and sufficient public freedom in order to legitimize themselves in the external spheres. Therefore, the central theme for completing the transition does not reside so much in the risk of a coup d'etat, at least not under current circumstances. The axis of the debate should be centered on the mechanisms that favor the adapting of certain institutions and leaderships to democratic conditions. And it is here where we have the risks, as we have said above, of bogging down. The changes in the judicial branch do not favor the creation of a favorable atmosphere for that democratic institutionalization. The Agendas Blend Since mid-February the social agenda, which has been repeatedly announced in previous evaluations, has been added to this inconclusive political transition. From that date we now find ourselves in a time of key definitions. On the one hand it, is a question of trying to close the political transition agenda, and on the other, and at the same time, undertake public social policies that will include the poorest sectors. But neither the political nor the social agenda can be undertaken by just one political protagonist. And much less so can this protagonist come from the Colorado Party, which lacks stability in its leadership and which has a minority in Congress, in addition to the split due to the dissidence of the Argana faction. The scenario calls for a policy of basic consensus. But we return to the beginning; during this phase, the basic consensus must include priority for drastic changes in the judicial branch and modifications in certain leaderships in the Armed Forces. If the Liberals [Authentic Liberal Radical Party] and National Encounter accept any type of agreement without clear demands and commitments that will be complied with (as opposed to what President Wasmosy did with the 13 January [1994] "democratic commitment"), then they will be betting in favor of strengthening restrictive democracy and in the medium term for maintenance of the invisible powers.
