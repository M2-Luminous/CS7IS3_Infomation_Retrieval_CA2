To this end, the authorities have decided to invest 8 billion yuan ($920 million) in its post and telecommunication industry in 1994. Of the investment, 2.5 billion yuan ($287 million) will be used to develop mobile telephones. Half of China's 840,000 mobile telephone users live in Guangdong. By the end of this year, Guangdong will have raised installed capacity by 400,000 lines. And the number of customers is expected to rise to 180,000, bringing the province's total to 600,000. Guangdong will also add 2.5 million telephone lines, including 100,000 for international direct dial (IDD) and 50,000 in the countryside. To do this the province is installing 28 cables connecting Guangzhou with Shantou and Macao and undertaking several digital microwave projects. Meanwhile, Guangdong will add 110 postal vans and build 200 more post and telecommunication offices to meet growing demand. Guangdong's post and telecommunications business is expected to amount to 14 billion yuan ($1.61 billion) this year. In 1993 telecommunications alone earned the province 9.4 billion yuan ($1.1 billion). And by 2010 the post and telecommunication industry is expected to have fixed assets worth 270 billion yuan ($31 billion). By then Guangdong will have enough installed capacity to provide telephone service to 45 of every 100 residents. As of l993, 6 percent of Guangdong's residents had a telephone, compared with the national rate of 2.15 per cent. It is expected that in the next two decades, Guangdong will add 2 million telephone users every year. Last year 1 million customers were added to push the total beyond 5 million, or 20 per cent of the country's total. To further promote the industry, Guangdong is considering more imports of advanced equipments this year.
