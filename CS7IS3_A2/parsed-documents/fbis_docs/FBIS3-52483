"Only the leader of the Islamic revolution Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i can pardon him (Szimkus)," Musavi Tabrizi told reporters. A German delegation headed by Deputy Justice Minister Rainer Funke arrived in Iran a few months ago to request clemency for the German spy from Iranian officials. The prosecutor general said that Funke's request that German spy be pardoned has not been sent to the leader of the Islamic revolution for his decision. On anti-narcotics campaign, Ayatollah Musavi Tabrizi said that a special joint law enforcement and army unit has succeeded in tightly controlling the borders and preventing entry of international drug traffickers and narcotic drugs. He added that 70 percent of prisoners have been convicted of drug related offences. The ayatollah said that poppy cultivation in Pakistan and Afghanistan, bordering Iran on the east, was one of the main reasons for smuggling in of these drugs to Iran and added that Islamabad and Kabul governments should pay careful attention to the destructive outcome of poppy cultivation. Ayatollah Musavi Tabrizi added that by sealing off Iran's eastern borders, 70 percent of the anti-narcotics campaign has been completed.
