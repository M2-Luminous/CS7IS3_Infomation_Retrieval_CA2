One of the persons concerned has since left the residence of his own accord. While awaiting a solution, the ambassador has given his permission to the persons involved to remain in the Belgian residence, which enjoys diplomatic immunity. In the contacts that were immediately established with the Cuban authorities, the Belgian Government firmly insisted that the requests of the persons concerned be met, including their wish to leave the country. Despite efforts, it appears the Cuban authorities hold only a faint hope of seeing the interested parties being authorized to leave the country directly from the residence. The Belgian Government will, in any event, continue to demand that a humane solution be found to the situation, including the provision of the necessary guarantees regarding the fate of those involved in the future. In particular, the Belgian Government will not accept these persons being punished for the simple reason that they forced their way into the Belgian residence, concluded the press release issued by the Foreign Ministry.
