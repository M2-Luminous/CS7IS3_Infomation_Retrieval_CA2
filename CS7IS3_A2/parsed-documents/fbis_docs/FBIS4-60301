In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Praise be to God who says: There is the type of man whose speech about this world's life may dazzle thee, and he calls God to witness about what is in his heart, yet is he the most contentious of enemies. When he turns his back, his aim everywhere is to spread mischief through the earth and destroy crops and cattle. But God loveth not mischief. When it is said to him, 'Fear God,' he is led by arrogance to more crime. Enough for him is Hell, an evil bed indeed to lie on. [Koranic verse] God's peace and blessing be upon the seal of prophets and messengers, our Lord Muhammad, and on his family and companions. Esteemed Yemeni people all over unified Yemen: The sons of Yemen are now celebrating the blessed 'Id al-Adha and the fourth anniversary of the establishment of the unity state and the proclamation of the Yemeni Republic on 22 May 1990. On that day, the Yemenis realized their dream and great objective for which they had offered huge sacrifices until God ordained its realization by the merger of the two parts of Yemen and reuniting the one Yemeni family to start building a unified homeland, having removed all forms of oppression, despotism, chaos, and displacement and freed the homeland from the captivity of the atheist, destructive communist ideas. Those ideas had been imposed by evil elements on a precious and dear part of our beloved Yemeni land for quarter of a century, during which our people suffered humiliation and disgrace. Then the dawn of unity broke, heralding an end to a dark night. Thus, the Yemenis enjoyed the dividends of unity under a political regime that is based on the principles of shura, democracy, and political pluralism. While the Yemeni people were celebrating the blessed 'Id al-Adha and the fourth anniversary of the unity, the elements of apostasy and secession insisted on invoking the hateful past and setting the clock back to the time of division and fragmentation of the homeland through al-Bid's secessionist announcement. This announcement has clearly revealed the truth about 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his clique and exposed their secessionist bent and their outright hostility to the people's unity, stability, and progress. The al-Bid's secessionist announcement has proven beyond any shadow of a doubt the truthfulness of the pronouncements of the state's legitimate institutions and bodies to everybody at home and abroad that the crisis has been, all along, a confrontation between constitutional, popular, and unionist legitimacy and a rebellious, secessionist clique. Consequently, this places all the segments of society--parties, organizations, and masses, including the unionists in the Socialist Party--before their true responsibilities toward this heretic announcement and to stand firmly behind the national, unionist ranks, without any hesitation, leniency, procrastination, or excuses. Having examined this traitorous announcement with a high sense of national responsibility; and out of its concern about the higher interests of the sons of unified Yemen, the Higher Council of the Yemeni Reform Grouping condemns and rejects this traitorous announcement that has no legitimacy whatsoever and no constitutional or legal foundation. This announcement is totally null and is deemed high treason and a violation of the Constitution and an infringement on the country's sovereignty, stability, unity, and the higher interest of the Yemeni people. In addition, the announcement was made by someone who does not have the right to issue such an announcement and who has no legitimacy. He is also on the run and his whereabouts is unknown because he is being pursued by the legitimate authorities. Based on this, confronting this announcement is a legitimate national duty and a religious duty to all the sons of the people and the legitimate institutions. These institutions are responsible for discharging their duties. They bear responsibility for protecting the territory of the Yemeni Republic and safeguarding its unity. These institutions are carrying out these important duties, along with the sons of the people. It is the cause of the entire homeland and all the people. The Higher Council of the Yemeni Reform Grouping extends its thanks and appreciation for all the brotherly and friendly countries that support Yemeni unity, since this unity is a major factor of stability in this vital region in which most countries have major interests, such as resources and waterways. We are certain that these countries will not pay attention to the secessionist announcement of al-Bid and his gang, since these countries must realize that this act is hostile to the Yemeni people and that it is a serious precedent that will extend to most fraternal and other countries. We wonder: What hope will remain for our Arab nation to achieve unity when it sees a unified people being fragmented? We also denounce some media characterization of what is happening in Yemen as something between north and south, when it is, in reality, between the authority of a state that is member of all Arab and world organizations and an abominable clique that thinks its selfish interests require secession. We think the defense of Yemeni unity is an Arab and Islamic responsibility first and then a Yemeni responsibility. We are confident, therefore, that all fraternal and friendly nations will side with the one, unified Yemeni people and their will and stability and elected constitutional institutions. We appeal to our unyielding people to side with the legitimate authority and its Armed Forces and to be one rank in this situation and remain vigilant until victory is complete, God willing, by destroying the secessionist clique. On that day, shall the believers rejoice, with the help of God. He gives victory to whom He will, and He is exalted in might, most merciful. It is the promise of God. Never does God fail from His promise, but most men know not. [Koranic verse] Issued by the Higher Council of the Yemeni Reform Grouping on 12 Dhu al-Hijjah, 1414 Hegira, corresponding to 23 May 1994
