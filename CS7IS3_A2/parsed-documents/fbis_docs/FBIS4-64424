[Begin Ciller recording] The oil pipeline system, which constitutes a valuable investment for both Turkey and Iraq, has been left idle for three years and faces the danger of damage and rotting. An agreement has been reached to carry out a sort of rescue operation in order to eliminate this danger. In this way, when the oil embargo is lifted in the future, the system will be able to function uninterruptedly.
