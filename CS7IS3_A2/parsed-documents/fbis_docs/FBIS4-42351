Perhaps it talks too much about taxation.... [Scharping] But this is not true. You have to tell people the truth before elections. We do not want to increase the general level of taxation and social security payments, but distribute them differently, with two objectives: social justice and encouragement of demand. We will reduce the charges which weigh on investment in order to create new jobs and launch new products. [Picaper] But the Socialists have the reputation of imposing taxes. [Scharping] This is precisely what has changed. If the state has new ideas, it must not immediately translate them into new taxes, but achieve them with the money it has and strive to work at less cost. We have promised to prevent any increase in the state's share of the GNP. It is currently 45 percent, which is much too high. [Picaper] Do you want to reduce bureaucracy? [Scharping] We have 18 ministries. Two or three could be eliminated. We will reduce bureaucracy and open the decisionmaking processes to the citizens. We want to modernize the state's work, separate politics from everyday administrative tasks, and speed up the delivery of permits for industrial installations and the marketing of new products. Our priorities are economic growth, protection of the essentials of life, and consolidation of public finances which are burdened by a very large debt. These problems will be easier to solve in the European framework, especially with France, than they are country by country. [Picaper] Do you intend to create a special tax for rebuilding East Germany, as your East German colleague Wolfgang Thierse has suggested? [Scharping] No, why should we dream up new taxes? However, Germany has lost its way under Kohl. There is some egoism in this. After reunification, the Bundesbank damaged growth in Germany with its extraordinarily high interest rates, which concurrently imposed a very heavy burden on our European friends and partners, particularly France. [Picaper] Will you offer the finance portfolio to Karl-Otto Poehl, former president of the Bundesbank, who is a Socialist? [Scharping] Unless I am mistaken, Karl-Otto Poehl disagreed with Helmut Kohl's government during the implementation of German monetary union. For many years he was a very respected president of the Bundesbank. Since his resignation, he has worked in a private bank. His judgment is very important to me. [Picaper] Do you intend to give a ministry to Daimler-Benz Chairman Edzard Reuter, who is deeply involved in politics and who will shortly leave his post as chairman of his enterprise? [Scharping] We are not speculating on the formation of my government. That will come in August. There are many capable entrepreneurs in SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] ranks with whom I have frequent discussions, including Edzard Reuter. Stronger Franco-German Cooperation [Picaper] German production is going badly.... [Scharping] Germany is experiencing many social tensions and regional disparities with some rich regions like Hamburg or Frankfurt, but also very poor regions, especially in the East. Our country still has major assets: its level of vocational training, the productivity of its industry and the quality of its products. It has weaknesses, like the other European countries: unfavorable investment conditions and much too slow a transfer of the results of research into new products. [Picaper] And the European weaknesses? [Scharping] They are to do with inadequate cooperation. The Germans and French are cooperating in aeronautics and space, but why not do so with regard to high-speed land transport -- the high-speed train and ICE [intercity express train]? We would be able to produce a joint product. We ought also to improve in the trans-European information and communications networks, especially in view of increasingly fierce international competition. [Picaper] Do you intend to eliminate nuclear energy, as the Greens do? [Scharping] We can abandon it, especially if we succeed in exploiting renewable energy sources which will be one of the growth markets of the future, solar energy for instance. There are ill-informed people who think there is not enough sun in Europe. In Japan and the United States, they have set to work under the watchword of "ecolution" -- a combination of "ecology" and "evolution." Europe must do the same, to avoid building up an irreversible technological lag. [Picaper] Will the complementary tax of 10 percent on gross incomes higher than 60,000 German marks [DM] for single people and higher than DM120,000 for married couples with which you want to replace the 7.5 percent general solidarity tax be enough to cover the budget deficits? [Scharping] The revenue it will produce will be the same, but, economically and socially, this will make a big difference. It will enable us to release 80 percent of incomes from any additional tax. We are suffering from a paralysis of the internal economic situation, and a marked weakness in growth. To overcome the two, we must create more demand and hence not overburden medium and small incomes. Not Increasing Property Tax [Picaper] Will you increase wealth tax? [Scharping] No, let us wait to see what the Constitutional Court says on this subject. We have promised not to increase the property tax for enterprises or individuals if it is allocated to retirement capital. [Picaper] Hans Peter Stihl, the president of the Chamber of Trade and Industry, said that your inheritance tax will ruin many small- and medium-sized enterprises. [Scharping] He is right. That is precisely why we do not want to increase it. [Picaper] Last year, DM62 billion went abroad. Will you remove banking secrecy to improve deductions at source? [Scharping] No. But, in Europe, we must harmonize capital tax. This will take some time. I have seen that it is on the agenda for the German term as European Union president which begins on 1 July. Theo Waigel has taken this objective. I am anxious to see the result. Moreover, we are consulting with experts to improve the German system even before European harmonization. [Picaper] In France, there are a number of tax-free savings opportunities. I cannot see anything comparable in Germany. [Scharping] In our country, life insurance is virtually tax-free. But I have told you that we intend to study the savings policies of other European countries to bring us closer to other systems first. [Picaper] In our country, direct taxation is lower than in yours. The reverse is true with regard to indirect taxation. Have you thought about that? [Scharping] I am aware of it. It does not just relate to taxes but also energy prices and other spheres. I do not want to make any predictions, because we must first assess the state of the treasury. We do not just have a very high public debt, almost DM2,000 billion, but also hidden deficits in supplementary budgets. Until we clarify all that, we will not be able to draw up a financial policy.
