The other parties and independent candidates did not obtain the necessary number of votes needed to be represented in parliament. The Central Electoral Commission will prepare an official report containing all violations of the [electoral] law found during the ballot. The report will then be sent to the Supreme Court of Justice, which will confirm the legality of the ballot within the following 10 days. Commenting on the results of the parliamentary elections and the [6 March] public opinion poll titled "Consulting With the People" [actually a referendum in which the majority rejected the idea of Moldova's unification with Romania], Dumitru Motpan, the leader of the PDAM -- the party that obtained the most seats in parliament -- stated to ITAR-TASS that the absolute majority of the people has reasserted its belief in the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova. The PDAM will not act to halt reform, but rather it will act to further reform, the PDAM leader said. According to Motpan, the first task is to implement privatization, which will begin by giving land to the peasants. However, generally speaking, the solution to the economic problems depends on whether the state manages to increase labor productivity in Moldova's economy. To that purpose, Moldova will deepen and extend its relations both with the countries belonging to the CIS and with the West, Motpan stated. According to the MOLDOVA-PRES agency, the PDAM leader also announced that the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova will alter the national anthem, which, said Motpan, is identical with neighboring Romania.
