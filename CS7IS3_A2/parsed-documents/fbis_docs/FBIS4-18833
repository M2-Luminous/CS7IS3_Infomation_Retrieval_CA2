They have asked them to be neutral in this ethnic war. Francois Rutayisire, the RPF representative in Paris is quite unambiguous: [Begin Rutayisire recording] Three years ago, France sent in its troops, saying they were there to protect and evacuate French nationals. They ended up staying for three years. We hope this is not going to be the same. [Unidentified correspondent] If on their way to Kigali, RPF troops come into contact with French troops barring their way, will they react violently? [Rutayisire] One of our spokesmen has already answered this question. If anyone gets in the way of the RPF forces, who are fighting to eliminate the presidential Guard, the RPF will not hesitate to fight. [Correspondent] Including against French troops? [Rutayisire] Against whoever gets in its way. [end recording]
