There is, however, still considerable difficulties for China to rejoin the organization within a specified time. He said that under any circumstances China should, as a matter of principle, be a member of GATT and the multilateral trading system. Sutherland, who is in China to attend the international symposium on China's strategy for foreign economy and trade in the 1990's, told Chinese and foreign reporters that he came to China at a time when negotiations on the global multilateral trading system have entered a crucial stage. He has had an opportunity to hear the progress China has made in its active efforts to have its status as a signatory party to GATT restored and he was deeply impressed by China's determination and courage in this regard. Sutherland said: In 1980, China ranked 31th in the world in terms of trade volume. In 1993, it became the 11th largest trading nation in the world. If we count the EC as a single unit, China would have been the 6th largest trading nation. Besides, progress in recent years in legislation and reform has further opened up China's trade. A new global multilateral trading system will be officially inaugurated on 1 January 1995. As a major player, China should play a central role on the world economic stage. The world trading system needs China's participation. Speaking of the "Foreign Trade Law" China just promulgated, Sutherland said: Some of the top topics in negotiations on reentry involved the transparency of China's trading system, consistency of its trade policy, and a series of issues in regard to quotas, licensing, and inspection standards in China's import administration. Promulgation of China's "Foreign Trade Law" will serve as a positive factor in the process of restoring China's GATT status. Sutherland pointed out: Negotiations on China's reentry into GATT have entered a crucial stage. Although China has displayed determination and flexibility in an effort to accomplish this task, whether or not the talks can be completed quickly depends on the attitude of the various signatory parties concerned. If China wishes to have its status restored by year-end, if will have to reach substantive agreements with the various signatory parties by the summer. It is not impossible, but will be rather difficult. Gu Yongjiang, vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation who held the news conference with Sutherland, said: Some of the obstacles to the restoration of China's GATT status are technical, some are political. During numerous talks, China has offered its answers to issues involving tariff reduction, non-tariff reduction, and transparency of its trade system. Some signatory parties, however, have set excessive conditions on China's re-entry into GATT. As a developing country, China is supposed to undertake the obligations of a developing nation and, at the same time, enjoy the corresponding rights as such. He said that many difficulties lie ahead in China's reentry into GATT. China is, however, confident of reaching its goal through bilateral and multilateral negotiations.
