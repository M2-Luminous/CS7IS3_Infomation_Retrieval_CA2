ACTION: Notice of Tentative Determination on Application of State of Utah for Final Approval, Public Hearing and Public Comment Period. SUMMARY: The State of Utah has applied for final approval of its underground storage tank program under Subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).

Notably, the State of Utah's statute authorizes the issuance of regulations that are broader in scope than the Federal regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination.

In addition, anyone who wishes to learn whether the hearing will be held may call the person listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section. A. Background Section 9004 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) enables EPA to approve state underground storage tank programs to operate in the State in lieu of the Federal underground storage tank (UST) program. Program approval is granted by EPA if the Agency finds that the State program: (1) is ``no less stringent'' than the Federal program in all seven elements, and includes notification requirements of section 9004(a)(8), 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a)(8); and (2) provides for adequate enforcement of compliance with UST standards (Section 9004(a), 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a)). B. State of Utah In February 1986, the State of Utah established authority through the Utah Solid and Hazardous Waste Act to implement an underground storage tank program, the State further developed its authority in the UST Act in February 1989. The State adopted the federal rules and developed some additional rules in February 1989. The State submitted a draft application for state program approval in September 1992. EPA reviewed and commented on the draft application and requested additional information to be included in the final application. On September 20, 1993, Utah submitted an official application for final approval. Prior to its submission, Utah provided an opportunity for public notice and comment in the development of its underground storage tank program as required under ยง281.50(b). EPA has reviewed Utah's application, and has tentatively determined that the State's program meets all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final approval. Consequently, EPA intends to grant final approval to Utah to operate its program in lieu of the Federal program. This tentative determination to approve the Utah UST program applies to all activities in Utah outside of Indian Country, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151. The Environmental Protection Agency retains all underground storage tank authority under RCRA which applies to Indian Country in Utah.
