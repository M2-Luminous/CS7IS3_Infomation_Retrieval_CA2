It can work, pass laws, and introduce amendments to the constitution, said Ivan Yemets, chairman of the Central Electoral Committee, in an interview with the Novyny television and radio agency. According to him, 337 deputies were elected in two rounds of elections of people's deputies to the Ukrainian parliament. Among the deputies, 120 were nominated by voters, 89 by parties, and 128 by workers collectives. Most in the new parliament are members of the Communist Party (86); Rukh [Ukrainian People's Movement for Perestroyka] -- 20, Peasants Party -- 18, and 14 were elected by the Socialist Party. Namely these four parties define the party share of the present Supreme Council. As regards the people's deputies in the current parliament, 56 of the 188 members who ran in the elections were elected. As Ivan Yemets reported, repeat elections will be held in 112 districts among which the elections in 92 districts were valid but the voters did not cast the required number of votes in favor of the candidates. The elections were void in 20 districts where voters ignored their candidates and did not turn out at the polling stations in sufficient numbers. According to the law, repeat elections should be held within one month, but according to Ivan Yemets, there are still problems which the Central Electoral Commission has to resolve.
