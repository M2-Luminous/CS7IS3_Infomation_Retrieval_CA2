If the South Korean authorities truly think of the destiny of the country and the nation, they should give up their anachronistic view of confrontation, come back to the stand of national independence, sincerely accept the proposal of anyone if it is helpful to the peace and Reunification of the country and make no scruple of jointly opening the way of the nation.
