The 50-meter, two-stage rocket is the first major space vehicle developed and manufactured entirely in Japan, freeing Japan's aerospace industry after decades of heavy dependence on U.S. technology. Previous Japanese rockets used U.S. technology under a licensing agreement that bans launches of third-nation satellites. The orange and yellow H-2 rocket blasted off early Friday at Tanegashima Space Center in southwestern Japan after a three-day delay due to bad weather and technical snags. As scheduled, the rocket released a dish-shaped payload called the Orbital Reentry Experiment (OREX) about 15 minutes after blastoff, successfully having it reenter the atmosphere to gather data for developing a Japanese version of the U.S. space shuttle. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa issued a statement hailing the successful launch of the H-2 rocket as "creating new prospects for the 21th century." Tomifumi Godai, chief of the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA), said the successful liftoff of the H-2 rocket put an end to "a quarter-century approach run" to catch up with the United States and other aerospace leaders. "Now we mark the beginning of activity to lead the world," Godai told a press conference. Masato Yamano, NASDA director in charge of the launch of the H-2 rocket, described the two-hour space mission as a great step forward toward space development. "The successful launch of the H-2 rocket demonstrates the practicality of our technologies developed to date and is a great achievement toward developing a transport system to promote diversified space activities," Yamano said. The H-2 rocket, Japan's first rocket capable of launching large communications and earth observation satellites, was developed by Rocket Systems Corp. (RSC), a consortium of more than 70 companies led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., at a cost of 270 billion yen. The technological centerpiece of the rocket is the first-stage engine, the LE7, modeled on the U.S. space shuttle engine and considered one of the world's most sophisticated rocket power drives. But due to the complexity of the LE7 engine that runs on liquid hydrogen and oxygen, the first launch of the H-2 rocket was two years behind schedule as a series of accidents delayed the project, including an explosion in 1991 that killed an engineer and a fuel leak in 1992 that burned an engine in test running. People involved in the H-2 rocket development said the launch was a complete success, but acknowledged there are many problems to be overcome before Japan can get a foothold in the satellite-launching business. The biggest problem is to make the H-2 competitive in the international satellite-launching market, currently dominated by the European consortium Arianespace and General Dynamics Corp. of the United States. The H-2 rocket costs some 19 billion yen, including launching expenses, which makes it 1.5 to two times more expensive than its U.S. and European counterparts. But NASDA and RSC officials are looking to make up for the price disadvantage with a reputation for reliability. "We could offset such a price gap if we increase reliability," an RSC official said. There are still nontechnical hurdles, such as a pact with fishermen around Tanegashima Island. The agreement allows launches only in the January-February and August-September periods, because the launches disrupt fishing activity, meaning only two rockets can be launched a year. "I wonder if we could have rocket launches in better seasons such as spring and autumn," one NASDA official said.
