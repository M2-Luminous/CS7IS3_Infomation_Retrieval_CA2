Paektu Is Firm Guarantee of Accomplishing Revolutionary Cause of Chuche" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, January 15 (KCNA) -- The revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu was created in the days of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle waged under the wise guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. It is a spirit of unfailing loyalty to the leader, a revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle to tide over difficulties by one's own effort and an indomitable revolutionary spirit of rising again and fighting even if one might fall a thousand and one times. NODONG SINMUN says this in an article today. The article says: The revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu underlies the tremendous force that made it possible to defeat the Japanese and the U.S. imperialists in the past and build a socialist power of independence, self-sustenance and self-reliance in defence on this land. Now it serves as an invincible ideological and moral weapon for the Korean people who are carrying the Korean-style socialist cause through to accomplishment. It is, above all, an eternal life-giving water that helps the entire Korean people hold in high esteem the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il with unfailing loyalty. It contains the revolutionary attitude toward the leader and view of life that should be acquired by the chuche-type revolutionaries faithful to the party and the leader. When we actively learn from the spirit, we can all become true revolutionaries like anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners who staunchly fought with one mind of loyalty to the leader in any circumstances. The revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu also powerfully encourages the Korean people to glorify the Korean-style socialism holding aloft the revolutionary banner of self-reliance and hard struggle. The anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle was an arduous revolutionary war fought against the Japanese imperialists armed to the teeth in reliance on one's own strength with neither a state support nor foreign assistance. The anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters always pulled through difficulties by displaying highly the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle in their struggle full of trials, and fully displayed the revolutionary habit of unconditionally carrying out any difficult and hard revolutionary tasks by their own effort. The revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle displayed highly in those days has now become a powerful ideological and moral source for the Korean people in thoroughly implementing the party's revolutionary economic strategy and successfully building the Korean-style socialism. Self-reliance is the only way to smash the imperialists' economic blockade and effect a steady upsurge in socialist economic construction. There will be no tasks we cannot carry out, or no fortress we cannot occupy when we continue to actively follow the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle displayed by the anti- Japanese revolutionary fighters. The revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu is the ideological and moral source of the strength that enables the Korean people to staunchly go along the road of revolution with an indomitable fighting spirit and strong will.
