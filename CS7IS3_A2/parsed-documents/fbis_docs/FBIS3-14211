The statement was a shock to human feelings and to the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. It was also a flagrant violation of the international agreements on maintaining the legal status of Jerusalem and ran counter to U.S. policy itself, which meticulously refrained from recognizing the city as the capital of the Israeli state. President Clinton's surprise behavior is an indication of the indecision of the U.S. Administration, which on the one hand speaks about peace and on the other pours fuel on the fire, thus inflaming the feelings of Arabs and Muslims who no longer believe in the usefulness of the new world order headed by the United States. The surprise U.S. decision has swept away all the dreams for peace and stability in the Middle East. Its dire consequences will appear sooner or later because insulting Arab ideals and feelings cannot go unpunished. The Arab people are capable of regaining their dignity even if they are disappointed by their governments, who have adopted an impotent stance on the U.S. decision. Condemning this unjust decision, the Wafd Party calls on all national parties, organizations, and forces to stand together against this impending danger threatening the Arab nation. The U.S. Administration must know that the voice of the people is stronger than it thinks.
