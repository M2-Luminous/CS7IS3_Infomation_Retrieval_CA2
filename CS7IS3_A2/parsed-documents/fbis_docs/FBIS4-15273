Paradoxes in Russia are not an exception, but a rule -- despite the continuing production decline, enterprises are in no hurry to get rid of the redundant employees, appealing to the temporary character of current difficulties. While the total production output dropped by 16 per cent in Russia in 1993, the number of workers and employees decreased only by five per cent. Even the shortage of raw materials, fuel and spare parts and overstocked warehouses have failed to discourage plants and companies from sacking their employees. To retain their workforce, they resort to various ruses, including shorter working weeks or unpaid leaves. The leadership of Moscow's Zil automobile plant that halted its assembly lines on April 4 laid off workers and employees, promising to pay 75 per cent of their leaves. As of the beginning of the year over seven per cent of all workforce in industry worked part time. However, market relations are beginning to make themselves felt. Industries which have already completed the process of privatisation are more willing to get rid of the redundant labour. In machine engineering and metal working industry the number of workers dropped by 800,000 in 1993, in chemical and petrochemical industry by 50,000. Another factor is that labour is flowing from the state sector to private businesses. Currently, less than 19 million people work in Russia's industry. Slightly more than half of them work at state enterprises, one third at firms and companies with mixed form of ownership and 11 per cent in private business. However, the situation is tend to change rather rapidly. Specialists of the Russian State Property Management Committee said that if the pace of privatisation is maintained -- over 900 large and medium-sized enterprises a month -- more than 70 per cent of industrial enterprises will become private by the middle of the year. They will employ 17 million people.
