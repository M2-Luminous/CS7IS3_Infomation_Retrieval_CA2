Talks dealt with several issues related to the fact-finding mission of the UN secretary general's envoy in implementation of Security Council Resolution 924. Brother Lakhdar Brahimi briefed the brother president on the results of his contacts within the framework of the mission entrusted to him by the UN secretary general. The brother Presidential Council chairman emphasized anew our country's commitment to Security Council Resolution 924. He also noted the Yemeni Government's cease-fire initiatives since the resolution was adopted in order to give those who rebelled against legitimacy the chance to stop fighting and spare Yemeni blood. However, they foiled all these initiatives and did not respond to the calls made by brothers and friends to cease fire. They violated the cease-fire and did not commit themselves to the Security Council resolution with the aim of prolonging the conflict and internationalizing the Yemeni crisis. He stressed our country's readiness for an open-minded dialogue to activate the entire joint military committee, which comprises the Yemeni side and a military team from the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the Sultanate of Oman, and the U.S. and French military attaches to our country, to supervise adherence to the cease-fire. This dialogue can take place in any of the following Arab capitals: Damascus, Riyadh, Cairo, or Rabat, within the framework of commitment to the principles that maintain unity, democracy, constitutional legitimacy, and sovereignty and independence of the one Yemen. He emphasized our country's appreciation for Lakhdar Brahimi's efforts and its desire to extend all possible support to render his mission successful in a manner that realizes security, stability, and peace for Yemen. The meeting was attended by brother Muhammad Salim Basindwah, foreign minister, and 'Awni al-'Ani, UN Bureau representative in our country. Following his meeting with brother Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council chairman, brother Lakhdar Brahimi replied to questions posed by [Yemeni] television by saying that he has been acquainted with the Yemeni views as well as the views of others in the region, and he will complete this task within the next two days in a way that will enable him to carry out his basic mission--the submission of a report to the UN secretary general. He added: I think I held useful talks on two basic points at this stage. These are ceasing fire to stop the bloodshed and starting dialogue. Brother Lakhdar Brahmi left Sanaa last night at the end of a short visit to our country.
