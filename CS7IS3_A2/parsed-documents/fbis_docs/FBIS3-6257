Ozawa told a group of reporters in the Diet that it would be difficult because he has not made any preparations for the trip. His U.S. visit was believed to be a troubleshooting mission to find a breakthrough in the strained Japan-U.S. trade ties. Secretary general of the coalition's primary bloc Shinseito and a close associate of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Ozawa initially considered going to Washington on March 21 at the request of the National Press Club to deliver a speech. Ozawa, however, had eyed using the opportunity to meet officials in the administration of President Bill Clinton and congressional leaders to work out difficulties that hampered the development of bilateral economic ties following the failure of the "framework" trade talks last month, political sources said. Hosokawa and Clinton failed to reach agreement in the talks aimed at opening up Japan's market to U.S. goods and reducing its huge trade surplus. On the possibility of visiting the U.S. in the future, Ozawa said he would consider going after the intense media speculation over the trip has died down.
