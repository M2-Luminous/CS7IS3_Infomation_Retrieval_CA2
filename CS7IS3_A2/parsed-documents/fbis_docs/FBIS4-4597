He said that even at the cost of war that may be triggered on the Korean peninsula again, the United States will suspend the development of nuclear arms and it has made a series of military preparations for this. Moreover, he unhesitatingly and undisguisedly made violent remarks on war that the United States will deal an overwhelming air strike against someone else's provocation within 24 hours. These bellicose remarks by U.S. Defense Secretary should not be overlooked in view of the grave situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula today. As is known to all, the United States totally reversed the agreement reached during the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York by presenting unreasonable excuses, instead of doing what it should have done according to this agreement, thus leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to an extreme pitch. By raving about resumption of the Team Spirit nuclear war exercise, the United States deployed in the advance area the U.S. naval fleet made up of 30 ships, including a mobile aircraft carrier unit, so that the fleet can reach the coast of our country within 24 hours. In addition, Patriot missiles departed Texas, United States and are on the way to South Korea at the order of the U.S. President. Meanwhile, the U.S. military is working out a plan to deploy 600,000 troops, including two Marine corps divisions from the U.S. mainland; 200-odd ships and vessels, and 1,600-odd airplanes to the Korean peninsula within 80 days in an emergency. Timed to coincide with this bustling military move, U.S. Defense Secretary made violent remarks about an overwhelming air strike, and so forth. This clearly shows the U.S. imperialists' intention to start a war of aggression on the Korean peninsula at last. The United States raved that such military steps are to be taken because we are developing nuclear weapons. However, this is nothing but sophism designed to deceive the people and to justify its maneuvers of aggression by misleading public opinion. As is known to all, the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula occurred when the United States began to bring nuclear weapons to South Korea. As the United States threatened our people with them, the problem has increased. Nevertheless, the United States, the offender of a nuclear threat, laid blame on us, the sufferer, and expanded the war maneuvers in a step-by-step manner. This is an intolerable crime that is the same as a thief calling, "Stop thief!" These are stereotypical tactics used by the U.S. imperialists whenever they invade other nations. As the whole world knows, all situations illustrate that the one who is blocking the road of a solution to the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula is none other than the United States and the ringleader who is driving the situation on the Korean peninsula into a phase of confrontation and war is none other than the United States. The U.S. imperialists should correctly realize that they cannot solve the problem by a military threat and menace, nor can they frighten and bring our people to their knees. This is proven by historic facts, including the Korean war in the early 1950's, the Pueblo incident in the 1960's, and the Panmunjom incident in the 1970's. The time when the means of force worked disappeared a long time ago. The time when the United states could threaten and menace small nations by wielding military clubs as a almighty means and act like the international police is gone forever. Moreover, the Korean people are not the people of the past when the nation was just liberated from the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule, but are the mighty and dignified people who shape their destiny independently by grasping it in their own hands. Our people have a firm self-reliant national economy and strong defense capabilities to defend our-style socialism by smashing any aggressor in a stroke. Our people do not want war but are not afraid of war. It is our consistent position to resolve the nuclear problem through dialogue and negotiations. If the United States is truly interested in resolving the nuclear problem, it should not adhere to foolish military means and discard nuclear threats to us. It should first take a step to give up the policy of hostility against us. If the United States, instead of doing this, advances along the road of provoking a war by further aggravating tension, the rascals will suffer only bitter defeat. If the Korean war in 1950 was described as the beginning of a downward slope for the U.S. imperialists, a second Korean war will drive the U.S. imperialists into a corner from which they can never come out. The United States should ponder the consequences to be brought about by its new war provocation maneuvers and should act with discretion.
