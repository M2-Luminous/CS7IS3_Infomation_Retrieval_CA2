FR941130-0-00021 FR941130-0-00002 Authority: 12 U.S.C. 378, 1813, 1815, 1816, 1817(a)(2)(b), 1817(j), 1818, 1819 (``Seventh'', ``Eighth'' and ``Tenth''), 1828, 1831e, 1831o, 1831p&hyph;1(a); 15 U.S.C. 1607. 2. Section 303.15 is revised to read as follows: ยง303.15 Mutual-to-stock conversions of mutually owned state-chartered savings banks. (a) Prior notice requirement. In addition to complying with the substantive requirements in ยง333.4 of this chapter, an insured state-chartered mutually owned savings bank that proposes to convert from mutual to stock form shall file with the FDIC a notice of intent to convert to stock form and copies of all documents filed with state and federal banking and/or securities regulators in connection with the proposed conversion. An institution that is in the process of converting to stock form that has filed a proposed stock conversion application with the applicable state and federal regulators (or otherwise has initiated a stock conversion) prior to the effective date of this section shall file the required materials with the FDIC as soon as practicable. An insured mutual savings bank chartered by a state that does not require the filing of application materials to convert from mutual to stock form that proposes to convert to the stock form shall notify the FDIC of the proposed conversion and provide the materials requested by the FDIC. (b) Content and filing of notice _(1) Content of notice. The notice required to be filed under paragraph (a) of this section shall provide a description of the proposed conversion and include a copy of all notices or applications concerning the proposed conversion, including all attachments or appendices thereto, that have been filed with any state and federal banking and/or securities regulators. Copies of all agreements entered into as part of the mutual-to-stock conversion between the institution, its officers, directors/trustees and any other institution and/or its successors also must be provided. (2) Filing of notice. Notices shall be filed with the regional director (DOS) in the region in which the institution seeking to convert is headquartered at the same time as the conversion application materials are filed with the institution's primary state regulator. (c) Review by FDIC. (1) The FDIC shall review the materials submitted by the institution seeking to convert from mutual to stock form. The FDIC, in its discretion, may request any additional information it deems necessary to evaluate the proposed conversion and the institution shall provide such information to the FDIC expeditiously. Among the factors to be reviewed by the FDIC are: (i) The use of the proceeds from the sale of stock, as prescribed in the business plan; (ii) The adequacy of the disclosure materials; (iii) The participation of depositors in approving the transaction; (iv) The form of the proxy statement required for the vote of the depositors/members on the conversion; (v) Any increased compensation and other remuneration (including stock grants, stock option rights and other similar benefits) to be obtained by officers and directors/trustees of the bank in connection with the conversion; (vi) The adequacy and independence of the appraisal of the value of the mutual savings bank for purposes of determining the price of the shares of stock to be sold; (vii) The process by which the bank's trustees approved the appraisal, the pricing of the stock and the compensation arrangements for insiders; (viii) The nature and apportionment of stock subscription rights; and (ix) The bank's plans to fulfill its commitment to serving the convenience and needs of its community. (2) In reviewing the materials required to be submitted under this section, the FDIC will take into account the extent to which the proposed conversion conforms with the various provisions of the mutual-to-stock conversion regulations of the Office of Thrift Supervision (12 CFR Part 563b), as currently in effect at the time the FDIC reviews the required materials related to the proposed conversion. Any non-conformity with those provisions will be closely scrutinized. Conformity with the OTS requirements, however, will not be sufficient for FDIC regulatory purposes if the FDIC determines that the proposed conversion would pose a risk to the institution's safety and soundness, violate any law or regulation or present a breach of fiduciary duty. (d) Notification of completed filing of materials. The FDIC shall notify the institution when all the required materials related to the proposed conversion have been filed with the FDIC and the notice is thereby complete for purposes of computing the time periods designated in paragraphs (e) and (g) of this section.
