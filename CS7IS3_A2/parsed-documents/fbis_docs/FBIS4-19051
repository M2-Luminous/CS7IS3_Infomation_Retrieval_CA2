He calls for reducing the list of countries for which a permit is obligatory from the current 33 to only eight to 10. Rexrodt's desire to reduce export controls takes the desire of industry into account. At the moment there are 33 states on the so-called Country List H; the fragmentation of Yugoslavia has not yet been taken into account. On the fringes of a visit to Egypt, Rexrodt had stated: "We will considerably shorten the H List." He is inclined to reduce it to "eight to 10" states and to also strike Egypt from this list. The FDP politician pointed out that his "considerations" still require coordination with his colleagues in the Cabinet. The list contains nonallied countries that have not signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, have biological or chemical combat agents or carrier weapons, or are located in areas of tension. The list includes, for instance, India, Brazil, Argentina, China, Iraq, Iran, and many Arab states. The background of the proposal is the necessary harmonization of export regulations within the European Union (EU). The common single market forces coordinated dealing with the export of such "dual-use goods," which are to be included in weapons systems or are destined to the production of weapons. German regulations are stricter than those abroad. A harmonization at the high German level has been rejected by 10 EU countries. Therefore, a regulation to permit Germany a stricter practice is being discussed. The top associations of industry reject solo action. A shortened country list could change that. Following the negative worldwide headlines about the participation of German companies in the construction of poison-gas factories in Libya and Iraq, the liberal-conservative coalition tightened the law. Since then, Article 5c of the Foreign Economy Regulation says that the planned export of dual-use goods must be approved by the Federal Export Office in Eschborn, if the recipient is in a country that is on the H List and the exporter knows that the goods are to be for a certain purpose or are to be used for armament production. These stipulations force German companies to ask their customers what they intend to do with their goods. Industry considers this to be a competitive disadvantage. The number of 5c-cases is declining strongly. Last year, the Federal Export Office rejected the export of goods with a total value of 46 million German marks [DM] (the previous year DM50 million). According to information released by the office, the export of dual-use goods to a value of DM71 million (previous year DM220 million) that were to be used for armament purposes was approved.
