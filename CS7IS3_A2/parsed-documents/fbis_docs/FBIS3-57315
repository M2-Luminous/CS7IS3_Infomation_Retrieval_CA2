As is known, the decision adopted by the Ukrainian Supreme Council on 18 November 1993 states that the republic does not regard it as obligatory for it to accede to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The document containing Leonid Kravchuk's proposal was distributed to Supreme Council members to look at today. In the note accompanying the draft parliamentary decision, Leonid Kravchuk notes that the accords reached in Moscow on 14 January between the presidents of Russia, the United States, and Ukraine provide guarantees for the national security of Ukraine, pledges by the United States to grant Ukraine a minimum of 175 million dollars for the dismantling of the nuclear weapons, with the possibility that this amount may be increased, and also the removal of all nuclear charges from Ukraine to Russia for dismantling with the simultaneous provision of compensation to the republic in the form of removed and processed nuclear fuel for nuclear power engineering. Further, the Ukrainian president's note states that the United States has declared its readiness to help Ukraine to develop a market economy. The Ukrainian Supreme Council plans to examine the question of the trilateral Moscow Statement of the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia this week.
