Statistics show that in the first four months of this year, rural and township enterprises in the autonomous region generated 6.71 billion yuan of output value and produced 800 million yuan of profits and taxes, both more than doubling that in the same period of last year. The implementation of the central government's strategy of accelerating the development of rural and township industry in the country's central and northwest areas has created a favorable environment for Inner Mongolia to develop rural industry, but its growth has long been hindered by a shortage of funds. Early this year, the autonomous region set up a leading group to coordinate rural and township enterprises and initiated a special development fund for rural and township enterprises. The fund is established with the purpose of helping existing rural enterprises to enlarge production and helping poor and remote rural areas start more rural enterprises. To ensure effective input of funds for rural enterprises and guarantee efficient use of money, the autonomous region has also worked out rules which stipulate that rural and township enterprises should report their new projects and detailed procedures for starting the projects. The establishment of the fund has provided a financial guarantee to help boost the autonomous region's rural industry. According to local officials, Inner Mongolia invested one billion yuan to develop rural industry in the first quarter of this year. It also plans to pump a total of 2.5 billion yuan in loans into the development of rural industry this year, an increase of 50 percent compared with last year.
