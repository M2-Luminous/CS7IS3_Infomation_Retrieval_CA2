What are your feelings after having seen the situation in the field? [Claes] I cannot hide my concern at the present political vacuum, an economy in free fall, and the fact that the conditions which would permit the implementation of the Arusha accords have still not been met. But we cannot wait any longer: All the parties which feel able to participate in implementing these accords should do so, even if they leave others to join them later. Otherwise, I fear that Rwanda may move toward an almost structural confrontation between the ethnic groups. [Braeckman] You have issued warnings and threatened to suspend cooperation. Have you been heard? [Claes] My comments have not been followed by results, that is the least you can say: While I was in the country a political leader was assassinated, and I know that a lot of arms are held by the civilian population. I see no other solution than the implementation of the Arusha accords, even if a great deal will remain to be done after that. The two armies must be merged, a large part of those bearing arms must be demobilized, and an emergency plan must be drawn up for the economy. This too will require funding. [Braeckman] How do you view the recent events in Burundi, and more massacres in Bujumbura? [Claes] It is clear that the Army does not accept the power- sharing formula which emerged after the election of President Ndadaye and which was reproduced when his successor was appointed. [Braeckman] Following the putsch there were calls for Belgian military intervention in order to avert further clashes, were there not? [Claes] That is true. We were asked to send 2,000 soldiers, but it was clear the Army did not agree. There was a risk of violent confrontation. It was subsequently decided to send in a stabilization force consisting of troops designated by the Organization of African Unity. Belgium was ready to make a financial contribution of US$2 million to this force. But even this, the dispatch of 180 men, was not acceptable to the Army. There was then talk of sending in 65 officers responsible for health and hygiene tasks, which was by no means a stabilization force. But the Burundian Army considered that even this was humiliating. During my talks with the government it became clear that the authorities want to reorganize the Army, they want to separate off the purely military activities of the gendarmerie and create a sort of republican guard. Belgium's help was requested, but if we now decide to restore military cooperation with Burundi, I wonder what kind of welcome our experts will receive and how we can take their suggestions into account. [Braeckman] Belgium is still interested in Central Africa. But is it not one of the last remaining countries which is? [Claes] This very morning I explained to the UN secretary-general's representative for Africa that there was a danger of countries in the industrialized world becoming disheartened over Africa, of turning their backs on it, if the Africans themselves did not give minimum guarantees of stability in order to allow a fruitful return to cooperation. You know that within the European Union, Belgium and France are the only two remaining champions of the African continent. It is only the Maghreb on the one hand and South Africa on the other which are still considered to be of interest. I must also point out that 85 percent of the Belgian cooperation budget is still destined for Africa. This cooperation must not become impossible. [Braeckman] Turning now to Zaire, does the Western troika still exist? [Claes] Together with Paris and Washington, we will accept the result of the current parliamentary sessions. We obviously recognize the new structure (HCR-PT, High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament), as it is the result of accords negotiated by the Zairians themselves. Negotiated, but not yet signed. Together with our partners, we support any prime minister drawn from this new Zairian Parliament: For us, it is not a question of individuals, but of principle. The HCR-PT is for us the new source of legality in Zaire. But I repeat that solid guarantees will be required before any further international aid is available.
