At the meeting, they argued over remarks made on 9 April by Masayoshi Takemura, Sakigake [Harbinger Party] representative and chief cabinet secretary, and by Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] Chairman Keigo Ouchi that the debate on selecting a successor to Prime Minister Hosokawa should be shifted from the current representative meeting to summit meetings of the coalition parties. Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and chairman of the representative meeting, stated: Now that a few coalition leaders have stated so, there is no point in continuing discussions at the representative meeting. Leaders of the coalition parties need to put their views in order regarding what has to be done at the representative meeting of the ruling coalition. In this way, it has been decided that the leaders of the coalition parties will coordinate their views on an appropriate venue for discussing a possible successor to Prime Minister Hosokawa. Following their coordination, the meeting of coalition party representatives will be held again at 1500 [0600 GMT]. Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura's proposal for holding a ruling party summit meeting is believed to be based on concern that if the issue of choosing a successor to Prime Minister Hosokawa is discussed at the coalition representative meeting, at which Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa attend, both Shinseito and Komeito may take the initiative in choosing the successor. Because discussion over a possible successor to Prime Minister Hosokawa is entangled with a struggle for leadership among the coalition parties, it will still take time to coordinate views on the issue.
