Peoples' fears of "what is going to happen with us Slovaks" are justified, the author of the commentary and the paper's editor-in-chief Jan Smolec writes. Politicians who did not move a finger for the independent Slovakia seized power, he adds. The daily outlines a pessimistic picture of Slovakia's future after the "dismissal" of the "beloved" premier. Peter Weiss, chairman of the opposition Democratic Left Party (SDL), "an heir of the communists from whom we have not heard one word of sincere declaration to the people will now influence the life of society," the paper says. It gives also the name of another "accomplice" in the conspiracy -- Chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) Jan Carnogursky who "voted against Slovakia's independence." "While the Slovak Metropolitan Archbishop Jan Sokol was praying for independence a Christian politician voted against it," says REPUBLIKA, alluding to Carnogursky. These people together with "extreme separatists" will likely to lead Slovakia back to "Czechoslovakist or other dangerous waters. But we will not surrender. The fight for Slovakia continues," Smolec concludes.
