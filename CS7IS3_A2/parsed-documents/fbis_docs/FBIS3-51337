Guillermo Albareda, secretary of the Gold Committee of the National Mining Society (Sociedad Nacional de Mineria, SNM), has said that whereas Peru produced 18 tons of gold during 1992, it produced 28 tons during 1993. He added that 70 percent of the gold was obtained by new or expanded companies. Among the major investments he has cited were the Yanacocha Mine in Cajamarca Department, which the U.S. company Newmont Mining has been exploiting since last year, with an initial investment of $50 million. He has also attributed the growth in this sector to expansion and modernization in the Retamas and La Poderosa Mines. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2042 GMT 12 Jan 94)
