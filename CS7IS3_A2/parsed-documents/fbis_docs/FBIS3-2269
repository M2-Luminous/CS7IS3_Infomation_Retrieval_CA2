When answering NHK reporter's question on his impressions and achievements of the trip, Zhu Rongji reiterated his gratitude for the Japanese Government's extremely kind invitation and considerate arrangements and the warm welcome extended by the Japanese people from various sectors. He said: "During my visit, I have met with His Majesty, the Emperor. I have held very cordial talks with Prime Minister Hosokawa, Deputy Prime Minister Hata, and people from the government and nongovernmental sectors. I would like to point out particularly that I have made extensive contacts and in-depth exchanges with people from the Japanese economic sector. I have held talks with 260 key leaders of Japan's large enterprise groups, large companies, and major banks. More than 1,400 entrepreneurs and industrialists have personally attended my talks and speeches." Zhu Rongji stressed: After conducting the above activities, I have formed two distinct impressions: First, Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation have enjoyed immense popular support and have become a trend sweeping across Japan. I firmly believe that this kind of thinking will not change, no matter how the Japanese political situation develops and what happens in the rest of the world. Second, Japanese entrepreneurs and industrialists are very keen to strengthen Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Through my visit, the Japanese economic sectors have improved their understanding of China's rapid economic progress; have clarified some of their doubts on China's economic reform; and have confirmed their confidence to expand Sino-Japanese economic, trade, and technical cooperation. Commenting on the prospects of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, Zhu Rongji said: China and Japan can be very complementary economically. Both sides can make up each other's deficiencies. Various elements, including favorable opportunities, close geographical locations, support of the people, and other political, economic, and cultural factors, are conducive for Sino- Japanese economic cooperation to develop further. In 1993, China and Japan created three "firsts" in their bilateral economic and trade relations. First, Sino-Japanese trading value reached a record high of $39 billion. Japan has become China's largest trading partner, whereas China has become, for the first time, Japan's second largest trading partner. Second, imports of Japan's technology has become the largest item, or 28 percent, of China's total technology imports. Third, Japanese entrepreneurs were on the top of the list of foreign investors who fulfilled their investment-funds commitments in China. We are satisfied that Sino-Japanese economic and trade relations have been developing rapidly. Such progress is not only beneficial to China, but also to Japan's economic recovery. The figure of $39 billion is not big. When we consider the potential of Sino-Japanese bilateral cooperation, it is a very small figure. Our prospects are encouraging. Japan's principal way of transferring technology to China is by forming joint ventures that produce goods under jointly funded and operated formats. Such arrangement will only increase Japanese products' competitiveness in foreign markets. By cooperating to develop world markets, China and Japan are cooperating and mutually benefiting partners on an equal footing. They are not competing adversaries. When asked to comment on Japan's economic recession, Zhu Rongji said: Economic recession is not merely a problem in Japan, but also in the West as a whole. To combat its current economic problems, the most important steps the Japanese Government should take are, in addition to such traditional ways as taking interventionist measures and stimulating demands, to restructure its industry to make its product more competitive and to explore overseas markets. The most effective way is to strengthen its cooperation with Asia -- China especially -- a region in which economic development is the most vital and fastest in the world today. The past two years have proven that the development of such economic cooperation has been very favorable for Japan's economic recovery. Speaking on Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's forthcoming visit to China, Zhu Rongji said: The Chinese Government and people attach great importance to Prime Minister Hosokawa's visit. This will be an important event in the development of Sino-Japanese relations this year. President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng are looking forward to having fruitful talks with Prime Minister Hosokawa. His visit certainly will push the two countries' good neighborly, reciprocal, and cooperative relations to a new level. In response to a question about the issue of the MFN status between China and the United States and the prospects for Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations, Zhu Rongji said: This is an issue which is heatedly debated every year. The MFN status is the foundation of normal Sino-U.S. trade. Both countries will suffer if this foundation is shaken. In fact, it is the United States, not China, that will suffer the most. We hope this issue can be resolved once and for all. There are two different views toward this issue in the United States. Some people think that the MFN status should be linked to the "human rights" issue, but others think that these are two totally different issues that should not be linked together. More and more Americans now support the latter view. I hope reason will prevail. Zhu Rongji pointed out: The development of Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations over the last two years has been fast and many large American enterprises have invested in China. In fact, U.S. investment in China has now exceeded that of Japan. The prospects for Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations are bright. Commenting on inflation in China, Zhu Rongji said: Some inflation is unavoidable in development countries. The index of China's commodity price increase was always kept under 6 percent during the 1990-92 period. Last year's 13-percent increase was a bit too high. The causes of the price increase are price reform and the decontrolling of prices for grain and certain capital goods, as well as excessive investments. However, price reform is essential for building a market economy. But I believe that this year's price increase rate will be kept under 10 percent, and it will be kept to about 6 percent next year, when the price reform will be basically accomplished. Zhu Rongji pointed out: We have taken several steps to bring inflation under control. First, we have taken strict measures to control investments and capital construction projects from becoming too excessive. Good things need not be accomplished in one day. To this end, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have decided to strictly control the money supply by adopting a stringent monetary policy. Second, we have strictly controlled expenditures by adopting a stringent financial policy. We have changed our previous practice of making up deficits by issuing more paper money with the practice of floating treasury bonds. The quantity of treasury bonds we will float this year will account for approximately the same proportion in our budget as the quantity of national debts Japan will issue this year. I believe we can balance our financial receipts and payments this year. Third, we have attached great importance to supporting agricultural development and the "food basket project." The Chinese consumer goods market has more supply than demand today, and agriculture is what we must attend to today. As long as we are able to ensure the success of grain output and the "food basket project," commodity prices will not be a big problem. Answering a question about China's regional differences and differences in people's incomes, Zhu Rongji said: In China's rapidly developing economy, the economic development in coastal areas is faster than that in interior China, the increase of incomes of people in cities is faster than that of people in rural areas, and the increase of incomes of people of certain strata is faster than that of government functionaries. We are attending to these problems, which have also occurred in many developing countries. Zhu Rongji stressed: While coastal area development certainly is faster because of its good conditions, the economic development in interior China has also been significant in recent years. To reduce the differences between coastal and interior areas, the most important requirement is to develop communications and transportation. The economic development in interior China, which has rich natural resources, will be significantly expedited as long as transportation problems have been resolved. This being the case, the Chinese Government has been giving central and western parts preferential treatment in terms of investments needed for the development of their communications, energy resources, and raw and semifinished materials. Of all those projects we have presented to the Japanese Government to consider for granting the fourth yen loan, projects to be carried out in central and western China account for 70 percent. Zhu Rongji said: As for the difference in individual incomes, this is because of our policies which link individual incomes with economic returns, which give more to those who work more, which allow some people to become affluent first, and which oppose egalitarianism. The fundamental way to deal with unfair distribution in society is to expedite economic development so that the country will have a greater capacity for improving the living standards of its people. We will also regulate distribution by reforming the tax system, and will gradually improve the social security system to ensure social stability.
