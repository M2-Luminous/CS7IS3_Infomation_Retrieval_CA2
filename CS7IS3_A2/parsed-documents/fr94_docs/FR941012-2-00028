SUMMARY: The Acting Director, Information Resources Management Service, invites comments on the proposed information collection request as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. DATES: An emergency review has been requested in accordance with the Act, since allowing for the normal review period would adversely affect the public interest. Approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has been requested by October 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Attention: Dan Chenok, Desk Officer: Department of Education, Office of Management and Budget, 726 Jackson Place, NW., Room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. Requests for copies of the proposed information collection request should be addressed to Patrick J. Sherrill, Department of Education, 7th & D Streets SW., Room 5624, Regional Office Building 3, Washington, DC 20202&hyph;4651. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patrick J.

Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 3517 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 3517) requires that the Director of OMB provide interested Federal agencies and persons an early opportunity to comment on information collection requests. OMB may amend or waive the requirement for public consultation to the extent that public participation in the approval process would defeat the purpose of the information collection, violate State of Federal law, or substantially interfere with any agency's ability to perform its statutory obligations. The Acting Director, Office of Information Resources Management, publishes this notice with attached proposed information collection requests prior to submission to OMB. For each proposed information collection request, grouped by office, this notice contains the following information: (1) Type of review requested, e.g., new, revision, extension, existing, or reinstatement; (2) Title; (3) Frequency of collection; (4) The affected public; (5) Reporting and/or Recordkeeping burden; and (6) Abstract. Because an emergency review is requested, the additional information to be requested in this collection is included in the section on ``Additional Information'' in this notice. Dated: October 4, 1994. Ingrid Kolb, Acting Director, Information Resources Management Service. Office of Postsecondary Education Type of Review: EMERGENCY Title: Application for Designation as an Eligible Institution Under Title III Abstract: Institutions of Higher Education will submit this form in order to be designated as eligible to compete for grants under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, Title III, Parts A and C. Additional Information: The U.S. Department of Education has requested an emergency review and approval from the Office of Management and Budget. The Department's requested approval date is October 19, 1994. If the deadline date for transmittal of applications for Title III eligibility designation is delayed, the Department will not be able to notify institutions of their eligibility status before mid-April, 1995. Such a delay in the Title III eligibility designation will delay in the competitions for new awards under Title III Part A Strengthening Institutions Program and Part C Endowment Challenge Grant Program, and the newly authorized Hispanic-serving Institutions Program. Ultimately, further delay in the processing of this collection submission will result in severe time constraints for these FY 1995 new grant awards, with the danger that the FY 1995 funds will remain unexpended at the end of the fiscal year. Frequency: Annually Affected Public: Non-profit institutions Reporting Burden: Responses: 1,200 Burden Hours: 9,600 Recordkeeping Burden: Recordkeepers: 0 Burden Hours: 0.
