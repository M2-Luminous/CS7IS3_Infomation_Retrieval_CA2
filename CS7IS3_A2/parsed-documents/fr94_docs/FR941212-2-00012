Take notice that on November 30, 1994, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural), 701 East 22nd Street, Lombard, Illinois, 60148, filed to amend its application in Docket No. CP93&hyph;672&hyph;000 for permission authorizing the abandonment of facilities constructed in the 1930's and 1960's, and partial replacement of these facilities, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Natural requested authorization in Docket No. CP93&hyph;672&hyph;000 for the abandonment of approximately 490 miles of the original 24 ’ ’ Amarillo No. 1 mainline and one 12,000 HP engine at intermediate Compressor Station 195 located in Washington County, Kansas. Natural also requested the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity authorizing it to construct and operate: (1) Approximately 9.41 miles of 30 ’ ’ loop and three separate segments of 36 ’ ’ loop totaling approximately 18.66 miles in Hutchinson County, Texas; Ford County, Kansas; Lincoln County, Kansas; and Otoe County, Nebraska, respectively, at an aggregate estimated cost of $19,020,000; and, (2) one 14,500 HP compressor engine, by means of retrofitting one existing 12,000 HP engine to 14,500 HP, at Compressor Station 195 located in Washington County, Kansas, at an estimated cost of $5,925,000. Natural indicated that the abandonment and construction project was proposed to increase the reliability of Natural's services and reduce operating costs by eliminating or replacing parts of the system that are obsolete and require high operation and maintenance costs. In Docket No. CP93&hyph;672&hyph;001 Natural proposes to amend its application in Docket No. CP93&hyph;672&hyph;000 to eliminate from that docket the proposed abandonment and construction activity south of its Hooker Lateral in Beaver County, Oklahoma. Natural states that it is now requesting authorization to abandon approximately 308 miles of its 24-inch diameter Amarillo No. 1 line and one compressor engine at its Compressor Station 195 located in Washington County, Kansas. According to Natural's application to amend, it is also requesting authorization to construct and operate approximately 9.46 miles of 36-inch diameter pipeline in Otoe County, Nebraska and one 14,500 horsepower compressor engine, by means of retrofitting an existing engine, at its Compressor Station 195. Natural estimates the total cost of the new construction to be approximately $12,828,000. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before December 27, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate and permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Natural to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
