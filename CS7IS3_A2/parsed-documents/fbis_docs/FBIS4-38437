He told a press conference on Tuesday that a system which is going to cut short the export of capital was introduced only this year. It will monitor all import and export operations. The chairman of the central bank denied press reports that he objected to the six economic decrees signed by the president of late. He said they would help create a favourable climate for reforms, although certain changes in legislation would be necessary for that. Gerashchenko added that the president is expected to sign a decree lifting certain limitations on the activities of foreign banks in Russia.
