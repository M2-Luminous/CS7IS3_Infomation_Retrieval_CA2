One of the Purposes of Deng's Trip to the South Is Therapy and Convalescence in the Winter Season Will Deng Xiaoping survive 1994? Once Deng is gone, will China plunge into great chaos? Long ago, somebody predicted that Deng would not survive 1993. Rumors that Deng Xiaoping had fallen ill began to circulate again at the end of 1993. I made a thorough investigation and provided CHENG MING's readers with the most up-to-date information: Deng took a special southbound train in Beijing on the evening of 9 December 1993. He arrived in Wuxi's Tai Hu on 11 December and went to stay in No. 2 Villa. The result of the follow-up investigation shows that Deng Xiaoping has survived 1993 safe and sound, mortifying some prophets. The newsletter of the CPC Central Committee General Office dated 13 December 1993 reported part of Deng's itinerary: On the evening of 9 December, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, accompanied by the comrades in charge of the CPC Central Committee General Office, took a special train and went on a southward trip. On the way, he had cordial conversations with the persons in charge of local authorities in some provinces. Comrade Deng Xiaoping and some other old comrades will have a brief rest in Wuxi and later move on to Shanghai. Comrades Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, Ding Guangen, Wen Jiabao, and Zhang Wannian saw them off at the railway station. This "official report" agreed with the report in "Notes on a Northern Journey." As revealed by an informed source, one of the purposes of Deng Xiaoping's southern trip was to have a second round of therapy and convalescence after the Lao Shan holiday last April, this time in winter. The main objective was to improve his body functions and treat rheumatism. He arrived in Shanghai on 23 December and stayed at the lakeside of Dianshan Hu. Deng Has Been Seeing Military VIPs the Most Since He Retired From the Political Foreground On 3 January, Deng Xiaoping met with and entertained military leaders at the lakeside of Dianshan Hu. The 5 January newsletter of the CPC Central Committee General Office said: In Shanghai, Comrade Deng Xiaoping met with persons in charge of the Central Military Commission and all services, arms, and military regions and gave a dinner for them. After the dinner, he had a cordial conversation with them. In recent years, that is, since Deng retired from the political foreground, he has been seeing top military personnel the most. This is because Deng has a very firm concept that the military not only produces political power, but also protects political power; and that especially after he has passed away the military will have to be relied on to consolidate and preserve the leadership group with Jiang as the core and other undertakings he will leave behind. For fear that wavering, splitting, breakups, and rebellion may occur within the Army once the situation changes, besides setting up a group loyal to his cause and ideology to succeed him, he also considers reinforcing the Army's loyalty to the CPC Central Committee and the core of the party as the second most important matter. An inside story reveals that at the 3 January meeting, Deng Xiaoping made an emphatic speech on the question of whether or not China will suffer disturbances after the old generation of leaders is gone. What concerns people most is this question: "Once Deng dies, will China plunge into great chaos?" Now Deng Xiaoping is answering his own question. "It Is Possible That Partial Disturbances May Happen" According to the minutes of the National Defense University party committee meeting at which Zhao Nanqi relayed Deng's remarks, the content of Deng's speech, disjointedly delivered, is as follows. There is one question that other countries, including those friendly to our country, have been concerned with for nearly 10 years. The question is whether or not China will plunge into chaos when our generation is gone, when I am also gone. Of course there are some countries hoping China will have great chaos, such as a civil war. Foreign hostile forces also hope that China will have great chaos. Also, the hostile elements within and outside China wish great chaos on China, the more chaotic the better. I would like to tell these countries to stop being idealistic and dreaming about it. As long as the party's and the state's line and principles are correct; their policies conform to the interests of the broad masses; the party and government leadership groups have rallying power and enjoy public support; and the party and the people maintain close ties and the people rally around the party center, then China will not have drastic changes or big disturbances. However, it is possible that some inappropriate policy may cause partial disturbances, but we can redress it in time. It is also possible that some people may try to make trouble in China with support from foreign countries and hostile forces. If that happens, it should be handled in good time without procrastination. Foreign countries and hostile forces have never stopped trying to make trouble in China. We should not expect hostile political forces to restrain themselves and let us carry on with our four modernizations peacefully. It is correct for the leadership group of our Army to have such an awareness. This is in keeping with the objective situation. Why are hegemonists and the anti-China and anticommunist forces hostile to, and afraid of, the People's Liberation Army [PLA]? Why are foreign hostile forces and domestic hostile elements afraid of, and why do they attack, the PLA? Because the interests of our Army completely coincide with the interests of the party, the people, and the state. Our Army is the people's Army led by the party. Deng Mentions Two Possible Causes of Turmoil Though many people in and outside China are certain that there must be great chaos or even a civil war after Deng Xiaoping dies, Deng himself has "prevailed over all dissenting views." As to whether or not he is logical or convincing enough to wipe out people's misgivings, people have to think it over and make their own judgments. However, while ruling out the possibility of great chaos, he did not rule out the possibility of minor turmoil. In the two possibilities mentioned above, the first obviously refers to the type of "turmoil" in the 1989 pro-democracy movement. To tackle such "turmoil," Deng did not mention deploying the Army or tanks, but made this light remark: "But we can redress it in time." Does this mean he has drawn a lesson from the 4 June massacre, or does it mean he sees armed suppression as something that naturally has to be done? The first possibility and the second possibility are the two sides of one coin: Though turmoil is caused by inappropriate policies, there is also interference from outside. Deng believes this should be handled in good time. Does this remark smell of any gunpowder? Was the bloody suppression in the 4 June incident a case of "timely handling?" If not, does "timely handling" mean solving "disturbances" or "trouble" before they happen through peaceful means? Deng Is Laden With Anxieties About the Stability of the Army Deng Xiaoping often stresses that the pace of the economic reform, which is actually a semi-reform, should be quickened, but discourages fast reform of the Army structure. He told the military VIPs that though the pace of the military structural reform is a bit slow, it is quite stable and this is the right thing to do. Deng said: The Army is always a unique organization which cannot afford to have turmoil or ups and downs. The cadre contingent of the Army, mainly the leading bodies and leadership groups at or above the regiment level, should be streamlined. Some comrades have suggested that we wait until the issue is more thoroughly deliberated and the thinking at different levels is more aligned, so that problems are easier to solve. I agree with Huaqing and the General Staff Headquarters. The purpose of the reform is to greatly improve the quality of the Army, raise efficiency, improve the knowledge of science and technology and culture, and enhance fighting capabilities. The reform is now under way in the Air Force, some of the group armies, and the East China Sea Fleet. It is making smooth progress, but we should keep watch on the changing circumstances. This remark by Deng Xiaoping indicates that contrary to his lightheartedness toward the "partial disturbances" outside the Army, he is laden with anxieties about whether or not the Army can maintain long-term stability. Therefore, while not demanding a quickened pace of Army reform, he is worried that problems may emerge in some units where the reform is going on and "making smooth progress." "The Problems in the Army Are Rather Outstanding" Deng Xiaoping also said: It is correct for us to practice omnidimensional reform and socialist market economy, but we should be soberly aware that some decadent things from capitalism have infiltrated our Army. The problems in the Army are rather outstanding, though there has been a turn for the better lately. The crux of the issue is that the Army must strengthen party building, which will in turn contribute to the Army building. The Army should have its own characteristics and should consistently adhere to "four qualities (lofty ideals, moral integrity, education, and physical strength), three emphases (appearance and bearing, courtesy, and a sense of discipline), and two undauntednesses (undaunted by difficulties and hardships and undaunted by the need to sacrifice one's life)." It was correct of the Central Military Commission to criticize some Army cadres for being preoccupied with their personal benefits, sulking, and affecting morale. The problem is that we should get our thinking straightened out, truly straightened out. This will make the job easier and more effective. Those two remarks by Deng Xiaoping indicate that the CPC's Army is not a great wall of steel. There are many old and new problems in the Army that must be solved through reform. But reform will aggravate instability. Furthermore, the Army's trust in the party, the party center, and the party leaders has been shaken and it is very unhappy about the party's corruption and all kinds of problems caused by corruption. In this way, the Army's rallying power and fighting capabilities are bound to decline. Even Army cadres are "preoccupied with their personal benefits, sulking, and affecting morale." Deng demanded "straightening out the thinking" in the Army. But how can it be done? The 2d Artillery Corps, the Commission for Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense [CSTIND], and the Military Regions Demand More Expenditure According to military sources, in the middle of December 1993, the 2d Artillery Corps, the CSTIND, and the military regions demanded more military expenditure and operating funds. The 2d Artillery Corps asked for a 150 percent increase, the CSTIND asked for an increase of 800 million yuan for scientific research and production (the Central Military Commission having granted 420 million yuan), and institutions of higher military education demanded increases in operating funds of more than 100 percent (the Central Military Commission having granted 30 to 60 percent increases). At the National Defense Ministry's committee meeting in January, Chi Haotian announced that the State Council and the Central Military Commission had, after examination and deliberation, granted a 12.5 percent increase (with the inflation rate deducted) in the military and national defense funds for 1994. The budget for 1995 is set at a 15.8 percent increase over 1993, while the military is asking for a 35 percent increase. Can Deng properly solve all these practical problems in the Army? Deng Feels Anxious About the Destiny of the Country After His Death Deng Xiaoping has survived 1993. Many people hope he can survive 1994. But he can see that the end of his life is not far off. He keeps persuading the top-echelon military leaders, pacifying them, asking them not to be pessimistic about the situation after his death, and asking them to stabilize the general sentiment in the Army and raise the morale of the troops. All this shows that this old man is still very anxious about the destiny of the country after his death. This is what is tragic about this chief architect of the "quarter-reform."
