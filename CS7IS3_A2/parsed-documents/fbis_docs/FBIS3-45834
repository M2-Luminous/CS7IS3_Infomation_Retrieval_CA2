One of China's major agricultural centers, Anhui reported a record output of grain, edible oil, meat, eggs and milk last year, and an increase in farmers' incomes. A provincial official in charge of agriculture said farmers expanded the acreage under quality rice to 666,700 ha last year, up 200,000 ha over the previous year, while introducing improved cotton and noted tea varieties. As a result, they turned out five million kg of tea last year, worth 130 million yuan. Last year also saw Anhui produce 260 million kg of cotton, 15.66 million kg of oil-bearing seeds (up 12 percent over the previous year) and 1.61 million kg of silkworm cocoons (up 13.3 percent). Now urban residents have more choices of vegetables grown and sold by local farmers who pay close attention to the market needs. Anhui produced 1.37 million tons of meat last year, an increase of 6.4 percent over the previous year, 370,000 tons of eggs, up 2.2 percent, and 340,000 tons of aquatic products, up 11.86 percent. Following the development of rural industries over the past two years, farmers' incomes last year reached 670 yuan per capita, up 100 yuan over 1992.
