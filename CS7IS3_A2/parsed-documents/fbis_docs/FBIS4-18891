Hammad told the Italian news agency ANSA that these rumors "do not favor the peace process and the presence of observers in Hebron" on talk picked up by the press according to which Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasir 'Arafat was preparing to ask Spain to send observers in Italy's place because of political uncertainties in Rome. This version of events originated Wednesday [6 April] in Cairo where consultations had been started up on the Hebron force of 160 lightly-armed Norwegian, Danish and Italian observers. The head of the PLO office here said that Italy is well-liked by Palestinians because over the years, since 1975, this nation has extended its good offices to allow Israelis and Palestinians to meet. "Unlike other countries, Italy never made propaganda out of its activities within the peace process (and) in effect, provided great help. ``Since the beginning, since 1975, Italy has hosted many secret meetings between Palestinians and Israelis. Various ministers, in the present government as well, like Peres' deputy, Yossi Beilin, have had their first contacts with PLO officials in Rome or Milan,'' said Hammad with reference to Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. The PLO delegate also said that Italy contributes substantial financing for the Israeli-occupied territories and for assistance for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and spoke of what he said was the "virginity" or pristine nature of Italian cooperation in Palestine where "everything is regular and everything goes well." These factors, he added, have created a climate of "affection" for Italians. "In the territories, just say you are Italian and you immediately feel the warmth of the people. Like in Lebanon, moreover, where the Italian presence is highly appreciated, you feel that the people's reaction to Italians is positive." On the international force to send to Hebron, Hammad said discussions were under way on expanding the number and that it is not now possible to name a date for the deployment of these observers because there are numerous problems still open between the PLO and Israel. One of these problems is the presence of Jewish settlers. "Their presence, with the ongoing presence of the Israeli Army, would cause great tension, making the work of the observers difficult," he added. Last night, it was learned here that members of the three-nation observer force to oversee peace in Hebron may visit that city next week to lay the groundwork for their mission there. The three working groups set up to prepare the mission, which will involve 35 Italian, 35 Danish and 90 Norwegian observers, were scheduled to gather separately today in Rome, Tel Aviv and Cairo. They will then get together next week for a reconnaissance trip to Hebron, sources said. The observers force, dubbed Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH), was requested by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation March 31, after the Hebron mosque massacre carried out by a Jewish extremist February 25. It will mark the first time that armed foreign observers have been allowed into the Israeli-occupied territories.
