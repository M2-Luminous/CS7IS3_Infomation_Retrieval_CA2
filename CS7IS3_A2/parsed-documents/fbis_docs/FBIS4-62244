Thus, according to Yaroslav Kendzyor, the first bloc -- purely communist -- comprises 138 deputies. The second one, "left center," which was named by him, is composed of deputies from the so-called "party of power," as well as deputies from the Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine and the Labor Party, and it comprises 72 legislators. The right center comprises 53 deputies from Rukh and the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists. Only five people's deputies comprise the right wing. These are representative of the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party and the Ukrainian National Self-Defense. Yaroslav Kendzyor believes that if the left and right wings of the center unite, they will have the same number of deputies as the communist bloc. Therefore, a battle for so-called independent deputies will be waged in parliament. Commenting on the presidential elections, Yaroslav Kendzyor said that "the candidacy of Leonid Kuchma is the most dangerous." Moreover, Yaroslav Kendzyor confidently told journalists that "there have been reports that Kuchma will be supported in the elections by certain political and business circles in the United States." He also called on all Ukrainian patriots to vote for a candidate who will be able to strip Kuchma of as many votes as possible.
