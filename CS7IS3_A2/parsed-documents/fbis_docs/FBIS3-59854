According to reports, 30 organizations have agreed to go in this direction. The group will of course include the Lebanese Hizballah Party. It will also include delegates from the Sudanese organization headed by Hasan al-Turabi, several branches of what is called "the Islamic Jihad," in addition to representatives from Hamas. It is not yet known whether rejectionists like the Ahmad Jibril group and Abu Nidal group will also join the movement. A number of struggle "professionals" from various Western countries will also be present. They come under the fundamentalist group known as the "East Wimbledon." They are individuals fashioned along the lines of the star of a new English play. The star is an unemployed man, who, after having fallen on hard times for a long time because of the economic recession, hits on the idea of getting himself circumcised and joining the active fundamentalist groups in Wimbledon. During this month we will see in Tehran a group of people who would tell us that 'Arafat is a "traitor of Islam" and that the Palestinian problem is so important and vital that it should not be left in the hands of the Palestinians, for there are people there who are more Catholic than the Pope. We became somewhat familiar with the tone that will prevail at the demonstration in Tehran through the official media and sermons of clerics who usually reflect the government views. Many political Middle Eastern cliches are in circulation, such as treason, conspiracy, surrender, impostors, imperialist agents, backstabbing, demonic plan, and blood-shedding and so on. Fiery and angry speeches are used in order to prevent any serious discussion of the deal, since those attending the conference did not tell the public what the pros and cons of the deal are in their view. A method such as this will encourage the use of man's ability at criticism. This is a very serious matter for the demagogues, because once people start using their brains, then they will quickly discover the deceit of the "rejectionists" of all types. It is not difficult to compile militant slogans, particularly for those who are not directly affected by the Palestinian tragedy. Also, it is not difficult for Tehran to sign a few documents for its political agents here and there. Also it is not difficult to plant a few bombs and fire a few Katyushas. It is also very easy to claim heroism at the expense of others, and for one to become a revolutionary struggler from a distance and let the others fall martyrs so that tears will be shed for them. What's difficult is to produce alternative, harmonious, and cohesive policies. It is for this reason in particular that the various "rejectionist fronts," which were established in the past five decades, have failed, bearing in mind that at a certain time Yasir 'Arafat was a member of some of them. The question now is: Can the "Gaza and Jericho first" option be a good beginning to realize the Palestinian people's legitimate aspirations? The answer in my view is no. I am convinced after having closely followed the peace process during the past two years that the Palestinians could have obtained a better agreement. But I have no right, nor does any foreign party, to try to undermine the agreement. The final decision is up to the Palestinian people and their leadership. If this agreement has any positive aspects, one of them is that for the first time since the mid-forties the Palestinians have taken an initiative on their own behalf. In other words, the Palestinian people have cut the umbilical cord that linked them to the so-called "Arab World," which often exploited their problems in order to serve its own interests. Therefore, what is required from the groups meeting in Tehran is to ask themselves a simple question: How far are they prepared to go in order to blow up an agreement they consider bad? Discussion and debate are useful and not harmful. The Palestinian parties opposing the agreement have every right to remove 'Arafat by political means and propose an alternative strategy for peace and justice. But what is not permissible is to sow the seeds of a civil war in the name of defending the Palestinian problem. For we all have seen the grave consequences of this kind of foreign intervention in many parts of the world. The massacres being committed in Afghanistan are committed by Afghan hands. But foreign forces serving their own interest are the manipulators behind the scenes. The emergence of Tehran as leader of a new opposition front will cause harm rather than good. Iran has absolutely no national interest in attempting to blow up an Arab-Israeli settlement. Also it is not in its interest to appear in the Arab world as a leader of an organization whose strategy is based on violence and on suspect ideologies. Iran is a major and regional power and, therefore, has to behave accordingly. It is not a desert and isolated country like Libya so that it would become a laboratory for analyzing the crazy ideas of some people. Finally, it is said that the most serious mistake in politics is for a politician to do something that he does not need to do. This applies to Iran, since nothing is compelling it to embrace politicians like al-Turabi and Jibril and the fundamentalists of "East Wimbledon."
