FBIS3-11077 "drlat052_r_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-052 Document Type:Daily Report 17 Mar 1994 Peru Drug Kingpin Vaticano's Family Network Described 94SM0253A Lima SI in Spanish 7-13 Feb 94 pp 30-32, 47 94SM0253A Lima SI Language: Spanish Article Type:CSO [Unattributed article: "Vaticano's Network"] [Excerpts] In the purist Cali Cartel style, the web of the relationships of the organization headed by Vaticano covers every flank--financial, police, military, terrorist, judicial, and operational. A comparison of information from various sources has made it possible to determine the table of organization that is detailed on these pages. It is very striking to see the levels of closeness since apparently even the agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) have been the subject of intelligence leaks pertaining precisely to the control operations carried out in Huallaga. One of the brothers of Vaticano (so-called because he is the head of all of the "churches," or firms), namely Elias Chavez Penaherrera (aka Lan Chile), was the man in charge of the "payments" made to the military. This was because his work--the coordination of the receipt and dispatch of drugs by air--could only be carried out in this way. One of these payments may have been the gray automobile delivered to a general whose involvement in this relationship has been proven,, according to reliable information. Elias, who was formerly in charge of logistics in Campanilla, is now reported to have replaced his brother and to be in Cali. [passage omitted] "I Know Nothing" The statement "I am his brother, but I know nothing," which was made by Manuel, the brother of Reynaldo Rodriguez Lopez, at the time of his arrest, has become famous. Vaticano has said the following about his brothers: "...Humberto lives in Campanilla, and he devotes his time to livestock breeding and music. He has a group called "La Banda del Caribe" (The Caribbean Band). Emilio lives in Campanilla, and is engaged in farming and livestock breeding. Berzabeth lives in Campanilla. She devotes herself to her housekeeping, and is married to a former policeman, Silverio Cardenas. Bertha lives in Lima and works in a grocery. Elias lives in Campanilla, but I do not know what he does." Where the others are concerned, he says that he has not seen them in a long time. His sister Bertha, for her part, also said in her statement to the police that "I have not seen my brother for more than 10 years now." But her relationships were business ones, even more than family ones. Bertha (La Calena) was the general director of the organization, and she was apparently in charge of the process of laundering the money. The operations of "LR y Asociados" (LR and Associates) are being traced in an effort to prove this. This business, which was established in March of 1992 by Mrs. Lucila Emetria Rivera de la Cruz, a housewife (55,100 shares), and her daughter, Claudia Luna Victoria Rivera, a student (2,900 shares), was engaged in the construction of commercial centers in Lima. Vaticano has said that in May of 1991, he sold a plot of land measuring 1,100 square meters that he had purchased in Block 51 of the Benavides Extension, Surco, "to a woman whose name I do not remember." This woman was none other than the mother-in-law of his sister Bertha. Mrs. Lucila Emetria is the mother of Marcos Ivan Luna Victoria Rivera, Bertha's common-law husband, who also lived at Bertha's minimarket and home complex at 3373 Avenida Aviacion. Her son was sentenced this week to 12 years in prison by the First Criminal Court of Callao for illegal trafficking in drugs. "La Calena" has told the police that she never realized she was living with a drug trafficker. Figureheads Having set up their business in the commercial center they had built on the 1,100-meter plot in question, the mother and daughter hired a manager, Yuri Marcel Munoz Rivera. He too is one of Mrs. Lucila Emetria's sons, and, having been linked with Luna Victoria in this way might also have played other roles. In the first place, it has been proven that he visited "Panama," Bertha's minimarket on Avenida Aviacion. In November of last year, he traveled to Trujillo. There he is reported to have collected money (the sum of $40,000 has been mentioned), which he brought back to Lima and delivered to his sister Terlinda. She made a trip to Iquitos, presumably to pay off Judge Jaime Cardenas Fonseca, the brother of "Mosca Loca" (Crazy Fly), for the release of Bertha. It was Vaticano, who met with Terlinda in Iquitos for purposes of coordination, who gave the order for the operation. LR y Asociados SRL (LR and Associates, Ltd.) built the "Las Gardenias" commercial center on the plot of land purchased from Vaticano, and leased all of the shops. In this way, the property (land and buildings) was valued at more than $1 million. In 1992, however, LR sold the entire complex to two men for a little more than $100,000. And the land alone had cost $65,000 when they bought it from Demetrio. It is suspected that this unusual sale was made as a means of laundering the money obtained from Huallaga. A short time thereafter, the business purchased another plot of land two blocks farther along. On that plot, the company built the "53 Shopping Center," in which 79 shops have been offered for lease thus far. The sales manager chosen on this occasion was Elias Rojas Boltan. The Polvos Rosados Trade Fair Terlinda's trip to Iquitos was not the only one she would make. She traveled to Arica, Chile, in May of 1993 (Vaticano said she left Peru via Tacna-Arica). And in November of that year, she made another trip to Medellin, Colombia, where she stayed at the Hotel Capitolio. A number of telephone calls were made from her home, located in Unit A at 4660 Avenida Arequipa, in Miraflores, to Cali, Colombia. The calls were made to the "Holguines" development company, to Maria Escobar, to Jairo Frisneda Granada, and to Enrique Rocha. The trip to Medellin was nothing unusual, although it is known that this was the headquarters of Escobar's cartel, and there were sometimes dealings between the two. Proof of this is the presence of Juan Chavez Penaherrera, one of the brothers, in that city from time to time "on business." Terlinda also managed Booth 151 in Polvos Rosados. Although this seems to have happened infrequently, this trade fair also served as a meeting place for the members of the organization. It is known that Berzabeth, the other sister of Vaticano who was arrested, had some booths there. In order to understand the operational plan of the commercial "facade" completely and to establish further links, a total of 180 homes and offices throughout Lima, including those of a number of offices of aviation companies that make flights into the jungle, are being investigated.
