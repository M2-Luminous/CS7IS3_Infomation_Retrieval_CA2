Semenov Urges Joint Exercises MK0605095094 Moscow OBSHCHAYA GAZETA in Russian No. 18/43, 6-12 May 94 (Signed to press 5 May) p 2 MK0605095094 Moscow OBSHCHAYA GAZETA Russian BFN [Interview with Colonel General Vladimir Semenov by Aleksandr Sidyachko under the "Hello!" rubric: "Peacekeepers Getting Ready for Battles"] [Text] The Russian-American peacekeeping forces exercises scheduled for July at the Totsk training ground of Orenburg Oblast are under threat of disruption. The State Duma has asked Yeltsin "to look into the question of the wisdom of the exercises," and the Foreign Ministry and the Defense Ministry has been asked to think of holding maneuvers on the territory of a NATO state. The Russian Federation president, according to his press service's report, treated with "understanding the parliamentarians' arguments" and recommended to the military to hold additional consultations with the Americans "taking account of both the postures of the Russian lawmakers and those voiced by the public in this connection." OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent Aleksandr Sidyachko called Colonel General Vladimir Semenov, commander in chief of Russia's ground forces, to ask for his comments on the situation that has taken shape around holding this operation. [Sidyachko] Vladimir Magomedovich, the top lawmakers were especially angered at the fact that the exercises are being planned on the territory of Russia. They are inclined to interpret them as a rehearsal of America's future invasion.... [Semenov] During last spring's Vancouver meeting of the presidents of Russia and the United States, an agreement was reached on joint peacekeeping actions of the two countries. Then the Americans proposed, within the framework of military cooperation, to hold a peacekeeping exercise on their territory. But we declined. It would have taken several million dollars to move the men and equipment across the ocean. We do not have the money. As for a NATO country, we proposed this option to Germany, where the U.S. 3d Infantry Division is stationed. The Germans declined. And then we made a decision to hold the exercises on the training ground of the 27th Russian Peacekeeping Division in Totsk. [Sidyachko] The majority of Duma men hold the opinion that America is to pay all the exercise expenses for Russia. And it's you pay your money, you takes your choice, you know.... [Semenov] This is not so. The Americans are to pay all the expenses involved in the participation in the exercises of the 3d Infantry Division, food, renting the airfield, the landing of planes with equipment included. As far as our 27th division is concerned, these maneuvers were included in the combat training plan as early as last year. Thus each pays only for himself. [Sidyachko] Why these exercises at all? [Semenov] I want to specially underline: they are going to be command and staff exercises. More than 250 men are to take part in them on each side. The Russian Armed Forces are to contribute the staff of the 589th Motorized Rifle Regiment of the 27th Division, the staff of the 2d Motorized Rifle Battalion and one of its companies. The U.S. Armed Forces are to contribute the staff of the 1st Brigade of the 3d Infantry Division (20 men), the staff of the 1st Battalion of the 15th Infantry Regiment (20 men), and Company "C" (101 men). The equipment includes 50 wheeled vehicles and about 20 trailers. No tanks, armored vehicles, field guns, and mortars are to be used. The objective of the exercises is to forge common approaches to the planning and conduct of peacekeeping operations, to practice the mechanism of coalition peacekeeping troop control. The Americans have vast experience in holding such operations. They will demonstrate the technique of separating feuding sides, share their experience in escorting humanitarian freight, in the performing of joint duties at checkpoints, in the provision of aid to refugees. Today the world body has recognized two types of peacekeeping actions: operations in enforcing peace (for example, NATO bombing in Bosnia and Herzegovina; they, as experience shows, are not effective -- A.S.) and peacekeeping operations where all violence toward the indigenous population is ruled out. Practicing the second option is indeed the objective of the upcoming exercises. [Sidyachko] In the wake of the Duma's statement on where it stands in regard to the exercises, how could you argue for the need to hold them? [Semenov] The United States justly believes that Russia will also in the future have its interests in many regions in the world and seek to exercise its influence on them. And here the best way out would be to look for compromise solutions rather than a standoff that will not benefit any side.
