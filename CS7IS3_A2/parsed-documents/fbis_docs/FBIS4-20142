Christian Schmidt, chairman of the foreign policy working committee of the CSU land group in the Bundestag, said at a CSU foreign policy congress in Bonn that the opening-out of the WEU, NATO, and European Union [EU] is a "question of Europe's future." There is a "unique chance" of expanding an all-European "peaceful order" right now, he said. This chance might disappear in a few years' time. Referring to Serbia and Russia, both Schmidt and CSU Land Chairman Glos pointed out that the young Central European democracies are afraid of new wars. These countries feel that the West is not taking their worries seriously. This applies not just to Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, and Hungary; but also, for instance, to Slovenia. According to the CSU land group, the Central European countries should be associated with the WEU "soon" and take part in EU foreign policy consultations. They should be able to join NATO "in the medium term." The decision about this rests with the individual countries themselves and NATO. "There is no right of confirmation whatsoever concerning countries outside NATO," he said, with reference to Russian demands on this subject. Relations between Russia, CIS, and NATO should lead to a close partnership. Glos said that the West wants to "win over" Russia as a partner, but veto rights should not be linked to Moscow's important role. "Certain internal political developments in Russia" are a cause for concern, he said. Russia's conduct in Bosnia is a "test of its credibility," according to Glos. "The hour of truth has come," he said. Schmidt said that bilateral agreements between NATO and Russia concerning strategic cooperation and joint international peacekeeping activity are possible. However, it is "unthinkable" for Russia to join NATO right now. Even so, cooperation with Russia is of "decisive importance" for the development of a European security structure. The security partnership with the Russian Federation must include a strategic and stabilizing partnership for Europe. In view of the internal political differences within Russia on the subject of NATO's "Partnership for Peace" [PfP] offer, Schmidt called upon the German Government to explain to Moscow that PfP mainly concerns the stability of peace. "Also in this respect, Europe is condemned to the success of Yeltsin and the reformers," said Schmidt. As far as the EU is concerned, the CSU insists that the Maastricht Treaty Review Conference scheduled for 1996 should encourage a consolidation of West European foreign and security policy. The EU must "involve itself more thoroughly" in Bosnia and Croatia. Schmidt said: "The danger of a conflagration in the European home cannot be offset by the use of half-strength fire doors alone."
