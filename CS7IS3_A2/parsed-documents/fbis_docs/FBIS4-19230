The cut was the smallest since April 1985 and proved insufficent to allow a decline in mortgage costs. Building societies dismissed the move as "a technical adjustment," claiming that they were unable to pass on the benefit to customers. The timing of the February interest rate cut has also proved controversial, with the Bank sending out the signal for cheaper money just two days after an upward adjustment in American interest rates. That precipitated a sharp sell-off in world bond markets with the British market suffering a particularly savage correction. As a result, the cost of long-term money has risen sharply, making it more expensive for home owners to obtain fixed-rate mortgage finance. Discrepancies in the statements put out by the Bank and the Treasury at the time of the February rate cut added to the confusion and Mr Clarke admitted yesterday that the resulting muddle had finally persuaded him to make public the minutes of his regular meetings with the Governor after a lag of six weeks. However, the Chancellor made it clear that he had not made the decision lightly. He had been influenced by the recommendation to publish contained in a report by the powerful backbench Treasury and Civil Service Committee and had "ghosted" the idea for some months. The move was also consistent with other strategies designed to make the conduct of monetary policy more transparent and less subject to political influences, including the decision to allow the Bank to publish an independent quarterly report on inflation. The Governor hoped that by giving the market the opportunity to appreciate the nuances behind interest rate decisions, speculation would be reduced rather than increased. However, he said that there would be a learning process and admitted that it might not be "a particularly comforting process." Yesterday's announcement was accompanied by the publication of minutes for the last three meetings between the Chancellor and the Governor, including the February meeting where the decision to cut base rates from 5.5 percent to 5.25 percent was taken. The February minutes reveal that Mr George would have preferred to hold rates unchanged because he feared an adverse reaction in financial markets and a loss of credibility. Mr Clarke had on the other hand expressed concern about the likely impact of higher taxes from April and argued that a rate cut in April might be "too late." Financial markets are likely to focus on the minutes for March in which the Chancellor holds out the prospect of further interest rate cuts, drawing attention to the fall in share and bond prices. He says that "it would be appropriate to consider a further reduction in interest rates if indicators subsequently suggested that activity was subdued and inflationary pressures remained under firm control."
