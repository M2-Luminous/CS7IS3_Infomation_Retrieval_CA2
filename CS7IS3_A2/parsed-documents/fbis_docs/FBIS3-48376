The reporter and participants in the discussions said that the tasks elucidated by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his New Year address of this year and at the 21st plenary session of the Sixth party Central Committee are a programmatic guideline which brilliantly illuminate the road ahead for our people accelerating the general advance of socialism of our own style and a militant banner which actively inspires the entire nation towards the accomplishment of the sacred cause of national reunification and vigorously encourages it towards the consummation of the chuche revolutionary cause. Noting that under the wise leadership of the great leader and our party, the UAWP outstandingly performed the honorable mission and duty as the reliable supporter of the party and as the thorough defender and implementer of the party's policies during the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan, the reporter and participants in the discussions referred to the successes attained in the course of vigorously carrying out the three revolutions of ideology, technology, and culture in rural areas. They stressed that the UAWP today faces the honorable task of contributing to safeguarding and defending socialism of our own style and to further enhancing its superiority by thoroughly implementing the party's revolutionary economic strategy. The reporter and participants in the discussions said UAWP organizations at all levels should set the next three years as an adjustment period for socialist economic construction and actively wage a struggle to thoroughly implement the party's agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy in this period. Saying that all UAWP members should, above all, be brought up as genuine loyalists and devoted children who bear absolute adoration and loyalty toward the great leader and the dear comrade leader, they presented concrete measures for effectively carrying out the ideological indoctrinations concerning the chuche idea theory, the greatness of the party and the leader, faithfulness, and revolutionary tradition in various forms and methods. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: This year is a significant year marking the 30th anniversary of the release of the socialist rural theses. We should wage a vigorous struggle to complete the historic task of the rural theses and mark a new turning point in rural economic development. Noting that this year is a significant year marking the 30th anniversary of the release of the socialist rural theses, the reporter and participants in the discussions said UAWP organizations should actively organize and mobilize all union members to the struggle to complete the historic task of the rural theses and to implement the party's agriculture first policy. They said the functions and roles of union organizations at all levels will be further enhanced so as to contribute to increasing grain production by consolidating the results of irrigation and electrification, achieving mechanization and scientification on a higher level, and implementing chuche-based farming method in rural areas. They stressed that, to this end, UAWP members and agricultural workers will actively carry out political propaganda and economic agitation [sontong] and strengthen various mass movements, including the socialist competition movement, so as to highly demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude with the same spirit and vigor displayed in the postwar socialist rural construction.

Mentioning the tasks recently given by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il for the working people's groups and organizations to carry out human reform works well, the reporter and participants said in the discussions that UAWP functionaries should ceaselessly expand the ranks of pioneers with laudable communist virtue in rural areas by being deeply involved with UAWP members, actively support, encourage, and develop positive deeds discovered among them, and widely introduce and publicize deeds.
