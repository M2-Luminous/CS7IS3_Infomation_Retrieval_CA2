We are not even aware if North Korean-U.S. and North Korean-International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] negotiations on the nuclear issues are being held. The recent U.S. sideshow makes the security situation on the Korean peninsula more complex. U.S. evangelist Billy Graham recently visited with President Clinton and Kim Il-song separately, conducting secret diplomacy. We do not dislike this event, however, nothing special resulted from either meeting, which fell short of our expectations. It is true, however, that the secret diplomacy made a contribution to easing the tension. We suspect that, besides a peaceful diplomatic gesture, the United States is conducting a sideshow, which is causing the people to think that this is a demonstration of military strength. The sideshow has been produced daily by the U.S. Defense Department and press. Let us cite some actual examples: The United States will deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK; the U.S. aircraft carrier, Independence, is moving toward the waters of the ROK; if a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, the ROK and U.S. Combined Forces can win in four months; if North Korea attacks the South, the United States will not be content with simply repulsing the North Korean forces, but will occupy Pyongyang and overturn Kim Il-song's regime; the United States has decided to conduct the Team Spirit exercise this year; and the United States will send more than 1,000 U.S. troops to the ROK... What is an issue is that such reports are not discussed in advance with the ROK. The people have felt somewhat uneasy because the United States have unilaterally made such remarks without full negotiations with the ROK side. The ROK Government has not actively coped with such reports. There have been many cases when it has been too late for the ROK Government to cope with such reports. Generally speaking, it seems there are two points that make the people feel uneasy about such a sideshow. One, the people are anxious over possible U.S.-ROK friction about the security of the Korean peninsula. Two, the demonstration of military strength, true or not, may incite North Korea. Of course, we can understand why the United States is conducting such a sideshow. We think that the sideshow may be a U.S. strategy to resolve North Korea's nuclear issue before 22 February when the meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors is expected to be held. The ROK feels deeply that a war should not break out again on the Korean peninsula. For this reason, the ROK cannot but be surprised at the U.S. unilateral strategy. In addition, the ROK is doubtful that the sideshow will be helpful to resolve North Korea's nuclear issue.
