In response to 20 questions posed by Sinn Fein on the Downing Street peace declaration, the Northern Ireland Office issued a statement saying the wishes of the greater number of people in Ulster would be determined in a special poll. The Government also drove home its message to the terrorists to give up violence. The statement bluntly told Sinn Fein to stop "playing for time" and that democracy and violence cannot be reconciled. The Government regards only one of the 20 questions put by Sinn Fein as involving an explanation of the text of the Joint Declaration. In the declaration, the Government had said they would "uphold the democratic wishes of a greater number of the people of Northern Ireland." Sinn Fein challenges the Government over the precise definition of this phrase and asks how it would be measured in practical terms. The Government's comment is: "The wish of a greater number of the people of Northern Ireland would be determined by a numerical majority of those validly voting in a poll fairly and explicitly organised for this purpose. "Provision for such a poll is made in Section 1 of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973." In comments on the other questions, the Government frequently refers Sinn Fein to the text of the Joint Declaration, quoting large chunks. At the end, the Government poses its own question for Sinn Fein, urging them to renounce violence in accordance with the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland. "Democracy and violence cannot be reconciled. Sinn Fein must choose. They know what they have to do if they are effectively to fulfil their democratic mandate. "The democratic path leads to a meaningful role in the political process: a process in which, as has been explained, all issues are open for discussion and negotiation. "The alternative is isolation -- standing on the outside while those committed to democracy shape the agreement, structures and institutions that will determine the relationships between the peoples of these islands." The Government says the majority of people in Ireland want an end to violence now. "Their wishes could not be clearer. There is no conceivable justification for continuing to rob people of their lives, least of all a call for a textual explanation of the Joint Declaration," the statement says. "Sinn Fein asks what comes next. Certainly no further playing for time," it warns. Sinn Fein's questions were sent to the Northern Ireland Office through the Irish Government. Final agreement on the British Government's response was reached at a Cabinet sub-committee meeting today. Elsewhere in its commentary on the questions, the Government makes clear that acceptance of the Joint Declaration is not a precondition for entering the talks process. "What is required is a permanent end to the use of, or support of, paramilitary violence," the statement says. The British Government says it "accepts the validity of all electoral mandates, including that of Sinn Fein." It runs through what would happen if Sinn Fein and the IRA renounced violence, saying exploratory talks would take place after a three-month lapse. These talks would explore the basis on which Sinn Fein would be admitted to the peace process but without anticipating the negotiations within that process. There would also be an exchange of views on how Sinn Fein would be able eventually to play the same part in the public life of Northern Ireland as current constitutional parties. The talks would examine the practical consequences of the ending of violence. The statement also makes clear: "A lasting and general peace would render military operations in support of the police no longer necessary." Sinn Fein said tonight that they would examine the answers they had received to see if they provided the clarification they required. Mitchel McLaughlin, Sinn Fein party chairman, said: "Clarity on the issues we have identified is in everyone's interest and is crucial to the development of a viable peace process. "The response from the British Government can only assist in the development of such a peace process if it provides direct, unambiguous and comprehensive answers to the 20 questions we have asked." He added: "We will therefore be examining the British response to see if it provides the clarification which we require to make a properly informed assessment of the Downing Street Declaration." Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams was today on the first of a five-day trip to Italy. Sinn Fein said it would be faxing a copy of the response to him. It was thought unlikely he would make an off-the-cuff reply before returning to Northern Ireland next week for consultations with party leaders. In its response the Government tells Sinn Fein that no organisation has a veto over the peace process "whether by withdrawing from it or by refusing to renounce violence." It adds: "An end to violence would open the way for a comprehensive reassessment of existing provisions against terrorism, many of which would become irrelevant and obsolete in a climate of peace." Sinn Fein's questions probe a wide range of issues surrounding the Joint Declaration, many of which the Government responds to merely by quoting the document's text. Only one of the 20 questions submitted to the Government by Sinn Fein was genuinely seeking clarification of the Downing Street declaration, Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew indicated tonight. He said: "The rest of them are invitations to negotiate. We are not going to negotiate. That is made very clear." Sir Patrick said on the BBC Six O'Clock News before the Government had published the questions and its commentary on them: "We are facing something of great seriousness. We are facing the continuance of violence for political purposes." He insisted that the future of Northern Ireland would be decided "by consent and democracy and not by violence or coercion."
