The detection technique is based on electrochemical methods, but the sensitivity is a thousand times greater than with conventional methods. This technique can detect slight variations in the concentration of substances present in trace amounts in body fluids, so it can aid in the diagnosis of illness, and it can also be used to study the behavior of neurotransmitters and help clarify the mechanism of information transfer. Wide-ranging applications in basic medicine and bioscience can be expected for this technology. Among the ultra-sensitive methods for detecting molecules in liquids there is the ``radiochemical-enzymatic method,'' in which a special reagent that contains a radioactive isotope and that will react with the substance of interest is allowed to bind to the substance of interest, and the concentration of the substance of interest is determined by the quantity of radioactivity. There is also the ``chemiluminescence method,'' in which a special fluorescent reagent is allowed to bind to the substance of interest, and the concentration is determined by measuring the fluorescence. There are difficulties, however, because in both cases these special reagents are difficult to handle, and the procedures are complex. In addition, the ``electrochemical method'' has also been used because it is fast and simple. The new detection technique developed by NTT is a kind of electrochemical method. The electrochemical method is one in which the concentration of a substance is determined from the current and voltage during electrolysis of a liquid containing the substance of interest. With previous electrochemical methods, however, it has been impossible to accurately detect the concentration corresponding to the value for the current when the current is very small, so these methods were not suitable for the detection of substances at extremely low concentrations. The reason for such low sensitivity is that the electron exchange between the electrode and the substance of interest is only one electron per molecule, so the resulting current is extremely small. Researchers at NTT thought that if they could solve this problem, they could make use of the simplicity and speed of the electrochemical method and at the same time create a system that would enable detection with high sensitivity. They came up with an electrochemical reaction system based on the completely new concept of using small, comb-shaped electrodes to increase the current value. With this system, one of the electrodes that carries out the electrochemical reaction with the substance of interest is shaped like a comb with narrow spaces between the teeth, and another electrode of the same shape is paired with it so the teeth interlock but do not touch. The molecules of the substance of interest accept an electron from one of the comb-shaped electrodes and donate that electron to the other comb-shaped electrode. Therefore, the molecules repeat the electron exchange (redox) reaction many times. This change in design alone has resulted in a current about 30 times greater than with conventional electrochemical methods. In addition, to obtain a larger current, the comb-shaped electrode is connected to another electrode in a separate vessel that contains metal ions. This electrode continues to receive electrons from the comb-shaped electrode, which acts as a medium for the substance of interest. Those electrons are donated to the metal ions in the separate vessel, so in the separate vessel, the ions become metal atoms and precipitate. This metal becomes a cumulative record of electrons that the substance of interest carried between the two comb-shaped electrodes. If a current is then passed in the opposite direction, a current peak about 1000 times greater than with conventional electrochemical methods can be obtained. When we know what kind of substance we are measuring, by measuring peak current we can determine the concentration. Since the current peak is amplified 1000 times, the concentration can also be measured with the same precision. The molecular detection technique developed by NTT can also measure electrochemically inert substances if there are active substances that react specifically with them. For example, it is known that patents with Parkinson's disease have reduced levels of dopamine in their brains, and NTT has confirmed that this technique can detect dopamine. In addition, because the structure of the system is simple, by incorporating LSI technology NTT hopes to make the detector compact and available at an affordable price so that it can be used in many different fields.
