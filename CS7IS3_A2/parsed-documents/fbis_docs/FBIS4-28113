The group, studying the pension, medical and other social welfare systems, said in the report that Japan should become a welfare- oriented society funded by the expansion of indirect tax. The report said that, based on an impartial taxation system, the government should provide quality welfare, realizing long-term stable pensions, enhancing the efficiency of medical services and strengthening nursing care, they said. It suggested that the government raise the consumption tax rate, currently at 3 percent, noting that taxpayers now bear too great an income tax burden and the rate of direct taxation is too high, creating unsteady tax revenues because of the close mirroring of economic fluctuations. However, the report avoided referring to the margin by which the consumption tax rate should be raised. The tax reform committee of the coalition parties will begin full-scale discussion of reform of the nation's tax system after Thursday when the results of two other study groups -- on administrative reform and the fundamentals of taxation -- are to be submitted.
