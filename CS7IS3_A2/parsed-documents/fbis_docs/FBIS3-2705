During the year, 150 km of express highways were built and more than 1,690 km of ordinary highways upgraded. Individual counties and townships, using their own initiative to pool money, built 3,346 km of roads within their own territories and asphalted 2,650 km of concrete roads. By the end of last year the total length of highways in Guangdong had reached 67,490 km, an increase of 11,600 km over 1992. As a result, the province has 37.8 km of highways per sq km, ranking among the top in the country in this regard. In addition, last year the province built 22 new bus stations and 49 new berths which are able to handle 7.47 million more tons of goods each year. This year the province plans to pour 12 billion yuan (about 1.38 billion U.S. dollars) into further upgrading its key highway and shipping facilities.
