FR940812-1-00011 FR940812-1-00004 Section 400.11(b)(2) is amended by requiring that the annual social services plan that a State must submit to ORR must be developed on the basis of a local consultative process. Section 400.11(b)(2) is also amended by changing the submission date for the plan from a date that is no later than 45 days prior to the beginning of the State's planning cycle for social services to a date that is to be prescribed by the Director of ORR. Section 400.11(c) is amended by requiring that final financial reports must be submitted in accordance with the requirements specified under §400.210. The language regarding the submission of quarterly financial reports remains unchanged; quarterly reports will continue to be due 30 days after the end of each quarter. Thus States must submit fourth-quarter reports by October 30 of each year, instead of the current deadline of December 30 of each year. ORR needs to receive end-of-year financial data from States soon after the end of the fiscal year to enable more timely forecasting for the next fiscal year. Adjustment may continue to be made, under §400.210, until one year after the end of the fiscal year in the case of grants for cash assistance, medical assistance, and related administrative costs, and 2 years in the case of grants for social services and targeted assistance. Section 400.13(d) is revised to prohibit the charging of case management costs against the cash assistance, medical assistance, and administrative costs (CMA) grant. This revision conforms to priorities established by ORR in FY 1991. Subparts E_Refugee Cash Assistance Section 400.62 is amended to require that refugee cash assistance (RCA) begin on the same date, in relation to the date of application, as assistance under the program of aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) would begin under the State's plan for AFDC. For example, if a State has opted under its AFDC plan to provide assistance no later than the date of authorization or 30 days after the receipt of an application, whichever is earlier, then that same rule will apply regarding RCA. This provision prohibits a State from adopting this rule for AFDC but paying assistance retroactive to the date of application for RCA. This provision thus assures that RCA and AFDC applications and assistance in a given State are treated equitably. Subpart F_Requirements for Employability Services, Job Search, and Employment Section 400.70 is revised by removing references to refugees who are applicants or recipients of AFDC or GA. Section 400.71 is amended by adding a definition of the term ``Family self-sufficiency plan''. Section 400.75(a)(1) is amended by requiring, as a condition for receipt of refugee cash assistance, that a refugee who is not exempt under §400.76 must participate in employment services within 30 days of receipt of aid. Section 400.76(a)(7) is amended by exempting from participation in employment services and acceptance of appropriate employment, a parent or other caretaker relative of child under age 3, rather than age 6, who provides full-time care of the child. Section 400.76(a)(9) is amended by exempting a pregnant woman from registration and participation in employment services if the child is expected to be born within the next 6 months, instead of the next 3 months. The proposed changes in §§400.76 (a)(7) and (a)(9) would make ORR policy consistent with the requirements of the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) program contained in the Family Support Act of 1988, Public Law 100&hyph;485 (42 U.S.C. 602(a)(19)). Section 400.79(a) is amended to emphasize that an employability plan must be developed as part of a family self-sufficiency plan where applicable for each non-exempted recipient of refugee cash assistance in a filing unit. Section 400.80, which contains job search requirements, is removed. Other references in the regulation to job search at §§400.75(a)(2), 400.76(b), 400.79(c)(3), 400.82, and 400.156(a) are also removed. Section 400.82(b)(3) is amended by removing the paragraph on conciliation. Section 400.83 is amended by inserting the paragraph on conciliation from §400.82 and changing the heading to ``Conciliation and fair hearings''. Subpart G_Refugee Medical Assistance Section 400.94(a) is amended by clarifying that a State must determine Medicaid eligibility under its Medicaid State plan for each individual member of a family unit that applies for medical assistance. This is to clarify that if any individual in a family unit is eligible for medical assistance under a State's title XIX plan, then the State must provide that assistance under Medicaid and not RMA. For example, under section 1902(a)(10) and 1902(1) of the Social Security Act, certain children under age 19 who were born after September 30, 1983, may be eligible for Medicaid even though their parents are eligible for refugee medical assistance. Assistance may not be provided to such children under RMA if they are eligible under Medicaid. Section 400.100(d) is amended to clarify that only those recipients of refugee cash assistance who are not eligible for Medicaid are eligible for refugee medical assistance. Section 400.104 is revised by removing the existing provision for extended RMA for recipients who receive increased earnings from employment and replacing it with a provision that would enable RMA recipients who receive earnings from employment to continue to receive RMA until they reach the end of their time-eligibility period, in accordance with §400.100(b), or until the refugee obtains private medical coverage, whichever occurs first.
