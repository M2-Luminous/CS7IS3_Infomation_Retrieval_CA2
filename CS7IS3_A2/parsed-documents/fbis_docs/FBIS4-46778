In April, more than 300 enterprises were operating on a reduced schedule, while 60 were shut down completely. The wages of the majority of machine builders do not exceed 100,000 rubles, but even those are being paid on an irregular basis. The enterprises' social sphere is being ruined, an intensive exodus of skilled personnel is occurring and hidden unemployment is growing. The enterprises' privatization has not produced any positive results and the unfair redistribution of collective property is continuing. The majority of the machine-building enterprises cannot survive under the tax, price and financial conditions which the government has proposed. The Russian machine builders' trade unions have repeatedly proposed changing the orientation of the economic reforms and easing their consequences, however, the government is not adopting or is adopting very belatedly actual measures based on our proposals. Under these conditions, at the decision of their elective organs, the Russian Federation Machine Builders Trade Union, the Motor Vehicle and Agricultural Machine Building Workers Trade Union, the Machine Builders and Instrument Makers Trade Union and the All-Russian Elektroprofsoyuz [electrical machine builders trade union] intend to organize on 1-3 June collective protest actions against the policy of the organs of power and administration, which is aimed at ruining machine building and making the lives of the sector's workers worse, including the picketing of the Russian Federation Government House on 2 June by representatives of the machine-building enterprises' labor collectives. The Demands of the Russian Machine Builders' Trade Unions 1. Support should be given to domestic machine building, including on the basis of the implementation of the approved special-purpose federal programs. 2. Urgent specific actions to overcome the mutual payments crisis should be carried out. 3. The state's portions should be returned completely to the agricultural producers, the defense departments and the MPS [Ministry of Railways] -- the users of machine-building products. 4. The priority of payments for wages over other payments should be established. 5. The government should ensure the fulfillment of obligations based on the Agreement on Social Harmony and on the General and Sectorial Tariff Agreements. 6. The number and amount of taxes should be reduced, the procedure for their collection should be simplified and the tax system should provide incentives for commodity producers. 7. Effective state regulation of prices for energy resources, transportation services, communications, individual types of products, medicines and other services in the interests of the basic mass of the population should be implemented. 8. An effective public employment system should be established as quickly as possible. 9. The safety of Russia's citizens should be ensured.
