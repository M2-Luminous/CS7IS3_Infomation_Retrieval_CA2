At first the West did not understand the real situation in the economies of the CIS countries, the Kazakhstani head of state went on to say. Now it is starting to understand the realities taking shape in the CIS. If I myself had not believed in the Commonwealth's potential, I would never have been a fervent supporter of the integration process. The fact that the ruble zone, for which I also fought, has collapsed attests to what has now become clear: We are different. The economies and the states are different. We have become really independent states. Some people, maybe among the Russian political establishment, dislike this. As for Kazakhstan, I firmly declare (not because I am afraid or apprehensive of something or because I am engaging in intrigue): Strategically, Kazakhstan's future is with Russia. The future of the people, the future of the state, the future of the economy. This is not only advantageous to Kazakhstan, it is also advantageous to Russia. If we speak of independence, Russia was the first to proclaim sovereignty in 1990. I was astounded at the time: from whom, from what? But what is there to be surprised at now? I do not regard sovereignty and independence as an end in itself, the president went on to point out. The end is to improve people's lives and the economy through this. When any state signs some agreement, it assumes obligations and gives up part of its sovereignty. The CIS countries' integration must now proceed along a path similar to the West European one, as the EC is doing. They are all independent states in the EC, and they all have their own currency, political independence, and freedom. Here, I believe, fate itself has determined a very important place for Russia. Russia can act as a unifier by fully recognizing sovereignties and not exerting any pressure, and maybe it can forgo some things at first. We must do as the West Europeans did, only not travel this path in 30 years, like they did, but in a shorter space of time.
