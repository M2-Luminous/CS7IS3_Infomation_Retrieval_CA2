The prime minister, acutely aware that new models to replace the True Path Party (DYP) and Social Democrat People's Party (SHP) coalition government are being discussed, has accelerated her secret political war against the powerful names who favor change. The proposal for a parliamentary inquiry into the activities of Yusuf Bozkurt Ozal, Kaya Erdem, and Ekrem Pakdemirli that might lead to their appearance before the Supreme Parliamentary Council, submitted by DYP parliamentary group deputy chairmen on instructions from the PM [prime minister], is an example of how this war is being conducted. The failure of the coalition government to curb the economic crisis has given new momentum to the search for alternatives. Efforts to promote a True Path-Motherland coalition--favored by the group of businessmen known as "the Barons of Istanbul"--have intensified. It is noticeable that solutions which foresee the removal of the two main opponents (namely DYP chairman Tansu Ciller and ANAP [Motherland Party] chairman Mesut Yilmaz) to the government model called ANAYOL (Mother or Main Road), debated for more than two-and-one-half years, are multiplying rapidly. It is also reported that the plan had reached the final stage; the next step was to find staff for the new government, formulate a new program and establish a new balance of power that would change the division of seats in parliament. Formulas in and out of parliament: Two factors which appear to worry the prime minister and bring the search for alternative government models to an advanced stage are the "alternative economic program" prepared by Ekrem Ceyhun, who is known to be very close to President Suleyman Demirel, and a second program being prepared by Ilhan Kesici, ANAP's Istanbul mayoral candidate and former undersecretary of the State Planning Organization. It is reported that the program prepared by Ceyhun, together with Mahir Barutcu, could be implemented immediately if a DYP-ANAP coalition came into being. The two programs could also be combined, or at least made compatible, after talks between the two sides. However, the greatest obstacles to the DYP-ANAP unification remain the chairmen of the two parties and this has resulted in a "war of attrition" being waged by deputies on their chairmen. As the actions of the conservative and religious wings of the DYP, which originally put the future of the present coalition at stake, continue, the idea of DYP-ANAP coalition is being openly expressed to the PM in parliamentary group meetings. DYP's deputy chairman Esat Kiratlioglu, responsible for party organization, claims that "democracy was born in the group after Tansu Ciller came to power. "Nobody could talk of such things in Demirel's time (as chairman). Even then similar ideas existed but they were being expressed secretly. Now they are being expressed openly. Let it be this way, there is nothing to fear," he said. Kiratlioglu said that Husamettin Cindoruk, considered to be the leader of the opposition within the party, has always been part of the opposing group but no longer has any followers, thus no political power. Kiratlioglu also claims that there is nobody strong enough to be an alternative to Ciller. As for Ekrem Ceyhun, Kiratlioglu claimed to be aware of his program but also thought that Ceyhun had no support other than that of Demirel. Kiratlioglu appeared to take an even harder line against opposition at a press conference on Sunday [1 May], when he accused ANAP leader Yilmaz of "calling for a civilian coup" by encouraging establishment of a new government by anti-democratic means. "There is a movement to destroy the True Path party as well as remove Ciller from the prime ministry," Kiratlioglu said. "We will not allow that. The government is standing firm." Kiratlioglu's approach to the issue is one of the tactics being used by Ciller who has told her deputies that a coalition with ANAP would result in the party losing power and its eventual disintegration. According to Ciller it is not possible for two parties to address the same section of the electorate and remain viable. She asks why should ANAP be kept alive by allowing it to share power and says that this would not, in any way, serve the interests of the DYP. The prime minister maintains that the present coalition government will carry on until the general elections when the DYP will take power on its own, wiping out ANAP in the process. Cindoruk, on the other had, says in private conversation that Ciller, to whom he refers, unflatteringly, as "that girl" and hints at her lack of experience and her political naivete, will be unsuccessful despite her good intentions. Cindoruk also maintains that those who had criticized him in the past should look at the present situation and admit that he had been right. "The government and the high officials in the bureaucracy are incompetent. The mistake was made by Demirel right at the beginning when he assembled a weak staff and the mistake has not been corrected up to the present day." Cindoruk says. The same commotion regarding ANAYOL can also be seen in ANAP. Istanbul deputy Naci Eksi's criticism of Chairman Mesut Yilmaz and demands for his resignation are interpreted as the extensions of the search for a new government. ANAP'S former group deputy chairman and Bayburt deputy, Ulku Gokalp, is also critical of Yilmaz. Istanbul deputy Gurol Soylu, founder of the party and late president Turgut Ozal's personal office director Fevzi Isnasaran, together with Huseyin Aksoy and Engin Guner, who was close to Ozal, are also known to be supporters of the idea of partnership with DYP. Gunes Taner, who is not a member of this group, was also said to support the DYP-ANAP partnership. It is also reported that Yusuf Bozkurt Ozal has taken the initiative to form an umbrella group for those who are "resentful of the leaders." Apart from these parliamentary "efforts," a new formula, which debates the establishment of a technocrat government -- ironically known in political corridors as "government of brains" -- to be headed by Central Bank ex-governor Rusdu Saracoglu, is simmering. This formula is a throwback to the 1971 Nihat Erim government, when President Cevdet Sunay, in the wake of a military memorandum, asked Professor Erim to form a non-party government. It is claimed that the present debate and the search for possible names for such a government is being kept alive -- particularly at a time when political parties in parliament will be forced to say "yes" to such a development because of military pressures. Pondering on possible names for "government of brains," the Turkish media comes up with the following: "Yavuz Canevi, Zekeriya Yildirim, Ercan Kumcu, Hasan Ersel, Kadir Guney, Gazi Ercel, Mahfi Egilmez, Ertugrul Kumcuoglu, Yavuz Ege, Metin Koksal, Bulent Gultekin, Salih Neftci, Kemal Dervis, Cetin Hacaloglu, Vural Akisik, Yilmaz Karakogyunlu, Veysi Sevig, Cem Alpar, Deniz Gokce, Taner Berksoy, Sukru Binay, Murat Kudat, Sener Oktay, Merih Celasun, Erdogan Ertozun, Aksit Kayalar, Gunal Kansu, Varan Tuncel." It is also claimed that the search for a new government would be an alternative to the "government of brains" thesis and the same names could be used by a Motherland-True Path coalition. Ciller, meanwhile, is trying to keep her parliamentary group united, utilize her "foreign support" card and gives the message that "we will all go down together" if economic prosperity is not secured. Her aim is to prevent her deputies from launching new alternatives. But new alternatives are sure to appear after July 5, 1994 -- the date which marks the end of the three month waiting period which Ciller requested before results of her economic package became apparent.
