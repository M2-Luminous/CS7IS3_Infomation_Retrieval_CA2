"Packard" and "Caterpillar" recently announced their wish to participate on a joint basis with the Russian ZIL production association to create new heavy trucks. The documents which are planned to be signed during the summit meeting are to ensure the start of the successful functioning of a new joint venture, "AMOZIL," and safeguard U.S. entrepreneurs against financial losses. An official spokesman for the overseas private investment corporation stressed that U.S. President B. Clinton and Vice President A. Gore very much want to see this venture succeed, since they believe that the development of transportation is a key element in Russian economic recovery. He also noted that the plan provides not only for the construction of a new truck plant near Moscow, but also for the creation of a network of stores and truck maintenance centers. According to the leaders of the U.S. companies, truck production is planned to start at the end of next year. According to the agreement concluded between ZIL, "Packard," and "Caterpillar," the U.S. partners will produce chassis and engines and the Russian plant will produce bodies for the heavy truck.
