He said that the treaty would expire in two years. "In accordance with this document, one party must notify the other on its intention to extend or not to extend the treaty. This means we still have a year," Panov stressed. Panov said that Russia had already proposed to North Korea to review the treaty. "That is to say the message to Pyongyang has already been sent," he concluded. Moscow does not rule out that the issue concerning sanctions against North Korea could be submitted for consideration of the UN Security Council, Chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry First Asian Department Mikhail Beliy said in an interview with Interfax today. Bely said that the matter was becoming serious since Pyongyang was refusing to negotiate with the International Atomic Energy Agency on reloading the nuclear reactor. Bely pointed out that sanctions were the last resort. "In principle, sanctions could be imposed. However, all other political opportunities must be exhausted before this," he remarked. Bely believes that not every method has as yet been applied to influence Pyongyang. "After the talks between North Korea and the U.S.A. failed, the Russian initiative on an international conference on security and non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula was high on the agenda. I think the time has come to try to settle this issue on the whole," he underlined. Commenting on the future of the treaty between ex-USSR and North Korea (since Russia was the legal successor of the USSR), Beliy said, "The first provision of this treaty providing for assistance to Pyongyang in case of an aggression against it is not really in force. Only in case of a non-provoked aggression against North Korea will we establish how much it conforms with our understanding of the treaty. We will be thinking how to amend the document."
