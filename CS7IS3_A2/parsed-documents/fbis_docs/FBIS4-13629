He expressed his regret that "some people should exploit the crisis Yemen is experiencing to distort facts and level false accusations at others." In a statement AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT received from a Yemeni Foreign Ministry official, Basindwah said that "with regard to the ministry's delay in sending financial allowances to the embassies, this delay is not limited to certain embassies. It affects all embassies." This came as a reply to accusations made by some Yemeni sources regarding a diplomatic reshuffle aimed at recalling to Yemen YSP diplomats or those close to the YSP, and the Foreign Ministry's deliberate delay in sending financial allowances to the embassies where they work. The foreign minister attributed the delay in sending these allowances to "the Central Bank's inability to secure the sums decided in hard currency on the specified dates." [passage omitted]
