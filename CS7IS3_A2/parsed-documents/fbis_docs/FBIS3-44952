"I think that many people in Hong Kong will be a little puzzled by the various messages which have been coming out of Beijing. "There were, I think, two rather different impressions given yesterday about future Chinese intention on right of abode," Mr Patten said. The Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping, reportedly said on Thursday morning that Hong Kong residents with foreign passports would not need to go through another application process to acquire the right of abode after 1997. But he said later in the day that people with foreign passports would lose their Chinese nationality, and a clear set of criteria would be worked out to allow the recovery of permanent resident status. Mr Lu added China would adopt a more lenient policy towards these people. It is estimated there are 300,000 to 400,000 people whose right of abode in Hong Kong will be in doubt after 1997 because they own foreign passports. Mr Patten said he was confused about China's stance, and the Government was anxious to reach an agreement on the issue to put to rest the anxiety of the people involved.
