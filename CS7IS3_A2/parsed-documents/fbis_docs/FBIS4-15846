Dolgopyatova: "Women and Workers Were Not Elected"] [Text] Yesterday the city electoral commission held a news conference in Mariynskiy Palace and made public the preliminary results of the second round of elections to the St. Petersburg City Assembly. Only 18.76 percent of the overall number of registered voters participated in the voting. Elections were held in 24 electoral precincts. The social composition of the deputies is curious: eight were managers, five were teachers, four were businessmen, three were scientific associates, three were representatives of public organizations, and one, an office employee. Not a single worker was among the candidates who were elected. Among the deputies there is not a single representative of the fairer sex. All five women who entered the second round suffered defeat by their male competitors. The deputy chairman of the city electoral commission, R.G. Malova, noted that the situation was calmer in the second round of the elections. There were no serious complaints or grievances. In Rita Grigoryevna's opinion, the voters made their choice, which was significantly different from the results of the first round, on the basis of television and radio debates, which helped the Petersburgers to get to know the candidates directly. According to observations of the state electoral commission, it was mostly the older generation who voted and there were practically no youth at the precincts except a certain number of students and military servicemen. A very strange situation developed in the 39th electoral district of Oktyabrskiy Rayon. As we know, the state electoral commission kept an eye out for violations when the results of the first round of voting were being summed up. According to information from the chairman of the city electoral commission, V.I. Fomichev, only 20,030 people voted here during 20-21 March, while there are 80,875 voters registered in Oktyabrskiy Rayon. Thus, the necessary 25 percent did not participate in the first round of voting. On these grounds the city electoral commission declared the first round of elections in the 39th district to be null and void. But the city's mayor, A.A. Sobchak, subsequently overrode the decision of the city commission, and on 3 April there was a repeat vote in this district as well. But the city electoral commission did not intend to take these results into account. V.I. Fomichev thinks that the city acted in keeping with the Statute on Elections to the City Assembly within the limits of its authority and that no official has the right to override its decision. This can be done only though the courts. Thus another has been added to the many points of confusion regarding the past elections.
