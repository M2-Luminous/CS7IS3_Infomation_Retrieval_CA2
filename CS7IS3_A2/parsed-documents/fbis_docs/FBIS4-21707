Police identified the rightists as Kuniyasu Uchiyama, 41, and Toshikazu Furusawa, 29, both from the Taihikai right-wing group. The two were arrested at around 7:10 p.m. [1010 GMT] Uchiyama was carrying a sword at the time of the arrest and police said they recovered four sticks of dynamite. The two men had held Kei Aragaki, 57, an executive in charge of the company's public relations department, and Mikinori Yoshida, 51, the head of the secretarial department, in an executive reception room on the 15th floor, police said. Before breaking into the building, the two rightists, carrying a sword, a handgun, and what they said were two sticks of dynamite, threatened a security guard with the handgun, police said. Pamphlets distributed by the two men described the mass media as a ``class a war criminal'' and called on the ASAHI SHIMBUN to ``amend the tone of its news coverage.'' The pamphlets also criticized Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for his failure to retract a statement apologizing for Japan's wartime activities in Asia which he said were ``a war of aggression.'' Police said the rightists entered the building at about 1:30 p.m., told the security guard the gun they had was not a fake and they wanted to meet the company's president. Police said one of the men fired a shot when another security guard approached but no one was injured. They then rode an elevator to the 15th floor where they used desks and potted plants to barricade themselves inside the executive reception room with the hostages. Police said the two men arrested Friday told the security guard they are ``disciples'' of [Taihikhai leader] Nomura. Furusawa was Nomura's secretary and chauffeur. He was present in the same room with Nomura and other ASAHI SHIMBUN executives when Nomura shot himself [in October 1993], police said.
