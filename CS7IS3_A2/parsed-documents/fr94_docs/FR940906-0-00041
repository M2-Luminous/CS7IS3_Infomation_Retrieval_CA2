FR940906-0-00041 FR940906-0-00017 C. Disease or Predation Not known to be applicable. However, the potential exists for disease to enter the wild Kootenai River white sturgeon population through the release of hatchery raised sturgeon, such as those from the Kootenai Tribe's experimental hatchery. Diseases known to occur in white sturgeon hatcheries include bacterial diseases, protozoans, fungi, adenovirus, and the white sturgeon iridovirus (WSIV) (PSMFC 1992). Many of these causative diseases are commonly found in natural water systems, while the WSIV pathogen is thought to reside naturally in several wild populations of white sturgeon. During late November 1992, an outbreak of the WSIV killed most of the nearly 23,000 fingerling Kootenai River white sturgeon being raised at the Kootenai Tribe hatchery, and the IDFG hatchery at Sandpoint, Idaho. High fish densities and low dissolved oxygen conditions at the hatchery at the time of the WSIV outbreak were considered contributing factors. According to BPA (1993), WSIV problems at the experimental hatchery have been alleviated by installing additional tanks and supplying additional water. Although it appears that white sturgeon fingerlings are most susceptible to WSIV when confined under hatchery rearing conditions, the Service is concerned that WSIV and other diseases in wild white sturgeon reared in hatcheries may also be transmitted to the remaining wild population when released. Fish predation may be a contributing source of mortality for Kootenai River white sturgeon eggs and larvae, although no data to support this suggestion exists specific to the Kootenai River. In the Columbia River downstream of McNary Dam, common carp (Cyprinus carpio ), largescale suckers ( Catostomus macrocheilus ), and northern squawfish ( Ptychocheilus oregonensis ) have been collected with white sturgeon eggs in their stomachs (Duke et al. 1990). D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms The IDFG currently classifies the Kootenai River population of white sturgeon as endangered, which it defines as ``any species in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its Idaho range'' (IDFG 1992). While such designation regulates the take or possession of those species classified as threatened or endangered, the State lacks authority to impose or implement additional conservation measures to ensure survival or recovery of the Kootenai River population of white sturgeon. In Montana, the Kootenai River white sturgeon is classified as a ``Species of Special Concern'' (MTNHP 1993). The fish is currently managed under restricted harvest regulation, with catch and release only and possession prohibited. Similar to Idaho, Montana also lacks authority to impose additional conservation measures on flow management at Libby Dam to benefit white sturgeon. The Corps regulates the management of water at Libby Dam. The Libby Dam project was authorized by Title II of Public Law 81&hyph;516, the Flood Control Act of 1950, primarily for flood control, hydropower generation, and recreation purposes (Corps 1984). Present Corps policy states that equal consideration should be given to environmental concerns in accordance with project objectives. However, other than providing minimum flow releases of 4,000 cfs (113 cms) from Libby Dam to maintain rainbow trout habitat downstream, permanent operational flow alternatives for Libby Dam to benefit white sturgeon recruitment have not been implemented.
