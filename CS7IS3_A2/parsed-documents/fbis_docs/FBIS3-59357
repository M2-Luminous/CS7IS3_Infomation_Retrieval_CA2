How is this contradiction to be alleviated? The Enterprise Management Institute of the Capital Research and Development Corporation, the Members' Work Department of the China Enterprise Management Association, and the Capital Entrepreneurs' Club on the day before yesterday jointly held a symposium at which this "hot point" issue was explored. Figures from economic circles attending the symposium said that the current widespread shortage of funds in state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises had caused a reappearance of triangular debts exceeding the scale and rate of those in 1989, and that the amount of bank savings by enterprises had fallen; it is now difficult for the enterprises to maintain normal production and operation. The production and earnings of some state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises that, in the first half of the year, had been at a moderate rate and had had fairly good gains, had rapidly fallen back. For example, in the especially large enterprise Capital Iron and Steel Complex, which has abundant strength, the corporate debt funds are more than double what they were in the peak period of 1989. Since the beginning of this year, banks have given Capital Iron and Steel Complex 10 million yuan in working capital loans and at the same time have taken away 77 million yuan; in addition, the market changes make it impossible to obtain loans paid in advance, and a serious funds shortage has appeared. It was widely held by those at the symposium that, from an analysis of the macroeconomic economy, the fundamental reason for the current funds shortage was that investment in fixed assets has increased too sharply and has taken up too many funds. Last year and this year work was completed on more than 100 billion yuan worth of fixed assets investment projects, and they required the disposition of auxiliary working capital in a 1:03 ratio, which squeezed the the enterprises' existing working capital. In addition, the rising prices of the means of production and raw materials has added to the demand for enterprise working capital; in the first nine months of this year, the amount of increase in loans for enterprise working capital was reduced compared with that in the same period of last year, and in the August the amount was reduced 10.39 million yuan. The enterprises' nonstandard channels for raising funds have also been reduced. Some of those attending the symposium pointed out that the finance and land management sectors have been overwhelmed by the "land craze" and the "exploitation craze." This has become a direct motive force for encouraging an over-rapid momentum for the increase of investment. For many projects the share system has been adopted, and the funds paid into them are not taken back. With these funds not being taken back, the funds that are taken back are funds that should not be taken out. Thus, in the state's reorganization of the money market, to a certain extent contradictions have been shifted to the production domain and the enterprises. Speaking of state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises themselves, everybody held that a crucial problem is that mechanisms to replenish these enterprises' working capital have not yet been formed. The low rate of growth and the too-heavy tax burden in several years in succession have caused, on average, the profits retained by the people in enterprises to be less than half those retained in 1988, and the capability to replenish working capital from retained profits to become weaker and weaker. In line with the stipulation that 1 percent of the sales income be used to replenish the working capital, the "two sides" in finance -- pursuing and liquidating -- will deepen the enterprises' dependence on banks. With regard to the question of how to alleviate the funds shortage, the people attending the symposium unanimously maintained that the fundamental way to do this lies in deepening reform so as to enhance the vitality of state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises and, at the same time, strengthen the comprehensiveness of the five major reforms and improve the enterprises' external environment. Yang Peixin [2799 1014 2450], a researcher at the Development Research Center of the State Council, said that, to practically handle the invigoration of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises as a central link in the reform of the entire economic system, the tug-of-war struggle -- releasing rights-receiving rights-releasing rights -- is to be avoided. At present there are many ways, with regard to the funds problem, to handle the release of rights in a better way, invigorate the enterprises, and cause the enterprises to reap good returns. Zhu Renxue [2612 0088 1331], vice chairman of the China Enterprise Management Association, after giving a briefing on what he saw and heard during an investigation and study of enterprises over the recent several months, said that, in strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, there remain 20-30 percent of the state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises that are maintaining a growth in production and returns and that they do not feel that their funds are in very short supply. The operating mechanisms and management mechanisms of these enterprises are worthy of close attention and study. Guo Zhishan [6753 1807 1472], deputy director of the Enterprise Department in the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, proposed four countermeasures to alleviate the funds shortage: 1) Concentrate the necessary working capital so that at any time the difficulties of state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises are resolved. Checking the growth of triangular debts must be made an important objective of macro regulation and control. 2) Enterprises that have a debt larger than the average debt of enterprises as a whole must be closed down, i.e., their production stopped, they are merged, they are transferred, or they are declared bankrupt. Lawless elements who, in the name of triangular debts, intentionally erode the property of state-owned enterprises must be punished. 3) Regular channels that replenish the enterprises' working capital must be formed. 4) The growth of investment in fixed assets must be better controlled, emphasizing that investment in fixed assets and working capital must form a complete set. Yang Kaisheng [2799 0418 3932], deputy director of the Planning Information Department in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, said that, as of the end of September, working capital loans had increased 63.3 billion yuan compared to their amount at the beginning of the year, an increase of 4 billion yuan compared to that of the same period last year. That the enterprises are not affected by this is mainly because of the time difference: in July and August bank funds were comparatively tight, in September the situation changed, and in September and October there was a fairly big increase in working capital loans; before long the enterprises will feel the effect of this. He maintained that not to depend on deepening reform and adjusting the structure to change the situation in which enterprise get low returns, and to only increase loans, would be like "digging up earth to fill a well." Currently the production and marketing rate is falling, and some of the newly added working capital loans have become "overstocked goods," which shows that we must get a tight grip on the industrial structure and the product mix. He advocated that short-term objectives and long-term plans for reform be formulated. Under the circumstances in which the financial supervision and control system is not sufficiently perfected, the legal system is not sound enough, and people do not have a strong enough understanding of financial risk, in comprehensively blending funds, direct finance capital should be made primary, but, speaking of adapting to the market economy's long-term objectives, we should create conditions for gradually opening up indirect finance capital.
