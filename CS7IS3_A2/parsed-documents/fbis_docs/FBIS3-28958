Revealing the schedule at a National Assembly Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Committee meeting on Monday, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Kim Yang-pae said it would not contain any cuts of tariff equivalent -- the difference between the world and domestic prices -- on rice. Instead, under the Uruguay Round accord the government will allow a minimum rice market access of 1 percent of domestic consumption for imported rice in 1995 and increase the rate to 2 percent in 1999, 2.5 percent in 2000 and 4 percent in 2004, while not tarifficating rice for 10 years starting in 1995, Kim added. Regarding the 111 items due for tariffication under the accord, the schedule calls for a 10-percent cut in the tariff equivalents determined by the difference between world and domestic prices in the 1988-90 period. For barley, potatoes and other items whose imports are currently minimal or zero, a minimum market access of 3-5 percent of domestic consumption will be permitted, while for corn, soybeans and others whose imports currently stand at more then 3 percent of domestic consumption, the existing tariff system will apply. As for the "balance-of-payments" clause items such as beef, pork and chicken, the schedule will apply the tariff rates already agreed with the United States and other countries. On red pepper, garlic, onions and other "non-concessional" items, a 10-percent cut in the tariff equivalents is called for over the coming 10 years, Minister Kim said. For 102 import-liberalized items such as mushrooms and carrots, the schedule sets forth a 10-percent cut in rates determined by multiplying their 1986 basic rates by 150 percent or more, while a special determining method will be used for the 175 tariff cut preference items, including fruit juice and sunflower seeds. Tariff cuts on frozen strawberries, soybean sauce and 813 other items will be made on the basis of their basic rates in 1986 or their concessional rates. Minister Kim said the schedule would also call for a 13.3-percent cut in farm subsidies and a minimum subsidy of 10 percent of farming costs over a 10-year period ending in 2004, reducing total subsidies from 1,718 billion won to 1,493 billion won. But subsidies for grapes, silkworms and dairy products will be less than 10 percent of the cost, he added.
