Amid the effects of the sharp rise of the yen, the future is uncertain for the companies that are steadily lowering costs aand restricting the number of personnel. Toyota: Personnel Reshuffle of 20 Percent in the Indirect Sector; Faced With Measures Concerning Surplus Plants Toyota Motor Corp., which was a synonym for the high-earnings enterprise, has been doubly impacted by the recession and the high yen. The company's June 1993 settlement shows a business profit of 103.629 billion yen, which is a big drop of 23.8 percent from the same period a year before. The forecast for the June 1994 settlement indicates that the profit from its main business will decline further by 32.5 percent or 70 billion yen, and will definitely fall below the 100 billion yen mark. From the end of last year until this year when the recession and the high yen overlapped, Toyota evolved such internal company activities as "emergency VA [value analysis]," "VE [value engineering]," and the "special VA/VE," and implemented cost improvements totaling 100 billion yen. The VA/VE method is a cost-improvement measure generally adopted by various automakers in recent years, and is a typical post-bubble cost-lowering step. There are various added-value factors for autos such as performance, comfort, and endurance. The aim of the VA/VE process is to analyze each aspect of performance and quality, reexamining them in detail as to whether there are any excessive or ineffective parts, and linking them to cost-cutting. In the case of Japan's automakers, the ratio of parts made outside the company has reached 70-80 percent. Consequently, VA/VE activity naturally is a measure that has been adopted not only by the main Toyota company, but also by numerous parts makers. The slimming down of the indirect sector has also started. Limiting the period from six months to two years and centering on the management sector, all sectors including the new sectors will participate in the operations reform project. Toyota explains that, rather than indicating that it feels there is a surplus, it decisively halts work that can be halted. However, their explanation can be viewed as justifying the reshuffling that will affect about 20 percent of the personnel. For Toyota, which has never carried out any temporary transfer of sales personnel to the dealerships--a practice common among the other automakers, the act of reshuffling itself exposes extremely severe management circumstances. It is also planned to drastically downsize plant and equipment [P&E] investment. P&E investment in the early period (June 1993 period) was initially set at 410 billion yen, but it was actually reduced by 130 billion to 280 billion yen. It will also be kept at a similar level for the current period. Development investment in new cars and technology comprises 50 percent of overall P&E, and such drastic constraints will undoubtedly impact greatly on future plans for new car investments. Personnel cutbacks are not limited to reshuffling in the management sector. They will also have a major impact on new hiring of high school male graduates in the production sector. As of this spring, the plan was to hire 1,000 new graduates, but it was decided by this fall to pare it down to 500, and notices to that effect were sent to high schools nationwide. In order to reduce the hiring of new graduates in the management sector also, the plan for next spring calls for 1,650 new employees, or 850 less than this year. Meanwhile, unprecedented moves are seen in the reappraisal of the production sector. Regarding the popular passenger-car Tercel Corsa series, a production system in the form of consigned production at Toyota's Takaoka plant (Toyoda City, Aichi Prefecture) and Hino Motor--an affiliated company--had been maintained previously. However, consignments to Hino Motor will be terminated at the end of this fiscal year, and will be concentrated at the Takaoka plant. From Toyota's viewpoint, consignment to Hino is surplus productivity, and it became necessary to terminate production at the two plants for efficient production. This fall, Toyota will transfer the entire production of the Mark II from its Motomachi plant (ditto) to its new Kyushu plant. In accordance with this move, the surplus staff of more than 100 key employees at the Motomachi plant has been assigned to the group's chassis makers. Such aftermath effects of the bubble period are likely to surface in various forms in the future. Nissan: Second Zama Plant To Close in 1995; Is "Profit at Zero Growth" Possible? Twice this year, Nissan Motor announced a full-fledged restructuring plan for the purpose of drastically improving its earnings capacity. The gist of the plan focused on the following two points. 1) To close its second Zama plant in the spring of 1995, and 2) to lay off 5,000 of its personnel by 1995. The major aim of the plant closure is "to create a capacity for adequate earnings at zero growth" (Atsushi Muramatsu, then vice president). Nissan has five complete-assembly plants throughout Japan and, by reducing them to four plants, productivity will change from 2.5 million cars to 2.25 million cars annually. In order to be profitable with production of 2 million cars, capacity of 2.5 million production will become a burden. That is the reason for the decision to close the Zama plant. The policy for the personnel cutback is based on a decisive constraint on hiring and not supplementing natural retirements. Simultaneously, it has also been decided to begin temporary assignment of indirect personnel to the dealerships. When the plan was announced, it was intended to lay off 5,000 workers "by the end of FY95." However, due to the subsequent sharp rise in the value of the yen, it was moved up by about a year, and implementation is targeted toward the end of FY94. Nissan's total employees reached 59,600 at its peak in March 1989 and, if the cutback plan is enforced, they will total 42,000. The figure of 42,000 will generally equal the level in 1970. The hiring of new graduates next spring will also drop considerably. Although the plan calls for hiring of 200 college graduates--a 60-percent reduction from the number hired this spring, the probability is that it will fall below 200. At the outset, the hiring of 600 new high school graduates was scheduled for the production sector, but it was decided by this summer to cut the number by half to 300. Of course, the sharp yen rise from the spring to this summer provided the backdrop for the advancement of the cutback plan. Nissan's restructuring policy is considered to be a typical reduce and balance policy, but it is actually farther advanced. The company's production figure for this fiscal year seems likely to undercut the original estimate by 160,000 cars and settle at 1.8 million cars. A production level of 1.8 million cars will result in the lowest record in some 20 years. The aim of the company's restructuring plan is to "secure profits even with 2 million cars." However, due to the export slump caused by the high yen, the actual production level already appears likely to fall greatly below the original estimate of "2 million cars." The high yen has resulted in throwing cold water also on the earnings improvement measure based on bold restructuring. The company is firming up a decision to sell about 60 billion yen of its share holdings within this period, and this is based on the forecast of a deficit resulting from two consecutive periods of losses due to the high yen. Normally, the sale of shares as a company's settlement measure is intended with repurchase following the sale. However, it is likely to merely end in selling to lessen the company's capital burden. The company's interest-bearing liabilities exceed 1 trillion yen, and employees at the Zama plant which approaches closure say: "Depending on the situation, we may have to resign and look for jobs elsewhere." The future of the restructuring still seems unclear. Mazda: "Third Restructuring" Inevitable for Correction of the Bubble Expansion In September 1993, Mazda announced its forecast on the expanded operating deficit for the March 1994 period, and also revealed a new restructuring plan. Although the company had announced a rebuilding measure in May 1993, it was forced to reexamine the plan in view of the continuing recession and the sharp rise of the yen. The company had scheduled a cutback of 1,500 employees during the next three years, but it has decided to lay off 3,000 workers by the end of FY96 under the new plan. Although a halt to the production line was not clear in May, the recent announcement points to the closure of the third line (U3) in the Ujina district of the parent company, which is a new mainstay plant. The breakdown of the rationalization of personnel includes 1,000 direct employees and 2,000 indirect employees. Among the indirect employees, in addition to a drastic cut in hiring of new graduates, temporary assignments to dealerships will be increased from the present 200 to 1,000 employees. There will be an additional 650 employees (annually) who will retire. Among the direct employees, the policy is to cut by half the annual hiring of about 600, apart from the retirees. Forming the backdrop of the need for such "supplemental" restructuring is the unexpected difficulty caused by the sharply rising yen. At the outset, Mazda had estimated a rate of 112-113 yen to the dollar, but it actually climbed sharply to nearly 100 yen. In the settlement forecast announced in September, the foreign exchange rate was adjusted to 105 yen to the dollar, and the early forecast saw an expansion of the operating deficit from 12 billion yen to 32 billion yen. The company has a high export ratio of 60 percent, with its clients concentrated heavily in Europe, centering in Germany. However, because the recent high yen occurred not only against the dollar, but also tended to rise sharply against the mark, export profitability deteriorated and eventually suppressed earnings. Mazda's restructuring measure was already being questioned at the time of the announcement in May by those concerned as to "whether it is adequate." The second restructuring measure was predominantly interpreted as an inevitable step, but the view is voiced by many that "perhaps even this is inadequate." The reason is that sales policy and product policy were based on the rapid-growth bubble period, and are not able to respond to zero growth. Mazda has followed an expansionist policy by establishing a domestic five-channel sales system similar to Toyota and Nissan, and by introducing a unique model in each of the channels. However, the reality is that even Nissan faces difficulty in maintaining five channels. During the past five years, new models have been introduced successively in each of the five channels, but their penetration of the general users has been extremely insufficient, and the notification of car names cannot be said to be thorough. While massive CM's [expansion not given] are necessary for penetration among the users, funds are limited. Also, huge funds are required to narrow down the once-expanded commercial fronts. In view of this situation, it is not strange for a third restructuring plan to emerge. Isuzu: Resources Concentrated in the Truck Sector With Withdrawal From Passenger Car Production Isuzu Motor has decided to withdraw from the passenger car sector as its ace card for management restructuring. Isuzu's passenger cars consist of the Gemini, the Aska and the Piazza models, with the Gemini playing a central role with an overwhelming number of cars produced and sold. In an inherently competitive class of autos for the masses, the Gemini was truly a remarkable car with a unique character as its weapon for survival. However, amid the post-bubble drop in overall demand, its sales have nosedived, and it has become a burden on the company's management. For Isuzu, "how to deal with the passenger car sector" has been a major operational challenge during the past several years. The company fell into a deficit two years ago for the first time in five years in its October 1991 settlement and, even amid its restructuring, no clear direction was indicated regarding the nonprofitability in the passenger car sector. The company's number of passenger cars was 200,000 in 1985, but it fell to 72,000 in 1992. During this period, technological innovation on passenger cars, including electronification made advances, and development investment grew unprecedentedly. The inability to win in such development competition and sales resulted in lowering its competitiveness in the passenger car sector. However, even amid the deficit settlements, no revival measures for the passenger car sector were indicated, and voices of doubt were heard among those concerned as to "what the company intended to do." Ultimately, however, it was decided to discard the sector as a nonprofitable sector and to aim for management reconstruction under a production system with trucks as the commercial mainstay vehicles. Many evaluate such a clearcut decision as "far better than continuing the bloodletting endlessly." The reason is that withdrawal from the passenger car race not merely has a negative aspect, but also has various merits. One positive aspect is that the limited management resources can be concentrated in the truck sector. In the truck industry, every company is desperately continuing research and development in order to clear the medium- and long-term regulations on diesel exhaust gases. Naturally, plenty of funds become necessary. However, withdrawal from the passenger car sector is expected to facilitate coping with exhaust emissions. Also, passenger cars are directed toward the general consumers who are the ultimate users and, despite the "hits and misses," commercial vehicles such as trucks have mostly fixed users. Therefore, if commerciality in the hardware aspect can be ensured, it is difficult to fall into a broad decline. In other words, it is deemed that, compared to passenger cars, management plans for trucks can be easily formulated. The characteristic of such products is of course an extremely important element for a restructuring company like Isuzu which must follow a stabilized schedule. The market scale of trucks is smaller than for passenger cars, and the profitability rate is not high. However, they have merit as a potentially sound business with little fluctuation. Although reducing the product lineup has its risks in a certain sense, the risks are smaller than maintaining a front line that drains the company's energies. It will probably become the final gamble for Isuzu, the distinguished automaker.
