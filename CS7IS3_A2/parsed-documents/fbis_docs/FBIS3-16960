Its purpose was the creation of a legal space favorable to the implementation of a preelection program regarding dual citizenship, Crimea's complete economic independence, and the practical preparation of important acts necessary for the successful implementation of reforms. This determined the essence of the questions submitted for the poll of citizens of the Republic of Crimea: 1) Are you for the restoration of the provision of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea of 6 May 1992 which determines the regulation of mutual relations between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine on the basis of a TREATY and AGREEMENTS? (Yes/No) The need for this question is associated with the fact that the Supreme Council of Ukraine has not made a decision up until now about whether the law of Ukraine "On Demarcating the Powers between the Organs of State Authority of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea" is in effect or not. Periodically, guided by political considerations, the Supreme Council of Ukraine makes attempts to require bringing the Constitution and legislative acts of the Republic of Crimea immediately into conformity with the Constitution and legislation of Ukraine. This makes the conduct of progressive economic reorganizations in the Crimea extremely difficult and the arrangement of fruitful relations with foreign partners even more complicated. 2) Are you for the restoration of the provision of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea of 6 May 1992 that proclaimed the RIGHT OF CITIZENS OF THE REPUBLIC OF CRIMEA TO DUAL CITIZENSHIP? (Yes/No) With its decree of 24 February 1994 "On the Status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea in accordance with the Existing Constitution and Legislation of Ukraine," the Supreme Council of Ukraine made an attempt to deprive the Republic of Crimea of its own citizenship, reducing it simply to a concept of permanent residence on the peninsula. Naturally, this infringes considerably on the rights of Crimeans and does not respond to the aspirations of a majority of them that are directed at acquiring Russian citizenship as a second citizenship, like that of the other republics of the former Union. Therefore, it makes sense to elicit the opinion of citizens of the Crimea on the question, whose resolution Ukraine is hindering in every way possible. 3) Are you for conceding the FORCE OF LAWS to the edicts of the president of the Republic of Crimea on questions that are temporarily not regulated by legislation of the Republic of Crimea? (Yes/No) The lawmaking activity of today's deputy corps has been rather weak, an insignificant legacy was left, and many key legal questions remained outside the purview of the Supreme Soviet of Crimea. After the elections, essentially new deputies will come to parliament who will acquire at least some legislative experience after many months. But regardless of this, and whether the Supreme Soviet adopts the required laws in a timely way or not, people all the same will have to drink, eat, clothe themselves, sow, harvest, study, get medical treatment, and so forth. And so that our impoverished and wretched life would change, reforms would continue, production would be normalized, and the lag behind Russia, not to mention behind countries of the West, would be reduced, it is expedient for the period until parliament begins to work quickly and qualitatively to allot to the president the right to issue appropriate acts on the most pressing questions in the vital activity of the republic that are not reflected in legislation in force. It would seem that everything is clear and understandable. However, contrary to common sense, the Central Electoral Commission on elections to the Supreme Soviet of Crimea, with its decree No. 21/1 of 12 March 1994, expressed a reluctance to take on the work, and more accurately, the honor of organizing and conducting a poll of the citizens of the republic that responds to the despair of Crimeans, which is convincingly indicated by the results of the presidential elections. What is more, in paragraph 1 of its decree, the Central Electoral Commission, headed by V.V. Alsufyev, proposed to the president of Crimea to bring the provisions of the edict into conformity with existing legislation, thereby assuming the functions of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Crimea. This is an impermissible excess of the powers granted to the Central Electoral Commission by Article 14 of the Law "On Elections to the Supreme Soviet of Crimea." The conduct of the poll on another day or the creation of special commissions for the conduct of the poll do not constitute insurmountable difficulties, but it will require an additional diversion of numerous people with multibillion costs, which is not very sensible under conditions of a shortage even for the payment of pensions and wages. Therefore, the conduct of the poll simultaneously with the elections of the parliament of Crimea and the forces of the same electoral commissions would respond to the greatest degree to the interests of Crimeans -- the expenditures will be reduced essentially to the cost of printing ballots and distributing them to the polls. In view of the aforementioned, I appeal to all voters, citizens' associations, trade union organizations, and labor collectives that have nominated their own representatives to the electoral commissions: Hold meetings with the members of the commissions and give them instructions to support the idea of conducting a poll on 27 March 1994 with the forces of the currently operating electoral commissions. And I ask the members of every electoral commission to accept the decisions at their meetings concerning the participation of the commissions, regardless of the objective difficulties associated with this in the conduct of the poll scheduled for 27 March 1994 of citizens of the Republic of Crimea, about which the appropriate executive committees will issue notices. The source of strength of a president is his unity with the people. Support the idea of an all-Crimean poll, and the achievement of our common goals, although not much, will be closer.
