The day after these remarks, Mas'ud Rowghani-Zanjani, who heads the Plan and Budget Organization, said in an interview: In order to free the country's economy from the recent fluctuations and in view of the drop in the oil income that was to finance infrastructural and development projects in the Second Plan, efforts are being made to find new sources (!) of investment and to increase the prices of services such as electricity, oil products, telecommunications, gas, and so on, and to meet in this way the financial needs for the implementation of infrastructural projects (!). The president's remarks that the reduction in oil prices will not have any impact on our economy and that the country's development projects are not linked with our foreign exchange incomes are surprising, because even the most naive people in the country know that Iran is a single-product country that is extremely dependent on oil. This is so crystal clear that no facts and figures are necessary to prove it. In other words, the president's remarks are a big riddle: How can development projects be completed and infrastructural investments be made without any foreign exchange income? But fortunately the head of the Plan and Budget Organization solved this riddle very quickly in his interview and clarified where the money to be spent is to come from. Of course, Mr. Rowghani-Zanjani did not clarify how new investments will be acquired and what the nature of these investments will be; and apparently there has been no mention of how investments from abroad are to be acquired in the Second Plan either. This comes at a time when the First Plan and the government's economic reform policies have been frustrated basically because of the failure to attract any foreign investment or foreign financial resources. Thus, if we discount his reference to acquiring new resources, we will see that the country's economic development will be paid for from the people's pocket. In other words, the gist of the remarks both by the president and by the head of the Plan and Budget Organization is the old adage that it is easy to be a big spender with other people's money.
