Kooijmans stated that the early return of the visiting Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers was caused by an emerging conflict in the country's parliament. "It has nothing to do with Indonesia. Our country is busy with political campaigns in the run up to a general election. Prime Minister Lubbers' return before scheduled time was due to a conflict between two members of parliament of our country's two coalition parties," he told the press here Wednesday. He was speaking to reporters after signing -- together with Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas -- a memorandum of understanding on the improvement and protection over investments between Indonesia and the Netherlands. The conflict, he said, is very sensitive as it involves two ministers, members of the two coalition parties: Democratic Christian Party and Labour Party. The two ministers took an issue of office and attorney problems. "As the issue is very important, the Dutch parliament's lower house asked the visiting Prime Minister Lubbers to return early to his country. We regret his (Lubbers) returning home before the schedule time," said Kooijmans who will continue his visit as scheduled until Thursday afternoon. Prime Minister Lubbers arrived here on Monday for a four-day official visit until Thursday. He left Jakarta on Wednesday afternoon after visiting the ship industry, PT [Company Limited] Pal in Surabaya and attending the ground breaking ceremony for the development of Philip Ralins plant in the East Java capital city. He said, however, that although Prime Minister Lubbers cut short his visit to Indonesia, the Dutch leader's visit is very important and the two countries' bilateral relations are improving. Minister Kooijmans was scheduled to hold meetings with 15 non-governmental organizations [NGO's] in Jakarta's Dutch Embassy on Thursday. When asked by reporters on the purpose of his meeting with the NGOs, he said that such a meeting has become his tradition every time he make a visit to foreign countries.
