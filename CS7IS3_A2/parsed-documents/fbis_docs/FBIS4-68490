Grigoriadi, V.I. Golovlev, A.L. Kushnar, A.P. Pochinok, and V.P. Utkin, State Duma deputies from Chelyabinsk, addressed to Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin, dated 10 March 1994, under the rubric "It Is Official": "Deputies of the State Duma From Chelyabinsk Ask the President To Appoint a New Head of Administration"] [Text] The press has already reported that Deputies of the State Duma from Chelyabinsk V. Grigoriadi, V. Golovlev, A. Kushnar, A. Pochinok, and V. Utkin have sent a letter to President of Russia B. Yeltsin in which they make a critical assessment of the socioeconomic and public policy situation in the oblast and ask that the issue of appointing a new head of the oblast administration be considered. The deputies have approached the CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY editorial office with a request to familiarize the voters with the full text of their appeal and made it available for publication. To President of the Russian Federation B.N. Yeltsin Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich! All the deputies representing the 4 million inhabitants of Chelyabinsk Oblast in the Federal Assembly are appealing to you. We support the economic transformations you are implementing. Although we belong to different political groups (Russia's Choice, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord), a problem has brought us together which, as we see it, has reached crisis level--the state of affairs in Chelyabinsk Oblast. Since we have a realistic notion of how complex and contradictory the political and economic situation in Russia is, we are convinced that resolution of the main problems associated with the processes of reforms and reinforcement of the Russian state in leading industrial territories, of which Chelyabinsk Oblast is one, would have proceeded more effectively and in keeping with the main bearings and directions you have clearly outlined in the Message to the Federal Assembly Deputies had the executive authorities of regions pursued the course of the president unswervingly and consistently. Owing to the consolidation of progressive forces in Chelyabinsk Oblast, our territory was one of the regions that unconditionally supported the president and the course pursued by him. This is confirmed by the results of voting during the election of the president of the Russian Federation in June 1991 and the referendum in April 1993. Unfortunately the opposite trend has been registered lately: a fall in the rating of the president and his course. Here is proof: --the results of voting on 12 December 1993 (our territory ended up being the only one among the krays and oblasts to not have representatives on the Federation Council); --voting on ratification of the Constitution came close to failing, which gave our political opponents the pretext to call the results of the vote into doubt; --a considerable reinvigoration of oppositionist forces in the region has been registered, primarily the rapid growth of the number of supporters of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia. Abuse of the president's trust is becoming a practice expressed in violations of the law and deliberate failure to carry out the edicts of the president and is creating an environment of irresponsibility and permissiveness. This is confirmed by the findings of a commission of the Central Electoral Commission which operated in February of this year concerning failure to carry out a number of presidential edicts, a letter from Deputy Chairman of the Government A. Chubays (No. ACh-15/942 dated 7 February 1994) concerning violation of the Law "On Privatization of State and Municipal Property in the Russian Federation" and Edicts of the President No. 1231 dated 14 December 1992 and No. 2284 dated 24 December 1993, by the head of the Chelyabinsk Oblast Administration. Besides, social tensions in the oblast are being fueled by the periodically developing scandals associated with the operations of the local authorities and exhibiting a criminal coloring, including those related to issues of foreign economic activities, foodstuffs procurement, uncontrolled disbursement and theft of funds from the budget, and so on. To our mind, all this has resulted from the fact that head of the Oblast Administration V.P. Solovyev has focused all his activities on retaining personal power to the detriment of the direct functions of executive structures. The administration has been afflicted with continuous squabbling and the absence of a genuine program of action for implementation of the president's course. In recent months three first deputy heads of the oblast administration and a number of heads of cities and rayons, who "ventured" to raise the issue of uncontrolled disbursement of the budget and strange connections between the administration and a number of commercial structures, have been dismissed. The head of the oblast administration justifies ostentatious disregard for legislative and regulatory acts, dubious operations involving budget funds, and his arbitrary personnel practices by actions allegedly coordinated with first aide to the president V. Ilyushin, which causes bewilderment and profound doubts and directly discredits the president. We believe that the head of the oblast administration does not meet the requirement for a leader who is capable of consolidating progressive forces of the oblast in order to implement the presidential course of economic and political transformations. Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich! The socioeconomic and public policy situation in the oblast is becoming critical and requires that measures be immediately taken to reinforce executive power and build confidence in it. We ask that you consider the issue of appointing a new head. In the event it is necessary to set up an interdepartmental commission on the situation in the oblast, we ask that deputies from our oblast be included in it. Respectfully, [Signed] V.S. Grigoriadi (district 182) V.I. Golovlev (district 183) A.L. Kushnar (district 184) A.P. Pochinok (district 185) V.P. Utkin (district 186) 10 March 1994
