Among the coalition parties, the SDPJ is in the unique position of being the only party with connections to North Korea, through the Workers Party of Korea [WPK], and it wants to probe for a "dialogue-based" way of resolving the issue in meetings with Chinese officials. The mission will also conduct advance consultations on party General Secretary Wataru Kubo's visit to China in May. Kazou Watanabe, director of the party's General Affairs Bureau, and Hajime Fukada, director of its Organization Bureau, are other members of the mission, and they are due to meet with such key Chinese officials as Liu Shuzheng, head of the CPC International Liaison Department, and Zhu Liang, former head of the department. When the SDPJ met, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama spoke about the tense situation over the nuclear inspection issue on 22 March, and emphasized the importance of dialogue, saying, "We should refrain from immediate economic sanctions, and should try to resolve the mater through dialogue." At the party planning conference held the same day, the view emerged that "the government should continue efforts to find a breakthrough in the situation by resuming Japan-DRPK talks" and "Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to China with sanctions against North Korea in mind is a de-facto failure." Meanwhile, on 23 March, Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation [Rengo], urged the SDPJ to make diplomatic efforts, and expressed the hope that Murayama "will work on North Korea -- through the WPK -- to accept international opinions." The SDPJ is expected to confirm, at a meeting of the Central Executive Committee on 24 March, that it wants to work with the other coalition member parties to resolve the issue through dialogue.
