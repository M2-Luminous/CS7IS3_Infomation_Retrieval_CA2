The deputy minister for science, technology, and environment, Pricha Musikun, made the request at an informal meeting on trade and the environment in Geneva, Switzerland, attended by more than 20 nations. The gathering was organized as a brainstorming session ahead of the signing of the new Uruguay GATT agreement in April. Thailand and Malaysia attended the meeting as representatives of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN. Mr. Pricha said developed nations should not make environmental demands as part of any trade negotiations with developing countries. He said it is important that all nations be allowed to develop at their own pace.
