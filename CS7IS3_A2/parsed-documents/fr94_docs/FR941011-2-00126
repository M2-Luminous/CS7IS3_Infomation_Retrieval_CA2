I. Description of the Proposals MCC and MSTC are modifying their By-Laws and Rules to define their participants' rights and obligations more precisely and to give MCC and MSTC more flexibility and protection in dealing with violations of their rules. 8 MCC and MSTC are adding new sections to their By-Laws to authorize MCC and MSTC to establish additional committees as may be provided for in the By-Laws or Rules or may be established by their boards of directors. Such committees shall have the duties and authority as prescribed for them by the By-Laws, the Rules, or the boards. 8 The Commission recently approved the proposed rule filing of the Chicago Stock Exchange, the parent corporation of MCC and MSTC, which contained many of the same amendments proposed in the subject filings by MCC and MSTC. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34505 (August 9, 1994), 59 FR 42802. MCC and MSTC are amending their Rules to provide for the establishment of risk assessment committees. Each risk assessment committee will consist of four members. The risk assessment committees shall have such duties as may be assigned to them by MCC's or MSTC's Rules or by their boards. Among other duties of the risk assessment committees, the amendments require MCC and MSTC to consult with at least one member of their respective risk assessment committee before ceasing to act for a participant. 9 Three members of the risk assessment committees will hear all appeals of MCC and MSTC decisions to deny application for membership or to cease to act for a participant. Previously, MCC and MSTC Rules required the boards to appoint a panel to hear such appeals. 10 9 The purpose of the required consultation is to help ensure that the managements of MCC and MSTC have independent input to assist them in their decision making processes. 10 The amendments prohibit the member of the risk assessment committees who was consulted from participating in the hearing of any related appeal. MCC and MSTC By-Laws already provide that any member of one of the risk assessment committees (previously the board-appointed committees) that has any direct or indirect interest in a matter on appeal which might preclude such member from rendering an objective and impartial determination shall not hear such appeal. MCC and MSTC are adding provisions to their Rules to adopt formal standards of review for the hearing of appeals beyond the risk assessment committees. The new standards provide that the decisions of the risk assessment committees cannot be reversed, modified, or remanded by the boards if the factual conclusions in the risk assessment committees' decisions are supported by substantial evidence and if such decisions are not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.
