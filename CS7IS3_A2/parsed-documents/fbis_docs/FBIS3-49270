It is mainly the Czechs who did not want the meeting to be granted such a status. The Poles and Hungarians are losing hope. President Clinton will arrive for the Prague meeting straight from the NATO summit in Brussels. The only event to underline the regional nature of this meeting will be a two-hour working lunch on 12 January, attended by the five presidents. "It was clear form the very outset that there would be four meetings with the U.S. President, independent of each other," said Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who announced that the Czechs are accepting the U.S. "Partnership for Peace" proposal. He expressed surprise about speculation that the Czech Republic was opposing joint talks by the Visegrad heads of state with Clinton. A high-ranking Foreign Ministry official even told me that the era of joint Visegrad action was over. The "Partnership for Peace" proposal calls for independent action, and that is why Prague finds it attractive. Yesterday, Vaclav Klaus said that during Clinton's visit there would be bilateral talks by the Visegrad prime ministers, and after the U.S. guest's departure each of the three hosts would treat his opposite numbers to supper. The presidents will eat at the Hradschin, the prime ministers at the Liechtenstein Palace (seat of the government), and the foreign ministers at the Czernin Palace (seat of the Foreign Ministry). Care has been taken to exclude the risk of any joint stance being formulated. The reaction from Warsaw has been unexpectedly calm. "We will not force our will on the rest," a senior Polish official told me. "Perhaps the Visegrad Group is not in Poland's interests." Only President Walesa's spokesman, Andrzej Drzycimski, has made any attempt to assuage anxieties, saying that consultations were being held both with the United States and the Czech Republic. In his opinion, the Belvedere is still doing all it can to prevent more than one speech on behalf of the Visegrad Group at the joint Prague lunch, instead of four separate speeches. Slovak President Michal Kovac said yesterday that on Tuesday, President Walesa had suggested to him and the other Visegrad presidents the submission to President Clinton of a joint proposal for Visegrad integration with NATO. Kovac agreed. The Hungarians as well. But the Czechs did not. Yesterday, Vice Foreign Minister Andrzej Ananicz created the impression that he had no faith in a Visegrad-Clinton meeting. "One cannot imagine what a joint talk between five presidents would look like. As it is, each of them will have one hour in which to talk to the Americans," he said. One of our interlocutors, talking about the three lunches to be held following Clinton's departure, said: "These might be the farewell lunches of Visegrad."
