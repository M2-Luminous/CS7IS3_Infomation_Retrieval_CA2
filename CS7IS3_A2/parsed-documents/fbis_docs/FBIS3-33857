According to the news agency, the objective of the air attack was to completely destroy the Zeli Camp, in which 1,600 Kurdish opponents of the Turkish Government were sheltered. Considering the fact that, in the past, Turkish aircraft had hit targets up to 20 km into northern Iraq at most, this was the first time they penetrated to bomb positions of the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] deep inside northern Iraq. Referring to the latest operations against the PKK, Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said: As far as the struggle waged against the PKK is concerned, 1994 is an important year. Political observers believe that Ankara has launched a new phase in Turkey's operations against the PKK militants. Although, similar operations were carried out against the PKK in the past, Ankara's move to intensify the Turkish cross-border operations indicates that it is mostly worried by the developments in northern Iraq. However, several political observers are convinced that Ankara is more worried about the overt and covert policies of the European countries. They are also convinced that the fact that European countries give support to the Kurds in Iraq while remaining indifferent to the Turkish Government's suppression of the Kurds in Turkey accords with the policies of those Western Governments. The same observers believe that, considering the fact that the United States and the European countries act according to their own political interests, the Turkish officials are seeking several guarantees from the Western countries. The banning of the PKK's activities by the Bonn and Paris governments is regarded as in accord with Ankara's wishes. However, the Turkish officials are still believed to be worried by the activities of the Kurds, who are opposed to the Turkish and Iraqi Governments. Considering this state of affairs, several political observers are convinced that the Ankara Government's military moves against the Kurds will not be successful. Therefore, they believe that political talks will be the most effective means of resolving the PKK problem. Undoubtedly, the Turkish Government's cross-border operations against northern Iraq violate the territorial integrity of Iraq, which is an independent country. Furthermore, if such operations continue, they may harm security and stability in the region. In view of this, the settlement of the problems in the region through cooperation among the regional countries without foreign interference would promote security in the region.
