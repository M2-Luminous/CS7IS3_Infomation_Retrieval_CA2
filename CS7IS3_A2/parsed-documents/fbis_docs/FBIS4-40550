[Begin Moyiseyev recording] We believe the draft resolution -- and this does not necessary have to be a joint resolution, it could be an agreed resolution -- should first consider inviting Pyongyang -- not just Pyongyang alone but other countries mentioned in our proposal -- for an international conference aimed at finding a solution to the problems of the Korean peninsula as a whole. And if this conference fails to achieve any positive results and after all other political methods of solving the Korean nuclear problem are tried and failed, only then can step-by-step sanctions be applied.
