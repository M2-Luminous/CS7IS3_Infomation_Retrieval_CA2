Recalling that the UNPROFOR mandate [in Croatia] was expiring at the end of this month, Tudjman said Croatia would not agree to renew the mandate under present conditions. He emphasized that UNPROFOR supervision in the protected areas was insufficient, the best proof of which was the latest incident involving the downing of Serb aircraft which took off from protected areas in the Republic of Croatia. Special Envoy Akashi said the UN secretary general would inform the Security Council about the implementation of UNPROFOR's mandate in Croatia by the end of the month. Speaking about the Croat-Muslim Washington agreement, President Tudjman said the entire geopolitical situation has changed as a result of this and international and Croatian efforts would now be directed towards the solving of the problem of the reintegration of protected areas into the constitutional and legal system of the country. In conclusion, President Tudjman stressed that the problem no longer lies in the territorial settlement between the three nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but that a division between East and West has now surfaced, whose interests have always clashed in this area, the president's office has announced.
