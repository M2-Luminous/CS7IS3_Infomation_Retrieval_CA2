FR940822-0-00041 FR940822-0-00013 The remainder of the January 1993 rule is unchanged and is effective on August 18, 1994. III. Regulatory Impact Statement We generally prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, we consider all Medicaid providers as small entities. Individuals and States are not included in the definition of a small entity. In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any rule that may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 50 beds that is located outside a metropolitan statistical area. This final rule revises the January 19, 1993, final rule with comment period. We have decided to withdraw the second part of that rule which basically codified a mandatory budgetary method for determining financial eligibility for AFDC-related non-cash assistance individuals. We concluded, along with a number of other entities, that this provision would result in significant administrative costs. The mandatory budget method has, therefore, been withdrawn. This final rule will take effect on August 18, 1994. We believe that the withdrawal of the referenced regulations minimizes any unnecessary burden on the public, and that the best regulatory options have been selected. Further, we believe that these regulations will not lead to increased costs. Therefore, we have determined that these provisions will have a negligible cost effect and that a regulatory impact analysis is not required. We have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and will not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. For these reasons, we are not preparing analyses for either RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act. This final rule does not contain information collection requirements; therefore, it is not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this final rule was reviewed by OMB.
