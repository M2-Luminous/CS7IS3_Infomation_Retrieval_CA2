Prayers and peace be upon the noblest of messengers. Ladies and gentlemen: We are meeting here today at the national consensus conference to continue the dialogue which we started in September 1992. We are hoping that dialogue at this conference will reach its desired goal; that is, the removal of the country from the current crisis in order that normal life, tranquillity, and peace may return to Algeria, which will then be able to continue its development process in an atmosphere of security. My Lord, make this land secure [Koranic verse]. I am sure that this is the expectation and the yearning of all Algerians who are placing their hopes in our conference. Hence, it is our duty to rise to our responsibility and deliver what is required. Ladies and gentlemen, the Higher State Council [HCE] has shouldered its responsibilities during a very difficult stage. [Words indistinct] it has to face up to a complicated and critical situation which resulted from the poor management of the transition to democracy brought about by the Constitution of February 1989. This laid down a new political system for building the state, for the management of the country, and for the organization of the political society. This was in addition to the roots of the crisis which led to the tragic October events and the elements of which continued in existence. The absence of control over the new political system led to the haphazard application of the Constitution, which made the situation more critical. The organization of the election contest, whether at the local or the national level, showed the fragility of the administration and the state structures, leading us to chaos. The logic of the street overcame the logic of the state and opened the way to all possible pitfalls. All this led to the crisis of the establishments resulting from the resignation of the head of state by the end of the term of office of the People's National Council. This required the setting up of the HCE with the aim of guaranteeing the continuation of the state and completing the remaining legislative term. The urgent and circumstantial conditions that the HCE faced and the critical situation that existed then did not make the HCE cut short its task by merely covering the constitutional vacuum. It had to address the real problems of the country, clarify views with the political, economic, and social partners as well as the national cadres, search for ways of liquidating the crisis at its roots, and prepare the conditions for the creation of a qualitative transformation in the country's march. We found ourselves facing a political crisis which had resulted from a lack of control over the transition process, the strong and active presence of elements and practices of the previous regime, as well as the ossified mentalities which fear and reject change. We were also facing an economic crisis, the main features of which were heavy debts, stagnant economic growth, and inefficient enterprises in addition to smuggling and speculation which are bidding to dominate the markets. We were also facing an acute social crisis represented in the great delay in any response to the needs of the population, particularly in the spheres of employment and housing; this has been a cause of concern to young people and has led to a loss of confidence in the future. While we were facing this multifaceted crisis, the tragic assassination of the martyr Mohamed Boudiaf, may God bless his soul, took place. He was one of the prominent leaders of the 1 November revolution who gave his life for the sake of our dear homeland's advancement. [passage omitted] With that tragedy there was an escalation of savage terrorism, destructive to the country's material, human, and moral resources and aimed at blocking the path to any real effort to find effective solutions to the complex problems we are facing. Terrorism has created a security situation that is threatening the nation's unity and destiny. This tragic situation did not discourage the HCE from going ahead with dealing with the crisis at its roots. The HCE initiated a wide and comprehensive dialogue with political parties, popular organizations, associations, and national figures. The option was neither circumstantial nor tactical; it was a strategic option and a cautious attitude toward political practice, running the government, and organizing social relations. We were aware from the outset that dialogue was the more difficult path to take, but it was the right path to deal with the roots of the crisis and prevent its repetition. Serious and difficult dialogue requires patience and stamina, enabling us to instill the concepts and culture of dialogue and overcome violent methods in every field of social and political activity. Dialogue was very difficult in an atmosphere of violence and terror, which was destructive, and in a difficult security situation. It required us to leave the concept of a single party and monopoly behind and enter the era of pluralism which dictates, by its very nature, the acceptance of conflicting and contradicting ideas and proposals. Despite the will and the determination of the HCE to make the national dialogue successful and allow it to attain its sought after aims, however, some parties, with much regret, have taken a negative attitude toward the dialogue; they have even boycotted the conference. By such a stance, they are trying to make the nation miss a golden opportunity. They have put their narrow partisan calculations, even personal ones, before the interests of the nation. Such a stance runs counter to the concept of democracy we have been trying to implement. In these decisive circumstances in the history of the nation, we place the responsibility before national public opinion, which is aspiring to security and stability. Despite all of this we continued the dialogue with insistence and methodology. And here we are meeting today, thanks to that conduct, in a national conference for reconciliation. This in itself is a great acheivement we should cherish and take care of. In the midst of the economic crisis and its pressing elements, while the critical economic situation was imposing itself forcefully and urgently, and after extensive studies and wide consultations, the HCE had furnished the tools that enable our economy to rise again on modern bases and criteria. It passed the new investment law which is characterised by flexibility, encouragement, and adequate guarantees for national and foreign investment. In response to economic and social partners, the HCE issued a law on the setting up of a national economic and social council as an extensive and appropriate framework for consultations on and dealing with various issues posed by national development during a phase of transition to a new economic system, taking into consideration the principle of social justice and the state of the underprivileged groups in society. It made the appropriate decisions regarding the management of debts with international financial institutions and the provision of fresh possibilities to stimulate the national economy. [passage omitted] In the international domain, and proceeding from this promising starting point, we have taken part in all important regional and international meetings. We have resisted the attempts to isolate our country which were made by some parties who exploited the temporary crisis through which the country is passing. The pressure of events and the impetuous reactions and passions which they generate have not diverted the HCE from exerting the efforts necessary to overcome the present difficulties and from searching for a new proposal for running the country on scientific, technological, rational, and modern foundations. The transition to this new proposal makes it necessary for sincere patriots to face up to the basic challenges and all the exertions, patience, courage, creative thought, and working methods that they demand. We have been able to face up to the situation by mobilizing the dynamic forces of the country and sincere citizens. On this occasion, we pay our respects to the martyrs of violence and terrorism and we praise the Armed Forces, the security services, the cadres, the workers, and the citizens who are determined that the state will continue and that institutions and the country's affairs will go on as normal. Ladies and gentlemen: Regardless of what is being said about the present situation and notwithstanding the difficulties facing us, the current problems are more than just problems of the power struggle; they are in reality problems of a society in transformation, a society that greatly aspires to qualitative changes and to a comprehensive development -- a society which ought to reconsider itself in order to find the best means for organizing its life and bring about progress and prosperity to its members. This shows that the crisis is not an easy one; it also shows the enormity of the efforts which have to be exerted in order to resolve it. However, such a solution will not be found through a decree, through some improvised measures, or during a short period, nor will it be within the power of a single group or bloc; it should be carried out by the nation as a whole. It will not be attained through a comprehensive and long-term strategy. It is, however, obvious that such a solution will, inevitably, only take place once institutional problems have been resolved through the holding of multiparty presidential and legislative elections within the framework of the new political framework which we have been trying to establish upon the principles of republicanism. These principles which have unanimously been agreed upon, and stipulate pluralism, freedom of the press, individual and collective freedoms, human rights, and the alternatn of the principle of power by holding general elections. The organizing of the election contest on these bases and principles is the method which leads to the solving of the institutional problem, and this is the target of the transitional phase which has become acceptable by way of dialogue as means for reaching a national consensus. In order to succeed in this experiment and build the new political system it is inevitable that we should confront the following challenges: 1. Our capability to overcome the security challenge, as without the liquidation of violence, the restoration of security, and the country's stability, it is impossible to realize democracy no matter what efforts we make, irrespective of our intentions. 2. As for the building of a modern strong state, how can we build the state and give it its status and at the same time consolidate democracy? The state is a system and a collection of behavior patterns and values. Also democracy, the building of a democratic system cannot be done in a fragile state, nor the building of a strong developed state without a democratic system. 3. How can we build democracy and realize the development project? There can be no development without democracy which permits the full usage of the nation's energies and capabilities. There can be no democracy in deteriorating economic and social situations. 4. Our initiative in building a democratic system and a developed generation deeply rooted in the nation, and infiltrating the values and identity of our people, is a system which will not be isolated from positive international experiments. This means that we create the change which is imposed by the transformation currently taking place at the national and international levels, boycott the past methods and practices, and at the same time maintain our foundations, experience, and historic origin. 5. Define, establish and consolidate Algeria's position in the new world order which is about to take shape amid the ongoing stormy changes and ways of enabling it to assume its normal role as an active and effective state at the international level. This requires response to all the challenges. It would be possible to build our own special and creative experience through these challenges in the framework of the development of modern human experiences. Success will not be a gain only for Algerians; the same as the great 1 November revolution, it will be a gain for all the peoples aspiring to freedom. It is neither our right nor anyone else's right to be the reason for depriving the Algerian people of achieving this pioneering experience. Ladies and gentlemen, the building of the political system which we are endeavoring to construct and the overcoming of the challenges we are facing constitute a basis for the evolving national project [mashru'] to the building of which all Algerians are contributing. The national project draws its strength and its principles from the spirit of the evolving 1 November revolution. It is certain that our success in moving to the new political system and in establishing a successful democracy in security, prosperity, and stability is a fresh rebirth or a rebirth and a renewal of the 1 November eternal revolution. Ladies and gentlemen, all the difficulties not withstanding, the Algerians are against adventurism and violence. They are capable of conducting dialogue and living in security in the shadow of national unity. They are committed to their faith and tradition, and are open to the outside world. They are heading with confidence towards the future. Today at this conference we all have to rise to the level of our historic responsibility and leave behind personal and temporary accounts regardless of their justifications. We have to work with a unified and profound will to get the country out of the current situation and take it to the land of safety. All of us bear full responsibility in that respect. The conference is not the end of dialogue. The dialogue will continue in all forms and with the spirit of honesty, credibility, and responsibility. We have to firmly establish the principles of dialogue, consultation, and solidarity and to eliminate once and for all all manifestations of violence which are alien to our society, religion, and homeland and sow the seeds of hope. We have no right to deny the Algerians males and females this hope. May God guide us toward the good of our nation and the unity and safety of our homeland and may peace and God's compassion and blessings be upon you.
