The tragic Haitian crisis has gone through many phases. While the needs and suffering of thousands of people are reaching a critical stage, the different options attempting to force the military from power have not caused them to relinquish the positions they took by force. Those who claim that Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, has been reduced to the status of an economic outcast due to the all-out trade blockade imposed last year by the UN Security Council are not exaggerating. That measure was added to the blockade of fuel shipments taken in October 1993 -- the only measure the international community found to oppose the resistance of the military regime that has refused to allow the return of deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. It should be noted that, in addition to taking power by force, the Haitian military is as, or perhaps even more, savagely repressive than the Duvalier dictatorship. They have proved to be liars and have not kept their word because they broke an agreement signed in July 1993 in New York in which they promised to return control of the country to deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. While the human rights situation in Haiti grows worse and repression reaches frightening levels, Haitians must also endure power and water shortages and watch the price of medicines -- when they are available -- go sky high. But the coupists turn their back upon this harsh reality. They continue to travel in lavish automobiles that are air-conditioned to counter the tropical heat. Despite all the measures taken against them, the Haitian military has not shown signs of fearing any of the consequences, not even when faced with rumors of an impending invasion by foreign troops -- an argument that has gathered strength in the last few days as an extreme option to try to settle the crisis. It must be said, however, that far from being a solution, the use of troops in Haiti would worsen the crisis. An invasion, regardless of how it is accomplished, represents a form of trampling on the rights of a people and a very serious attack on a country's sovereignty. [Words indistinct] as in the case of Panama. The interference in the internal affairs of a country would be a tacit admission of failure to reach a peaceful solution. Perhaps the astute Haitian soldiers are taking this into account and that is why they continue to defy the international community, which in any event must continue its attempts to make this coupist group, which is also accused of drug trafficking and illegal enrichment, come to its senses. At the recent opening of the 24th OAS Conference in Belem, Para State, Brazil, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide said quick, determined action must be taken to remove the coupists from power in keeping with the Governors Island Agreement signed in July 1993. While this issue is being debated within the OAS, OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares urged the use of peaceful means to solve the Haitian crisis and said that, even though these peace efforts might be very difficult, it will always be better than fostering a foreign invasion, which would set a terrible precedent.
