Votes in the parliament split 35:4 with 12 abstentions. Until now, Estonia did not pay compensation for property that was illegally expropriated at territories that under 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty between Estonia and Russia belong to Estonia, but are now under Russian jurisdiction, Liia Hanni, the Minister of Reform, said. Under Estonian ownership reform law, properties that lie in Petserimaa and across Narva river will be assessed by land commissions of Viru and Ida-Viru counties respectively.
