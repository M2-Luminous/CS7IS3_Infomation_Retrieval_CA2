"My opinion is that the agreement as a whole gives Finland possibilities for development," he says, at the same time as he points out that, as in all agreements, there are compromises involved. In addition to all the principles, it is a matter of a fierce struggle for jobs, as to which countries attract industrial activity, he concludes. Now he only hopes that it will be possible to avoid a long political quarrel about the domestic part, something that would only prolong industry's period of uncertainty. Mattsson therefore rejects Member of Parliament Paavo Vayrynen's proposal to postpone the EU membership. "That does not improve anything. I am of the opinion that our EU negotiations have been handled well. Always, when you approach the end, the whole must have precedence over the parts." Mattsson describes the EU agreement as acceptable for his own company, Cultor AB, as well, despite the fact that the lowered sugar quota was a blow. Lower Volume Threatens Sugar Refineries From Cultor's point of view, Finland's sugar quota was one of the three important parts of the EU agreements. The decrease of about 10,000 tons from 144,000 plus 14,000 tons to 133,000 plus 13,000 destroys the previous adjustment regarding productivity and margins and threatens the existence of one of the group's three sugar refineries. It is said that 10,000 tons of sugar is the equivalent of about 100,000 sugar beets and a cultivated area of about 2,500 hectares. "Now the question is how, with a lower volume, it will be possible to achieve the previous productivity," says Mattsson. The other two important parts of the EU agreements concern grain production in Finland and Sweden and the export of fish from Norway to Europe. What Norway achieved in the matter of fishing means that Cultor's fodder production in that sector can continue as before, at the same time as EU provides greater stability. The grain production in Finland and Sweden also gives the company's fodder production reasonable opportunities, particularly since one has to come down to European grain prices right away. But one precondition for a promising fodder industry is that the meat and dairy sector maintain their positions, the head of Cultor states. Part of the domestic adjustment is to decide on how to handle inventories of raw materials bought before joining the EU. Here the government's grain inventory is the central matter -- but it is obvious that all companies are now striving to minimize their inventories and plan them in detail. One problem is that the EU does not know about such a thing as the primary product subsidy that Finland now has, which reduces the consumer price for meat and milk, for example. In order to compensate for that loss, the value-added tax on food must be lowered to 10 percent in this phase. In 1997 the value-added tax on food in the EU must be coordinated at 5 percent. Certain Demands Met -- Others Not On behalf of the entire food industry, Mattsson states that a part of the demands were granted, but for milk, meat, and vegetables, for example, one did not get the period of adjustment that had been sought. Now it is important for people at the company level to review their possibilities. In any case, Mattsson points out that in the EU there is money that, supplemented by domestic support, can be granted to the food industry for adjustment to the new market situation. Harsh conditions are tied to the subsidy, that, among other things, must not distort competition. The authorities will first make an industry evaluation and then distribute the subsidies, both the one from the EU and the domestic one. In one and the same industry there might be companies that need support and those that do not. "I want to call this a type of debt reorganization; it must be a serious matter for the company," Mattsson says. Cultor will not apply for any subsidy. The company has long prepared itself for the agreement that was completed yesterday, the concentration on core areas has been achieved, and the productivity is in order. "Our productivity is at the European level and our goal is to manage by ourselves," says Mattsson. Labor Conflict Frustrating Mattsson today regards as much more serious than the EU agreement the labor conflict that the food industry has just suffered through, "in a situation where a part of our industry was fighting for its life," as he expresses it. "Wage demands were put forward that were twice as high as within the export industry, in a situation where the parties had a common view of the declining employment capability in the food industry, and they were aware that we are facing a painful structural change," Mattsson says. He wonders whether one could call the system of negotiation bankrupt, that one negotiated for months in order then to reject both the national arbitrator's and the arbitration commission's unanimous proposals. According to the chairman of the food industry, working conditions will now have to be accomplished such that the employees feel loyalty toward their companies, which then also increase their influence. The other, and worse alternative, according to Mattsson, is a system similar to the one in Norway, with forced arbitration of some sort. "We felt frustrated over the situation that occurred," says Mattsson. What he is now hoping for is genuine cooperation.
