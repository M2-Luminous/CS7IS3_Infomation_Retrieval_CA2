If the current excessive exploitation of such resources continued, the shortage of natural resources would further restrict the national economy in the next century. According to Mr. Wang, China can be called a big country of natural resources, but at the same time it was a small country in this sector when such resources were calculated based on per capita possession with its per capita water resources accounting for only one-eighth of the world average. Owing to imperfections of legislation, the destructive exploitation of natural resources was rampant in many places in the country. The panning of gold, for example, achieved a mere ten percent exploitation rate in some places, resulting in great losses. Mr. Wang said that small-sized coalpits accounted for 30 to 40 percent of the total number in the country, leading not only to a low rate of exploitation and usage but also frequent accidents. He warned that if there was no improvement in its exploitation of coal, China would face a serious shortage of such resources by the year 2005, though the country now ranked among the leading countries in the world in terms of coal reserves. According to this expert, China has 70 to 80 percent of the proven rare-earth reserves in the world. He criticized Guangdong, Guangxi and Jiangxi, which are rich in this mineral, for their mismanagement of exploitation of these natural deposits and for their devaluing the export prices of these minerals against each other among themselves with rare-earth prices dropping to RMB 40,000 per tonne from RMB 80,000 per tonne one year ago. Mr. Wang called on all parties concerned to pay greater attention to the protection and proper use of the limited mineral resources in the country, saying that the resources issue should be considered a basic national policy such as the population and environment issues.
