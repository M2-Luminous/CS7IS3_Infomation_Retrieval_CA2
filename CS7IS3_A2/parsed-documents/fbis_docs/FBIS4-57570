Escovar spoke at length with reporters after a Council of Ministers meeting on 18 May. [passage omitted] As Venezuelans we should be pleased that the country's institutions behaved in the way they have, that it is possible to try a president, that we can hold public officials accountable for their actions, and that the Constitution is not an insignificant book in practical life, but a set of rules that have a bearing on the country's life. What has transpired is not an act of revenge or persecution against a president, but the result of formal charges filed by a prosecutor general and a formal and concrete ruling by the CSJ [Supreme Court of Justice]. I have nothing more to add; I only want to urge people who sympathize with the former president to act responsibly and to spare the country from actions that might stem from an accumulation of feelings of revenge and also spare the country from the use of violence, because neither is in keeping with the serenity shown by the institutions. Calls to settle accounts with all those involved in this trial are absolutely irreconcilable with the country's dignity and the strength of Venezuelan democratic institutions. I want to talk to them calmly, because apparently there are already voices that are trying to distort the court ruling and this exemplary process that the Venezuelan people have accepted as their own and that democrats of Latin America and the world view as a reflection of the strength of Venezuelan institutions.
