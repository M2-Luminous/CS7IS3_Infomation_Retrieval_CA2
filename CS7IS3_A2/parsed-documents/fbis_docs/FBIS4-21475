How unsafe will the development of nuclear power plants be? The Chernobyl tragedy is still our current problem, it has not fallen into oblivion. We asked Minister of Environmental Protection Yuriy Kostenko to comment on this issue. Kostenko: First, I state that this presidential edict was adopted without any cooperation with the ministries and departments -- the Ministries of Health and Environmental Protection, the State Committee for Problems of Consequences of the Chernobyl Catastrophe, and the State Committee for Control Over Nuclear Power Industry -- which are responsible for the state of the nuclear, radiological, and ecological safety. This edict is a vivid example of how the executive power -- our president -- violates the Ukrainian legislation and is under the nuclear lobby's thumb. The edict itself is absolutely inexpedient from both economical and ecological viewpoints. I will begin with the economy. A lot is being written and said about the nuclear power industry being much cheaper than the electric one. As practice shows, electrical energy produced by the U. S. nuclear power plants is 1.5 times more expensive than the energy produced by thermal power stations. Why? For the first thing, high demands concerning nuclear safety considerably increase the costs and main expenses. For the second thing, companies which own nuclear power plants participate in special funds for establishing nuclear waste sites. For the third thing, each nuclear plant should be closed down and neutralized after having worked to the end of its operating life. To implement these conditions, a special fund should be established which will have to include tariffs for electric energy costs. Finally, any state which has nuclear power plants should establish a national nuclear waste site which is an extremely expensive undertaking. In the United States, costs for carrying out scientific research for drafting criteria for establishing such waste sites stood at over $1.5 billion, while building costs of the nuclear waste site were estimated at more than $6 billion. One more important point. According to the concept of the development of the nuclear power industry in Ukraine, we are planning to begin using ``KANDU'' nuclear reactors produced in Canada. They are safer than Russian ones. In addition, they can use the natural uranium and we can stop buying the concentrated uranium in Russia. Why should we build imperfect reactors? Is this advantageous for someone? Oksanchuk: However, deliveries of Russian nuclear fuel to Ukraine is one of the conditions for our disarmament, one of the provisions of a tripartite Moscow agreement. Currently, only we are keeping to this agreement.... Kostenko: This is the thing. Though, we have delivered 120 warheads to Russia, we are still waiting for Russian deliveries of the concentrated uranium. When the Supreme Soviet discussed disarmament issues, the matter of establishing a joint enterprise for dismantling armaments and the further use of the concentrated uranium for the nuclear power industry was raised. This would have been more advantageous for Ukraine than obtaining nuclear fuel from Russia. For example, the costs of an enterprise -- which ``General Electric'' promised to build with us -- to dismantle ammunition and transform the highly concentrated uranium to the low concentrated variety would have stood at $25-35 billion. The United States' financial support for our disarmament could have been used for this purpose. Therefore, it would have cost nothing for Ukraine to set up such a joint enterprise. If the Ukrainian nuclear power industry begins operating ``KANDU'' reactors, we will have enough nuclear fuel -- extracted from warheads -- for over 150-200 years. Currently, we give back everything and receive only partial compensation which will cover our demands for only three-five years. In my opinion, no economic crisis can justify the operation of the second Chernobyl reactor. God forbid the next accident! Otherwise, this portion of the Ukrainian soil will forever become a radiological cemetery. In Zaporozhie, where the sixth nuclear reactor will be put into operation soon, the nuclear power plant is located close to the thermal electric plant. Discharges from the thermal electric plant mix with an enormous quantity of steam discharged from the nuclear power plant and cause oxide rains. This region which is very important in the production of agricultural products is experiencing a serious ecological crisis because oxide rains devastate everything. It is necessary to estimate what is cheaper: operating a nuclear plant or producing high quality agricultural products. The Rovno nuclear power plant was probably built on karstenite cavities. Expenses to underpin the foundation of this nuclear plant have already exceeded the planned expenses of this site by 40 percent. The aforementioned presidential edict also includes a clause which foresees putting into operation a new block at the South Ukrainian nuclear power plant. To put it into operation, a big reservoir should be built because the low water in the Yuzhnyy Bug River does not allow the effective cooling of the reactor. This reservoir will cover large territories. This situation has already been discussed twice by sessions of ecological experts: The first one was held in the time of the former USSR; the second one -- recently, by our ministry. Both inspections stated the inexpediency of setting up one more reservoir because picturesque landscapes will be covered with water and the ecological balance will be disturbed. In general, all this can lead to the death of the river. The situation will likely resemble that of the Dnieper cascade, where reservoirs turned into stinking bogs. Therefore, I state that the implementation of this edict will have one result: Ukraine will be economically ruined and the ecological situation in the Republic will be greatly aggravated; if we continue operating our nuclear power plants, the consequences can become really unpredictable. Oksanchuk: You opposed and are opposing our president. However, I will vote for you and my next question is as follows: If my Supreme Council candidate cannot do anything now when he is a minister, what will he do in the Supreme Council? Kostenko: I am sincere: I owe everything that I have done within the ministry only to my deputy status. I have always opposed antiecological decisions. (A minister who opposes the government is not welcome there.) Do you remember the situation when Lanovyy began opposing the president, and was immediately dismissed? I used my deputy status to oppose the passing of the antiecological law by the government. However, there are limits to everything. Currently, it is difficult to speak about any results when the state management of the environmental protection branch has not undergone any reforms. Reforms will be possible when the Supreme Council adopts corresponding decisions. Therefore, I am running in the elections because the office of the minister does not enable me to proceed with ecological reforms. I am pinning my hopes on the new Supreme Council which -- if our people make the appropriate choice -- will first and foremost think about the future strong and independent Ukraine with clean fresh winds and water, green forests, and a healthy population.
