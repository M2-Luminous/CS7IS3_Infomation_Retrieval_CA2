Marketing agricultural commodities from North Sulawesi to Mindanao will be easier, according to Minister for Trade and Industry Hartarto, and transportation cost for exports to Japan and South Korea will be reduced because of the accessiblity of the northern sea lanes instead of going through the traditional route of the Strait of Malacca or Singapore. Minister Hartarto stated that EAGA may eventually even serve as a gateway for trade in Asia and the Pacific region. Hartarto added that the government will establish incentives to encourage businessmen to develop the area, and local governments will be given full authority to work with the private sector.
