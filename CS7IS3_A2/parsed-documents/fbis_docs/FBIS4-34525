Organized by the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie), which includes most of the Indian groups, the Indians are strictly carrying out a "great protest mobilization for life" to demand the repeal of a new agrarian law approved by the Executive and Legislative Branches. The Indians charge that the law is unconstitutional. A source from the organization told AFP today that on Thursday the Indians of the Amazon region began taking control of the facilities for four petroleum wells managed by the Elf Hydrocarbures company of France and the Ecuadoran State Petroleum Enterprise. The provinces through which the Andes mountain range crosses have been cut off from each other because the main highways have been blocked. Hundreds of Conaie members armed with work tools such as machetes and picks occupied the roads, which they are not leaving for any reason despite the presence, until now peaceful, of troops and policemen. Nevertheless, the unrest got worse yesterday when Indians looted stores and the public market of the city of Canar, in the Andean province of the same name. This action provoked a reaction from merchants. Approximately 20 Indians and merchants were injured in the violent clashes, during which weapons appeared. Segundo Serrano, mayor of Azogues, the capital of Canar, told AFP by telephone that in the violence an Indian died from blows to the head. This has been officially confirmed by authorities. He added that, according to reports from Indian leader Jose Guaman, the merchants burned a community house and that the bodies of at least three Indians were found among the rubble. This has yet to be confirmed. "The situation was on the verge of getting even worse when the Canar Indians tried to start a fire in a fuel distribution facility in the city of Canar," Serrano added. He indicated that the city awoke today under the military control of Army troops, which were urgently deployed to the site to try to retake control and prevent more violence. "The people of Canar are living tense times. There is great fear in the center of the city, which only has five policemen," he said. The mayor also said the Indians have reportedly threatened to come down from the mountains to burn the city. Meanwhile, Conaie Vice President Rafael Pandam told AFP that another Indian was killed on Thursday in Tungurahua Province (in southern Ecuador) during the protests. He said the Indians will "oppose to the death" the agrarian law because it harms their interests and demands. As an example, he said the elimination of the Ecuadoran Institute of Agrarian Reform and Settlement (IERAC) also means the disappearance of the legal distribution of land to the Indians, who will have to seek new lands at the same time that arbitrary settlements are encouraged. Conaie President Luis Macas urged the Court of Constitutional Guarantees (in charge of enforcing the laws) and the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice "not to permit such big violations of the constitution because this would lay the groundwork for absolute chaos in all areas."
