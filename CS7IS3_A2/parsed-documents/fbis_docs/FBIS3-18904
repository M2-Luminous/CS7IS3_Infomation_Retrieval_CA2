Olsen was defending himself against accusations of broken promises, the EU [European Union] last night abandoned its attempts to reach agreement on fish and other internal problems. The stage has been set for a serious crisis both within the EU and in the Norwegian membership negotiations. After a dramatic meeting at which angry words had been exchanged, the EU's foreign ministers decided around midnight to abandon the attempt to find a solution to their internal problems and to reach a fisheries agreement with Norway. The EU ministers will not meet again until Tuesday [15 March] next week. The chairman of the Council of Ministers, Theodhoros Pangalos, said at a press conference last night that Spain alone carries all the blame for the delay. "Norway has shown flexibility by trying as best it can to achieve a solution," the Greek European affairs minister said. However, the meeting of the EU foreign ministers did not break up before they had formally concluded the agricultural negotiations with Norway so that only fish -- and possibly the minke whale -- remain for the next round of negotiations. This morning EU Commissioner Hans van den Broek and Greek European Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos were to give the European Parliament a briefing on the situation and on the results achieved in the negotiations with Sweden, Finland, and Austria. "I do not think that the Parliament will accept this sort of half-finished agreement," a Commission spokesman said last night. "But if the Parliament does so, there is a great danger that the Norwegian car will be uncoupled from the negotiating train," he added. However, the picture last night was unclear. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, however, thought that Norway would be able to keep up if agreement is reached on a formula in the course of this week. Before this dramatic development Fisheries Minister Olsen had been involved in an argument with the Association of Norwegian Fishermen, among others, about what in quota terms he had actually offered Spain and the others in the EU. Olsen denied categorically that he had given away a single fish, but earlier in the evening he made this reply to a question from NRK [Norwegian broadcasting company] about whether he had broken his promise: "That remains to be seen." "Norway will use the EEA [European Economic Area] fish [quotas granted to Spain and Portugal in the framework of the EEA agreement] for all it is worth," Olsen said at a press conference. He also said that with his proposal to the EU he had wanted to counter quota demands from the other side. But have you given any fish away? "No, I have not given away a single fish," the hard-pressed fisheries minister said. "The fisheries minister has given away fish," Vigdis Harsvik, secretary general of the Association of Norwegian Fishermen, said yesterday when she saw Norway's proposed fisheries agreement with the EU. Others were less sure about the interpretation of the complicated Norwegian calculations. The drama further increased when it became known that Spain had rejected the proposal because it did not give the country enough fish. The Spanish rejection led to sharp reactions from the EU's Greek presidency and Germany. "Never before have I been so angry," German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said in a clear reference to Spain. Kinkel pointed out that Spain would never have become an EU member if Germany had not lent a helping hand, and warned of the consequences if the EU fails in this major project of enlargement. "I am disappointed," Kinkel said before leaving Brussels in the early hours. He said that the problem was the EU's and not Norway's. "We were 98 percent in agreement with Norway on fish," he said. In the Norwegian paper, which was being freely circulated, Norway stated first that the quota of 11,000 [units not specified] which the EU will be allowed to fish in 1997 is to be brought forward to 1995. This means that in total there will be an additional 3,750 tonnes of fish for the EU in 1995 and 1996. In addition there will be technical adjustments which, according to Norway's calculations, will mean that the EU will receive an additional annual quota of 2,000 tonnes after 1997. The comprehensive fisheries package that was rejected by Spain yesterday evening consists of a series of elements that all aim at satisfying the demands from Spain and Portugal for increased quotas and ending the current discrimination against the countries within the framework of the EU's common fisheries policy. A Norwegian source stressed that the EU now has an understanding of Norway's argument that it is not fair to make Norway alone bear the burden of putting right the error made when Spain and Portugal joined the EU. Norway is also offering to allow an unexploited cod quota outside Canada's 200-mile zone to pass to the EU. Spain has interests in this area, but Canada and the EU disagree on how the fishing in the area is to be regulated. In addition, Greece is offering to give away 500 tonnes of its quota, and there was speculation yesterday evening that Germany too would consider giving away some of its quota in Norwegian waters. As far as the issue of market access is concerned, there is now talk of a transitional period of three years for the planned oversight mechanism. On the subject of the administration of resources north of the 62d parallel and negotiations with Russia, there will be a statement which in the Norwegian view meets the Norwegian need for a defensible administration regime. The EU accepts the Norwegian demand that Spitsbergen should be kept out of the EU so that the current system of administration can remain the same.
