On the eve of the prime minister's arrival, the arrest in Beijing yesterday of Wei Jingsheng, the most well-known dissident, takes on the value of a message. The Chinese Government does not intend to allow the Western concept of human rights to be imposed on it. But it is equally obvious that France cannot remain silent in face of violations of freedom. In the dialectic between national interest and respect for major principles, compromise is therefore necessary. Edouard Balladur has chosen realism. By negotiating to end the dispute over arms sales to Taiwan, he has enabled French businesses to reenter the most promising market of the next century. The cooling in relations between Paris and Beijing made our market share drop to 1.6 percent, whereas Italy climbed to 2.6 percent and Germany to 5.8 percent. By departing from the line followed by Francois Mitterrand since the bloody repression of Tienanmen Square in 1989, the prime minister ran the risk of breaking with the rules of cohabitation. But the stake was worth it. To cite Alain Juppe, "employment in France also depends on Asia." At the same time, the limits which cannot be crossed are clear. The French Government would bring dishonor on itself if it betrayed the ideal of democracitic countries to pocket a few more contracts. When dealing with China, the aim is to change not the essence, but the form. Today, the Beijing leaders seem ready to make some gestures on human rights, provided they can save face. They do not want to be taught any public lessons. Edouard Balladur therefore thinks, on this subject, that it will be more effective if he negotiates instead of preaching. The United States, despites its privileged position as a superpower, is now reaching a similar conclusion. Following the disastrous visit to Beijing by his secretary of state last month, Bill Clinton is trying to loosen the link between trade and human rights. The yearly threat not to renew China's status of most favored nation has ceased to be credible. American businesses need outlets badly, too. The White House, too, badly needs a partner to help it make North Korea, tempted by the bomb, see reason, or to persuade Japan to lower its trade barriers. Finally, it is clear that excessively vehement protests are likely to have the opposite effect. In the struggle for Deng Xiaoping's legacy, the hardliners could well take this "interference" as a pretext to take an ever tougher line. Thirty years have passed since de Gaulle dared to break the anticommunist solidarity to restore diplomatic relations with Beijing. However, the motive which justified the general's iconoclastic gesture remains the same. In his soldier's language, de Gaulle said at the time: "China should not be left to stew in its own juice."
