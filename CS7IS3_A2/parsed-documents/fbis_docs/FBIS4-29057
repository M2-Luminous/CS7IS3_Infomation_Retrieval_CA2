The group, formed by the Construction Ministry to estimate mid- and long-term construction investment by the public sector, said that spending by the private sector on building plants, offices and shops will remain weak until at least fiscal 2000. Private-sector firms are taking time to adjust inventories accumulated during the "bubble economy" era of the late 1980's, it said, adding public-sector investment will be a key factor to sustain Japan's economic growth. It said the 7.1 percent desired increase is calculated based on an assumption that Japan wants to maintain an annual 3 to 3.5 percent economic growth in real terms through the 2000 business year, which ends March 2001. Should Japan want to maintain the economic growth for 10 years from the 2001 business year at a pace between 2.6 and 2.9 percent, the government will find it necessary to increase its construction investment by an average 2.7 percent every year, the group added. The rate can be lower than for earlier years because private-sector investment will have recovered by then, it said. If the government increased such investment at lower paces, the economic growth target will not be sustainable, the group added. With public-sector spending on construction projects boosted to the recommended rates in those periods, the scale of Japan's construction market, including housing, private-sector business facilities and public-sector construction projects, will reach about 870 trillion yen for the decade through the 2000 business year. The scale will then reach to about 1,180 trillion yen for the next decade, it said.
