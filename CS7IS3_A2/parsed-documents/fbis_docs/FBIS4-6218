They have dismissed Thailand's repeated statement that its policy is that of supporting the elected Cambodian Government. Although we do not think the Cambodian leaders' charge that Thailand, as a "state," supported the Khmer Rouge troops has any factual basis, we cannot deny that support has existed at the border. Yet, this has been rather mutual help at the people's level within the normal range of contacts for border trade and visits -- these contacts exist at other points along Thailand's borders. We think that the attitude adopted by the Cambodian leaders does not reflect realities. If this continues, it will only worsen relations and aggravate tension between the two countries. This is not good for either side, especially Cambodia, which is at the stage of national reconstruction. Besides, we think that the attitude adopted by the Cambodian leaders could spoil the talks between the Cambodian leaders and the Thai Army commander, who is scheduled to visit Cambodia within a few days. The Thai Army is the prime target in the charge made by the Cambodian leaders -- a spokesman of the Cambodian Information Ministry said that there are bad elements in the Thai Army who have supported the Khmer Rouge guerrillas in violation of the Thai Government's policy of support for the Cambodian Government. The charge was serious; and it was directed against the Thai Armed Forces when Cambodian leaders failed to locate the sources of fresh munitions and cannon rounds the Khmer Rouge have in their possession. During his visit to Cambodia, the Army chief will have to answer those charges, and he might well have to put up with a few proposals from the Cambodian Government -- they can be about nothing other than Thailand's support for Cambodian guerrillas, regardless of the fact that the Thai military has completely ceased giving support to the Khmer Rouge since the peace agreement was signed in Paris by the four Cambodian factions. On behalf of the Thai people, we call on the Cambodian Government to stop making groundless accusations. Not only will they bring "a chill" in relations between Thailand and Cambodia, the accusations will seriously affect national reconstruction in Cambodia, badly torn by civil strife. We hope that the story of a farmer and the viper, which referred to Cambodian leaders in the past, will not have to be retold.
