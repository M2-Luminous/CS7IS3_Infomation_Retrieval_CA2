Keeping a distance of 50 km from our shore, it was completing a turn onto the reverse course, from Cape Svyatoy Nos to North Cape, so as to return in 30-40 minutes. The friends in the partnership for peace were working in the previous manner... Navymen dislike Orions. Crews of surface ships dislike them because they are impudent. Not only will they fly around the ship, but they also will not fail to roar over superstructures. Crews of strategic submarines departing on patrol duty dislike them because the sonobuoys scattered by an Orion will transmit the submarine's characteristic noises to the aircraft with almost one-hundred percent certainty. The noises later will be loaded into the computer programs of controllable mine ordnance. In a threat period, such weapons are laid covertly off exits from bases. You can be sure they will operate only against you. Several years ago such actions evoked a response. Air defense aviation alert forces would be sent up with one mission: Hamper reconnaissance by all possible methods but one -- destruction. One such alert mission almost ended in tragedy. An SU-27 which had hovered over an Orion fell into the propellers, but evidently it pleased God not to allow a great misfortune that day. Both our fighter and the foreign reconnaissance aircraft made it to their airfields. Well, I don't know about the Americans, but our ace later got it pretty good. He was saved from the anger of higher-ups only by one thing: What was then still a Soviet nuclear powered submarine slipped unnoticed into the Barents Sea in this commotion. Today "force majeure" circumstances are evaluated somewhat differently -- from the standpoint of the ability of combat teams to adequately analyze the behavior of the tracked target and forecast its ultimate goals. Previous methods of "bolt-rattling" -- stopping a flight or forcing a landing -- have been rescinded. This probably is correct. The world has become largely different. As a rule, yesterday's potential enemy is not behaving as energetically, although he is not letting up in reconnaissance activeness. Last year 179 Orion flights were registered in the Barents Sea, and there already have been 52 in three months of this year. "So you see for yourself," said Lieutenant General Aleksey Marenkov, air defense corps commander, commenting on this fact, "that while politicians seem to be getting friendly, the military do not forget their purpose." By the way, it is not just aircraft of contiguous states of Finland and Norway that operate actively near Russian borders. It turns out the Americans also have interests in the Russian North and are invariable participants of the various "air shows." Not a year goes by that the British and French do not drop in to train in detecting our subs from the air. Pilots of private light-engine aircraft and helicopters also are no less trouble. The specialists with whom I had occasion to chat are far from categorizing all of them as followers of the not unknown Mathias Rust, but there are so many who deliberately get on the nerves of duty air defense weapon teams. Sometimes fighter-interceptors must be scrambled and additional airspace surveillance and tracking systems must be started up. All this means expenditures, and no small ones: Just one liter of aviation kerosene costs R280 today. And filling an aircraft takes much more than ten tonnes. Meanwhile, fighter regiments have difficulty keeping fuel reserves at the 30-50 percent level. This is an average for the troops. In the first quarter the Kilpyavr air regiment near Murmansk was allocated only five percent of what was required. The reason is not new -- Ministry of Defense inability to pay. Aviation kerosene, solar oil and gasoline are obtained by hook or by crook. Colonel General of Aviation Viktor Prudnikov, commander-in-chief of the Russian Federation Air Defense Troops, recently got all this in Omsk on his word of honor. They believed him (regretting it for the umpteenth time!) and gave him 26,000 tonnes on credit. Counting what came before, it will be necessary to pay R11 billion for everything. It is the very same picture with spare parts, but old ties far from always help out. More and more often, suppliants are treated indifferently: When there is prepayment, we'll talk... I will not begin to accuse the heads of such enterprises of a lack of patriotism, because I know how difficult it is for them as well -- no money to develop production, nothing to pay workers. I ask only one thing: Do not nag those officers who turn to you for help. They themselves already have been serving on credit for a long time. Pay has been issued only for January in two air regiments which I had occasion to visit -- near St. Petersburg and Murmansk. Air defense missilemen guarding Kola Peninsula installations -- enterprises, the atomic electric power station at Polyarnyye Zori, Fleet garrisons and bases -- are in a similar situation. The state's debt for the Severomorsk formation's pay is around R600 million, and it is three billion for the large strategic formation at Arkhangelsk... What is service without pay? Chancing to be in Murmansk recently, a missile regiment commander was unable to buy a stick of boiled sausage, which his wife had asked for the day before as she handed him the last R5,000 note that had been hidden away. "You understand, I was ashamed to ask the saleswoman to cut off a piece, but for no more than 5,000..." "I understand you, Lieutenant Colonel. The situation is morally repulsive. But who would explain something else to me: How, with whose concession, and for how much are streams with abundant fish leased on the sly in Murmansk Oblast? Who are they, these stern businessmen (would that they were only ours!)? Armed with Winchesters and assault rifles, they permit themselves to threaten the corps commander: "We don't give a damn, General, that you have equipment here on Rybachiy, that it has to be removed from here by ship. Clear out of here with a whole skin; this section of the peninsula is private property..." Just quite recently service in the Arctic was considered prestigious. One year for one and one-half, one and one-half times the pay, arctic increments -- all this more than compensated for all sorts of inconveniences of life. Today for the most part it is zealots who inhabit the "norths," those for whom money will not cloud the eyes. Because no one pays either pilots or their families for clearing a snow-blocked runway. That is how they serve, together with the airfield soldiers and with the regimental commander. You won't go from here to the "continent" for a replacement very often. There are fewer and fewer who wish to move to the Arctic, inasmuch as, having settled down in a more or less civilized place, people do not wish to leave it for fully understandable reasons. And you can't send them off under armed escort. And what is to be done with residents of former garrisons such as of that same Novaya Zemlya? They removed the formation, but some of the people just remained there; there is nowhere to move to. Who will take the housing inventory on his balance sheet? How can acceptable everyday conditions be created for them and how can they be provided with work? Ministry of Defense personnel suffice only for a little bit -- to maintain the vital activity of a combat infrastructure mothballed for the time being. The idea was for the rest to have gone over to institutions of local government, but a government decision is needed for this. And the people work. Each day the combat teams of SAM launch systems, radars and command posts and the pilots of air squadrons go on guard over Russia's air borders. To hell with the area's biorhythms and geographic and climatic features. Whether it be the South or Kamchatka, there is work, with a meaning that is simple and understandable -- protect the Motherland. If not we, then just who will do it?
