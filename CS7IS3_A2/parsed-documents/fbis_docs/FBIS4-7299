FBIS4-7299 "dreas083_m_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 Thailand Poor Security Measures in South Hurt Investment Poor Security Measures in South Hurt Investment BK2804024694 Bangkok THE NATION in English 28 Apr 94 p A7 BK2804024694 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday admitted that security measures in the South are inadequate. He said violence in the region including last year's torching of more than 30 schools in the southernmost provinces and Saturday's bomb blast at Nakhon Si Thammarat's railway station, had adversely affected investment in the South. Chuan told a gathering of Islamic religious leaders that while people in the South may have become accustomed to such incidents, those outside the region were scared by the press reports. He said religious leaders could help solve the problem of violence by giving officials information when incidents occurred and telling people in their communities to behave themselves. Many acts of sabotage have occurred in the South since Chuan took office in 1992, the bomb last Saturday which killed three people and injured at least 27 others being only the most recent. The opposition has threatened to file a no-confidence motion against the government over public security. Deputy Interior Minister Suthat Ngoenmun said it was the duty and right of the opposition to file a no-confidence motion. The government must publicly explain to avoid confusion, he said. He said police should come up with better measures and intelligence to prevent violence. Police performance in dealing with bombing incidents dissatisfied the people, the press and the opposition, Suthat said. "I'm not happy. I'm not satisfied with police performance in preventing and suppressing crime," Suthat said. "Intelligence services should be better. I don't know what their problem is, since the government has allocated a budget for them." He said police chief Prathin Santipraphop should not comment on cases while things are still unclear. This only confuses the public and allows the culprits to escape. Suthat said evidence, witnesses and investigative procedures should be kept secret. Police should not publicly reveal everything because this affects the investigations. He said Pol Gen [Police General] Prathin is a capable officer, but he may not have a strong enough team to help him. Deputy Interior Minister Chamni Sakdiset said Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut was ready to face the opposition in Parliament, should it initiate a censure debate. He said police should investigate all possible motives behind Saturday's bomb blast, including personal affairs and politics.
