Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov made a speech at the conference and said that political measures and not declarations should be the basis for civil accord. Their purpose should be the elimination of sources of civil confrontation, which he believes are the sharp property stratification, the violation of social and economic rights of working people, the increase in crime, and the spiritual degradation of the public. The head of the party believes that a civil accord in Russia is possible but it should be agreed upon not by confrontational branches of powers but by various political forces. The communists intend to set up a wide coalition of left, centrist, and national and democratic forces in order to win the elections and to come to power legally.
