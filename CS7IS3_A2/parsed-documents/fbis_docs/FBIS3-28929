The official, requesting anonymity, said he "favors exchange rates that reflect economic fundamentals." The dollar fell more than 2 yen to sink below 106 yen in Tokyo after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to reach an agreement on the framework trade talks at their weekend meeting in Washington. Rejecting possibilities of an overall review of the trade talks, the official said both sides decided on "a cooling-off period" but "the July deadline is unchanged." Aside from the issue of "objective criteria" which lead to the failure of the summit, the official said the insurance field was "near agreement," and stressed that Japan would continue promoting deregulatory steps and other measures.
