Ricardo Alarcon, Ernesto Melendez, and Jose Luis Rodriguez, foreign investment, cooperation, and finance ministers respectively, also received Stewart during the first day of her two-day working visit to Cuba, which has a full agenda. An official from the Canadian Embassy in Havana said these were constructive and "very smooth" talks. As she arrived in the Cuban capital last night, the official, also in charge of African affairs in Prime Minister Jean Chretien's liberal administration, pointed out one the objectives of her trip was to broaden bilateral ties. She also underscored that common programs could stem from these conversations. Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs Minister Andre Ouellet said the Canadian Government today ended the 16-year suspension of official economic aid to Cuba, convinced that "now is the time to turn the page" on Cuba. This aid was canceled on 1978 due to the Cuban military aid offered to Angola in view of the South African aggression. This decision, however, did not hinder bilateral relations, especially commercial and tourist relations, which thrived without difficulties. According to Ottawa government sources, Canada will grant Cuba over $1 million worth of foodstuffs, mainly for children, between 1994 and 1995. Stewart is expected to make a public announcement regarding this aid tomorrow morning in Havana.
