House of Representatives member Nakamura was arrested on suspicion of bribery after the lower house for the first time in 26 years approved a relevant petition filed by the Tokyo District Court. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who also heads the Japan New Party, said the arrest of a legislator while the Diet was in session is "really regrettable," but did not elaborate. Japanese legislators cannot be arrested during a Diet session without a go-ahead from parliament. Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei Kono said "as a legislator" he regretted "that things have come so far." Out of respect for the Diet's ethical standards, legislators have to make sure to clear themselves from any suspicion, he said. Kono's party, which is at the center of the current corruption scandal highlighting ties between the construction industry and politicians, must make further efforts to "break with corruption," Kono said. The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest force within the ruling coalition, said the Diet's lifting of Nakamura's immunity demonstrates parliament's determination to combat political corruption. SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news conference his party "honors" the Diet decision and urged the prosecution to clarify suspicions against Nakamura as soon as possible. Nakamura quit the main opposition LDP on Wednesday. He is suspected of having accepted a 10 million yen bribe from Kajima Corp., a leading construction firm. Kozo Watanabe, acting secretary general of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), another key coalition member, told reporters the Diet's cooperation with prosecutors is important in restoring public trust in politics. "We politicians must try to shape up so we can win back public trust in politics," he said. House of Representatives Speaker Takako Doi, while noting the need to honor parliamentarians' rights, said that legislators on the other hand have the duty to safeguard the credibility of the Diet. Health and Welfare Minister Keizo Ouchi, leader of the minor coalition Democratic Socialist Party, said it is "really regrettable" that the construction bribery scandal has spread as far as to an incumbent legislator. He said that for the sake of public trust, the Diet had to lift Nakamura's immunity. Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi, of the SDP, said Nakamura's arrest is "extremely bitter" for his ministry as it has further undermined voter's trust. Kazuo Shii, chief of the Secretariat of the minor opposition Japanese Communist Party (JCP), said Nakamura's arrest is "a matter of course" and his case only the tip of the iceberg. He said his party will demand that Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa be questioned in connection with a series of bribery scandals involving major contractors. With bribes having been disbursed to win public works contracts, Hosokawa and his government bear responsibility for full clarification of the scandal, Shii said.
