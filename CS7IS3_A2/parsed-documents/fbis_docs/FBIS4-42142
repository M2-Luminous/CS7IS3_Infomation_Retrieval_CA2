In a statement at Ankara Esenboga Airport before his departure, Demirel said that this will be the first visit to Ukraine and Moldova by a Turkish president since the two countries gained independence. He pointed out that Turkey was one of the first countries to recognize and to establish diplomatic relations with Ukraine and Moldova. [Begin Demirel recording] Turkey attaches great importance to the strengthening of the independence of these two countries -- which gained their independence and took their rightful places in the world -- and to the success of their political and economic reforms. In particular, Turkey is trying to share its experience in the transition to a free market economy to the benefit of these friendly countries. In line with this aim, I would like to announce that the Turkish Development and Cooperation Agency will open an office in Moldova during my visit. Turkey considers friendly Ukraine one of the most important countries in our region. [end recording] Demirel pointed out that the approval documents for the friendship and cooperation agreement signed by President Kravchuk in Ankara in 1992 will be exchanged during his visit to Ukraine. He added that agreements on sea and highway transportation and on tourism will be signed, as well as a protocol on the Ceyhan-Kirikkale-Samsun oil pipeline project that will carry Middle Eastern oil to the Black Sea and Ukraine over Turkey. [Begin Demirel recording] As you know, Crimean Turks live in Ukraine and Gagauz Turks in Moldova. These Turkish communities make up very important bridges of friendship between Ukraine and Moldova and Turkey. We attach great importance to the happiness of these Turks in the countries, to their living as free citizens whose equal rights are guaranteed and who can uphold their ethnic and social identities, and to the establishment and development of mutual understanding and strong cooperation between them and the local and central authorities. Our Crimean Turkish brothers in Ukraine were expelled from their lands and massacred in 1944 during the Stalin era. The 50th anniversary of this shameful incident of humanity was marked on 18 May with sorrow and contempt. The Crimean Turks are still trying to return to their historical homeland, the Crimea. Despite the help of the Ukrainian Government and its desire to make this return easy, the Crimean Turks are faced with serious problems in their return to Crimea. Turkey will try to be of as much help as it can to alleviate these problems. [end recording] Demirel said that in Moldova, a series of documents will be signed that will constitute the contractual basis of the relations between the two countries. He explained that the agreements to be signed will cover friendship and cooperation, ground and air transportation, culture, judicial cooperation, and the struggle against organized crime. Demirel announced that the Chief Consulate in Kishinev in Moldova has been raised to the level of an embassy. He said that he will inaugurate the new embassy building during his visit. The president pointed out that in Moldova he will meet with the leaders of the Gagauz Turks and tour the areas in which they live. He added that he will lay the cornerstone of the brick and tile factory the Turkish private sector is building for close to $1 million in the Gagauz region. Demirel was seen off by Turkish Grand National Assembly speaker Husamettin Cindoruk. Acting Prime Minister Necmettin Cevheri, Chief of the General Staff General Dogan Gures, certain ministers, and officials were present at the ceremony. Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and Transportation Minister Mehmet Kostepen are accompanying Demirel on the visits.
