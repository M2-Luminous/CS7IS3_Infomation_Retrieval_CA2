In an interview to INTERFAX, he said that the proposal to elect candidates to all management bodies of the chamber on a basis of a single list would have little support. Sergey Shakhray said that the media and independent deputies favor individual and secret voting for every candidate. He believes that the parliamentary chairman should have only two deputies, one from the party list and the other from a one-seat constituency.
