Vladimir Suman, deputy of the government coalition Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) and chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, told CTK after the meeting that "no problems in this respect are being expected." The NATO mission was led by NATO Assistant Secretary General Gebhardt von Moltke. Suman said that Moltke explained to the deputies the fundamental principles of Partnership and acquainted them with expected positions of individual participating countries (non-members of NATO) towards the project. The Czech deputies informed the NATO officials on the course of action the parliament would take on Partnership. "We primarily stressed that we are prepared to exercise control over the army and to take in parliament all the measures necessary for the implementation of the project. We said we would strive to influence people's stand towards the army and NATO and contribute to the transformation of the Czech Army so that it would be capable of meeting the conditions set for the admission to NATO," Suman said.
