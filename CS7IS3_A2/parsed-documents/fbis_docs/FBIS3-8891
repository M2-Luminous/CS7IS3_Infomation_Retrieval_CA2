On that day at the Primatial Square, an unknown man hit Samelova in the face with his fist. She asked a policeman standing next to her for help. To her request, he replied: I am not here. The Radiozurnal editor denies that, at the beginning of the Monday evening edition of Radiozurnal, she used the information to politically compromise the police. She merely described what happened at the square during a public radio broadcast. However, she does not see the fact that she decided not to press charges as a reason not to investigate the events and draw appropriate conclusions on the part of competent bodies.
