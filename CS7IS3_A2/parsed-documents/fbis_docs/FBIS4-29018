The allied forces took the action after determining that the chances of an unexpected military provocation by North Korea are high following its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the sources said. The United States is expected to increase the intensity of a draft resolution on U.N. sanctions against North Korea. Pyongyang has said it would regard the imposition of sanctions as an act of war. Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae said last week that South Korean and U.S. military forces have completed preparations for three possible stages -- the beginning of sanctions, limited North Korean provocations and an all-out war. The intelligence surveillance operation would go into full operation if and when sanctions were imposed, Yi said. At present, the United States and South Korea have deployed U-2R reconnaissance aircraft, E-3C early warning planes, KH-9 spy satellites and all other possible means to monitor North Korean movements around the clock while thoroughly analyzing the pictures and information gathered, the sources said. Washington has already sent military analysts and intelligence officials to South Korea to support the operation, they added. The South Korean military, meanwhile, is rechecking its decision- making system in order to meet possible limited provocations by North Korea, and strengthening the defense of public and government buildings and facilities and military command posts that could be targeted in a North Korean attack, they said.
