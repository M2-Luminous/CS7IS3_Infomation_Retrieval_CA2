Communication between the UN forces and NATO in Bosnia-Herzegovina is weak and there is a deficiency in the execution of duties. What are your views on the issue? [Cetin] This also derives from the structure of the United Nations. Current organizations and international institutions, and especially the United Nations, are conceptualized to suit the Cold War period. These organizations have not been able to adapt themselves to the new situation with the elimination of the Cold War and the two blocs. They were quite deficient in adapting to the new reality. When we take the United Nations into consideration, this is one of the problems. The second problem is that this organization has no political will. The political will belongs to the nations. Within the structure of the United Nations actually it is not the political will of the 187 members but rather that of the Security Council members and especially the five permanent members within the Council. The political will of these five members is actually reflected or implemented. Since a unity of views cannot be secured among these five members the United Nations is thus rendered helpless. The third point is that the United Nations does not have its own military force. It can only recruit forces from among its members. Many times these forces cannot act independently from these nations. They implement the policies of their countries. The forth significant point is that the United Nations has no power to secure peace. It is trying to secure a peace that is not stable. There is no peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They are called the peacekeeping forces. How can you keep a peace that is nonexistent? This also causes some problems. Now, NATO has reached a decision saying that if the United Nations makes an appeal to NATO then it will undertake the necessary operation. Because this region is beyond NATO jurisdiction. As you have expressed in your question a while ago, they behaved most indecisively there. This implementation has affected the credibility and respectability of NATO. When an appeal was made to NATO one or two planes undertook an operation. This not only lacked any deterrence it actually encouraged the Serbs. This is what happened in Gorazde. Beyond that there were differences of views between the civilian and military commanders in Bosnia-Herzegovina. For example, the military commander requested an intervention two days ago. Whereas, the civilian administrator was opposed to it. Bosnia-Herzegovina is, in a way, paying the price for all these negative points. The Bosnian people are paying the price and Azerbaijan is paying the price in the Caucasus. Now Gorazde has been under siege for the last 20 days. It has reached the point that.... [pauses] The United Nations is powerless. Some 200 UN peacekeeping troops are being held hostage by the Serbs. In other words they cannot even protect their own forces, they cannot ensure the security of their own people. How can such a United Nations protect the people of Gorazde? [Alkas] How come the Serbs are so bold? [Cetin] I believe that the world and these organizations have not issued a message in the language that the Serbs can understand. They did not give the message that, if necessary, they will intervene to the very end. They could not deter them, they only encouraged them. For example, for the last few days they gave the impression that an agreement was being reached while they actually were helping the Serbs gain time. [Alkas] On the one hand they said they would withdraw and on the other they continued their attacks. [Cetin] I talked with the Bosnian president a while ago before coming to the studio. He said that the situation is very critical, that no one is intervening, and that the tanks have begun to enter one section of the city. Of course, the Bosnian people will not be defeated with the occupation of Gorazde. They will continue their heroic struggle as they have done for the last two years. Given the situation, however, another duty befalls the United Nations. Since you cannot protect them then allow them to protect themselves. Let us try and lift this arms embargo. Turkey has been working on this from the every beginning. If you cannot protect the safe havens, if you cannot protect the people in that region, and if you cannot protect your own people, then you can at least lift the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia-Herzegovina and grant the Bosnian army and people to right to protect themselves. [Alkas] We thank you, Mr. minister.
