This time it will be about setting up, not dissolving, a structure that would take over all state security units and law-enforcement agencies. It is planned to organize "a security service community" that would include chiefs of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Federal Agency of Government Communications and Information, the Main Security Administration, the presidential security service (all former KGB services), and also the Main Intelligence Administration of the Defense Ministry General Staff. In addition, the community will include chiefs of services to be set up on the basis of the reorganized Internal Affairs Ministry. It is not yet clear who will head the new structure. To all appearances, it will be subordinate directly to the president, and its meetings will be chaired either by the Russian Federation Security Council's secretary or by the president's national security adviser.
