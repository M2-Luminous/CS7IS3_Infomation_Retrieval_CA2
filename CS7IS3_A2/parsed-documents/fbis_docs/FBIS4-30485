The auto industry, which has staked its survival, is leveling demands at the steel industry for price cuts. But behind that severity lies unexpected "understanding." "The situation is that plant and equipment built for autos is not operating. Management of every steel company is suffering because of that depreciation burden," "We have not once received a guarantee from users saying `We will buy X number of vehicles next year'"... This kind of offense and defense is being fought between steel and autos. Toshio Kokure, Kawasaki Steel Corporation vice president (in charge of operations), was astonished at being pressed by the president of a major auto company who said, "For vehicles which emphasize price, like light cars, 80 percent of the steel can be replaced by imported material." At present, 100 percent of the steel used by the automakers is procured from domestic blast-furnace companies. Since the summer of last year, automakers have been requesting price cuts on steel materials, against the background of a resolve that is even prepared to reduce that. The beginning was a revolt of companies that make auto parts. From 1992 into 1993 complaints gushed forth from parts makers: "Why do we have to buy expensive domestic steel despite being asked to lower costs by units of 1 yen and 1 sen?" No matter how much parts makers push ahead with lowering of processing costs by self-help efforts, it is very hard to make progress in lowering costs if material costs, which account for about one-half of all costs, do not become lower. A system of "centralized procurement" of steel has been established in the auto industry. It is a system by which automakers also buy in one lot from steelmakers the steel used by parts makers, and supply it to them. For the automakers, the price was less by buying in one lot, and it was effective in controlling their keiretsu; for the steelmakers, it had the advantages of the number of companies to negotiate with being reduced and of price and volume being stable. But, starting the year before last, the market price became less than the price of steel purchased in a centralized manner and supplied to parts makers. For example, in contrast to the fact that cold rolled steel could be purchased on the market for about 65,000 yen per ton, the supply price was 90,000 yen, a big gap. The phenomenon of reversal had also occurred a number of times in the past, but it was temporary and soon reverted to the former state. The cause lay in disorder in the supply volume among domestic producers, so it could be solved by adjustment among steel companies, which are predisposed toward cooperation. But the cause of the current drop in the market price was imported steel, such as that made in South Korea. If it were a domestic problem, "consultation" would operate. But it does not happen that way when overseas entities are involved. Automakers judged that "the price reversal is not a temporary phenomenon; it will continue in the future as well," so starting last year they began asking steelmakers to lower prices. Although this matter has not yet been settled, it worked out that, beginning in April, auto companies lowered the price at which they supply steel to parts makers by 5,000-7,000 yen. Steelmakers say "it is a price between automakers and parts makers, so it has nothing to do with a price reduction with us." But, actually, there is a strong possibility that the steelmakers' price for autos will also drop by about 5 percent. Automakers' Own Device Prevents Them From Reaping the Strong-Yen Benefit Because of the strong yen since last year, automakers' profits have declined by a total of about 1 trillion yen. Therefore, they accelerated cost reduction, but they became irritated by the fact that it is very difficult to restore material that gains the strong-yen benefit. Steel is a typical example of that. However, the automakers' production system itself had factors which hinder reaping the strong-yen dividend. Japanese manufacturers have adopted the just-in-time (JIT) production system. Deliveries must be made a number of times each day at established times. It is arranged that the storage and delivery for that purpose are the role of the steelmakers. Even if the auto companies tried to use imported steel, it would be impossible in the present situation, in which there are no overseas blast-furnace companies which employ a delivery system which conforms to JIT. Automakers also recognize this situation, so the question of how much extra cost there is because of conforming to JIT has become an issue in the negotiations on lowering of costs. One more thing which stands in the way of imported steel is the question of quality. Japanese cars use a lot of high-grade, expensive steel, such as corrosion-resistant steel plate, which does not rust easily; high-tensile steel plate, which is strong and thin; and steel that can withstand complicated pressing. Japanese blast-furnace companies have responded to automakers' severe demands by this technology. One could not use imported material for that kind of high-performance steel, even if one so desired. But the highest performance steel that is used in autos accounts for about 40 percent. Aside from that, one can use imported steel if one so wishes. Furthermore, in promoting the inexpensive building of cars, automakers are trying to lower the proportion of expensive steel that is used. Japanese automakers bought Chrysler Neons, which appeared on the market at a miraculously low price, and inspected them thoroughly to find out why they can be made cheaply. Among other things, they were also deeply impressed by the way of using steel. Japanese cars have to use expensive steel because of complicated surface design. In contrast to that, by making curved surfaces gentle, so that they are easy to press, it has been arranged that inexpensive grades of steel plate can be used on the Neon. At present Japanese automakers are competing fiercely in how to make cars inexpensively. Therefore, means are being devised by which even inexpensive steel will serve the purpose. If that happens, it will mean that preparations will have been made for being able to use imported material, or electric steel, which is not used now because of unstable quality. Cooperation Crumbles Before Survival Automakers are indebted to steelmakers for more than development of technology. In order to increase the ratio of local procurement for cars produced in the United States, they replaced the steel which had been exported from Japan, with products of U.S. blast-furnace companies that received technology from Japanese blast-furnace companies. The drastic reduction in steel exports is due in part to a ruling on dumping, but it is said that "even if it had been an acquittal, the reduction in exports would have been delayed by only one to two years" (major auto company). Moreover, the fact that parts makers extricated themselves from centralized procurement because they were unable to endure the price difference means that the amount purchased decreased, so automakers' power to negotiate with steelmakers became weaker. Because of these reasons, although the auto industry pressed for price reductions, the pressure to lower prices is weaker than that from such large-demand users as shipbuilding and electrical appliances, which opened the door to imported steel. There is an understanding that 1) the lowering of prices until they correspond to the international price will be done in stages for the next three years, when restructuring of the steel industry will progress; 2) the rate by which prices will be lowered will be greater for low-grade steel and less for high value-added steel, for which the cost of developing technology has not been recovered; and 3) models up to the year 2000, when depreciation of production plant and equipment will end, will not cause rapid reduction in the use of high value-added steel. Perhaps that is why an impression such as "I thought that in negotiations on price cuts the auto industry deals with things more reasonably than shipbuilding and so on, which seek drastic price cuts" (Kawasaki Steel Corporation vice president Kokure) leaked from the steel side. The one exhibiting this kind of action which most understands the steel side is Toyota Motor Corporation, which is famous for severity in lowering costs. Behind this transformation lies the installation of Toyota's chairman, Shoichiro Toyoda, as chairman of Keidanren (end of May). One can easily imagine that it avoided a clash with the steel industry, which up to now, as the representative of industry, has produced any number of Keidanren chairmen. But to judge this phenomenon as Toyota having come of age is too great a leap of logic without going into the essence. It is being demanded that Japanese business reform, from its closed nature within Japan to internationalization, and from the cooperation of collusion to rational competition. Can we not say that to have chosen, in spite of that, to maintain a system of industry cooperation and a doctrine of giving preference to the domestic scene, is a compromise which sees only what is under its nose? The price and system determined by negotiation between the champions, Toyota and Nippon Steel Corporation, will probably have a strong effect on both industries, just as up till now. But that does not mean that the shakiness toward steel of lower ranking automakers, whose operation is suffering, will have ended. "From our standpoint, even the price cut that is soon to be decided on will still not be low enough. It is also possible that we will get imported material in the future. We have no leeway to be considerate just because steel is having a hard time" (Mitsubishi Motor Corporation executive director Shigeru Nakagawa, who is also director of the Purchasing Division). A person in charge of purchasing for an automaker says "We are working with the feeling that the (currently existing) 11 automakers may not all survive. Unless we get the blast-furnace companies to also think that the present six companies will not necessarily all survive...." Even if the two top companies, Toyota and Nippon Steel, try to preserve the current setup, there is no doubt that it will gradually crumble in the face of free competition.
