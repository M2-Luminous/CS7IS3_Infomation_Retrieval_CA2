Thus, the budget will have a deficit of 42.8971 billion manats. F. Yusifov noted that such a large deficit is the result of a decline in the level of production, which has dropped several-fold as compared to 1992. In order to cover the deficit, the following steps are being planned, in particular: implementation of the state privatization program, which will help to earn 5 billion manats; changing prices for alcoholic beverages, which should bring 1.3 billion into the budget; raising prices for fuel and energy and bread; introducing value-added tax on imported goods, which will bring in 4.6 billion over the remaining seven months; and so on. The deputy minister of finance also emphasized that raising the minimum wage from 900 to 2,000 manats is in the works, which will require additional budget expenditures. This difference is expected to be covered by raising retail prices on gasoline and the recently approved tax in the amount equal to two minimum wages on each square meter of space occupied by commercial trade and public catering entities. F. Yusifov said, however, that raising the minimum wage will only lead to another jump in market prices and in the final count an even greater decline in the population's living standard. As a KHABAR-SERVICE correspondent learned from competent sources in the republic government, three options for raising gasoline prices are now under consideration: 40, 50, and 60 manats per liter. Most likely the middle figure will be chosen, which will bring into the budget an additional 25-30 billion manats, but still will not be enough to raise the minimum wage.
