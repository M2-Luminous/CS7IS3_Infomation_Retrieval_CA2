Orobtsova and A. Lomakin] [Text] [Orobtsova] The Black Sea Fleet remains a bone of contention between Ukraine and Russia. Vladimir Bezkorovannyy, commander of the Ukrainian Naval Forces, believes that the naval vessels of the Black Sea Fleet's coastal service should be divided equally between Russia and Ukraine. However, in the opinion of Valeriy Kuznetsov, the Crimean president's military adviser, Ukraine is not capable of financing combat training even with the minimal number of ships at its disposal. The Black Sea Fleet numbers more than 100 naval vessels in all, only five of which are Ukrainian. Meanwhile, as Valeriy Kuznetsov stressed, Ukraine has considerably increased the number of its ground forces on Crimean territory, where there are now around 50,000 Ukrainain servicemen together with their construction units. Ukraine is probably afraid of the processes that are taking place in Crimea, Valeriy Kuznetsov said, because Crimea is Russian in spirit.
