Of these matters, the Hong Kong issue is bound to become one of the hot topics for the NPC deputies and the CPPCC national committee members during the "two sessions," and the keynote on the Hong Kong issue set by the "two sessions" will definitely also attract attention from people in and outside China. People must still remember that, at the first session of the Eighth NPC in March last year, the Chinese Government, for the first time since China and Britain solved the question of Hong Kong between them, leveled criticisms on the British Government in the "Government Work Report." One year has passed. The unfriendliness and lack of cooperation demonstrated by the British side on the Hong Kong issue have aggravated. So what comment will this year's "Government Work Report" make on the same issue? It is believed that this will be the focus of attention. Over the past year, because the British side always held on to the position which violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration, defied convergence with the Basic Law, and contravened the agreements and understandings reached between China and Britain, the Sino-British talks on the arrangements for the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong broke down. On 24 February, Chris Patten's partial constitutional reform bill characterized by the "three violations" was adopted by the British Hong Kong Legislative Council, after which the British side unilaterally disclosed the contents of the talks, misrepresenting and attacking the posture of the Chinese side. The Chinese side was compelled to publicize the relevant truths to ensure a correct understanding of the facts. It is foreseeable that the series of moves made by the British side -- which intended to confront the Chinese side and sabotage the smooth transition and transfer of sovereignty in Hong Kong -- will evoke strong criticisms from the NPC deputies and CPPCC members during the "two sessions." Last year's first session of the Eighth NPC decided to set up a Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. After it was founded last July, the PWC quickly began its work and, after adopting the work programs of all its subgroups at its second plenary session last December, entered the stage of substantive work. As a working organ subordinate to the NPC standing committee, the PWC will be able to hand in an excellent progress report to the nation at the upcoming NPC session. There is not much time left before Hong Kong returns to China. A great deal of convergence-related work in political, economic, legal, and other fields, has to be done. Therefore, as Premier Li Peng put it, the burden on the PWC is even heavier, its responsibility greater, and its role bigger. After the forthcoming "two sessions," the PWC is bound to step up its work and speed up its progress. The NPC and the CPPCC national committee are the embodiment of the will of the state as well as the people's will. The NPC deputies and the CPPCC members show of concern on the Hong Kong issue demonstrates the Chinese people's longing for national reunification and their wish that the great construct of "one country, two systems" will be smoothly realized first in Hong Kong. The smooth implementation of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong will play an effective exemplary role in the process of solving the Taiwan issue and will help the reunification of the motherland come to pass at an early date. It is now March, and spring has arrived early in Beijing. Hong Kong's NPC deputies and CPPCC members will attend the great events, participate in government and political affairs, and offer valuable advice. A separate constituency was set up for Hong Kong members at the first session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee last year. Now the CPPCC members from Hong Kong have served a full year in their office. They, faced with the wind and rain in Hong Kong of the past year, have given all their strength. They will definitely offer good ideas and good suggestions during the upcoming "two sessions" and will do their utmost to ensure the smooth return of Hong Kong to China. "A thousand sails pass by the shipwreck; ten thousand saplings shoot up beyond the withered tree." Hong Kong's destiny is, after all, in the hands of the Chinese people, including the Hong Kong compatriots. The uncooperative attitude of the British side will not in the least hold back the forward momentum of the wheel of history. During the "two sessions," the NPC deputies and the CPPCC members will once again give voice to the aspirations of the Chinese people on the question of Hong Kong.
