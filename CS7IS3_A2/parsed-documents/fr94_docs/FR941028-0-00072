FR941028-0-00072 FR941028-0-00009 Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of proposed §773.26 provided that a challenger could have submitted affidavits setting forth specific facts concerning the scope of responsibility of the various owners or controllers of an applicant, a permittee, or any person cited in a violation notice; the duties actually performed by such owners or controllers; the beginning and ending dates of such owners' or controllers' affiliation with the applicant, permittee, or person cited in a violation notice; and the nature and details of any transaction creating or severing an ownership or control link; or specific facts concerning the status of the violation. Paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(B) and (c)(2)(i)(C) of proposed §773.26 looked to official certification as the basis for the reliability of a submitted document. Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) would have allowed for the submission of certified copies of corporate minutes, stock ledgers, contracts, purchase and sale agreements, leases, correspondence, or other relevant company records. Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) would have allowed for the submission of certified copies of documents filed with or issued by any State, municipal, or Federal governmental agency. Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of proposed §773.26 provided for a challenger's submission of an opinion of counsel in support of his or her position. Under the proposed rule, such opinion would have been appropriate for submission when it was supported by evidentiary materials and when it was rendered by an attorney who certified that he or she had personally and diligently investigated the facts of the matter and that he or she was qualified to render the opinion. Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of proposed §773.26 provided that, when the decision of the responsible agency was reviewed by an administrative or judicial tribunal, the challenger could have presented any evidence to such tribunal which was admissible under the rules of the tribunal. Under the proposed regulation, however, the evidence submitted would still have to have been probative, credible, and substantial. Paragraph (d) of proposed §773.26 represented OSM's attempt to offer substantive standards which would have established what must be proved by those seeking to rebut the presumptions of ownership or control contained in current §773.5(b) of this title. Proof of the facts set forth in the proposed regulation would have established that the presumed owner or controller did not, in fact, have the authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which the relevant surface coal mining operation was conducted, under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.5(b). In general, the proposed standards contained in paragraph (d) of proposed §773.26 would have allowed a presumed owner or controller to demonstrate that he or she lacked control over a surface coal mining operation by presenting evidence that he or she actually lacked authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which the relevant surface coal mining operation would be conducted. In the alternative, with respect to a presumed owner or controller of a violator, the proposed standards would have allowed a person to present evidence that he or she took all reasonable steps within his or her authority to cause the violation to be abated and that such abatement was prevented by those in actual control of the mining operation. Paragraph (e) of proposed §773.26 would have provided for the review and revision of information in AVS to reflect determinations made by regulatory authorities in response to challenges of ownership or control links or the status of violations. The proposed provision would have provided that, following any determination by a State regulatory authority or other State agency, or following any decision by an administrative or judicial tribunal reviewing such determination, the State regulatory authority would have been required to review the information in AVS to determine if such information was consistent with the determination or decision. If it were not consistent, the State regulatory authority would have been required to promptly inform OSM and to request that the AVS information be revised to reflect the determination or decision. Industry commenters criticized the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed §773.26 as violating due process by not providing an owner or controller with the opportunity to challenge the existence of the violation at the time it was cited. They further criticized the provisions of the proposed rule as violating State primacy. In substance, they asserted that the proposed rule ``balkanized'' the permit application process by allowing the regulatory authority that issued a violation to identify the ownership or control links to the violation. They asserted that this provision impermissibly allowed such regulatory authority to play a role in the permit application process. They further argued that the regulatory authority before which an application was pending should be the sole decisionmaker. OSM disagrees with these views. OSM has already addressed these issues in detail in previous sections of this preamble captioned ``Due Process'' and ``Primacy.'' Further, OSM has clarified that a permittee may, within the context of the improvident permit issuance process, challenge the existence of the violation at the time it was cited. See discussion above in this preamble, ``Section 773.20_Improvidently Issued Permits: General Procedures.''
