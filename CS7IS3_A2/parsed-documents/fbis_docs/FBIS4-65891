FBIS4-65891 "drweu101_n_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-101 Daily Report 25 May 1994 NORDIC COUNTRIES Finland _O_ Farmers' Group Leader Cautious on EU _O_ Farmers' Group Leader Cautious on EU 94P20761A 94P20761A CSO [Editorial Report] Shortly after returning from Brussels as part of the Foreign Ministry team that negotiated Finland's accession agreement with the European Union [EU], Esa Harmala was elected chairman of an occupational association that has publicly expressed concern about the livelihood of its constituency under the EU, the Farmers and Forestry Owners' Association (MTK). Harmala, 39 and a forest owner, had gained recognition as MTK's trade policy chief prior to 1991, when Prime Minister Esko Aho appointed him chief economic adviser. When negotiations began with Brussels, Aho asked him to move to the Foreign Ministry post. Though widely applauded in the press for his efforts in Brussels as the negotiator in charge of agricultural issues and enjoying the support of Aho and his farmer-oriented Center Party, Harmala's narrow margin of victory (37-33) over active farmer and Center Party MP Juha Korkeaoja on 28 April was attributed by Helsinki's two leading dailies (HELSINGIN SANOMAT and HUFVUDSTADSBLADET editions of 29 April 1994) to be largely due to controversy surrounding his Brussels role. Many MTK board members blamed Harmala for helping forge an agreement that will result in lower producer prices and farm incomes, and may eventually force them off the land. Although voting in the leadership board was by secret ballot, in comments before and after the balloting, many Harmala supporters emphasized they did not want their vote for him interpreted as supporting EU membership, according to HUFVUDSTADSBLADET reporter Inger Blomqvist. Following approval of the entry document by the European Parliament on 2 May, Finnish opponents and proponents are now organizing for the membership referendum campaign. While the government has not yet set the date for the referendum, it is expected to be held in late September or early October, leaving Harmala, who will not assume his new office until late June, very little time to heal wounds and unify the MTK before the vote. The mood in MTK, according to the HUFVUDSTADSBLADET article, is perhaps the bleakest in the history of the 80-year-old organization. In April last year, Prime Minister Esko Aho appointed then MTK Chairman Heikki Haavisto as foreign minister. Haavisto had served as chief of the MTK since 1976, and like Korkeaoja, had been a farmer, gaining great popularity among his constituency as a farmers' champion. As in choosing Harmala, Aho picked Haavisto as part of his overall strategy for overcoming resistance from the powerful agricultural lobby. Haavisto was deemed best able to assuage the powerful farmer and food-processing sectors while directing Finland's entry bid (HUFVUDSTADSBLADET editorial, 16 April 1993). While food industry leaders have indicated that most of their objections have been overcome (HUFVUDSTADSBLADET, 14 April 1994) many farmers -- especially those in the colder and more remote north -- still feel doubly betrayed with Harmala's victory, having had their demands for a special "Arctic Agriculture" arrangement largely rejected (HELSINGIN SANOMAT, 23 February 1994). In the hour-long prevote discussion, Harmala said he understood that many farmers blamed him personally for negative provisions in the entry document, especially the lack of a "transition" regime toward open trade. At the election meeting, Harmala pleaded that his role as a Foreign Ministry official was to get the best deal possible for Finland as well as for the farmers, and that as their new chairman he would put their interests above all else (HUFVUDSTADSBLADET, 29 April 1994). He also reiterated the current MTK posture of delaying definitive announcement on the membership referendum until the details of the accession agreement are made clear, asserting that some of the provisions are "subject to interpretation." According to an editorial in the HELSINGIN SANOMAT of 29 April 1994, this delay is a clear sign that even though the entry document has been published and the European Parliament has given its sanction, the MTK may still have difficulty formulating a position acceptable to its membership.
