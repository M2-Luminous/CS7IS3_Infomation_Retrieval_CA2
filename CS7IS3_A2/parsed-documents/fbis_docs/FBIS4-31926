Nearly 30 percent of respondents believe that the parliamentary elections are more important, and almost 20 percent that the self-governmental ones are. Generally, then, the parliamentary elections are evaluated as more important than the local elections. The poll was carried out a week before the election date. Both kinds of elections are often compared. Public opinion researchers estimate that participation in the local elections may be lower than in the parliamentary elections. A lot is being said about the fact that the local elections have acquired a political character, which results, among other things, from the fact that they are being held just a few months after parliamentary elections; those elections were lost by postsolidarity and rightist groupings and won by parties with origins tracing back to the Polish People's Republic. Thus, it is another test of forces for both the winners and the losers. In many cases, the coming elections will also acquire the characteristics of a referendum for or against the self-governmental authorities that have been in power since 1990. We evaluate the intentions of our fellow countrymen slightly differently from our own. According to 30 percent of the respondents to the PBS poll, for other people the parliamentary elections are more important; 14 percent say that the self-governmental elections are more important; 4 percent believe that neither set of elections is of any special significance; and, according to 24 percent, Poles attach equal importance to the self-governmental and parliamentary elections. Almost 30 percent of the respondents had difficulty evaluating the views of other people. Representatives of groups that are higher in the social hierarchy (the management cadre, well-off and educated people) say relatively frequently that, for other people, more important are the parliamentary elections; however, they themselves usually say that both kinds of elections are equally important. Also, the view has been confirmed that the idea of self-government is more important for small communities. In rural areas and small towns, there are more people for whom the self-governmental elections are of greater importance than parliamentary elections. The poll was carried out on 11 and 12 June on a 1,043-person representative sample of adult inhabitants of the country.
