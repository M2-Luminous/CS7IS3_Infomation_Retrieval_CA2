The summit meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton came to an unprecedented conclusion with no joint statement issued. At their meeting, the two leaders made straightforward assertions, choosing not to be compelled to reach a cosmetic agreement. This should be considered a sign that the post-Cold War relationship between Japan and the United States is entering a new, mature stage. Whether setting "numerical targets" to measure the extent of openness of Japan's markets is right or wrong is not all that matters in the Japan-U.S. relations. As President Clinton has pointed out, Japan and the United States share common interests regarding the situation o the Korean peninsula. The two nations have also reconfirmed close cooperation regarding common global issues which include aid to Russia, the ronment, population control, and AIDS. We should not be preoccupied with "the breakdown in negotiations and failure to reach an agreement" regarding the framework trade talks and overlook the steady progress being made by the two nations toward strengthening bilateral ties as a whole, including expanding cooperation among their private companies. "Japan and the United States can endure even if they fail to agree on certain points," (as stated by President Clinton.) That is the way it ought to be. It is desired that both nations will take advantage of the cooling-off period to resume talks at mature levels. The maintenance of good bilateral relations is important for the security of Asia, as well as the rest of the world. If bilateral relations are actually maturing, what is most needed is for the two nations to fulfill their roles as mature nations. In this respect, Japan -- which said what it had to say, and, for the first time, said "no" to what it cannot do -- must now carry out what can be done promptly and infallibly. In particular, it is most urgent for Japan to carry out deregulation and improve procedures regarding government procurement -- measures which can be implemented under the government's own responsibility. Not only must Japan hasten steps toward a domestic-demand-oriented economic recovery by implementing versatile fiscal and monetary measures, but it must also apply the Antimonopoly Law more strictly to create a fairer and more open market. In short, the government needs to prove that "Japan has changed." We urge Prime Minister Hosokawa to exercise his leadership, taking the initiative to persuade those forces which resist reform. Japan rejected a U.S. demand for introducing numerical targets in priority areas in the framework trade talks, such as automobiles and insurance services, on the grounds that it would lead to managed trade and run contrary to the principle of deregulation. This is only natural. Japanese and U.S. scholars and numerous foreign news media, including those of the United States, support Japan's position. We urge the United States to reconsider its position and try to find other ways to promote access to Japanese markets. We cannot agree with the idea of setting unilateral numerical targets and approaching bilateral trade talks with threats of imposing legal sanctions against Japan. An outline of the framework trade talks was agreed upon last July during a meeting between Kiichi Miyazawa, who was then prime minister, and President Clinton. During the days of a one-party rule by the Liberal Democratic Party, Japan often took advantage of outside pressure to carry out domestic reform. With the birth of the Hosokawa administration, Japan is pressed with reexamining this past political approach. There is no denying the fact that Japanese markets are extremely attractive since Japan is a member of Asia which is showing spectacular growth in the post-Cold War era. More than a few European and U.S. firms which have already enjoyed success in Japanese markets. In view of an age when markets and consumers should decide who is the winner, we should all level-headedly think once again of ways to correct trade imbalances.
