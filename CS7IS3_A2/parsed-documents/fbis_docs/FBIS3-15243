Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent today, the Russian foreign minister noted that in his recent statement, Christopher spoke of the need to use legal ways of encouraging the Latvians to expand citizenship and grant voting rights to Russians living in Latvia. In the minister's view, this pronouncement sits well with President Bill Clinton's intention of speaking up for minorities in the Baltic countries, a subject which was also discussed at the Moscow summit. Andrey Kozyrev stressed that magnanimity on the part of the Baltic authorities could hardly be counted on in this respect, any more than threats of force on the part of Russia, something which was in vogue until recently. "We are dealing with a humanitarian problem -- protection of human rights and ethnic minorities, and it needs to be treated as such," Kozyrev said. In conclusion, the minister noted with satisfaction that "our friends in the West are gradually getting used to this idea, and losing their traditional bias towards individual regions".
