Ukraine ranks the world's third in the number of nuclear warheads stationed on its territory. It is preceded only by the United States and Russia. Two types of missiles are stationed in Pervomaysk, the Nikolayev region. Part of missiles have been dismantled. The U.S. Pentagon head visited a dismantled missile silo to see a de-activated SS-24 missile. The secretary was told by Ukrainian servicemen that warheads have been removed from 30 SS-24 missiles and eleven SS-19 missiles. All in all, this will be done to 46 SS- 24 and 30 SS-19 missiles. Last year Ukrainian specialists took off duty two regiments of strategic missiles. One of them to include ten systems was withdrawn from Pervomaysk. Nuclear warheads have been dismantled and sent to technical storages, missiles have been removed from silos, fuel and oxidizer were put into special tanks, loaded into freight cars and set to the Yuzhmash plant in Dnepropetrovsk. The U.S. defence secretary visited the Yuzhmash plant, which earlier produced the world's only high-precision heavy missiles capable to deliver up to ten warheads of megaton weight. The plant and its design bureau produced four generations of intercontinental ballistic missiles and made the first artificial earth satellite of the Cosmos series together with the rocket booster. Now the plant continues to produce space equipment, simultaneously with first Ukrainian trolley-buses and wind engines.
