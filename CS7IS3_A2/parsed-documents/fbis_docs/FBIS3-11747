Actions initiated about a month ago at the "El Carmen" and "Tecun Uman" border passes are part of a demand for a 40 percent wage increase or the granting of a 300 quetzals (more or less $50) monthly bond. The takeover caused long car lines, which had to wait for the highway to the Mexican border to be cleared. The National Police (PN) also reported that security at the "La Aurora" airport had been increased given a possible takeover by state workers, who have threatened to take futher steps. Terminal Director Colonel Elfidio Diaz Solis stated that only passengers carrying travel documents as well as passports are being allowed to enter the airport. Last week, at least 300 public employees blocked all entries and exits to the airport for more than five hours, which caused considerable discomfort to foreign and national tourists. Five weeks ago, almost two months ago, the National Federation of State Workers Unions (FENASTEG) began measures pressuring for a 40 percent wage increase. So far, the government has said it is unable to approve the wage increase because of insufficient funds. Union workers have rejected these claims with their own evaluations indicating that the government does have sufficient financial resources.
