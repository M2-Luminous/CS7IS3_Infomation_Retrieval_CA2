FR941021-2-00049 FR941021-2-00036 Under the terms of the MSRP, 80 percent of the crude oil violation amounts subject to this Decision or $1,781,426.00 in principal, plus accrued interest, should be disbursed in equal shares to the states and federal government for indirect restitution. Accordingly, we will direct the DOE's Office of the Controller to transfer one-half of that amount, or $890,713.00, plus interest, into an interest bearing subaccount for the states, and one-half, or $890,713.00, plus interest, into an interest bearing subaccount for the federal government. In accordance with previous practice, when the amount available for distribution to the states reaches $10 million, we will direct the DOE's Office of the Controller to make the appropriate disbursement to the individual states. Refunds to the states will be in proportion to the consumption of petroleum products in each state during the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the funds allocated to each state is contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Agreement. When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and reporting requirements that apply to any other crude oil funds received by the states in accordance with the Stripper Well Agreement. We must also determine the appropriate method for disbursing the 20 percent of the fund available for direct restitution ($445,357). The application period for crude oil overcharge refunds ended on June 30, 1994. As we discussed in King Petroleum, Inc., Case No. LEF&hyph;0125, August 8, 1994 (Proposed Decision and Order), we will not hold a separate refund proceeding for monies that become available for direct restitution after the June 30, 1994 closing date. 59 Fed. Reg. 41755 (August 15, 1994). Therefore, the funds in this case ($445,357) will be added to the general crude oil overcharge pool for direct restitution to those applicants who applied by the June 30, 1994 deadline. It Is Therefore Ordered That: (1) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll, Office of Departmental Accounting and Financial Systems Development, Office of the Controller, Department of Energy, shall take all steps necessary to transfer $2,226,782.70, plus accrued interest, from the Mt. Airy Refining Company escrow account Number 650X00286Z, as specified in Paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of this Decision. (2) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll shall transfer $890,713.00, plus accrued interest, of the funds referenced in Paragraph (1) above, into the subaccount denominated ``Crude Tracking-States,'' Number 999DOE003W. (3) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll shall transfer $890,713.00, plus accrued interest, of the funds referenced in Paragraph (1) above, into the subaccount denominated ``Crude Tracking-Federal,'' Number 999DOE002W. (4) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll shall transfer $445,357.00, plus accrued interest, of the funds referenced in Paragraph (1) above, into the subaccount denominated ``Crude Tracking-Claimants 4,'' Number 999DOE0010Z. (5) This is a final Order of the Department of Energy. Dated: October 14, 1994. George B. Breznay, Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals.
