The figure compares with 12 percent growth in January 1993 and, considering the good start, this year's aim of 16 percent export growth is likely to be attained with ease. Samsung Electronics Co. led the pack with exports worth 630 million U.S. dollars, up 57.5 percent. Exports of home electronic appliances rose 39.1 percent to 320 million dollars and shipments of electronic parts such as D-RAM chips jumped 82.3 percent to 310 million dollars. This compares with Samsung's export target of 560 million dollars, as Japan's economic woes helped its rivals compete, a Samsung official said. Goldstar Co. exported goods worth 250 million dollars, up 40 percent, with exports to China surging 133 percent. Six million washing machines were exported, up 100 percent, and 47 million color television sets were sent overseas, up 62 percent. "The export strategy of selling mainly high-value-added products and securing new markets in the Middle East and Africa made a great contribution to the export increase," a Goldstar official said. Daewoo Electronics Co. registered exports totaling 125 million dollars, up 42 percent, chalking up gains of 83 percent and 58 percent in the Middle East and China, respectively.
