It was an opportunity for Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene to repeat what he had already said to the same audience last Thursday. The prime minister began by reaffirming that democracy is like a fragile plant. "So it requires constant vigilance and an effort on the part of each individual." Jean-Luc Dehaene also reiterated that Italy is a democratic country. "The elections took place there in full respect of the constitutional rules. Consequently, the results must be accepted," he said, adding that "the Italian Government had been formed in a legally correct manner." "Within the European Union," he went on, "Belgium will reaffirm the democratic principles and continue to be highly vigilant in ensuring that they are respected. Regarding direct bilateral contacts with foreign colleagues, it is up to each individual Belgian minister to decide on and regulate them personally, naturally within the context of Belgian European policy," the prime minister concluded. He was applauded by the entire majority, including the PS [Walloon Socialist Party], whose bureau had asked last Monday that the government adopt a clear position. At the end of the debate, the four majority parties tabled a motion pure and simple.
