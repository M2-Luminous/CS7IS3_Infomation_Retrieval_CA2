The ANC and IFP have clashed on the question of a capital for the province, with the IFP favoring Ulundi, while the ANC and the NP favor Pietermaritzburg. The ANC has gone so far as to urge members of the Executive Council to boycott meetings held in Ulundi. The leader of the NP in the province, Mr. Danie Schutte, has accused the IFP of adopting a one-sided attitude towards decision-making and said the IFP and the ANC have not yet proved that they can work together in a provincial government of national unity. Mr. Schutte also attacked the call by IFP Transvaal leader Themba Khoza for the immediate lifting of the state of emergency in KwaZulu/Natal and described it as arrogant. Citing the deaths of 45 people last week and more killings at the weekend, he said a decision to lift the state of emergency could not be taken lightly.
