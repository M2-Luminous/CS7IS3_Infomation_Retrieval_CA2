The move would amount to final acceptance by Thailand that its petrochemical industry cannot handle the swifter lowering of protectionist barriers originally envisaged under AFTA's "fast track". But Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin indicated yesterday that Thailand was not seeking permanent withdrawal of the sector from AFTA, not even on the list of exclusions that will be subject to review after eight years. He said that to do so would be a backward step that would run counter to Thailand's leadership in cutting tariffs under the AFTA programme. The Thai petrochemicals industry has been seeking a delay in the reduction of AFTA barriers ever since the basic agreements were signed at the ASEAN summit in Singapore in January 1992. The industry argues that it cannot compete without the protection of tariff barriers because the natural gas that it uses as a raw material is considerably more expensive than the supplies used by Malaysia and Indonesia, partly because of the length of the undersea pipe that brings the gas from the Gulf of Thailand to Rayong. Some industries that use petrochemicals as raw materials, such as textiles, have argued strongly against retaining protection for petrochemicals. They say that the retention of tariff barriers makes their costs higher than those of their competitors in other ASEAN countries where petrochemicals supplies are cheaper. Officials say privately that Thailand under the first Anand Panyarachun government initially agreed to put petrochemicals on the "fast track" as a result of a challenge from Indonesia and Malaysia. During negotiations on the creation of the free trade area, the other ASEAN countries are said to have argued that Thailand was the most protectionist of the six. They therefore reportedly challenged Thailand to demonstrate its seriousness by agreeing to put the sensitive petrochemicals sector on the fast track. All along, some sections of the bureaucracy have questioned whether the Anand government's position was justified, and yesterday's decision by a Finance Ministry-led subcommittee appears to reflect the feeling. The sub-committee decided to send delegates to negotiate with Indonesia and Malaysia to keep petrochemical industries on the "normal track" list. Mr Tharin admitted the two countries are opposed to the idea. An alternative proposal would be for all three countries to put petrochemical industries under AFTA's exclusion list. This, in effect, protects their petrochemical industries for another eight years until the exclusion lists are reviewed. Officials from several countries have warned that putting sectors on the exclusion list will require swifter adjustments since the present intention is for tariffs to drop sharply back on schedule after the eight years of exclusion. Under the regular "normal" and "fast" tracks tariffs are cut gradually in steps of five percentage points over the relevant periods. Mr Tharin said yesterday he believes that keener competition over this sector would not affect Thailand. Thai entrepreneurs are capable of competing with neighbouring countries provided that the competition is on a level playing field. The conclusions reached by the sub-committee have been submitted to Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, who is in charge of international trade negotiations, he said. Mr Tharin added that Dr Suphachai's compromise proposal to protect petrochemical industries for another five years would be considered as a backup proposal if Malaysia and Indonesia disagreed with the Ministry of Finance's initiative. But Mr Suphachai's proposal would adversely affect Singapore as its petrochemical industry is more open than any other ASEAN country. The sub-committee also considered revising the taxation on raw materials, including LPG. The move was aimed at reducing the costs of raw materials which would enhance the sector's chance of competing. In the long run local plastic industries should be able to compete with imported products, and Thai tariffs should not be too high, Mr Tharin said. He would submit the sub-committee's proposals to the Board of Investment at its next meeting.
