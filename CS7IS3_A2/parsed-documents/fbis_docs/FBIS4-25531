He made these remarks in an interview here this morning with Hatsuhisa Takashima, chief commentator of the Japan Broadcasting Corporation [NHK]. Jiang said: "It is China's consistent stand that it needs enough patience to find a solution to such a complicated issue on the Korean peninsula. "We should keep calm at a time when it is more difficult and urge all parties concerned to exercise restraint and act with caution," he said. Jiang said the goal for the settlement of the issue is finally to safeguard peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and realize denuclearization. No matter what temporary difficulties may appear, he said, it is possible to find a proper solution to this problem as long as these two major objectives are not departed from. Jiang said it is imperative to see that the door for negotiation is not completely closed, adding that there still exist possibilities of holding dialogue. He urged all parties concerned to take positive measures so as to avoid acceleration of the crisis and not to make all parties' efforts wasted. Jiang said China is not in favor of imposing sanctions because that is useless for the settlement of the problem. On the contrary, he added, it would aggravate the escalation of the situation and lead to a serious consequence that all parties concerned do not want to see. He said: "It is my view that persevering in dialogue and consultations is an effective and fundamental way to solve the problem." During the more than one-hour interview, Jiang also answered questions on a series of other major international issues raised by Takashima. On Sino-U.S. relations, Jiang said that U.S. President Bill Clinton's recent delink of China's most favoured nation status with the human rights issue was beneficial to strengthening and expanding bilateral economic cooperation and trade. It conforms to the fundamental interests of the two countries and the two peoples, he said. Jiang said as long as the two sides look towards the future and the whole world, proceed from their fundamental interests, abide by the principles defined by the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques to increase mutual trust, reduce troubles, develop cooperation and not to practise confrontation, the Sino-U.S. relationship will grow smoothly and healthily.
