The United States proposes to include Marrakesh Ministerial Declaration, the clause of seeking a committment to address the link between social and labor standards towards international trade in the world trade organization. The prime minister said this when replying to a question posed to him at the news conference at the end of the fourth G-15 summit in New Delhi. He said if the U.S. and other developed nations insist on imposing a global minimum wage, it will not be advantageous to the South nations. He pointed out that cheap labor is the only comparative advantage the developing world has against the developed nations. The developed countries on the other hand, have full advantages, namely, capital, technological knowhow, management and marketing know-how, and huge domestic markets.
