They are accused by the budget CPI [Congressional Investigative Committee] of embezzlement and malfeasance in office. While the defense witnesses for Deputy Cid Carvalho were testifying before the Constitution and Justice Committee, Carvalho presented his resignation to the committee. He said he resigned because he cannot defend himself against the budget CPI accusations. [Begin recording] [Carvalho] I am ready to be processed under a common civil court, under which I will be tried anyway. [Unidentified reporter] Does this mean the end of your political career? [Carvalho] Yes. [end recording] This was the first resignation of the morning. Later the plenary hall was informed that two other deputies charged with the same crimes also presented their resignation. They are Deputies Manoel Moreira from the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement] Sao Paulo, and Joao Alves, who was expelled from the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] of Bahia. The three deputies resigned two months after the budget CPI decided to judge them. The final CPI report accuses the three of embezzlement and malfeasance in office. This is why it requested that they be stripped of their political rights for lack of decorum. By resigning, the deputies avoid undergoing a political trial and a sentence forbidding them to run for elections for three years. The Constitution and Justice Committee which met today to approve the stripping of political rights of Deputy Joao Alves was taken by surprise by his decision. Committee rapporteur Deputy Moroni Torgan was this morning trying to make the committee members vote on the issue by alleging that the resignation is irrevocable only when it is published in the congressional bulletin, which has yet not happened. [Begin Deputy Thomaz Nono, president of the Constitution and Justice Committee recording] I have listened to the committee. As I said before, our action is merely political. The only thing the Chamber of Deputies can do is to strip him of his political rights. When a deputy resigns like this, even though he may deny it, in practice he is really confessing his guilt and loosing his mandate which is the political sentence that the Chamber of Deputies would have imposed on him.
