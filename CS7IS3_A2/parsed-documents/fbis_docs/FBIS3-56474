Chubays Keeps His Status"] [Text] The president has sharply thickened the plot of appointments to a new cabinet by his edict yesterday under which Anatoliy Chubays stays on as chairman of the State Committee for the Management of State Property and is appointed deputy chairman of the Russian Government "over and above the number of deputies determined by the edict of 10 January." Vladimir Mau, aide to Yegor Gaydar, says that the confirmation of Anatoliy Chubays' status is in line with the provision of the 1991 law on privatization stating that head of the State Committee for the Management of State Property simultaneously has vice premier status. Thus, the decision that Chubays should keep his "privatization minister" office has automatically led to keeping him in the number of government leaders. Remarkably, his status is now in fact higher than that of the other deputy chairmen because the president decided his fate apart from the government as a whole. According to unofficial information, Chubays's appointment came as a surprise also for the head of the cabinet. If one is to stay in the legal fairway, certain conclusions can be drawn from the reservation that Anatoliy Chubays was appointed "over and above" the quota of deputy government chairmen set three days before that (four vice premiers). The president's edict sets down a 4+N formula of the number of vice premiers. This was also indirectly confirmed yesterday by Vladimir Shumeyko, elected chairman of the Federation Council, who let it be known that the Russian political Olympus is inclined to regard leaders of the Federation Council as having been "posted" from their former jobs. Thus he can nominally keep his position of first deputy premier, in which case the number of deputy chairmen grows to six. Amending one edict by another increases chances of unexpected decisions. It has become known from sources close to the president that another vice premier, Aleksandr Shokhin, is seen as a candidate for the position of minister for cooperation with CIS member countries, but he cannot keep his vice premier rank. Shokhin's realm has already been dealt a painful blow. The Russian Agency for International Cooperation and Development, whose chairman he was, has been placed under the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations with the obscure status of a "state institution." Neither does Shokhin have any chances whatever to take the place of the premier's long-time friend Oleg Davydov as head of the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations. Shokhin, tipped as a candidate for the head of the Duma's international affairs committee, let it be known guardedly, after the Duma session yesterday, that he did not rule out chances of filling the post of minister for CIS affairs. His uneasiness about whether this position would include vice premier rank was betrayed by the persistently repeated idea that "relations with the CIS should be directed by a specially trained vice premier." It is not clear whether one more vice premier, Boris Fedorov, would be able to carry into effect his plans of control over the entire financial sphere including the steering of the ruble rate policy and the external debt problem. Fedorov announced a press conference for 18 January (the composition of the government is to be announced on 17 January) where he is expected to announce whether he is happy with the position of finance minister which, according to its status, has always measured up to that of a vice premier.
