NODONG SINMUN today brands the "trinity" as a slogan of the puppet authorities and comprador entrepreneurs to crack down on the workers' struggle for wage hike and vital rights under the pretext of "economic stability" and "increase of competitiveness." The news analyst says: That day the traitor Kim Yong-sam preached "labor-management harmony", saying rather "humane treatment" is necessary than wage hike in order to make this year "the first year free from labor-management disputes." This is quite ill-intentioned. By "labor-management harmony" he meant that the workers must refrain from any demand and any protest but meekly yield to the exploitation by the employers. Kim Yong-sam told the businessmen that he would loosen the "regulations" obstructive to business activities to the extent that the employers are satisfied. Although Kim Yong-sam wants the workers to work silently without protesting to the "government" and the employers, it is a futile dream. The South Korean workers and people will not be cheated by the traitor's sermon on "labor-management harmony" and "trinity" but rise up courageously in the struggle to overthrow the "civilian"-veiled regime.
