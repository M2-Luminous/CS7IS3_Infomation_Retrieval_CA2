FR941206-0-00068 FR941206-0-00011 (9) The frequency for calibrating the temperature monitor used for catalytic oxidizers and thermal oxidizers has been reduced from once per month to twice per year. (10) Several commenters requested clarification of the general provisions to part 63 as they relate to this rule. A table identifying the relationship of the final General Provisions requirements has been added to the final regulation. Language similar to that in the General Provisions has been added to subpart O in cases where a direct reference to the General Provisions was not appropriate. (11) Based on comments received, an excess emissions report is required semi-annually, whether the source has experienced excess emissions or not; the Administrator may determine on a case basis that more frequent reporting is necessary. (12) Revisions to definitions and phrasing have been made to clarify the regulation. One topic for which comments were received that did not result in a change in the regulation concerned hospital sterilization. Several comments were received that recommended the inclusion of hospital ethylene oxide sterilization operations under the standards promulgated in today's action. While the EPA listed ``commercial sterilization facilities'' and ``hospital sterilization facilities'' as two separate categories on the proposed source category list, hospital sterilizers were removed from the final source category list and only commercial sterilization facilities were included on the list. Section 112(c) specifies that the source category list will periodically be revised, and hospitals (with EO emissions greater than 1 ton/yr) may be added to the source category list at a future date. Hospital sterilization sources (under 1 ton/yr ethylene oxide emissions) will likely be assessed as part of section 112(k) of the Act. IV. Administrative Requirements A. Docket The Docket is an organized and complete file of all the information considered by the EPA in the development of this rulemaking. The Docket is a dynamic file, since material is added throughout the rulemaking development. The docketing system is intended to allow members of the public and industries involved to readily identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participate in the rulemaking process. Along with the statement of basis and purpose of the proposed and promulgated standards and the EPA responses to significant comments, the contents of the Docket will serve as the record in case of judicial review (section 307(d)(7)(A)). B. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq . and have been assigned OMB control number (2060&hyph;0283). An Information Collection Request (ICR) document has been prepared by the EPA (ICR No. 1666.02) to reflect the changed information requirements of the final rule. This collection of information has an estimated burden per affected facility of about 510 hours for the first year. In subsequent years, the burden is approximately 60 hours per affected facility. These burden estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Mail Code 2136); 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' C. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), the EPA is required to judge whether a regulation is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of this Executive Order to prepare a regulatory impact analysis (RIA). The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs, or the rights and obligation of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is not ``significant'' because none of the listed criteria apply to this action. Consequently, this action was not submitted to OMB for review under Executive Order 12866. D. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .) requires the EPA to consider potential impacts of proposed regulations on small business ``entities.'' If a preliminary analysis indicates that a proposed regulation would have a significant economic impact on 20 percent or more of small entities, then a regulatory flexibility analysis must be prepared. The EPA's analysis of these impacts was provided in the preamble to the proposed rule (59 FR 10591).
