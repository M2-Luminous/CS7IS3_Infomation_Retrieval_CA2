RENMIN RIBAO and XINHUA already have sent reporting teams to Qiandao Lake to cover the story. In light of the requirement to "seek truth from facts," they will cover the news jointly and will present the truth of the matter to the public at home and abroad. During an interview given to a reporter, an official in charge of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS] said that ARATS had already send a message to the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], giving a detailed account of the Qiandao Lake incident. Throughout the handling of the Qiandao Lake incident, the official said, ARATS has played a role of offering information to the SEF and of passing on the SEF's messages to the relevant mainland departments. ARATS already has proposed the SEF that the two organizations will hold a routine meeting as quickly as possible to discuss the question of protecting the lives and property of compatriots on both sides of the strait. As ARATS is not authorized to handle the question of compensating the victims of the Qiandao Lake incident, he said, Taiwan's travel agency and the victims' relatives should consult with the mainland insurance company and travel agency on the matter.
