However, the real situation has not developed in accordance with its wishes, and today mainland China is neither "stable" nor "secure," as shown by the fact that political disturbances have occurred one after another, the incidence of crime has remained high, social security has deteriorated, and some disturbances -- which were neither too big nor too small -- have occurred from time to time. Let us have a look at the strikes which broke out in some mainland provinces during the current sessions of the National People's Congress [NPC] and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]. The Reasons Behind the Series of Strikes in Liaoning Province A number of strikes have broken out intermittently in Shenyang, Dalian, and Fushun in Liaoning Province since March. According to an analysis made by the Liaoning Provincial Government, five reasons have triggered these strikes, which include: 1) some state-owned enterprises had to be closed down, suspended, merged, or converted to other lines as a result of reform, so the interests of the staff and workers were affected; 2) the staff and workers were unable to receive their wages because enterprises performed poorly and their products were overstocked; 3) some staff and workers were forced to take a rest break for half of their working days due to the limited production quotas, and their income was reduced accordingly; 4) the staff and workers were dissatisfied with the rising prices; and 5) party and government cadres benefited more than the ordinary staff and workers in the course of reform. The Staff and Workers in Shenyang Threatened To Call a Strike in the Entire City Since last November, more than 80 enterprises and factories in Shenyang have failed to pay wages and bonuses to their staff and workers, and the lives of nearly 300,000 people have been affected. More than 180,000 staff and workers received only one-half or two- thirds of their basic salaries and were forced to rest at home for half of their working days, and this has created strong feelings of dissatisfaction among them. In early March, the staff and workers from more than 40 metallurgical, chemical, agricultural machinery, and pharmaceutical enterprises conducted a slow-down in Shenyang. Some of them held rallies to present petitions to the city or provincial governments, airing their grievances against inflation, price increases, and opposing the merger and stoppage of enterprises. On 11 March, approximately 20 enterprises and units spontaneously sent a cable to the State Council, proposing that the interests of staff and workers be protected during structural reform and that their position as masters of the country be strengthened. On 15 March, the staff and workers from some chemical enterprises in Shenyang lodged a petition with the city government, in which they proclaimed that enterprises and factories belonged to the working class, and everything in them belonged to the ranks of staff and workers, and they included the slogans "down with the newly emerging nobility!" and "eradicate the new bureaucratic bourgeoisie!" The strike spread to 40 enterprises and factories, and the staff and workers even threatened to go on strike throughout the city and province to protest against inflation and the closing down, stoppage, merger, and conversion of enterprises. They called for the right to administer enterprises and factories. Up to the present, the staff and workers from over 30 enterprises and factories have applied to the provincial government to hold rallies in the Workers' Cultural Palace, Zhongshan Park, Nanhu Park, and the Martyrs' Mausoleum, and have called on the government to immediately put an end to the closing down, stoppage, merger, and conversion of state-owned enterprises. They also called on the government to carry out the guidelines of the central authorities to vest in representatives of staff and workers the right to participate in making policy decisions regarding factories, mines, and enterprises. In addition, they called on the government to ensure that any default in payment of their salaries, bonuses, and allowances would be avoided in the future, inflation would be checked, their living standards would be enhanced, and their material benefits would be increased. Some 10,000 Staff and Workers Planned To File a Petition in Beijing The staff and workers in Shenyang planned to enlist 10,000 people and chartered eight trains to carry them to Beijing to present a petition. As the event further deteriorated, the provincial government reported the case to the secretary of the provincial party committee and governor, who were attending the NPC and CPPCC sessions, and asked for instructions from the State Council. As instructed by the State Council, the provincial leader Gu Jinchi flew back to Shenyang on the afternoon of 16 March to handle the affair. Trade Union in Fushun Called for Reorganizing the Leading Body of the City Government The coal mine in Fushun, Liaoning intended to cut 20,000 miners. For this reason, a dozen cases of slowdown actions and petitions have been reported since the middle of February. The provincial government had to give the miners a pledge that not one single person would be reduced and there would be no default in the payment of workers' wages, bonuses, and allowances. The official trade union of the Fushun Chemical Plant acted as the representative of the staff and workers to request a 50 percent wage increase and an upward readjustment of factory prices for their products, and to express their opposition to importing chemical fertilizers, which has made an onslaught on the domestic market. The trade union also called for reorganizing the leading body of the city government. Over 300 Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Lodged a Petition to the Provincial Party Committee Several strikes have broken out in factories, mines, and enterprises in some cities of Shaanxi Province, including Xian, Xianyang, and Baoji since the second half of February. In mid- March, the strikes further escalated, and over 300 factories, mines, and enterprises in Xianyang, Baoji, Hanzhong, and Yanan lodged petitions with the provincial party committee. Enterprise party committees and trade unions were among the units lodging the petitions and in some cases even acted as the leading petitioners. On 16 March, some party and government leaders from Shaanxi Province, who were attending the NPC and CPPCC sessions, hurried back to Xian to deal with the situation. Over 700 Cadres in Sichuan Ask for Leave One-third of cadres working in 25 departments and offices under the Sichuan Provincial CPC Committee and Government will be reduced in the first half of this year. After the news was confirmed, over 700 cadres asked for sick leave, annual leave, and leave to attend to private affairs since 10 March, and on 14 and 15 March, another nine commissions and offices under the provincial authority had to suspend work due to large numbers of people asking for leave. The party committee and government reported this emergency to the leading cadres attending the two sessions in Beijing, and principal provincial leader Xiao Yang immediately returned to Chengdu to handle the affair. Luo Gan, secretary general of the State Council also went to Sichuan to get acquainted with the situation there. It has been learned that there were similar conditions in Chongqing, Yibin, and other cities. Jiang Zemin and Li Peng Stress the Importance of Stability The above strikes broke out during the NPC and CPPCC sessions and shocked the CPC hierarchy. When Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Qiao Shi met persons in charge of Liaoning, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Qinghai, and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, who were attending the two sessions, they all stressed that stability was necessary in all localities, that reforms should promote and be beneficial to stability, and that the importance of stability should be properly stressed. They also said that reform measures and policies would have an impact on stability; hence, where stability was seriously affected, reform should be decisively suspended or stopped. This should be regarded as a cardinal principle. Jiang Zemin said: Reform must be carried out under a stable situation, within the tolerance of the vast number of staff and workers, and with their support; otherwise, the desired goals of reform will not be achieved.
