Early last year Mayor Yu Zhengsheng led a delegation to Hong Kong where he announced a package of projects available for investors. Later, Qingdao sent missions to countries including the United States, the Republic of Korea (ROK), Singapore, Russia and Germany for the same purpose. At the same time, foreign trade companies in Qingdao have reformed and readjusted their operation and management methods in their accounting, labor and distribution systems.

Experiments in joint-stock systems and setting up foreign trade groups engaging in industrial, agricultural and technical production have been made in this port city in a bid to expand markets internationally. Light industry, food and edible oil, and textile companies have set up permanent offices in Russia, the ROK, Japan and Argentina. The city now has over 30 sales agencies overseas. Last year 17 trade and industrial enterprises in the city each exported over 10 million U.S. dollars-worth of goods. Qingdao now has over 300 foreign-funded enterprises which are export-oriented. Qingdao exports mainly to Hong Kong and developing countries in Latin American, African and Asian countries. Last year its exports to Japan reached 230 million dollars-worth, exceeding the value of exports to Hong Kong and making Japan Qingdao's biggest foreign trade partner. The year 1993 also witnessed a big increase in foreign investment. Some 1,629 foreign-funded projects were approved by the city, with contracted foreign funds totalling 1.85 billion U.S. dollars.
