FBIS4-52232 "dreas089_m_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-089 Daily Report 7 May 1994 Thailand Extradition Sought for 2 Bombing Suspects Extradition Sought for 2 Bombing Suspects BK0705103294 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 7 May 94 p 1 BK0705103294 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] Two more suspects are wanted in connection with a spate of bombing attacks in the South and Thailand is seeking their extradition as they have been hiding in a foreign country, Deputy Interior Minister Chamni Sakdiset said yesterday. Mr. Chamni did not name the suspects or the country. He said Southern Border Provinces Administration Centre director Wisut Singkachonworakun told Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut yesterday that police were gathering evidence against the two in order to seek their extradition. However, a source in the South named them as Domae or Romae Bron and Mada-o or Ro-seng Krongpinang and said they had been hiding in Malaysia. Four Islamic teachers in Songkhla's Chana District were arrested on Wednesday and charged with taking part in eight different bomb attacks from May 1991 to March 1994, rebellion and premeditated murder. Gen. Chawalit said yesterday he had ordered police handling the case against the four and the Songkhla governor to ensure fair treatment of the suspects. A number of southern New Aspiration Party MPs met him yesterday and expressed concern over the case he said. Gen. Chawalit said he told the MPs that the four would be regarded as innocent and subject to proper treatment. It would not be right for authorities not to allow their relatives to visit them or have them handcuffed. The case must be dealt with as quickly as possible to prevent further problems. The minister believes there will be no protests over the arrest. The chairman of the Association of Islamic Schools yesterday warned authorities concerned to be careful in their handling of the case against the four teachers. Nidir Waba said if the charges against the suspects were proved groundless, problems would follow. He said the arrest of the four had affected the image of Ponoh schools -- private schools teaching Islam -- in the South. Dr. Ismael Ali, director of the Islamic College of the Prince of Songkla University, said the arrest of the four was intended to discredit private schools teaching Islam and their teachers. He said he knew the four well because they were his juniors while he was studying in Saudi Arabia. "All of them are good men. I doubt the possibility of their having committed such serious crimes," he said. The four suspects are Sa-ali or Ali or Sali Hamanapden, Mut or Hamase or Mut Loman, Suroma or Daman Leduwi and Ya or Kaya or Sakariya Hamanapden. Muk Sulaiman, a New Aspiration Party MP for Pattani, said Gen Chawalit was not happy about the arrest. He said he personally believed that incidents in the South were a result of dissatisfaction with Police Chief Gen. Pratin Santipraphop. The arrest of the four might lead to a protest, Mr. Muk said. He would be a defence lawyer for the four. Ahseed Phithakkhumphon, chairman of the Islamic Committee of Songkhla, yesterday went to meet Songkhla Governor Yuwat Wuthimethi and asked to know the facts behind the arrests. Mr. Ahseed said people of Chana District felt hurt by what happened to the four and were about to protest when they first heard about it but he asked them to stay calm. He said Islamic leaders were still shocked by the arrest which was quite unexpected. He said: "I can speak on behalf of fellow Muslim people that we would not protect wrongdoers. Wrongdoers must be dealt with according to the law. But what just happened was unexpected."
