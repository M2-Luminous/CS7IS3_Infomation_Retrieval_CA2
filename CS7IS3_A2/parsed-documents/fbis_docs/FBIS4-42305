During his five-year stint at the Foreign Office, the Diplomatic Service has been transformed from concerns about war and peace to the more routine considerations of the trade balance. Sitting in the regal splendour of the Foreign Office, Hurd explains: "Twenty years ago it would be some fellow down the corridor who would deal with trade. But this is the life I now lead. I've become a tradesman. It's extremely interesting and I've learned a lot." The change is largely the result of a joint initiative with the Department of Trade and Industry, known as "Overseas Trade Services," which began three years ago. The co-operative venture has had an immense impact on the Diplomatic Service, with the more senior ambassadors now devoting as much as a third of their time to promoting British exports. The export drive means that reporting back from a diplomatic posting to the Foreign Secretary in London takes on a wholly different dimension. Mr Hurd explains: "Exports are a test of how well it's going. Every time I see an ambassador now, I have in my brief what the exports are -- and the subject always comes round to that." A fifth of British diplomats abroad are engaged fulltime in commercial work, while nearly half of the locally-recruited staff are businessmen and women employed as commercial officers, actively seeking out opportunities for British exporters. At present staff issue about 200 export-intelligence leads every day which are faxed to a central clearing house, sorted and sent directly to the relevant British businesses which have subscribed to the service. People abroad are matched by a staff of 100 specialist export promoters in London, seconded from blue-chip businesses, to seek out overseas opportunities and follow up with assistance to the exporting companies. The services cost from 15 pounds up to 1,000 pounds depending on requirements. But they can be very effective. As a result, Britain has sold vintage cars to Japan, electronics to Germany and an authentic English pub to the Danes. But Hurd also recognises a wider, more delicate, role for the diplomatic service. "The big foreign contracts become political contracts," he says. As a result the ambassador is put "on the front line between business and politics." To win these contracts for Britain "it is important to know who decides, who has his ear, what will influence the decision, who is important to him and what our competitors are doing." Such big prizes are often backed up by ministerial visits, sometimes involving the pomp and ceremony of the Royal Family. Last November, the Royal Yacht Britannia was moored in Bombay harbour in India while 1 billion pounds worth of contracts were signed involving more than 300 British businessmen representing 100-plus firms. The Queen, Mr Major and the Indian premier looked on. In July, Michael Heseltine, the President of the Board of Trade, will lead a similar delegation of businessmen to South Africa. Hurd believes British overseas exports could be about to undergo a renaissance, capitalising on the country's early lead in privatising public assets. His office points to Severn Trent and North West Water who are supplying water to Mexico City, while British Gas has signed a 300 million pound contract in Chile to operate the Trans-Andean gas pipeline. "I dare say we will make mistakes, but it's very exciting witnessing a new generation of British investors and entrepreneurs," he says.
