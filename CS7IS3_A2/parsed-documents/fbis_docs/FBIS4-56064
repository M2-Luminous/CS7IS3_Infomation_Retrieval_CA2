They wish to form a coalition with the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], and this will have to be decided by the programs. Personal issues cannot be of major importance. [Bak] The interior minister expressed his indignation because you had cast doubt over the police's unbiased investigation and had not excluded the possibility of premeditated attack. This phase of the investigation was closed last week. Are you more relaxed now? [Horn] The television program "A Het" has adhered to its former practice and again failed to ask me. I would have told them that the police had not supported its claim with anything. This is the reason we do not consider the investigation closed. The statements made by the car's passengers were not taken into consideration. [Bak] According to the police, apart from personal guard Jeno Zsidey, no one else mentioned any phenomena that might cast doubt on the accident verdict. According to our information, others have mentioned similar things. [Horn] I am not familiar with the statements by the others, but I also saw the flash. I told this to the policeman in Miskolc. I am sorry the police issued a statement the day after the accident and it did not want to change this later. [Bak] In fact, statements that were contradictory in certain details have been published. [Horn] This is true. Make no mistake, we are not seeking anything in the background. We would have preferred the police to make an official statement when all details were known. This is one of the reasons the MSZP is not leaving events at that. [Bak] According to a recent view, it is a conscious goal of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] for the MSZP to gain as big a majority as possible because then the SZDSZ would not join it in a coalition. [Horn] I cannot see much change in the MDF's style. It continues to see the MSZP as its main opponent, although the MDF is unlikely to be in competition in the second round. It is useless to frighten the citizens with our "too much of a victory." We will find out after the elections who can work together with whom. Regardless of our results, we still want a coalition. [Bak] Many members of the SZDSZ are worried that the MSZP will achieve a parliamentary majority on its own and then the SZDSZ will have very little say in the decisions. [Horn] Politics is not pure mathematics. Those who are afraid of our "too much of a victory" -- for example the MDF -- take themselves as an example. In our view, a political style that is different from the current one is the basis of the coalition. [Bak] In multiparty parliamentary systems, the decisive majority of a single party is undesirable. [Horn] Very clear rules of cooperation are needed between the partners. What the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] says, namely that it only bears responsibility for the government's decisions in proportion to its weight in the coalition, cannot be repeated. Without the KDNP, many harmful laws could not have been made. Anyway, what should we do? Shall we say to the voters that you have voted for us but do not do it again? [Bak] On which points do you see much difference in the programs? [Horn] It is important what we do with the distribution systems, namely the health service and social security. There is a difference in the programs on creating workplaces. In our view, it is not enough to stimulate the enterprises to create workplaces. We see this as an overall government program. In my view, there is a good chance of achieving agreement on this issue. [Bak] In your view, how united is the SZDSZ in the desire to form a coalition? [Horn] They have a big debate. I have spoken to many of their leaders in recent days. In my experience, some of them definitely want to participate in the coalition. However, it is impossible without compromises. [Bak] The MSZP also has debates. To what extent will these influence the future talks? [Horn] A small part of the membership and the politically influential people dispute the views of the majority. This equally applies to the so-called liberal and the popular-national wings. Both of these are a negligible minority compared with the center but their voice is always louder. [Bak] Do you agree that your accident was useful to a number of people in the party? To a certain extent, you have been pushed into the background compared to others. [Horn] This would be true if I was mentally less able than before. I would not like to upset anyone but I am on the same level as before. [Bak] Nevertheless, you are restricted from participating in daily politics. [Horn] The doctors asked me to take it easy in the interest of rehabilitation. However, the injury did not influence the big issue, namely the elections that were decided a few days after the accident. I am to participate in a number of campaign debates in the coming days. I know that viewers will have some aesthetic hardship looking at my "spaceship gear." Perhaps some will believe that I get inspiration through this. As a matter of fact, in my view, it would not alter the results if the parties did not campaign between the two rounds. It is unlikely that people who have decided whom to vote for can be influenced now. The general public is not much interested in the messages sent by the political elite to each other.
