Ten CPPCC members made speeches at the meeting. Wang Zhaoguo, Qian Zhengying, Sun Fuling and Henry Ying-tung Fok presided over the meeting. Also present were Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua and some ministers. Shi Ningsun, member of the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, called for curbing inflation. "To maintain social stability and ensure a healthy growth of the national economy, the most important thing to do is to curb inflation," he said. Luo Yuanzheng, professor of the Beijing Institute of Economics, called for a vigorous development of an export-oriented economy. Chuang Wing-king from Hong Kong called for the government to adopt preferential policies for the five provinces and autonomous regions in northwest China and encourage them to explore CIS, West Asian and Western European markets through Xinjiang. Tsui Sze-man, chairman of the Mirror Post Cultural Enterprises Corp., Ltd. of Hong Kong, said any attempt to introduce a premature administration of Hong Kong by Hong Kong people under the pretext of accelerating the democratization of Hong Kong violates China's sovereignty, goes against the aspirations of the Chinese people and is doomed to fail, he said. "Whenever British colonialists leave a country or region, they are sure to create problems and adopt policies aimed at dividing the local people. This has been experienced by the people of Hong Kong," he said. Wang Wenguang, vice-chairman of the Jiu San Society, called on the government to increase expenditures on the application and commercialization of scientific and technological findings, establish a technology market and enact a relevant law. CPPCC members Wang Xihua, Wu Jing, Zhu Shuhao and Kang Ling also made speeches at the meeting.
