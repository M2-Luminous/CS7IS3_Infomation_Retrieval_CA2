In the interview, he also said he was doubtful about how far China would go in taking concerted steps with Japan, the United States, and South Korea to resolve the issue. In late March, the UN Security Council issued a presidential statement calling on North Korea to accept international inspections of its nuclear facilities. Commenting on the opinion that China took the initiative in issuing the presidential statement, the New Zealand deputy prime minister denied that China took any initiative, saying, "Other nations decided to issue that presidential statement out of consideration for China." In calling China the "player who holds the key," he stressed the need to continue the efforts to urge China to get involved in the issue.
