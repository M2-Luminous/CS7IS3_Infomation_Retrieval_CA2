The ministry said the measure must be extended because North Korea has kept heightening tension on the peninsula by reinforcing its military training. The ministry decided to watch North Korea's military moves by operating a 24-hour security monitoring system on the Korean peninsula. Meanwhile, the ministry lifted the special state of alert, ordered for President's Kim Yong-sam's visits to Japan and China, as of 5:30 P.M. last Wednesday.
