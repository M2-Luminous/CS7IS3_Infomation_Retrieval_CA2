The report is characterized by a harsh tone throughout its entirety. However, it is questionable whether the report's message has any persuasiveness, particularly when Japan is currently being harshly criticized abroad for the lack of openness in its markets. Taking into consideration the trade policies of the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton, MITI took the trouble to include in its report a topic entitled "The Problems of Results-Oriented Criteria" to put up a counterargument based on logical reasoning against U.S. trade policies. Harsh expressions can be found throughout the report. For example, the report refers to U.S. trade policy as "tantamount to a single country serving both the roles of judge and prosecutor and lacking in due process." MITI's stance as indicated in this report is due to its concern that "a results-oriented way of thinking can easily turn into managed trade." In fact, even though the same problems were pointed out in last year's report, the Clinton administration's policies turned out to be what Japan had feared. For example, the Clinton administration, among other actions, reinstated the Super 301 provision (for determining and taking counteraction against unfair traders and trade practices) of the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act. What is emphasized as the basis of Japanese assertions is GATT, which Japan considers the "Constitution for International Trade," and the new World Trade Organization (WTO), for the establishment of which an agreement was concluded not so long ago. MITI then urges in its report to actively utilize the process of settling disputes through the WTO. While there should be no argument against such "idealistic thoughts," why then are Japanese assertions hard to understand? Even if the primary objective of the report is not necessarily to point out "unfairness" in Japanese markets, it goes without saying that the least Japan can do to gain understanding from its trading partners is to show that it is not reluctant at all at striving to open its markets to foreign access. However, the lack of openness of the Japanese markets is not the only problem. There have been only two instances when Japan took its case to GATT for review under the latter's regulations. In particular, when a problem arises between Japan and the United States, Japan resorts to bilateral negotiations rather than turning to international rules. It has opted for "ambiguous measures" as represented by the semiconductor agreement and voluntary restraint agreement on automobile exports. A GATT report of investigation into trade policies has criticized Japan, saying "unless it is in line with the principle of a multilateral trade system which includes a nondiscriminatory rule, a bilateral settlement undermines the multilateral trade system itself as well as confidence in the system." Therefore, Japan, which has succumbed to U.S. pressure, cannot help but be labeled in international trade circles as a country that "acts contrary to its words." If Japan has made changes to its previous stance, then it should actively try to make that known. Above all, it must show that through action, or else the rest of the world will not be convinced. Even should the logic which the report bases its assertions on be valid, it can be said the problem lies in how to carry out the policies the report advocates. Otherwise, the report would only focus on counterarguments and tend to invite results which are contrary to its aim to "present a framework for bringing about constructive solutions to disputes due to trade frictions which often invite illogical confusion."
