[Signed] Brigadier General Reynaldo Andino Flores, defense minister. Explanation of Motives The proposal that has been presented is based on the need to replace conscription with enlistment for educational, social, humanitarian, and democratic purposes. This enlistment should spark and stimulate the interest of Honduran youths in developing their human potential and engaging in military training to defend the homeland. Once the constitutional amendment is ratified and enacted, enlistment for educational purposes should be developed into a secondary law to regulate its organization and operation. With the proposed constitutional amendment, the president of the Republic makes good a pledge made to the Honduran people that he would substantially change military service. I have no doubts that the proposal to amend Article 276 of the Constitution, whose essential basis and justification we have presented, will be approved by the National Congress with the majority required by our Constitution. [Signed] Brigadier General Reynaldo Andino Flores, defense minister. This is the text of the proposed amendment. Decree No. Whereas the Honduran people's duty to defend and serve the homeland -- a duty set forth by Article 38 of the Constitution -- can be complied with through military service or any of the various civil services that citizens must render according to their merits and capabilities, as demanded by the country's fundamental needs; Whereas Honduran society's evolution demands a revision of the criteria with which military service has traditionally been complied with, and this compliance should be regarded by the people, particularly young people, as compliance with a civic duty rather than a mere demand; Whereas the Honduran people should be given the option for military service that would make it possible to reconcile the will to render it with the duty to serve and defend the homeland anywhere and under any circumstances demanded by the homeland, and the need to give the people this option cannot be delayed any longer; and Whereas the state must ensure the fulfillment of the constitutional duties assigned to the Armed Forces, and it is thus necessary for the Armed Forces to have a permanent number of compulsary members, according to the Constitution, it is therefore decreed: Article 1. Article 276 of the Constitution shall be amended to read as follows: "Article 276: Citizens between 18 and 30 years of age will serve in the Armed Forces on a voluntary basis in peacetime for educational, social, humanitarian, and democratic purposes. The state, however, retains the right to exercise conscription according to the Military Service Law. In case of international war, all Hondurans capable of defending and serving the homeland are soldiers." Article 2. For this decree to become law, it shall be ratified by the National Congress in the next regular legislature by two thirds of the total number of members and published in the gazette. Tegucigalpa, on such and such day of 1994. [Signed] The president and secretaries.
