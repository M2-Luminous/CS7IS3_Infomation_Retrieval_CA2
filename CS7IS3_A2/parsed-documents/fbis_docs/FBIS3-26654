Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan and Chen Yiping, deputy secretary general of the Central Political and Legal Commission, attended the meeting and made speeches.

It is learned that last year, political and legal departments in the municipality conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress, persisted in the party's basic line, further emancipated the mind, strengthened and reformed the judicial and security work, gave full play to their functions and role, and safeguarded the capital's political stability and social order in coordination with various other departments under the support of the broad masses of the people. As a result, a fine social environment and legal guarantee were provided for reform, opening up, and economic development, a marked progress was made in improving the style of thinking and the style of work among the ranks of judicial, procuratorial, and court workers, and the goal of "making this year's work better than last year's" was attained. Li Qiyan said: The capital's judicial and security work is very important. The good result achieved in this work last year was ascribed to the hard work of the comrades on the political and legal fronts. In this new year, our tasks on reform and development are heavy, while our tasks on judicial and security work are even heavier. To successfully accomplish these tasks, we should first of all emancipate the mind and focus the judicial and security work on ensuring the creation of a peaceful and stable social environment and ensuring the even faster development of the economy. We hope that the comrades of judicial and security fronts will enhance understanding, work hard, and use practical actions to ensure that the party's basic line is truly implemented in Beijing and ensure that Beijing will do all its work in an even better manner, with economic construction as the central link. Chen Xitong said in his speech: We must pay attention to maintaining the capital's political stability and social order by regarding it as the matter of prime importance. This is the most important task of all professions and trades in the municipality. This year, our country will set forth major measures for reform, and reform has entered the new stage of pressing ahead in an all-round way and making breakthroughs in key areas. Currently, our country's situation is very good, and the people throughout the country are high-spirited and working vigorously, thus setting off a new upsurge of construction. To ensure the implementation of reform measures and the even faster development of the economy, a peaceful and stable social environment is indispensable. Therefore, the capital must achieve success in safeguarding political stability and maintaining social order. He added: The capital's work concerning public order must be grasped further. Generally speaking, Beijing's situation in public order is good, but it still lags behind the demand. Thus, we cannot be satisfied with it. The work concerning public order is the matter with which all the people should be concerned. We should pay attention to tackling the problems concerning public order in a comprehensive way and truly set up a network of mass participation in preventing and controlling crimes. We should also successfully maintaining public order to ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and economic construction. Chen Xitong said in conclusion: Party committees and governments at all levels must assume responsibility for security work and introduce strict responsibility system. Party committees and governments at all levels should be responsible for maintaining social order and stability, and whenever there are problems, they should be ready to face and tackle them. We should set up strict responsibility system to make all departments and regions to be responsible for "defending the land." This is the only way to mobilize the initiative of the masses. Also attending the meeting were leaders Yang Chaoshi, Meng Zhiyuan, Feng Mingwei, Shen Rendao, Sheng Liangang, Su Zhongxiang, He Fangbo, and Fan Yuanmou.
