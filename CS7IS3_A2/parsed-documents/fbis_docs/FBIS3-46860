He gave his personal assurance that army rangers positioned in Mae Ai of Chiang Mai and Mae Chan of Chiang Rai would be ready to provide protection to the villagers if fighting spills into Thailand. Lt-Gen Panthep yesterday inspected the preparation of rangers and listened to a briefing about the general situation at the Ban Rak Thai border base in Mae Chan District. An official report said some 3,000 Mong Thai Army (MTA) soldiers of warlord Khun Sa based in Mong Kan opposite Mae Chan District are facing some 4,500 troops of the United Wa State Army (UWSA) near Doi Lang opposite Mae Ai District. Fighting might erupt at any moment because the MTA wants to seize some parts of Mong Yon which is under the influence of the UWSA, the report said. The report also said that several battalions of Burmese government soldiers heading for Mong Kan have stopped their advance because they believe that the MTA might attack Tachilek township opposite Mae Sai District.
