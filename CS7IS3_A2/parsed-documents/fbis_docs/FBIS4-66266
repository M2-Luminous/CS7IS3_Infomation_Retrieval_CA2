This was the first part of a 1993 overall summary. A second section concerning the degree of trust in the Chinese, British and Hong Kong governments, and a survey of residents' confidence in the future will be made public hereafter. To evaluate Hong Kong Governor Patten, surveys basically were undertaken once per week; in 1993, 50 surveys were taken in which more than 28,600 people successfully were interviewed. The average grade given to the Hong Kong governor was 57.99. Regarding legislative councilors and political groups, a survey was made once every two months. Some 3,385 people were interviewed for the former and 3,271 people for the latter. [passage omitted] Summarizing residents' degree of support for the Hong Kong governor, as of the latter half of 1993, the degree of support was fixed at around 57 points, with less fluctuation than in 1992, indicating that residents' appraisal of Hong Kong Governor Patten himself has begun to finalize. There were two rather large fluctuations in 1993; in March there was one jump after publication of the political reform plan statutes. In October there was a seven percent rise after reading out the second administrative report. Thereafter a recovery to normal levels was seen. An analysis of the grades given to Patten finds them average. In 1992, they rose to a height of 65 points, about the same as before Wei T'u-hsin left office. The highest score given to the top 10 Legislative Council [Legco] members was around 65 points. If we compare the marks given to Legco Members to those received by the Hong Kong governor, Patten only comes in at around sixth place. From this one can see that evaluations of the Hong Kong governor himself are only average. [passage omitted] Regarding residents' appraisals of the 10 most familiar major Legco members, Tu Yeh Hsi-en still holds first place, Liu Hui-ch'ing second, Liu Ch'ien-shih is often in third or fourth. The others, such as Li Chu-ming, Chou Liang Shu-ch'ia, Si-tu Hua, Huang Hung-fa and Li P'eng-fei are all on the list. Tu Yao-tsung has been on the list for nearly one-half a year now. Regarding degrees of recognition, the top 10 Legco members are all recognized by about 70 percent to 80 percent of residents, about 20 percent higher than the political groups, indicating that more residents recognize Legco members than political groups. Analyzing the marks received by various political parties and groups, the Hong Kong Alliance still occupies first place, the Hui Tien second, and for nearly one-half year now the Freedom Party and Workers Union have vied for third and fourth place. Fifth place is contended for by the Min-chien Lien and the Tsu-Min Lien. It is noteworthy that the marks political parties received were generally lower than those received by Legco members, indicating that residents still have rather low knowledge of political parties. However, they are somewhat better known than at the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994. [passage omitted]
