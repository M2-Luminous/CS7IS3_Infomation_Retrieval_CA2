William Perry received this present from a representative of the Belarussian Optical Mechanical Association (BELOMO) which is now mastering peace-time production. The BELOMO together with the "Integral" association and the Association of Computing machinery, will cooperate with American firms in the field of conversion of the defense industry to peace-time production. According to William Perry, the United States is prepared to earmark 10 million U.S. dollars to Belarus for the implementation of the conversion program. A special tender was carried out in the United States whose winners will cooperate with the three Belarussian production associations. Now the United States is getting down to business, the U.S. defense minister said commenting on the signing of the conversion documents and the establishment of the joint American-Belarussian committee which will control conversion issues. "We have been coming to this for almost two years," Defense Minister of Belarus Pavel Kozlovskiy noted. The process of conversion will include three stages: The delivery of the latest equipment to Belarussian enterprises, the organization of production of modern products and the creation of an export market," representatives of the U.S. Defense Ministry told BELINFORM. The fact that the United States have set aside 30 million U.S. dollars to Belarus, confirmed the words by Pavel Kozlovskiy that the "geographic remoteness and a different level of the economic development are not an obstacle to cooperation." According to information received from high ranking officials of the Belarussian Defense Ministry, 10 million U.S. dollars will be spent on conversion, another 10 millions U.S. dollars -- on construction of houses for servicemen, 5 million U.S. dollars -- on the destruction of conventional weapons and the remaining 5 million U.S. dollars -- on re-training of officer cadres of the Belarussian Army.
