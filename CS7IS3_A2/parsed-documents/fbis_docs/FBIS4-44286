The British message further stressed that there will be no deviation from this position, even at the extraordinary EU summit that will be held on 15 July in Brussels. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos made a statement on the issue today and told correspondents that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will assess the prerequisites for our country's representation at the extraordinary EU summit. It is recalled that the prime minister said in Corfu that our country will be represented at that summit at a lower level. At the same time, commenting on press reports that the British prime minister, speaking in the House of Commons, attributed responsibility for the failure to elect a EU Commission president to the Greek Presidency, Mr. Venizelos expressed his regret and said that if this stands it is an isolated remark that is at odds with the impression of all the other EU members.
