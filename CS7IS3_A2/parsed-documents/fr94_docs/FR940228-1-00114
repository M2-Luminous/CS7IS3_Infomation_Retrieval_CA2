FR940228-1-00114 FR940228-1-00010 The Secretary proposes that, notwithstanding the regulatory requirements for submission of reports, if an institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the institution has provided Federal Pell Grants in accordance with the Federal Pell Grant Program regulations, but has not received credit or payment for those grants, the institution may receive payment or a reduction in accountability for those grants. The institution would have to demonstrate that it qualifies for a credit or payment by means of a finding contained in an audit report as initially submitted to the Department that was conducted after December 31, 1988. The audit would have to have been timely submitted in accordance with 34 CFR 668.23(c), with respect to grants made during the period of that audit. The Secretary specifies that, in determining whether the institution qualifies for a payment or reduction in accountability, the Secretary would take into account any liabilities of the institution arising from that audit or any other source. The Secretary collects those liabilities by offset in accordance with 34 CFR part 30. Executive Order 12866 These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere in this preamble under the heading Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs. The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental function. To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The small entities affected by these proposed regulations are small institutions of postsecondary education. These regulations make modifications that reduce potential abuse in the Title IV, HEA programs. These changes will not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would impose minimal requirements to ensure the proper expenditure of program funds. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 Sections 668.8, 668.12, 668.13, 668.14, 668.15, 668.16, 668.17, 668.22, 668.23, 668.26, 690.83 and Appendix A contain information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). This NPRM contains provisions that would affect postsecondary institutions who wish to participate in the Title IV student financial assistance programs. Annual public reporting and recordkeeping burden contained in the collection of information proposed in these regulations is estimated to be 10,488 hours, including the time for searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, completing and reviewing the collection of information, and submitting materials. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington D.C. 20503; Attention Daniel J. Chenok. Invitation to Comment Interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations regarding these proposed regulations. All comments submitted in response to these proposed regulations will be available for public inspection, during and after the comment period, in room 4318, Regional Office Building 3, 7th and D Streets, SW., Washington, DC, between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week except Federal holidays. Assessment of Educational Impact The Secretary particularly requests comments on whether the proposed regulations in this document would require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States.
