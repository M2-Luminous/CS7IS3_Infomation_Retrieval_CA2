Mr. Tillet, can you give us first up your reaction to this mayhem in town? [Tillet] Good day to you, Patricia. I just wanted to correct some unfounded reports earlier on Newsbrief, linking today's march to the IFP. The march is in fact a Zulu march. It has been organized and initiated by Zulu headmen on the Reef. It has absolutely nothing to do with the IFP. [Glyn] Do you therefore distance yourself completely from the behavior of the people down there? [Tillet] Well, let me just say at the outset that we have rceived unconfirmed information from an intelligence source that there was a deliberate plot hatched to disrupt today's march, today's Zulu march, and that there were to be snipers positioned in various areas, and also individuals, agents provocateurs, planted in the march, that were intended to sow panic, mayhem, destruction, and to fire indiscriminately at marchers, so that it became impossible to know where the shots were emanating from. [Glyn] But do you, Mr. Tillet, distance yourself from the kind of behavior we have seen from this crowd today? [Tillet] We completely distance ourselves from all forms of violence whatsoever. It is very, very sad that there are agents provocateurs that have allegedly tried to disrupt today's march, evidently trying to provoke a counter-response. They have achieved exactly what they wanted to achieve -- to sow panic, mayhem, and destruction in central Johannesburg. [Glyn] Our reporters there, Mr. Tillet, seem to indicate to us that there are an awful lot of IFP supporters down there. Should they be responsible for the violence, what will your course of action be? [Tillet] Well, I would like to ask your reporter on what basis he or she comes to the conclusion that they are IFP members, but, of course, we do concede that there must be some overlapping between the Zulu marchers present and IFP members and supporters among them. There's no doubt about that. But the IFP as a political organization cannot be held responsible for a march which has been organized and initiated by the Zulu headmen in the Transvaal in support of their Zulu king's demands. [Glyn] Are you suggesting that the IFP has no influence over the Zulu nation in this part of the world? [Tillet] Yes, it does have an influence, but you know, I don't think that anybody was expecting the kind of sabotaging of today's march. It's highly unfortunate and regrettable what has happened, and I think that there will have to be an investigation, a very senior police inquiry, into the events of today that culminated in this morning's mayhem. [Glyn] Well, when you were informed of the intention of these people to go on the march, did you make any kind of request to their leaders for them to leave all their traditional weapons at home? [Tillet] Well, Zulus are perfectly entitled to bear their traditional weapons. Those are cultural weapons, and I don't think that that has got anything to do with it. I think that that is a red herring and a smokescreen that is raised by political opponents of the IFP and of the Zulu nation. [Glyn] But given the explosive nature of a situation like this, do you not think it would have been a good idea to make a plea to these people to come unarmed? [Tillet] Well, I think you are diverting the focus. Instead of focussing on the agents provocateurs that allegedly started the shooting, you are now focussing on individuals who are exercising their democratic right to participate in a march in support of their king's demands, albeit with traditional weapons. Those traditional weapons have been handed down through centuries. I cannot see how the IFP or any other organization, for that matter, including the state, can expect Zulus to abandon their traditional cultural heritage. [Glyn] Ed Tillet, thank you very much for joining us today on Newsbrief. Mr. Tillet is a spokesman for the IFP.
