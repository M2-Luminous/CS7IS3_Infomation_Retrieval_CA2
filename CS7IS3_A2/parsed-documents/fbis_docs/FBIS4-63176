Were any latter-day Ivan Shadr to think of portraying a hegemon's class impulse he could sculpt him raising a weighty volume on conflictology -- the science of settling disputes by peaceful means. Meeting for their spring seminar in Saltykovka near Moscow, the miners strenuously studied the basics of this science. The miners' extraordinary initiative required the commentary of a knowledgeable person. I found him in the shape of Emil Pain, member of the Presidential Council, who in this capacity leads the nationalities policy working group and the problems section of the president's analytical center. [Mamaladze] What do you think of it, I asked Russia's chief conflictologist. [Pain] It is very symptomatic that the miners turned to conflictology. It is as symptomatic as the signing of the social accord treaty. It looks as though the idea of accord is being confirmed in society as a significant value. You remember how back in the fall of last year words about war were widely current and various political groups called themselves fronts. Today the majority of these forces are arguing about who is more geared toward accord and who is its main expresser. [Mamaladze] And how do you explain this change? [Pain] Partly by what is called "metal fatigue." The Russians are tired not only of their own quarrels but also of conflicts in nearby foreign parts. After all, the umbilical cord of the common state has not yet been cut and everyone is feeling their pernicious consequences. To some extent the conflicts beyond Russia are saving it from its own conflicts. The experience of bloodshed is sobering. During the nine months of the Tajik conflict over 50,000 people have been killed and nearly four GNP's have been lost. Some 20,000 killed and a destroyed economy -- that is the result of the Armenian-Azerbaijani war. There is much the same "harvest" in Georgia. [Mamaladze] That is entirely correct as regards the umbilical cord. Sergey Yulyevich Vitte -- and he was from Tbilisi and knew about the matter at first hand -- said: "Until the troubles end in Russia it is impossible to end the troubles in the caucasus." If talk has turned to "salvation" then we must speak of a viewpoint quite widespread in the post-Soviet states: These conflicts are advantageous to Russia as a political lightening conductor on the one hand and on the other as a means of restoring control over key geopolitical zones. [Pain] Political interest is a leading element of all the major conflicts we know which have developed into interethnic or regional wars -- Karabakh, the Dniester Region, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Tajikistan. That means, first, the interest of seizing power when the political opposition uses outbursts of hostility to crush a rival. Second, this involves holding on to power -- those who have it use the energy of a conflict to switch dissatisfaction to particular ethnic or political groups. Finally there is the interest of expanding power, when an outside force turns interethnic or intergroup clashes into a tool for expanding its spheres of influence. In any conflict these interests are present and interwoven.. It is another question whose interests were expressed by, for instance, the Confederation of Peoples of the caucasus operating in Abkhazia or by the cossacks in the Dniester region or Abkhazia.... [Mamaladze] ...Or in Moscow in the fall of last year with an association of politicians, retired military men, and gunmen from the Dniester Region and Abkhazia for whom the conflicts blazing far from Moscow were fields for their own battles and a nutrient medium. [Pain] Yes, here too political forces came onto the state and also used outside conflicts in the interests of the struggle for power like, for instance, the internal conflicts in Georgia involving the parties of war and the Zviadist opposition. I once made a special analysis of the timetable for the opposition's acts of provocation and Shevardnadze's initiatives to reach peace in Abkhazia -- each peacemaking step was followed by a response which thwarted it. [Mamaladze] Yet the same happened with Yeltsin's initiatives. By analyzing the relevant timetables we would have obtained approximately the same picture. Incidentally, it would have reflected quite clearly the surprising synchronization of the actions of some politicians here in Moscow, the authorities in Gudaut, the Conference of Peoples of the Caucasus in the North Caucasus, and the Zviadists in Georgia. I do not think they needed the services of conflictology. [Pain] In actual fact conflictology would be suitable for everyone as long as expectations are not made excessively high, of course: The myth of the omnipotence of science is an offshoot of the myth of the omnipotence of the state. In the West conflictology is achieving quite considerable successes when the sides want to reach agreement, realizing how much they are losing from the unabating conflict situation. In ethnopolitical conflicts as a rule the groups which do not want conciliation gain the upper hand. Then apart from political interests there are operating alongside them, in parallel or interwoven, the pragmatic criminal interests of mafia groups which extract colossal profits from the trade in weapons, drugs, and hostages, from the appropriation of property, and the establishment of control over sources of material benefits. [Mamaladze] According to some figures this business based on blood brings its participants a profit of tens of millions of U.S. dollars. And all this is shielded by the banner of the national idea. In this connection it would be of some use to touch on the role of various ideas in the kindling of conflicts. For instance, history interpreted in a self-seeking way is most often used to justify claims to territory and status. Historians pave the way for detachments of gunmen. Their disputes over "who came to this land first" are transferred to the battle fields, turning into bloody disputes between the peoples. [Pain] Where there is no developed legal consciousness, no developed legal and political culture, and they do not yet exist and cannot exist in post-totalitarian societies, they are replaced by so-called historical or mythological truth. Conflicts contain no more powerful detonator than myth.... [Mamaladze] In other words we are dealing with the exploitation of a myth for political purposes? [Pain] Undoubtedly. In general I must say that a kind of "philosophy of prejudice" as the basis for making political decisions is taking shape before our eyes. For instance, after the 12 December elections many politicians in Russia concluded that nationalism was growing and that it was necessary to use it to consolidate society. That idea is utterly illusory and at the same time extremely dangerous. The plans to adapt nationalist slogans to the aims of consolidating society have not been successfully implemented in Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, or Lithuania. Still less will this be successfully done in Russia now, in an atmosphere of people's mounting revulsion toward politics. To judge by the polls of the All-Russia Center for the Study of Public Opinion on Social and Economic Questions Zhirinovskiy's party is losing its supporters more rapidly than all other political parties. The same studies show that today no more than 1-2 percent of Russians support the so-called national patriotic movement -- that is far lower than support for national movements in any other state of the former Union except perhaps for Belorussia [Belarus]. The leaders of the cossack movement, whose influence has also been greatly exaggerated, also failed to gain support not only at the parliamentary elections but also at the local ones. At the same time just talking about the need to grant special political rights to the ethnic majority or some other population group, the cossacks, for instance, can be enough to arouse national separatist feelings in some republics of the Federation. I consider the anti-Western feelings which are developing in a particular political environment, for instance the Duma environment, to be a very dangerous prejudice. This prejudice can not only cast Russia's foreign policy back to the Cold War but can also drastically aggravate the domestic political situation since the revival of the ideas of the West's intrigues intensifies the atmosphere of fear and suspicion in society. But on the other hand the West is not lacking as regards prejudices against Russia. You are simply amazed at how powerfully some Western minds have been gripped by the prejudice that the position of Russians in a number of countries of nearby foreign parts is merely a question of acts of provocation by a few Russian groups of nationalist orientation and not of the problem of legal and actual discrimination that really exists. [Mamaladze] Some of your Presidential Council colleagues have developed the concept of Russia's special rights and interests throughout the post-Soviet area, a kind of Russian "Monroe doctrine." After it had been widely publicized you could not convince the politicians and public of adjacent countries that their fears regarding Russia's neo-imperial ambitions were unjustified. Please open the doors of the presidential kitchen. Is the opinion that there are too many cooks in this kitchen and that each has his own recipe for stew a prejudice? [Pain] I am no expert in political cuisine. I shall merely say that indeed too many cooks spoil the broth. We have about 10 departments studying the problem of interethnic relations and conflicts. But it must not be forgotten that there is a president and the role of his personal decisions is great. If in some critical situations he had not taken personal control their greater aggravation could have been forecast. [Mamaladze] I remember about two years ago there was talk of a single state system for preventing conflicts in the Russian Federation. Is it taking shape somehow? [Pain] No, and I would not pin too much hope on such a system. As long as there is disagreement in decisionmaking because of contradictory department interests, no institution of power will definitively and fully ensure accord in society? [Mamaladze] And the Treaty on Accord? [Pain] It is only the precursor of the authorities' ability to lead matters toward the coordination of interests. But neither this act nor the structural innovations themselves can in themselves do what society as a whole cannot do. [Mamaladze] You mean that so far it cannot rid itself of traditional ideas and feelings? [Pain] In society several ideologies exist at the same time -- extremely popular and just as contradictory.. The ideology of the classic imperial approach and its most colorful and consistent expresser -- Mr. Zhirinovskiy. The ideology of soft "respectable" expansionism in the approaches to the post-Soviet area -- "we must annex not everything but only what can easily be grabbed." Finally, there is the ideology of complete isolationism, manifested so clearly during talks on the unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belorussia. [Mamaladze] So where are these ideas actually circulating -- in society or in the corridors of power? [Pain] Public opinion polls show that 70 percent of Russians oppose the imperial idea in the "Zhirinovskiy" or respectable packaging. You only have to put the question specifically: "Do you want an association in which the inflation level will increase still further?" for the majority to answer "no." How the authorities interpret and use public feelings is another matter. These people today are more great power-oriented, more nationalist, than the population. I repeat, there is no mass chauvinism, there is the "philosophy of prejudice" which serves the political interests of certain groups in the power structures, and it is particularly dangerous when it is made out to be the voice of the people. [Mamaladze] Who is making this out? Which authorities? [Pain] A very substantial proportion of the middle-echelon management apparatus and local apparatus -- the former party and economic aktiv. "We do not have the right to fail to consider the masses' feelings," they say, as though they were not speaking on their own behalf. In fact this is nothing other than attempts to grab the banner of great-powerdom from the opposition, which has monopolized this idea and will not surrender it for anything. [Mamaladze] We are talking in the building of the former CPSU Central Committee, your office once belonged to a department chief. Someone called you and those like you "democratic flies" which have flown into the thick soup of autocracy. What are you doing here? To what extent are the results of your research called for by those for whom you work? [Pain] Clearly not 100 percent. Even ideally they cannot by called for 100 percent: There is a big difference between the responsibility of the expert and the responsibility of the political decisionmaker. But our opinion -- I am not only talking of myself -- is heeded and some ideas are put to work, often producing a positive result. [Mamaladze] I would be delighted at this fact but reality prevents it. "Nationally minded people" continue to nurture destructive plans. The experience of bloodshed is by no means sobering, on the contrary.... Some "preserved" conflicts are smoldering under the "cover" of emergency measures. Territorial wars are continuing. And talks on a full-scale political settlement of conflicts are being disrupted before our eyes time after time. What is your prediction on this score? [Pain] There are no eternal conflicts, sooner or later they subside -- that is the postulate of conflictology, checked by historical practice. And although, most unfortunately, interethnic wars have a corrupting effect on specific people, adapting their awareness toward the horrors of living in an atmosphere of violence and fear, "metal fatigue" does nonetheless ensue. The politicians' task is to catch that point in the conflict's trajectory at which talks will produce the best result. Despite the disappointing results of the talks an analysis of the situation leads to the prediction that a favorable political situation will take shape in a number of trouble spots. An understanding is developing of the fact that military victory cannot be one either by our own forces or by those of a "third party." However much we may be concerned for peacekeeping operations they will not achieve their aim unless they are supported by the implementation of joint interests. Armies are good when you have to separate sides but it is not armies that extinguish conflicts but banks, corporations, joint ventures, and projects for mutually advantageous undertakings. And I can only rejoice that this idea is finally in political circulation on an equal footing with formulas for demilitarizing conflict zones and the safe return of refugees.
