It is good that they asked, and it is good that such discussion is under way. This discussion is not hair-splitting or a barren exercise compounding the sense of disaster, as we may think at times when feeling discouraged. Nations that shun, fear, or feel ashamed of the truth about their own mistakes often pay a high price later. As is known, he who does not learn from his mistakes is condemned to repeat them. Even worse, societies that look for explanations of their mistakes without trying to analyze them and pinpoint their actual causes rely on fabricated explanations, or, in other words, they construct myths because they fear hard truths. That is why such discussions and confrontation with the past are needed, are even indispensable, unpleasant as they may be. How Did It Happen and What Happened? To answer this question with some exactitude, we first have to determine more closely just what happened. Well, first of all, in 1989 power was taken from the communists. Besides, some people say--not without being somewhat right--that it was the communists themselves who yielded power. And, indeed, in 1989 they did not try to hold on to power by resorting to force; instead, they sat down (on their own initiative) at the "roundtable." But that is only part of the truth because it happened only in 1989, after resorting to force no longer had the chance of succeeding. Previously, in clinging to power, which they had seized by precisely an alien [Soviet] and not their own force, the communists had repeatedly, or rather continually, been resorting to force. They did so in the years 1945-54, and in an exceptionally frightful manner at that. They also did so during the Poznan [bread riots] in 1956, in Warsaw and other cities in 1968, in 1970 [workers' massacre] on the coast, in 1976 in Radom, at Ursus [Tractor Plant] and elsewhere, and last--again on a large scale--in 1981 [martial law imposed] (and during several subsequent years) throughout the country. It thus cannot be said that avoiding to resort to force and sitting down at the "roundtable" used to be a favorite custom of communists. The First Time They Avoided Force and Resorted to the "Roundtable" They Lost Power That took place in an atmosphere of enthusiasm and elation. Some people compared that event to the atmosphere and emotional tension associated with great Polish national uprisings. But that was not so, considering that the transfer of power took place in the absence of violence and victims and thus led to various distinctive consequences--good, admirable, and praiseworthy ones, but also some less admirable. But inasmuch as the "roundtable" nature of that transfer has already been the subject of numerous discussions, accusations, insinuations, and demagogic utterances, anyone who discusses it should at the same time define his position on it so as to avoid misunderstandings. As for myself, I believe that the decision of the democratic opposition in those times to sit down with the communists at the roundtable was correct and definitely more justifiable than a boycott. As a result, the communists lost power, and this happened in the absence of bloodshed. This was followed by a four-year reign of the then opposition, which became the ruling group, to its own great amazement and astonishment. That period is now over, and it is time to sum it up briefly. Of course, I am aware that a penetrating assessment would be premature; besides, many of the related matters are still incomplete, and the last cards have not been dealt yet, nor is the last act of the drama over. Still, a definite era in history is certainly over. In view of the customs that during that period became widespread in public life, in view of the flood of false accusations, slanders, and reproaches lacking even a modicum of truth, several fundamental things must be said before evaluating that period. The then democratic opposition took on the burden of responsibility for the country without being properly prepared for it. That happened not so much through its fault as chiefly through the fault of those who had relinquished power on seeing that they could no longer wield it (and they deserve praise for becoming aware of it). Here several obvious things, little if at all known to the present-day voter, should be pointed out. Well, the essence of the communist system consisted precisely in that all important documents, facts, statistics, and information concerning the state were secret and not accessible to the opposition, and attempts to gain access to them, if only in order to understand better the surrounding reality and to consider the future, were punished and viewed as hostile antistate activities. Attempts to learn about such domains as national defense, foreign policy, domestic security, the actual budget and state expenditures, or even about true figures on the state of public opinion (insofar as they were at all known) meant immediate imprisonment or something even worse. Then, too, consider that all of the higher posts and sometimes even entire professions and kinds of work had been reserved exclusively for members of the ruling party, and, in the case of particularly sensitive occupations, for especially trusted functionaries, whom Orwell termed members of the "inner party." I am not referring here solely to the diplomatic service or the General Staff. Eighty-odd percent of village chairmen in Poland used to belong to the party.... Waiting Would Have Been Impossible Independent thinking about the system of society, foreign policy, national defense, the direction of economic policy, and political alliances had been permitted by only a handful of privileged individuals within the party. If nonparty members tried to engage in such thinking, they were ridiculed, their sanity was questioned, and they were accused of being morally disqualified, of "politicking," sowing discord, displaying overweening ambition, and being irresponsible. Their attempts were unethical and suspicious, or at least that was how they were depicted. As a result, in accepting responsibility for the government, the members of the then democratic opposition faced an incomparably more difficult task than the previous rulers, who had anyhow failed to cope with it and thus brought about economic collapse and hyperinflation, turning this country into a major international debtor. Given its insufficient preparation, should the opposition have accepted responsibility for governing, or should it rather have shunned it and waited? Wait for what? Wait until the country is drowned in chaos, until inflation is growing at a rate of several hundred percent daily, until blood is shed? By then it was perfectly obvious that the communists were incapable of ruling and that a continuation of the existing situation would result in disaster. It has to be honestly admitted that the then leadership of the PZPR [Polish United Workers Party] probably was aware of this problem and drew its own conclusions. It was also understood by the individuals heading (or rather creating the leadership of) the democratic opposition, who engaged in intense internal disputes, because experience had taught them to distrust the communists. After all, Poland was the first country to enter upon this new road; at the time, the USSR had not yet disintegrated, the Warsaw Pact was still operational, and the Berlin Wall still stood intact and guarded. Friends of the PZPR, such as Honecker, Ceausescu, Zhivkov, and others, were still in power at the time. The Polish opposition was aware that they were likely to oppose it, by force.... Really, people who claim nowadays that they had known from the beginning that there should have been no negotiations or compromises with the communists are wise after the fact; at the time they were silent. Upon taking over the government, the members of the former opposition succeeded within a couple of months in introducing a set of economic, financial, and social measures that served to halt inflation. Further, they commenced the indispensable and as yet uncompleted process of privatization, made the zloty convertible, strengthened the currency, filled store shelves, and assured Poland of fuel and energy independence. Nowadays, when we consider the East and the situation of certain countries of the former USSR, we can see what Poland would have been like had these reforms not been accomplished. Those individuals who are making such outcries about Polish sovereignty should consider what the situation would have been like had we not afforded to this country, for example, additional possibilities for securing supplies of crude petroleum and gasoline. After all, it was not so long ago that farmers used to wait for days in line in front of gasoline stations and turn their farms into unsafe, flammable petroleum-storage areas. In addition, during those first few years of the new government, a major reduction of foreign debt could be accomplished. Note incidentally that, during the recent electoral campaign, a "responsible" politician uttered on television some nonsense about truck convoys carrying $2 billion in government funds each week from Poland to Switzerland. His knowledge of the reality is such that he believes that substantial funds are carried nowadays in trucks, but, more to the point, consider that $2 billion weekly means $104 billion annually. Polish exports have never so far exceeded $15 billion a year. Therefore, $104 billion sounds like black magic. Should any Polish government succeed in thus multiplying dollars, it should stay in power forever. At any rate, a man who believes that money is carried to Switzerland in trucks should not be elected; after all, everyone knows that it is carried there in socks. But let us return to reality from Cockaigne. It is a fact that Solidarity governments have brought about a 50-percent reduction of Polish debt in the so-called Club of Paris--that is, more than $20 billion. They also concluded a highly satisfactory agreement with united Germany, established amicable relations with all of the neighboring countries, and brought about the withdrawal of Russian troops from Poland. In speaking of Solidarity governments, I mean not only particular cabinets but also the Belweder and the entire system of society established during those four years because a no less important accomplishment of those four years has been the laying of the foundations of parliamentary democracy based on the rule of law, even if it is not too popular nowadays and has deserved considerable criticism. That will be discussed hereafter. But there is not the slightest doubt that the existence of an even not too efficient parliamentary system is ever so much better than the lack of any such system. Also established were mass media that are, though experiencing a number of ailments (chiefly childhood ailments), moderately independent and operate in the absence of censorship; they may be making many mistakes, but they represent a fairly effective means of social control over the government and the bureaucracy. All this has happened during those four years and by now taken sufficient root to make possible a fairly efficient (and so far proceeding without any major shock) transfer of power to the new governing team. Here we arrive at the core of our reflections. Montaigne wrote in his "Twenty-Third Essay," "Those who try to topple the government are most often the first to fall, crushed under its ruins; the fruit of unrest is rarely harvested by its initiator; usually the water is thus muddied and stirred for the benefit of other fishermen" (in Boy-Zelenski's translation). And Bernard Shaw wrote that revolutionary movements attract the best and the worst elements of society. Was It a Revolution? The fact that not a shot was fired and no window broken, that the Bastille was not demolished, and that no one was immured in it, might conflict with the idea of a revolution. On the other hand, the fact that an entire class or, rather, a large social group--the party nomenklatura may not have been a class according to classical definitions but certainly was a very large and influential group and perhaps also something more--was rather suddenly deprived of influence and largely replaced may indicate that all this was something of a revolution, considering also that the prolonged [communist] era of nearly total stagnation was superseded by a period of great social, occupational, etc. mobility. But it is not important what we call it, a revolution or whatever. I am engaging in these reflections only to justify the reference to Shaw's highly significant dictum and also to mention Cocteau's sober and skeptical remark, "The purity of a revolution may at most last two weeks." In our Polish case, that lasted somewhat longer, but not by much. Soon afterward, in addition to the lack of preparation, there appeared selfishness, greed, lack of moderation and often also of decency, corruption and abuse of power, and, in the end, the craving to amass money rapidly. All of this soon surfaced, sometimes in the form of a caricature, as when family affairs were settled with the aid of the public prosecutor's offices, and sometimes in a more threatening form, as when public affairs were resolved with the aid of secret documents. In addition, the poor quality of a large segment of the new political class--I hesitate to use the term "elite"--has become clear. For God's sake, what kind of elites are they, considering that they are ignorant of the surrounding world, cannot foresee elementary consequences of their actions, and cannot correlate elementary facts. But still? According to Slownik Wyrazow Obcych [Dictionary of Foreign Terms], published by the PWN Press, an elite is "a group or assemblage of persons displaying some distinguishing characteristic." It is not unlikely that the last Sejm did indeed consist of people displaying some distinguishing characteristic, but I am not going to define it. The Composition of the New Political Class Proved Weak The astonishing stupidity of the Right has already been widely discussed in print, so there is no need for me to describe it. The trouble is that this concerns parties, movements, and fringe parties that had attracted 20 percent of the vote but, at present, are not represented in the parliament [because none of these parties won at least 5 percent of the national vote]. But, of course, the point is not just the feeble intellectual qualifications of certain activists--I hesitate to call them politicians. For there also are the numerous hasty decisions made by such a serious, experienced, and merited institution as the Roman Catholic Church. It behaved to some extent as if it was bereft of the experience of 20 centuries or of the 20th century. The unpreparedness and immaturity of the Solidarity forces were reflected in, among other things, their failure--and that was a grave shortcoming--to explain to the public, carefully and clearly, their goals and intentions; even though they had a program of action, they were unable to make it sufficiently detailed and convincing. Trusting too much in their authority, their mission, and their historical rationale, the Solidarity forces neglected to consider what democratic politicians must always keep in mind--namely, that the principal yardstick of a politician's effectiveness is not whether history declares him to be right but whether voters declare him to be so, and in the very next election, at that. The "war at the top" and the destructive and sometimes shameful nature of successive electoral campaigns dealt a heavy blow to such an approach by Solidarity. What Then Did Happen? There was a change of guard but, by then, in a new guardhouse, in which different rules apply. It may be that the new sentinels will adapt themselves to the altered environment--and then this change will benefit Polish democracy. It would be beneficial if all of the main political forces in Poland were to share in succession responsibility for carrying out the reforms needed to have Poland enter the 21st century as an equal partner of other European countries rather than as an island of backwardness. That will be a long and difficult social process, which is not surprising because changes on such a scale and in such depth are bound to last much longer than was expected in the beginning. In order that the creation of a genuine and efficient democracy, that sole system of society assuring social and economic progress, may be crowned with success, it is also necessary for voters to realize that no one can work miracles in politics or the economy, that manna does not fall from the sky and plums do not fall from trees into mouths. Should this happen, perhaps a stable and responsible parliamentary democracy, meaning something different from a system under which some people try to carry out needed changes (and, in the process, make mistakes, which is natural) while others merely criticize them and promise a rose garden, will finally begin to operate in Poland. But, of course, the outcome may also be different. If the new government discontinues the reforms or, in the event of some crisis or under the pressure of the electorate, protects its position at the expense of a loss of currency stability and economic progress, if it fences off Poland with barriers of customs duties and prohibitions, and if it smothers private enterprise with taxes, then the opportunity will be forfeited, and, after some time, we shall again face a major economic, social, and political crisis. Summing up, what happened happened, and it cannot be undone. But the consequences may vary, and I believe that they still cannot be prejudged. The basic problem is that all of those shocks and twists and turns in our country are part of a much broader, worldwide great crisis of leadership, which nowadays can be observed in practically every country in the world. No continent has been bypassed by that crisis. But that is a subject for separate reflection. Nowadays, ours is not the only country in which, chameleonlike, power keeps changing its shape and hues while perching on a swaying and weak branch. A reason for optimism is that this creature does not, insofar as we know, behave irrationally.
