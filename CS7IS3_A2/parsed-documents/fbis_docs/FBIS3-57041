Responding to President Geydar Aliyev's call to the Republic's people, the Azerbaijan National Army [ANA] has inflicted effective blows on the enemy units and forced them to abandon many of their positions and flee from several towns they occupied in Fizulinskiy and Kelbadzharskiy Rayons. The troops of our military units, which have significant responsibility to the people in safeguarding Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, have displayed significant heroism in clashes with the ferocious enemy. Regardless of the resistance put up by Armenian occupationists, the blows the ANA units have inflicted on the enemy [words indistinct]. In fact, they are now more determined in their advance against the enemy units. The occupationists are becoming more and more aware of the fact that they are gradually being defeated in a foreign land. The Armenian Armed Forces, which have lost many men and much military equipment and which have realized that they will not remain unpunished for the acts of violence they have committed in Azerbaijan's territory, are retreating in a disorderly way. Kozly, [place-name indistinct], Kabakchylar, Sarnichlar, [place-name indistinct], Susuzlu, [four place-names indistinct], Kamishly, and Bagyrly in Kelbadzharskiy Rayon were liberated from the occupationists as a result of ANA's successful operations during the past few days. The ANA units captured several strategically important heights, including [place-name indistinct], in the violent clashes that took place in that rayon. Consequently, they have placed the upper section of the Kelbadzhar-Agdere motorway and the section of the Kelbadzhar-Lachin motorway up to [place-name indistinct] under their control. The enemy units lost many men and much military equipment in the clashes that took place in Kelbadzharskiy Rayon during the past week. They lost some 300 officers and men, nine tanks, two PDM's [not further identified], and five artillery guns. Azerbaijan's military units seized four tanks, two PDM's, a large quantity of infantry arms, mortars, and arms depots as spoils of war. According to information from [words indistinct], the number of deserters has increased eight-fold. The deserters are trying to flee to Armenia. Five Armenian officers and men taken as prisoners of war have said that they are affiliated with the 117th Division of Russia's 7th Army. The information they have revealed indicates that morale among the troops in Khankendi [Stepanakert] is very low. Yerevan has recently prepared to dispatch fuel, construction materials, and 20 military vehicles to Khankendi. People are taken from their homes in Yerevan and sent to the front lines. The prisoners also revealed that they joined the fighting because they feared serious repercussions against their families. This confirms the fact that Armenian military forces supported by Russian military sub-units in Armenia, and not the Nagorno-Karabakh self-defense forces as claimed by the Armenian and Russian mass media organs, are fighting in Azerbaijan, The ANA units, which are cared for by their state and people, are becoming more and more steadfast every day. The people of the liberated towns can return to their homes. Azerbaijan's people must rest assured that the aggressor will be forced to retreat and our homeland will be liberated.
