Everyone knows that Cambodia needs a huge sum of money for national rehabilitation and reconstruction, and that its main income comes from customs duties and taxes. Declining economic activity -- with a huge plunge in imports and exports -- has caused the country's income to drop by about 50 percent. This is the official figure announced by Economy and Finance Minister Sam Rangsi. This decline will certainly upset the Ministry of Economy and Finance's plan to seek 361 billion riels in income for the current fiscal year. In addition to the decline in export-import activity, foreign investment in general has not grown since it was permitted by the Royal Government. Although there has been no official announcement regarding foreign investment statistics, the facts show various companies that previously invested in Cambodia have withdrawn part of their funds and have turned to investment in Vietnam. Meanwhile, other companies that planned to invest in Cambodia have maintained a wait-and-see attitude. In addition to the political situation in the country, Mr. Sam Rangsi admitted that Vietnam's opening up to free import marketing and Thailand's reduction of its import taxes have also caused Cambodian exports to drop. Moreover, traders feel bad about a number of new principles recently announced by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Thus, there is sufficient reason to say that Vietnam's opening up has caused the decline in investment in Cambodia. Another heavy burden for the Royal Government is the recent verbal attacks and conflicts along the Cambodian-Thai border, which have caused the closure of the border at Poipet. This closure has badly affected the Cambodian economy and added a heavy burden to the daily livelihoods of the Cambodian people. Moreover, although Sam Rangsi did not mention the fourth cause of the decline in state income, everyone well knows about it; that is, corruption among those who rule the state and control the national economy. How will the government solve the present situation? It is true that the political situation has impacted on Cambodia's economic situation. But some have criticized Cambodia for having a serious crisis in state control over economic affairs. This requires an urgent remedy. Efforts should also be made to find a control mechanism that can stimulate economic activities. The time has come for the Royal Government to take a look at itself in a new mirror to see whether or not its economic policy has caused the decline of the national economy. It is believed that this economic crisis -- if not remedied in time -- will be more dangerous than the downfall on the Pailin battlefield.
