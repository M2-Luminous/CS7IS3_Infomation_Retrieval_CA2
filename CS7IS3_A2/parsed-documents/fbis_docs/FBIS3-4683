This is the first time that a DFAA director general visits the United States for the sole purpose of discussing the base issues in Okinawa. Yoneyama noted three particular pending issues -- the return of the Naha military seaport, the return of the Yomitan Auxiliary Air Base, and the stopping of live-ammunition firing artillery exercises over the Prefectural Highway 104 -- "are long- pending issues, which the prefectural residents strongly hope to be resolved, and the DFAA also wants to have settled." He thus indicated the solution of these three issues was one of the important purposes of the visit. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who had received a report on the purpose of Yoneyama's visit to the United States, on 17 February sent through his secretary a message of encouragement saying, "I would like you to do everything to have some of the issues of the bases on Okinawa settled." He thus expressed hope that Yoneyama will press on the U.S. Government to resolve the Okinawa base issues which were also a subject he had intended to take up at the recent Japan-U.S. summit meeting. Director General Yoneyama said at a news conference on 25 February: "The purpose of the visit to the United States is to exchange views with the senior officials of the Defense Department and the State Department primarily on the reduction and realignment of U.S. military facilities and areas on Okinawa." He noted he was looking forward to the meeting with U.S. Government officials and military commanders concerned with the U.S. bases in Okinawa, adding, "I would like to follow up on what has been discussed between Japan and the United States on the reduction and realignment of the bases on Okinawa." He will have Kenichi Sakamoto, liaison officer in charge of the U.S. bases in Okinawa, on his entourage in order to be able to discuss and exchange views on details. According to his schedule, Yoneyama will arrive in Washington on 27 February, and is due to meet with Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord, Ambassador Thomas, and Assistant Secretary of Defense Freeman while in Washington. After touring U.S. military bases, he will head for Hawaii, and will meet with General Larson, commander- in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii on 3 March, and then with General Stackpole, commander of the Marine Corps forces in the Pacific, Admiral Fitzgerald, deputy commander of the Pacific Fleet, and General Rutherford, commander of the Pacific Air Force Command -- to exchange views on the realignment and reduction of the U.S. military bases on Okinawa. In the past, there have been instances of DFAA directors general visiting the United States in company with Defense Agency chiefs, but (according to the DFAA) there has been "no precedence" of a DFAA director general visiting the United States on his own to negotiate on specific issues and exchange views with senior government officials and military leaders personally.
