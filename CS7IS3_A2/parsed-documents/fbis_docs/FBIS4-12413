[Abu-Salih] It is a fact that Israeli weapons are reaching the rebels. We have had evidence in the past. Israel has been involved in supporting the rebellion since the sixties. All the rebels' weapons originate in Israel. The incident in which a plane loaded with weapons was headed for Uganda is just one aspect of Israel's support for the rebels. ['Arafah] Have you agreed with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa on a date for resumption of the talks on Hala'ib? Why have negotiations been postponed for so long? [Abu-Salih] We have been waiting for Foreign Minister Musa since September. We have sent him an invitation but he has not come. I told him this when he visited me (in the hotel). No agreement was reached with him on a date. However, we are waiting for him at any time. Regarding the postponement of the talks, why don't you ask Egypt about this postponement? Why don't you ask Foreign Minister Musa this question? We have agreed to proceed in accordance with what Presidents Mubarak and al-Bashir agreed upon--namely, to draw up a framework for relations between the two countries. We have not been negligent and we do not want to blame anyone. Therefore, we did not want to submit the issue of Hala'ib to the Arab League meetings. We are still waiting for 'Amr Musa to honor us with a visit! ['Arafah] It has been said that there is U.S. support for the rebels in the south. On the other hand, Sudanese Foreign Ministry officials have stated that they are convinced that the United States does not want to topple the present regime. Is there a contradiction in the stand of the United States? [Abu-Salih] We take everyone at their word. The United States, according to its ambassador in Khartoum, says it does not support the rebels and does not do anything to topple the government. Secret actions by other nonofficial U.S. quarters (for example intelligence) is another matter! ['Arafah] It has been reiterated that there is a new dialogue between the United States and Sudan. For this purpose, the U.S. President has appointed a special representative to Sudan. He will also send his UN ambassador to Sudan at the end of this month. [Abu-Salih] Dialogue with the United States started a long time ago. U.S. Secretary Christopher referred to this dialogue even though Sudan is included on the list of the states that support terrorism. Recently, there has been the impression or signals that there is hope that this dialogue will be continued. For our part, we have already stated that we need balanced relations with the United States. I will meet with President Clinton's envoy on 31 March. She will carry a message from Clinton to al-Bashir. I believe that this mission will help promote dialogue between the two sides. [passage omitted]
