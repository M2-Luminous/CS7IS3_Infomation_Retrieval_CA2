According to Bosnian Serb military sources in Zvornik, on the border with Yugoslavia where the cargo controls are made, 13 trucks of the UN High Commisioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have taken 72 tonnes of flour to Tuzla, north-east Bosnia-Herzegovina. The International Committee of the Red Cross has taken 61 tonnes of flour and 35 tonnes of family food parcels to the same city. Srebrenica, the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, has received 78 tonnes of flour and 10 tonnes of heating oil, and 10 tonnes of heating oil have been sent to the medical center in Zvornik. The international humanitarian organisation Duga from Skopje has sent three trailers with food and medicine to be distributed to both the Moslem and Serb-controlled parts of Sarajevo. The delivery of humanitarian aid to the civilian population in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been hindered for months due to fierce Moslem-Croat fighting in the central and southern parts of the republic in which a war between local Serbs, Croats and Moslems has been raging since April 1992. During all this time the only safe way for the convoys is through the territory under Bosnian Serb control.
