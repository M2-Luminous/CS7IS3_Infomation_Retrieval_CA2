FR940512-0-00007 FR940512-0-00003 The Committee met on March 16, 1994, and unanimously recommended 1994&hyph;95 crop year administrative expenses of $1,056,000 and an administrative assessment rate of $0.60 per net ton of assessable farmers' stock peanuts received or acquired by handlers. In comparison, 1993&hyph;94 crop year budgeted administrative expenditures were $1,020,000, and the administrative assessment rate was initially recommended and fixed at $0.60 per ton. Administrative budget items for 1994&hyph;95 which have increased compared to those budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: Executive salaries, $140,146 ($134,304), clerical salaries, $132,500 ($127,479), field representatives salaries, $290,420 ($278,778), field representatives travel, $110,000 ($107,000), insurance and bonds, $8,500 ($7,500), and furniture and equipment, $9,500 ($4,000). Items which have decreased compared to those budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: Payroll taxes, $43,000 ($45,000), office rent and parking, $50,000 ($52,500), postage and mailing, $12,000 ($13,000), and audit fees, $9,200 ($9,500). All other items are budgeted at last year's amounts. The administrative budget includes $14,234 for contingencies ($4,439 last year). The Committee also unanimously recommended 1994 crop indemnification claims payments of up to $9,000,000 and an indemnification assessment of $2.00 per net ton of farmers' stock peanuts received or acquired by handlers to continue its indemnification program. The 1993&hyph;94 crop year indemnification assessment was $1.00 per net ton. Because of the high number of claims being processed during the 1993&hyph;94 crop year, the Committee recommended a higher assessment rate so that sufficient reserve funds will be available. The $9,000,000 of indemnification claims coverage to be provided on 1994 crop peanuts includes $5,000,000 in excess loss insurance to be purchased by the Committee_the same as last year. The cost of the indemnification insurance premium and the costs to carry out indemnification procedures (sampling and testing of 2&hyph;AB and 3&hyph;AB Subsamples, and crushing supervision, of indemnified peanuts, pursuant to ยง998.200 (c), are additional indemnification costs which must be authorized and paid from available indemnification funds. Such costs are not expected to exceed $2,000,000. The total assessment rate is $2.60 per ton of assessable peanuts ($0.60 for administrative and $2.00 for indemnification). Assessments are due on the 15th of the month following the month in which the farmers' stock peanuts are received or acquired. Application of the recommended rates to the estimated assessable tonnage of 1,760,000 will yield $1,056,000 for program administration and $3,520,000 for indemnification. The indemnification amount, when added to expected cash carry over from 1993&hyph;94 indemnification operations of $12,609,100, will provide $16,129,100, which should be adequate for the 1994 fund, and to maintain an adequate reserve. The 1993&hyph;94 budget was published in the Federal Register as an interim final rule on June 11, 1993 (58 FR 32600), and finalized on August 13, 1993 (58 FR 43066). The administrative expenses and assessment rate for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year were based on an estimated assessable tonnage of 1,700,000. Due to an unexpected short crop, the assessable tonnage is estimated to be only 1,476,377. In order to have sufficient revenue to cover budgeted expenses of $1,020,000, the Committee unanimously recommended that the 1993&hyph;94 crop year administrative assessment be increased from $0.60 to $0.70 per net ton of assessable farmers' stock peanuts. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers signatory to the agreement. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be significantly offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing agreement. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.
