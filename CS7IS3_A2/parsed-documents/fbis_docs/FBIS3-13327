A responsible source of the General Command of Kabul Garrison reported to a BAKHTAR INFORMATION AGENCY military correspondent that last night's attack of the infamous militia of Golboddin and Dostam, who have been disappointed by their continued defeats, met -- as on previous occasions -- with strong resistance of mojahedin and the Islamic Army of Afghanistan. The raiders were forced to retreat. As a result of this abortive attack a number of the infamous militia were either killed or injured, and a quantity of their ammunition such as 82mm artillery shells, mortar shells, and rockets have been taken as booty. In retaliation for the failure of their assault, the infamous militia again targeted residential areas. Five residences were destroyed as a a result of the firing of ten rockets by them. No loss of life was reported from the rocket attack.
