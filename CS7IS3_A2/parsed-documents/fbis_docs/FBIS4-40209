This is the first meeting at such a high level, organized for the purpose of working out the methods for improving CIS activities and the furthering integration of CIS countries. The conference participants, in particular, considered the possibility of creating an economic union and a mechanism for implementing this union. They also discussed the proposal of Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev to create the Euroasiatic Union which, as specific to the CIS, would enable integration of the CIS countries into a closer economic and political union, that is, to perform those functions which formerly were attributed to the CIS. Commenting on this, CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Karatchenya told our correspondent that "the CIS, as an intergovernmental organization, could not prove its value. Initially, the CIS played a huge part in disuniting the single empire. A civilized "divorce" without blood and war has been accomplished, and this gives credit to the CIS and its bodies. However, many people, having felt that economically this leads to a deadlock, began discussing the need for a union on a new basis. In the first place -- an economic union, in the second -- possibly, a political or military union, or some other type of union. The point is whether the current politicians and all of us are able to realize that we need to live together on one-sixth of the dry land. Regarding Nazarbayev's initiative -- the creation of closer integration with the CIS through a creation of supranational structures -- many people doubt whether state heads will concede to it. At least, in the near future. Regarding the reasons why many agreements within the CIS framework do not work or work rather feebly, they are of an objective nature: First, every country lives according to its own laws. Second, many agreements have been signed only by some CIS members. Finally, third, there are difficulties with the ratification of adopted documents by the parliaments of CIS countries. Not to mention other reasons, even Russia has not yet ratified the agreement on the economic union; this agreement is currently being discussed by the Federation Council and the Duma, and there is no single opinion on this issue."
