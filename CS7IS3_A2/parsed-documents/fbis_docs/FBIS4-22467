But the 45 seats of the communist faction in the Duma and the 400,000 circulation of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA compel, whether we like it or not, an entirely serious attitude toward plenums of the communists. In addition, when the red chiefs--Chikin, Zyuganov, and Tuleyev--consolidate, creating a new movement with the participation of Govorukhin and Glazyev, this also is reason to once again ask: Who are the communists today, what are they doing, how does their internal program differ from the street slogans? Those who have not forgotten the red banners at the White House and Ostankino in October would be pleasantly surprised upon reading the material of the recent plenum of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Central Executive Committee. The communists advocate conversion, a fight against crime, and a national information space. No one is summoning anyone to the barricades, on the contrary, the current contradictions may be resolved only by the nonviolent path under conditions of civic peace. In addition, party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov is calling for the "open and honest adoption of the so-called `local concerns theory.'" Painting the portrait of his organization, Zyuganov is altogether critical in a manner that is not communist. Even earlier it might have been suspected that the Communist Party of the Russian Federation was mainly a party of retirees, whose primary cells it was easiest to create under the auspices of district social security departments. The report confirmed this impression. "The age and social composition of our primaries do not yet correspond to the requirements of the times.... Exclusive party groups and restrictive party activities frequently become a venue for the like-minded in their narrow circle to unburden themselves, abusing the current regime, and are essentially a means of psychological release, not psychological mobilization. And several levels higher--street demonstrations which are also of practically invariable composition and are increasingly amounting to the role of psychological safety valve as well." Do not be deluded by the "local concerns theory" and the "age composition of the primaries": Even at the present time the Communist Party is preparing--in a coalition, it is true--to enter into control of the state. It is obvious that the Communist Party of the Russian Federation will, for all that, be seeking support not in the district social security departments but among the agrarians and miners, having caught very precisely the demands of certain strikers for early presidential elections. Mention has been made repeatedly of the political plasticity of Gennadiy Zyuganov. In the eyes of some he is a socialist, for others, a hard-line Leninist communist. The present report identifies Zyuganov's approach to the future presidential elections. It is clear to the communists that the present president should not take part in them. But it is important and not, I believe, out of the question for those who voted for the Communist Party of the Russian Federation that Zyuganov would not like to see Rutskoy among the candidates either. "After all, the amnesty was adopted," Zyuganov argues, "to ensure the most painless possibility of the departure of all politicians who wittingly or unwittingly dragged the country into chaos and fratricide." Nor would the leader of the communists care to have Zhirinovskiy as a competitor either. Without naming Vladimir Volfovich directly, Zyuganov warned the communists against some "social messiah" capable of creating in society "a belief in simple and most rapid solutions for all problems." As ensues from the plenum material, the leaders of the communists feel more lively and confident in the Duma than in a dialogue with their own party. By all accounts, the sole solution for political survival is an attempt to create some mass movement of the left. It cannot be ruled out that the name "communist party" will be buried en route. Otherwise with the inevitability of the change of seasons the present communists will be quitting the political highway together with the generation which they, mainly, represent.
