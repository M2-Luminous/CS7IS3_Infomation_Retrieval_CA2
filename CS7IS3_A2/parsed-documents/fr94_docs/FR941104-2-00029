ACTION: Notice of draft permits and permit modifications. SUMMARY: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing for comment 5-year sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) compliance plans which either amend previously issued Phase I Acid Rain Permits, or will, if approved, result in the issuance of a Phase I Acid Rain Permit to sources not previously required to have one. These actions are taken in accordance with the Acid Rain Program regulations (40 CFR part 72). DATES: Comments on the draft permits and modifications must be received no later than 30 days after the date of this notice (December 5, 1994) or the date of publication of a similar notice in a local newspaper, whichever is later.

All timely comments will be considered, except those pertaining to standard provisions under 40 CFR 72.9 or issues not relevant to the permit or the permit modification. Hearings.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Title IV of the Clean Air Act directs EPA to establish a program to reduce the adverse effects of acidic deposition by promulgating rules and issuing permits to emission sources subject to the program. On January 11, 1993, EPA promulgated final rules implementing the SO 2 portion of the program. Subsequently, several parties filed petitions for review of the rules with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On May 4, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement addressing the substitution and reduced utilization issues. In today's action, EPA is issuing to the following utility plants draft SO 2 compliance plans that allocate SO 2 emission allowances and approve SO 2 compliance plans, consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement: Phase I Units Designating Substitution Units E C Gaston in Alabama: one conditional substitution plan for 1995&hyph;1999, in which unit 5 designates Gadsden units 1 and 2, Gorgas units 6, 7, 8, and 9, and James H.
