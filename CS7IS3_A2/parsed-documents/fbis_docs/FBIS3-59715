MITI has been conducting a feasibility study jointly with the United States on the aircraft. MITI will soon send this message to their project partner, the Boeing Company, and expects to receive agreement. This is because Boeing had received an order for 63 ``737X'' aircraft from a U.S. aircraft company, and therefore decided to develop the ``737X,'' which has the same number of seats as the YXX, in preference to the YXX. Therefore the project could not possibly be continued. MITI had promoted the next-generation small passenger aircraft, the YSX and the YXX as two major projects for fostering the Japanese aircraft industry. The YSX will be the only project from now on. The YXX project started in 1984 as an international joint development project with the Boeing Company. A U.S./Japan bilateral memorandum was signed in 1986. The memo stated that Japan would be responsible for 25 percent of the project. Both sides have so far prepared marketing surveys and operational arrangements, and conducted investigations of design technology. The development of new airframe structure design concepts including engines and main wings had been under way. Meanwhile, Boeing has been studying the ``737X'' on their own in addition to the YXX for the development of next-generation mid-size passenger aircraft. The 737X is an offshoot of the 737 aircraft, and therefore the fuselage and engine are similar. This is an advantage in terms of cost reduction. Boeing has proposed the 737X to aircraft companies. Southwest Airline responded by ordering 63 aircraft, and therefore Boeing decided to develop the 737X. As a result, MITI has been holding discussions with the project's contact point, Japan Aircraft Development Corporation (JADC), and aircraft manufacturers. As long as Boeing has decided to put the 737X on their priority list, they have realized that it is not realistic to develop an aircraft that would compete with the B737X in the mid-size passenger aircraft market. In the meantime, they feel that Japan has gained enough technologies while developing the YSX and producing the B777 under contract. Therefore, MITI will pursue an aviation policy that focuses only on the YSX.
