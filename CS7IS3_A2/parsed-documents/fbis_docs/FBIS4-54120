Kim Sang-hyon of the opposition Democratic Party, said here on Tuesday Kim Tae-chung, chairman of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, will return to active politics if there is a nationwide support for him. "If there is nationwide support for him and if need be, Chairman Kim should return to active politics and he himself will," he said. Kim Sang-hyon was one of Kim Tae-chung's closest confidants for many years once in the past. In a special lecture at a political science and international relations class of Kyongbuk National University, Kim added, however, that since Chairman Kim commands outstanding political senses, he won't return to politics unless there is a widespread support for him or there are conditions warranting his return to politics. Kim Tae-chung himself said time and again that he had retired from politics for good and he would never come back to politicking.
