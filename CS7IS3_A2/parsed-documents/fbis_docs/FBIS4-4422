"Two years ago, the ministries would be excited about a forthcoming election. The neutrality of the bureaucracy would, of course, be forgotten, and endless requests for money, personnel, office space, cars, and name lists would come from officials of the bureau director general rank. Right now, nobody is saying anything." Ministries Cannot Now Engage in Organized Election Campaigns A bookkeeper at a leading general contractor which deals in the construction of ports and similar public works projects, testified to the change in the Ministry of Transport in the above terms. This is true not only of the Transport Ministry. The same thing is happening in the Ministries of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, Posts and Communications, Construction, and Education, and the Defense Agency. Even officials at ministries and agencies where former colleagues are now members of the upper house, elected from the proportional representation districts, tend to shut up when the topic of conversation turns to the election next year. Former Administrative Vice Minister of Transport Toru Nakamura told a senior bureaucrat at the bureau director-general level last August, "your candidacy will not be possible." This was soon after the inauguration of the Hosokawa administration. Former Transport Ministry officials were planning to have the senior official run as a Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] candidate. However, an incumbent lower house member with Transport Ministry links, Shinya Izumi, had defected from the LDP to Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], and in view of the change in political regime, the atmosphere was considered unsuitable for his candidacy. The situation is even more serious for ministries where former officials are incumbent LDP Diet members. The National Land Improvement Political Alliance, which traditionally supported former officials from the Agricultural Structure Improvement Bureau of the Agriculture Ministry stopped short of endorsing lower house member Ryotaro Sudo at its regular general meeting in February. The reason was officials of land improvement groups nationwide were defecting from the LDP, and it was not possible to reach a consensus on which candidate to endorse. Shinseito leaders are also applying pressure on ministries and agencies unscrupulously, saying "do you still want to supply candidates to the LDP?" There are currently 69 members of the House of Representatives, and 42 members of the House of Councilors who are former bureaucrats. In the first decade after the war, bureaucrats not only joined the conservative parties; some even joined the Socialist Party. However, after the founding of the LDP, the bureaucracy became an exclusive source of candidates for this party. Particularly in the proportional representation elections, close links between the bureaucracy and businesses traditionally produced hundreds of thousands of new LDP members, together with their membership dues. It was an impregnable LDP fortress. However, this fortress is also disintegrating. During upper house elections two years ago, the LDP put up six new former bureaucrat candidates, and five were elected. Hideyuki Aizawa, director general of the LDP Election Bureau, says that now, however, "lavish election spending, and the recruitment of party members through the mobilization of entire business sectors will not be allowed." "Ozawa Scheme" Seen as Threatening Last December, Minister of International Trade and Industry Hiroshi Kumagai forced Masahisa Naito, director general of the Industrial Policy Bureau and number-two man in the Trade Ministry's bureaucratic hierarchy, to resign over preferential promotions for ministry officials intending to run in elections. The repercussions of this incident are still being felt three months later. Unlike in the United States, where officials above the rank of bureau chief are replaced in the change of administration, the Japanese bureaucracy is more permanent. However, since the unwritten rule that "bureaucratic personnel matters are sacrosanct" has been violated, officials now fear politicians may have the last say on personnel appointments every time there is a change of administration. Such a sense of crisis is not wholly groundless because the incident coincided with a plan by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa to appoint more than one parliamentary vice minister to each ministry, and to send more than 150 political councilors from the ruling parties to participate in policymaking. The objective of the "Ozawa scheme" was to do away with "bureaucratic control of the administration," and to allow politicians to regain the initiative. Ozawa believes that bureaucrats should be "politically `neutral' and assist the politicians." That is, he wants bureaucrats merely to indicate the policy options, and let politicians make the decision. As a matter of fact, when the plan was presented to the ruling coalition parties last October, senior government officials wrote a paper opposing the scheme, claiming they represented the general consensus in Kasumigaseki. The gist of the document was that "if policies are formulated through lobbying by politicians for various interests, there can be no `neutrality.'" In the name of "neutrality," Ozawa wants to tighten control on the bureaucrats, while the bureaucrats are trying to keep the politicians from interfering. The idea of dispatching political councillors met with particularly strong resistance from the bureaucrats, and was eventually scrapped. Admittedly, in a parliamentary cabinet system, where policies are decided through consultations between the cabinet and the ruling parties, these policies are inevitably influenced by partisan interests. The question is: How far the bureaucrats, who are not directly responsible to the people, should be involved in policymaking, and to what extent the policy process can be made open. Leading Role in Policymaking After the change of regime, the old pattern under which bureaucrats supplied information only to the LDP has been interrupted. In place of this, there are an increasing number of cases where bureaucrats themselves, rather than politicians, have spoken out publicly. According to a former finance minister, this signifies not only that bureaucrats are overexerting themselves, but also that "politicians are losing influence." During the briefings prior to the Japan-U.S. summit talks, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa often asked the bureaucrats briefing him, "What am I supposed to do then?" This has become the talk of the Foreign Ministry. Essentially, the old pattern of policymaking has not changed since then.
