In a joint new year press conference, the business leaders stressed the need to pump-prime the economy by an income tax cut, and pass political reforms bill by the end of the current Diet session January 29. They said the tax cut could be financed by "bridge" deficit-financing bonds. Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, said if the House of Representatives was dissolved this month it would have a large negative impact on the economy. Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), called for steady implementation of reforms in all areas -- political, economic, and administrative. Such support for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's government reflects fears that political turmoil could further damage the economy, which is still in recession, political analysts say. But it would also be a blow to the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, they say, and the divide between businesses and the former ruling party could widen. As to the pending issue of a consumption tax hike to finance a cut in personal income taxes, Hiraiwa merely said it is a "future issue," while Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, said it should be considered "after business conditions recover." Both Hayami and Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, expressed similar views. Referring to the recent recovery of the dollar against the yen above the 113 yen line, Hiraiwa said the currency is still too low and Japanese companies will be happy if it rises to around 120 yen. Hayami, however, said he would like to see the dollar stabilize somewhere at the 110 yen level. Nagano said that this year industry should place a priority on ensuring employments rather than wage raises, which he said are quite difficult for the corporate management to offer.
