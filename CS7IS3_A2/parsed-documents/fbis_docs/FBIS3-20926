For the nine months to the end of September 1993, pre-tax income reached SKr1,855 million, more than 15 times the Skr122 million recorded in the comparable 1992 period. The net result was a SKr347 million profit for the third quarter of this year compared with a loss of SKr205 million in 1992. In the January to September 1993 period, net income was SKr928 million versus last year's SKr9 million. Net sales rose 54.7 percent to SKr15,021 million in the quarter and 41.3 percent to SKr42,415 million in the nine-month period. Order bookings in the January to September 1993 period totalled SKr49,210 million which was SKr11,483 million more than the amount of orders booked in the same period in 1992. 1993's sales and order bookings were boosted by a decline in the exchange rate for the Swedish kronor and, if this was taken into account, Ericsson noted that the increase in net sales was 20 percent and the order bookings increase about 10 percent. The United States is currently Ericsson's largest market, measured in net sales, followed by Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Over the past year, China's share of net sales has risen from three to six percent, which makes this country Ericsson's fifth largest market. "Radio communications" is the product area showing the strongest growth and is now the largest of Ericsson's business areas, both in terms of order bookings and net sales. The sharp increase in net sales within this product group was mainly attributable to sales of mobile phone systems and mobile phones. Notable among the most expansive markets were China, Germany, and Australia. Order bookings also rose sharply, with large orders reported in China, the United States, Mexico, Germany, and Australia. "Public telecommunications" reported third quarter and nine-month sales increases of 17.2 per cent and 15.6 percent, respectively, despite the divestment of the former operator activity in Argentina and the transfer of telecommunications exchanges for mobile telephone system to "radio communications" which took effect in January 1993. The increases were mainly attributable to Mexico, the United Kingdom, China, and Malaysia. Order bookings rose most in China, Spain, Australia, and Thailand. Important orders were also signed in Saudi Arabia and Lebanon. Ericsson's new switches for broadband transmission based on ATM [asynchronous transfer mode] technology have been ordered in Germany, Spain, Sweden, and Italy. SDH [synchronous digital hierarchy] for digital signal transfer has been ordered in Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Switzerland. "Business networks" reported strong increases in net sales and order bookings. This was mainly due to the consolidation of the Austrian company, Schrack. Major order bookings were recorded in Spain, Argentina, and the Philippines. "Components" showed an increase in net sales following a number of deliveries of power equipment to markets in Germany, Spain, and the Far East. The increase in net sales for "defense systems" was only marginally affected by currency rate changes, since most of the customers are based in Sweden. Order bookings were slightly lower than during the corresponding period in 1992 due to last year's substantial JAS orders.

Of the totals, SKr1,796 million was invested in Sweden compared with SKr786 million in the comparable period in 1992. Since the beginning of this year, Ericsson has increased its work force by 2,681 employees, bringing the total to 68,913 at the end of September 1993. Ericsson expects pre-tax earnings for the whole of 1993 to be "somewhat more than double" 1992's SKr1,306 million level.
