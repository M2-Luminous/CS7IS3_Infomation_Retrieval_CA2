In approximately one year FDPC members could state with justification that the main conclusions of the theses and the proposals they contained have been proven correct and almost fully implemented. The theses came into being because of FDPC members' concern over the fact that the national leadership lacked a minimally systematic understanding of Russia's interests and goals in the foreign policy sphere, as well as fears that a demonstratively one-sided pro-Western policy orientation could not only damage Russian Federation [RF] interests in other foreign-policy directions, but also would cause an inevitable hard reaction on the part of public opinion inside the country. The theses were aimed at convincing national leaders that the policy needed to be adjusted and this reaction softened. The changes in the Russian foreign policy course that have taken place since the end of 1992 have made it much more balanced and restrained, and somewhat softened this reaction but could not avert it entirely. There are increasingly numerous signs that the pendulum of Russian public opinion and Russian policy already is passing the "golden middle" and is moving in the direction of a policy potentially much more dangerous that the one conducted in 1991-1992. The explanation lies not only in past events and mistakes. There are forces that exist and operate in Russia, which strive to provoke a crisis in relations with the outside world, to create again a hostile environment without which they cannot even dream of coming into power. The firmer tone and better defined positions that have manifested themselves lately in Moscow's foreign policy lead to formation of a normal, more equal and respectful nature of relations with the leading powers. One cannot fail to notice, however, the revival and intensification of xenophobia as well. Under these conditions a number of FDPC members came up with an initiative to draft new theses. They have been written by the working group of council members who as a rule currently do not hold official positions in the bodies of executive authority. (Footnote 1)( The working group included: Yu.Yu. Boldyrev, deputy of the Federation Council of the RF Federal Assembly; L.I. Vainberg, president of the Association of Joint Ventures and International Associations and Organizations; A.P. Vladislavlev, vice president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs; A.C. Grachev, member of the MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI founder's council; O.V. Kiselev, chairman of the board of directors of AO [joint-stock society] Mosexpo; Ye.M. Kozhokin, director of the Russian Institute of Strategic Studies; V.P. Lukin, doctor of historic science, professor; I.Ye. Malashenko, general director of NTV; M.V. Masarskiy, president of the Association of Enterprise Managers; N.V. Mikhaylov, president of Vympel Interstate Joint-Stock Corporation, doctor of economic sciences, professor; I.M. Khakamada, deputy of the RF Federal Assembly State Duma; I.Yu. Yurgens, first deputy chairman of the General Confederation of Trade Unions; S.N. Yushenkov, chairman of the RF State Duma Federal Assembly's Committee on Defense). The group's work was coordinated by S.A. Karaganov, a deputy director of the Europe Institute of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] and the chairman of the FDPC collegium, and V.T. Tretyakov, editor in chief of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. In the process of preparing these theses, the council has conducted a number of seminars with the participation of noted specialists and politicians of Russia, Ukraine, the United States, Germany, China, Japan, and other countries. Among the materials used were official documents, as well as theoretical work of a number of noted Russian specialists. (Footnote 2)( Members of the working groups used especially extensively the work of the following specialists: A.G. Arbatov, D.A. Danilov, P.Ye. Kandel, I.M. Klyamkin, A.V. Kortunov, V.V. Naumkin, V.A. Nikonov, K.E. Sorokin, S.M. Rogov, P.T. Podlesnyy, V.V. Pazuvayev, D.V. Trenin, and K.O. Sarkisov. The authors would like to express a special appreciation for A.K. Pushkov, who was a co-author of one of the important parts of the report. (Members of the working group would like to thank the FDPC Executive Director T.V. Borisova and Deputy Executive Director A.A. Belkin for organizational and academic help in preparing the theses.) The theses were discussed at the meeting of the FDPC Assembly on 12 May of 1994 and the results of the discussion were incorporated in the draft. Not all planks of the theses necessarily reflect the views of each member of the working group who put his signature under them. Rather, they reflect a broad consensus on their underlying philosophy. The authors almost fully reaffirm the appraisal of the international situation and the prospects for our country's development presented in the 1992 "Strategy for Russia" theses. The new theses do not represent an attempt at an all-encompassing appraisal of the international situation and detailed recommendations on Russia's foreign policy strategy. We are gratified to see that state bodies now have engaged in doing this. The purpose of the theses is to influence several key long-term elements in Russia's policy, first and foremost with respect to the countries of the former USSR, as well as attempt to warn against some dangerous trends that have emerged in the Russian policy. 1. New Elements in Russia's Foreign Policy Situation 1.1. A perceptible trend has developed in Russia's foreign policy toward a shift from the old one-sided alignment with the West to the defense of real national interests. However, it has been accompanied lately by great-power rhetorics on the part of high officials, aimed first and foremost at domestic consumption. This rhetoric, not supported by real economic, political, and military levers, can only exacerbate suspicions that Russia is aiming for an "imperial revanche" in both the near and far abroad. There is presently a danger that Russia may start moving from the old policy of unconditional alignment with the West and neglect of its relations with neighbors in the former USSR to a policy of political confrontation and suspiciousness, on the one hand, and high-handedness of strength, on the other. 1.2. Suspicious attitudes toward Russia undoubtedly are on the rise around the world, but at the same time we see a decline of interest in it; quite a few signs of lack of respect for Russian interests can be detected. The main reason is the progressively weakening Russian economy and the lack of a strong economic strategy capable of taking the country out of the crisis and starting an economic upturn. Russia is relatively weak. But most important, so far no short-term prospects for its stabilization and strengthening are in sight. The West fears a revival of Russian expansionism. Many do not want even a partial restoration of Moscow's influence in the world policy. It should also be noted that there are many in the outside world who are interested in retaining on the territory of the former USSR, strategic counterbalances free of Russian influence. 1.3. For the West, there also are reasons that are purely internal as to why a shift has began in relations with Russia. To a considerable extent, West Europe temporarily lost the capacity for active outward-aimed action because of post-Maastricht difficulties, Germany concentrating on "digesting" eastern lands, the economic decline, and another fit of "Europessimism." There is an increasing desire to shut oneself off from the problems whose resolution requires political will and economic expenditures. Similar processes and orientation, first and foremost toward domestic affairs, also are developing in the United States, albeit in a less explicit form. The West has demonstrated its inability to seriously assist in the Russian reforms or to assist Russia effectively in averting and settling crises in the post-Soviet space. (Limited aid in both the former and the latter is being rendered, however). The inevitable erosion of security structures set up during the years of the Cold War begets fears among a part of traditional Western elites, the desire to slow down or turn back these processes, including with the help of the "rallying factor"--by reviving the perception of an outside, that is, Russian threat. Both in the West and in Russia there are forces that want us to "slip" and provoke a beginning of a new "cold war." 1.4. At the same time, the forces that wish a return to the Cold War do not have an upper hand either in Russia or in the West. Moreover, numerous analyses, including those conducted under the auspices of the FDPC, show that the conflict between Russian vital interests of primary importance and those of the largest countries in the West is not great. In most cases these interests either coincide or do not contradict each other. The conflict emerges only in connection with implementation of interests that are of clearly secondary importance. Thus, there is no deep underlying reason for worsening relations. 1.5. Nevertheless, we face the possibility of such worsening in relations, which will mark the beginning of the third--"farce"--"cold war" (the first one fell in the 1950's-1960's, and the second in the beginning of the 1980's). It cannot be either deep or intense. But for Russia, in its current state of overexertion and weakness, another confrontation with the West will cost extremely dearly and may derail economic reforms. This--and only under the best-case scenario--will lead to stagnation and considerable worsening of general conditions of life for Russian citizens as a minimum for the lifetime of one generation, and make integration processes on the territory of the former USSR more difficult. Moreover, in the event the confrontation exacerbates, the West may attempt to recreate the system of military-political isolation of Russia that will diminish even more its ability to influence the outside world, to defend its interests in it. It is conceivable that the West also has the ability to contribute to its domestic destabilization. The new isolation will be much more damaging than the one in which the USSR lived during the years of the first Cold War. 1.6. Even without a serious worsening in relations, there exists a real threat of qualitative and long-term increase of geopolitical isolation of Russia and weakening of its international positions, especially if a decision is made to expand NATO that would exclude Russia. 1.7. Russia has broken out of confrontation. It does not have any enemies in the foreseeable future and this is a gigantic plus in its current geostrategic situation. It is quite obvious, however, that the hope of acquiring new allies, first and foremost in the West, so far have not materialized. We have not succeeded in creating a new effective security system that would replace the collapsing two-bloc system and in which Russia could feel at least relatively comfortably. At least for the next few years Russia will be compelled to live without clear allies and be in a "suspended state" in a geostrategic sense. 1.8. A qualitatively new situation is developing in most "near-abroad" countries. The mood in favor of integration is growing. At the same time, the trend toward strengthening independent statehood is being replaced by another one--most states become weak. An unstoppable economic decline is taking place. Many states already are destabilized (the Transcaucasus, Tajikistan); others are moving in the same direction. Only the Baltic countries, and also (for different reasons) Turkmenistan, constitute clear exceptions. One may reach a preliminary conclusion that many, if not the majority, of countries that formed after the USSR's disintegration, are proving their inability to survive as completely independent states outside of very close cooperation with Russia, its and each other's support. 1.9. There are many reasons for this. The new structure of prices, under which Russia stopped playing the role of an economic donor, has led to a sharp redistribution of resources between former Soviet republics. Little countries suffer to a relatively greater degree from the disruption of traditional economic ties. All of them experience in most cases a shortage of specialists capable of adopting to new economic conditions, manage on a macroeconomic level, conduct a reform, and this cannot be made up for even in an intermediate-term future. In most CIS countries, for all practical purposes market reforms are not being implemented. The result of all this is that they not only progressively fall behind in relation to Russia, but also develop in different directions. The former USSR countries (with the exception of the Baltics and Turkmenistan) not only are growing increasingly poorer as compared to Russia, the differences in the structure of their economies keeps increasing as well. 1.10. Of particular concern is the situation in Ukraine. Its economy is disintegrating fast; there is the absence of consolidated political will and minimum accord, and perhaps of the ability to implement a resolute reform; the population is getting increasingly more impoverished. The disintegration process has gone far. As early as within the next one to three years Ukraine may have to face a social explosion and the beginning of political disintegration. There is a growing mood among the population, especially in the southern, eastern, and central oblasts, in favor of unification with Russia, as well as distrust and rejection of the policy associated with Western Ukraine. Most elites at the same time would like to preserve some level of state independence. In the foreseeable future calls for unification possibly will be coming from individual regions or oblasts, which may provoke internal clashes. A stream of illegal emigration to Russia is swelling. The manageability of the Ukrainian armed forces is declining dangerously. 1.11. The situation in Ukraine (but not Ukraine itself) currently presents the most serious long-term external challenge to the security and internal stability of Russia. Economic degradation, internal conflicts portending the threat of mass migration, technotronic catastrophes, loss of control over nuclear weapons and arsenals of conventional weapons. 1.12. Against the backdrop of weakening neighboring states, Russia public opinion and political circles, along with the general growth of nationalism, manifest an increased perception of imaginary omnipotence of Russia. This perception is very dangerous. It may result in drawing Russia into a considerable number of conflicts aimed at supporting stability in one or another country or region or at supporting unification processes. Russia, however, does not have either the social, military, or economic potential for it. Russia itself is in a critical economic situation. A quick overexertion is almost inevitable, and with it--increased social instability and renewed disintegration tendencies. Russia may very quickly follow the road of the USSR and fall apart because of excessive strain and insufficient resources. 1.13. At the same time, the experience of the last few years showed that a complete separation from the republics of the former USSR--as had been proposed by radical democrats--is impossible. Neither does it seem possible to effectively regulate by traditional methods of international diplomacy the set of problems that are emerging on the territory of the former USSR: sociopolitical conflicts; the legal and economic situation of almost 70 million persons living outside their ethnic homelands; economic development; borders. Integration with many states of the former USSR in a strategic perspective is almost inevitable. There is simply no other solution. It is only a question of its forms and terms. 1.14. No strategy for defense and promotion of national interests in the foreign arena--even the most elementary one--can be implemented given the current state of the bodies whose job it is to develop and implement this strategy. What we have is a discordant chorus, where each bureaucrat affords himself the luxury of his own policy, which weakens the country's foreign political positions and quite often embarrasses it. This is one of the greatest challenges facing the country's foreign policy. A top to bottom reform of the executive branch has not been completed. The capabilities of the president's apparat still are not commensurate with the president's constitutional prerogatives. 1.15. The shortcomings of the current system in the foreign political sphere per se in a most general sense boil down to the following: 1.15.1. So far the president had not devoted sufficient attention to the issues of foreign policy and national security; in many respects, he removed himself from the dialog with society on the foreign policy issues; he clearly does not have sufficient bureaucratic capabilities through which he could, at least in principle, exercise effective control over the formation and implementation of an integrated foreign policy strategy. 1.15.2. There is still practically no system of strict planning and coordination. The Security Council staff over the past half-year has increased potential capabilities for coordination. It cannot carry out this function effectively, however. The key role in defining the policy is still played by relevant agencies, which, with all the constant bickering between them, are united in one point--the reluctance to subordinate to anyone. As a result, the already meager potential of the country, the capabilities of the president and the presidency in the matters of foreign policy are being sharply diminished. 1.15.3. A continuous, anticipatory dialog between the bodies of executive authority and legislative authority has not been set up. As a result, additional impulses are generated for the confrontation of two branches of power, as well as obstacles on the road of forming a foreign policy consensus. 1.15.4. Because of the largely negligent attitude, the cadres corps, whose task is to serve foreign policy and national security, is in a sad state. To a large extent this is true of counterintelligence. But an especially alarming situation exists with respect to the professional corps of the MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs]. It is seriously demoralized and losing people. As a result, not just the quality of diplomacy suffers. The country is losing human resources that cannot be replaced in the foreseeable future. 1.15.5. Another alarming point is the level of knowledge the society and broad leadership circles possess with respect to foreign policy problems. There is a shortage of both serious analysis and popular coverage of these problems in the mass media. As a result, the mind of the public and policy-forming circles is filled with myths, falls prey to search for "simple solutions" and the worst examples of party propaganda. What To Do 2. General Considerations 2.1. Russia will inevitably see its foreign policy positions worsen, and in the future perhaps will face direct threats to its territorial integrity unless the national leadership manages in the next year or two to self-organize and advance a viable concept of national development--first and foremost, for getting out of the economic crisis: a new industrial policy designed for the long-term perspective, the rescue of scientific-technical intelligentsia and advance technologies, the restoration of law and order, and the restraint of corruption. The key formula of the entire Russian strategy must be "accumulation of strength" or, using A.M. Gorchakov's formula, "concentration." Without it Russia will not be able to ensure the well-being and freedom of its citizens and take the place of a respected and self-respecting power in the world. 2.2. One of the possible ways to stimulate such consolidation, such "accumulation of strength" is to create a nongovernment National Strategy Commission. This commission could also include representatives of the current administration--however, not for political oversight or guidance but just to enrich the unrestricted analysis of possible alternatives with information and ideas not available to people who are not part of the ruling structures. This commission could produce a long-term program of national development, around which a platform could emerge for uniting responsible and future-oriented economic and political leaders, the active part of the society. We have to honestly admit that so far none of the parties, nor the government, nor the president in his message to the Federal Assembly have been able to advance such a long-term program, although they have identified many of its essential elements. 3. Policy Toward Former USSR Countries It is no longer possible to conduct any policy toward the countries of the former USSR without defining clear strategic goals. Russia must decide in the very near future what it wants. Effective and long-term solution of the second-tier tasks--maintaining stability, establishing economic and financial cooperation, ensuring human rights, military-political interaction, and so on--is impossible unless these tasks are built into the overall strategy and subordinated to a single goal. The low efficiency of Russian policy over the past two years with respect to CIS countries and the fact that the organization is in a skid is a vivid testimony to this. 3.2. The disintegration of the USSR, despite likely being a historic inevitability, brought deprivation and a decline in the standard of living and quality of life for most people of the former USSR and has led to a succession of conflicts that has yet to reach the end. But such a conclusion should not push us toward a policy that may lead to even greater losses and suffering. 3.3. The boundaries of Russia's strategic choice are extremely narrow if we keep in mind first and foremost the progressive weakening of the majority of neighboring states, the growing instability in them, which has exceeded or is about to exceed the critical mark, the shift of the moods there in favor of integration, and the emerging balance of attitudes in the ruling groups in Russia itself. The different direction of Russian economic development and other countries of the former USSR; the lack of ability or desire to coordinate its interests with long-term interests of all countries; the lack of real experience of modern integration; and the political, social, and military-political instability make the idea of creating a EU-type community on the territory of the greater part of the former USSR increasingly less realistic even in the intermediate-range term. 3.4. Essentially, Russia is left with just one alternative: Either a course toward reuniting with the considerable number of former USSR republics--or in the event of their disintegration, with their regions--and creating a new federative state; or a course toward preserving political independence of these states in exchange for unlimited access to their markets of goods, services, and capital, creating an effective defensive military-political union, and providing a single legal space for all ethnic minorities that will ensure their full rights. That is, integration not through territorial and political unification, but through creation of political, military-political, and other conditions for economic interaction and interpenetration, which in turn should ensure and support political and military-political interests of Russia on the territory of the former USSR. Of course, the policy should provide conditions for such an integration as well in the event this trend becomes objectively predominant. 3.5. The goal of creating (or recreating) a federative state is too costly in political terms and especially in economic terms. Absolutely unacceptable are ultranationalists' recipes--reunification through strong-arm expansion, by undermining in a controlled way the stability of neighboring states. Such a policy is not only immoral--it is also impractical: Instability will inevitably spill over into Russia itself. However, the course toward reunification may turn out counterproductive even when purely economic and political levers are used: It will require gigantic infusions of money into frequently collapsing economic entities, direct subsidies to prop the population's standard of living in the neighboring states in order to make it at least comparable with that in Russia. Russia is in danger of turning again into an economic colony of states it will unite around itself. Considering the current standard of living in Russia itself, its inevitable sharp decline may lead to an explosion of social discontent and increased disintegration trends in Russia itself, when the regions, in order to avoid dramatic destabilization of the social situation, will be compelled to resort to a save-yourself policy. In this case, any industrial policy will be doomed from the start, society's modernization will be reversed, and a national strategy of accumulation of strength and restoration will be impossible. Overexertion is almost inevitable, and because of this overexertion and the shortage of resources, Russia may quickly go the way of the USSR. The policy toward unification will cause inevitable sabotage and resistance on the part of a considerable part of local elites. Besides, they will be to a considerable extent absolved of the responsibility for economic disintegration, impoverishment of the population, and instability. They will get an opportunity, even greater than before, to shift the responsibility onto Moscow. Finally, an open course toward full integration, especially with Ukraine, may cause tensions in relations with the outside world, and the rise of already-obvious anti-Russian moods. This will create difficulties in utilizing outside sources of growth: technologies, capital, societal management and social development expertise. The probability of NATO's expansion will sharply increase, and the danger of overexertion will increase even more. 3.6. Russia should not support just any integration--only that which will be beneficial for Russians and the Russian state. We also have to recognize the right of our neighbors to such a policy of "enlightened egotism." 3.7. The policy aimed at creating around Russia a system of friendly states, nonconfrontational toward Russia and economically open to it, also is not going to be cheap--both from the standpoint of political effort and from a purely economic standpoint. But this strategy is qualitatively cheaper and more profitable. Russia will not have to bear direct responsibility for maintaining the standard of living of the population of neighboring states. It will be able to avoid a return to the position of economic donor, and will be able to utilize to the full extent its advantages--natural resources, the technological potential, on average more skilled labor force and managerial cadres. It will have access to the natural, economic, and human resources of neighboring countries on a basis relatively more advantageous for it. The goal of such policy is not to restore with some modification the situation that existed before the disintegration of the USSR, but to modernize these relations in a way advantageous for Russia, whereby it will retain many advantages of its former geostrategic position and at the same time create for itself a much more advantageous economic position in the new commonwealth of states. The philosophy of this approach is "leadership instead of direct control." 3.8. Russia has the right to propose development of some model of interaction with the neighboring countries, but it should not impose it the hard way. And especially so by force. The people and the leadership of the neighboring countries must make their own choice. But the price of refusal also should be made quite clear from the very beginning: reducing the incentives for economic, political, or military-political support on the part of Russia. Such a formula will probably cause less resistance in the outside world, since it will not lead to a qualitatively greater military-political power of Russia and at the same time will ensure the opportunities for stabilizing the situation in the space of the former USSR. Apparently, only after getting out of the crisis, successfully implementing economic reform, and achieving a sharp rise in economic might and prosperity will Russia be able to afford a closer integration with those former USSR republics that will want it and if it is advantageous for Russia itself. 3.9. The concrete directions of Russia's actions in implementing the policy based on the "leadership instead of control" philosophy could be the following: 3.9.1. Insist on removing all restrictions on the movement of goods, on creating conditions for the capital of all countries to participation in privatization; transfer of industrial and other assets in exchange for debt. Active support on the part of all states for interpenetration of capital. 3.9.2. Create an effective system of mutual clearing, first on a bilateral basis, and then possibly by creating a clearing union with a reserve currency. At the same time, complete integration of financial systems should be avoided. The example of Belarus should be an exception rather than the rule (although its repetition cannot be completely precluded) because of the closeness of this country to Russia and its strategic position. It is necessary to attentively study the experience, benefits, and costs of economic integration with Belarus. 3.9.3. A course at creating a close military-political union of a considerable part of the former USSR states in the future, possibly with unified armed forces. 3.9.4. A course toward the right of all former USSR citizens to have a second citizenship (Footnote 3:) (On the issue of second (or dual) citizenship, the opinions of FDPC members were polarized. This thesis is left in the text more as an indication of a problem than as a commonly recognized version of its solution), and protection from any discrimination. 3.10. These goals might be achieved through following means: 3.10.1. The main principles of the policy must be flexibility. In addition to several fundamental principles, the policy with respect to each country should be formed on the basis of concrete conditions and concrete interests of Russia. The line toward strengthening the CIS must be continued, but it will not bring effective results without a stronger emphasis on bilateral forms of interaction in relations with former USSR states. Multilateral diplomacy within the CIS framework should develop on the foundation of new bilateral relations, in which Russia occupies stronger positions than in the system of multilateral contacts. 3.10.2. Within the framework of general strategic principles, Russia has to have a separately developed line with respect to each of the states of the former USSR. These lines may differ substantially from one another. 3.10.3. A consistent and energetic interaction with the responsible political forces of neighboring states. 3.10.4. Conduct policy aimed at preventing disintegration of neighboring states, preserving the main internationally recognized attributes of their statehood. At the same time, Russia cannot become a guarantor of preservation of the regimes that have shown the inability to govern their countries or that violate the rights of ethnic minorities, including the Russian one. 3.10.5. Limit interference in internal affairs other than in instances of gross and mass-scale violations of human rights, or unleashing civil wars that require peacekeeping measures in keeping with the UN Charter. The concept of Russia's special responsibility should not lead to a sharp expansion of Russia's participation in settling the conflicts. Moscow should stick to the principle: the less direct involvement, the better. At the same time, this principle cannot be made into an absolute--as experience shows, in some instances early intervention may prevent protracted conflicts with serious bloodshed. 3.10.6. All possible support for the export of capital to spheres profitable for Russia; support for establishing direct ties between oblasts, rayons, cities, and enterprises. 3.10.7. Purposeful efforts aimed at preserving the positions of Russian language; increasing at state expense the training of specialists from neighboring states in Russian institutions of higher learning. 3.10.8. Russia's policy toward the countries of the former USSR must be aimed at protecting the rights of all ethnic minorities. The Russian flag, Moscow must become symbols of guarantees of minority rights, protection from aggressive nationalism, from wars and violence. At the same time, on its own it needs to direct its policy toward the protection of rights and interests of Russian abroad. In this connection it appears expedient to create a special state organ coordinating the work of relevant ministries and agencies. 3.10.9. Taking into account the specificities of history, geography, and culture of the Baltic states, Russia must have a special policy with respect to these countries, aimed at building good-neighbor relations with them as they proceed with a civilized solution of the problem of ethnic minorities there and on the condition of taking into account legitimate interests of Russian security. 3.10.10. The course on "leadership instead of control" is far from ideal, including in the opinion of the authors of these theses. However, it represents the least evil. At the same time, of all politically available realistic options it seems to meet to the greatest extent the interests of both Russia and Russians, and those of citizens of neighboring states interested ((as published--line(s) missing)) 4. Policy Toward the Outside World 4.1. A slow but steady erosion of the security system created over the years of the Cold War; the diverse and broad geographic spread of Russia's political and economic interests; its current relative weakness; the obstacles preventing quick rapprochement with the West, which have become apparent by now, require that we conduct a flexible policy of balancing between the centers of power, build dynamically the balance of force with individual states and individual regions that would be advantageous for Russia. 4.2. The line of rejecting the costly globalist policy must be continued. The policy must be maximally economical and commensurate with current abilities. At the same time, Russia must boost its policy of cooperation and presence in those regions where there is interest in such cooperation and where it may bring economic dividends and increase the country's general political influence. This includes, for example, India, Greece, Bulgaria, Southeast Europe as a whole, and the Near East. We need to continue the policy aimed at developing relations as friendly and close as possible with China. There is the potential for Russian foreign policy to boost its presence in the Asian-Pacific region, and interaction within it with the United States, China, and Japan. 4.3. At the same time, because of historic, geographic, and cultural specificities of our country, the economic and technological might of the West, as well as the fact that Russia at this point does not have natural allies in the South and the East, its long-term goal should be to establish a stable realistic partnership, and in the future perhaps a strategic association, with the northern belt countries--from the United States and Canada to Japan, gradually involving in it China and other states. We should continue the course toward including Russia--and later possibly China--in the activities of the "Big Seven"--first on a political level. 4.4. It is necessary to conduct a policy aimed at avoiding the unneeded increase of tensions with the West and, on the contrary, to aim at establishing with it as close an interaction as possible in the areas where it is possible--not, however, at the expense of Russia giving up its own interests, but through their greater coordination. The dominant contents of relations should be stable cooperation while expanding the field of partnership where our interests and the concept for a problem resolution coincide (for example, nuclear nonproliferation and other spheres of military-strategic interaction, especially with the United States). Nor should we preclude a limited and controlled competition along certain lines (for instance, arms trade). 4.5. The interests of avoiding isolation and preserving influence in relations with West Europe, preventing a return to a military confrontation in Europe, and creating in the future an effective system of common European security of which Russia would be a full-fledged member, require preservation of the semi-demilitarized belt of states that has emerged in the center of Europe, preventing NATO's expansion, and broadening the dialog between Russia and NATO, which in the future would make the issue of expanding the bloc without Russian participation in its activities moot. Expansion of the zone of prosperity and stability to include the countries of Central and East Europe and the fastest possible inclusion of these countries into the EU would be in Russian national interests overall. 4.6. It is necessary to sharply increase the intensity of Russian policy in Europe and the efforts aimed at creating in a long-term future an effective system of collective European security or at least at preventing the creation of a system that would exclude Russia to some degree. Keeping in mind the possibility of NATO's expansion without Russian participation, it is necessary to increase the efforts to search for alternative ways to ensure Russia's security and political interests in Europe. 4.7. Also necessary are special efforts to support and expand an intensive dialog and interaction with the leading countries of the West, especially with Germany and the United States. 4.8. In order to attenuate possible irritants in relations with the outside world associated with the activation of integration processes on the territory of the former USSR, it is expedient to involve the West and other states in an intensive bilateral dialog on these problems. 4.9. We should not allow the necessary shift in Russian diplomacy's tone in relations with the West in the direction of greater independence and equal standing to become a goal in itself, and the enchantment with words to lead to a new alienation between Russia and the most advanced and powerful countries. Russia's realization of its status as one of the leading great powers must proceed on the basis of restoration of its economy, the use of existing and the creation of new levers to influence the situation, the strengthening of Russia's positions on the territory of the former USSR rather than through aggressive rhetoric that inflicts direct damage on the national interests. 5. Organizational Measures 5.1. The main task is to create conditions for the maximum concentration and coordination of resources and actions of all agencies toward protection and advancement of foreign policy interests of the society and the state. Building an effective structure of organs whose task is to protect the national interests in the foreign arena is a task of no lesser priority than developing the policy itself. Specifically, we consider it expedient to take the following steps: 5.1.1. Considerably increase the president's attention to foreign policy issues. Dramatically increase the role of presidential structures in its formulation and coordination, while retaining the democratic balance and constitutional responsibility of all branches of authority, including a strong parliament. 5.1.2. Create in the president's apparat--with the possible utilization or involvement of the Security Council's apparat, or on the basis of it--structures capable of effective policy coordination, possessing personnel capabilities commensurate with the task and, most important, a proper authorization from the president. We do not want to preclude the possibility of raising MFA potential in matters of foreign policy coordination. Experience tells us, however, that its potential is limited, especially in the part associated with the policy toward the countries of the former USSR. 5.1.3. For the president's apparat and under the president's supervision, to develop, with the participation of agencies and interagency commissions of the Security Council, continuously updated directives on individual lines of security policy, in particular, on foreign policy. After being approved by the Security Council and the president, these directives must become mandatory. Violation and nonfulfillment of them without the president's concurrence on each individual issue must lead to a practically automatic dismissal of officials permitting such a violations. 5.1.4. Create a sufficiently powerful structure that would be commensurate with the task, capable of formulating in a comprehensive and effective manner and coordinating implementation of the policy toward each of the countries of the former USSR. This may be done by creating a corresponding department with country desks in the president's apparat, in the Security Council apparat, by raising the status of the Ministry on CIS Affairs and creating in it country desks possessing personnel capabilities and prerogatives to coordinate the activities of agencies, or through a corresponding strengthening of the MFA. There probably are other options. One thing is clear--it is impermissible to continue the status quo. 5.1.5. It is expedient to set up a special unit in the president's apparat that would conduct state information activities on the issue of foreign policy in strict coordination with the MFA. 5.2. Special measures of an organizational, as well as a financial and moral nature, must be implemented in order to save and strengthen the cadres corps of the diplomatic establishment, the officer corps of enforcement ministries, whose role at the current stage of our history will inevitably grow not only from the standpoint of maintaining internal stability, but also in conducting a policy of prevention and regulation of crises in a number of regions of the former USSR, collection of relevant information, and support of the political and economic interests of Russia. 5.3. Keeping in mind the increasing influence of the armed forces in modern political life of Russia, the state leadership, and first and foremost the Ministry of Defense itself, as well as the leadership of other enforcement ministries, should not only facilitate development of civilian control over the armed forces, but also develop and implement a program for integrating the officer corps into civilian society. It is also necessary to develop a comprehensive program for raising the social status and prestige of military service. Rapprochement with and support for the officer corps is also a task for new elites, first and foremost entrepreneurs, who have a stake in the country's stable development. 5.4. Members of the working group do not claim that the recommendations on reforming the bodies involved in foreign policy are exhaustive. It is clear, however, that a reform is long overdue. The current situation inflicts serious damage on the country's international positions and prestige, and weakens its national security.
