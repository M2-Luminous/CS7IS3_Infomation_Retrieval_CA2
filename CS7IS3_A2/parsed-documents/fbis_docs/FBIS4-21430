Thai developers plan to invest in the Bt [baht] 12 billion tourism development, which would comprise an international airport, a 10-megawatt hydropower station, 100,000-hectares of eucalyptus plantations, two 18-hole golf courses, a 1,200-room hotel, 1,000 resort units and a casino. An official in Vientiane who asked not to be named said the area is plagued with Schistosomiasis disease, better known as blood fluke. ``We are suspicious of how the project is going to bring in tourists as Schistosomiasis is widespread, unless the project has a plan to eliminate the disease first,'' said the officer. ``We are concerned that the project might fail, after having already irreversibly destroyed nature in Laos,'' he said. Chanthaviphon Inthavon. deputy director of the National Office for Nature Conservation and Watershed Management in Vientiane, said he was worried about the proposal to transform 100,000 hectare of dry deciduous forest into eucalyptus plantations. ``It is too ambitious,'' he said. Chanthaviphon said the nature conservation committee had suggested the area planted to eucalyptus should be scaled down. ``We recommended that only a limited area, not full scale development, for the plantations project should be approved as a study whether it will really work,'' he said. Dr. Tysons Robert, a fish biologist of Mahidon University and one of the few scientists studying the Lower Mekong Basin, said the project's impact on fish and riverine ecology is among major environmental concerns. Robert said the location of Li Phi falls is unique in the whole Mekong system, with rapids extending over 3-5 kilometres. ``It is the only place where the main channel of the Mekong has such a big waterfall, separating the lower river from the upper river. So it provides a lot of habitats in a long place and fish are different,'' said Robert. ``Waterfalls or rapids are healthy places for fish. It's good for food, with a lot of oxygen. Many fish prefer to live in places with fast flowing water and a rocky habitat. There are more fish than other places.'' Robert said the proposed golf course would probably be kept green through the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, as well as water from the mainstream Mekong. All of this could affect the fish ecology in the area. ``Water draining from the golf course, which has a lot of strange chemicals in it, could have a very bad effect on fish,'' noted Robert. Another Laotian official told THE NATION that the small hydro-power station will be located at the edge of Khon Phapheng fall and will use a ``floating generation system''. The Khon Phapheng resort is planned to be the first development project on the mainstream of the Lower Mekong Basin.
