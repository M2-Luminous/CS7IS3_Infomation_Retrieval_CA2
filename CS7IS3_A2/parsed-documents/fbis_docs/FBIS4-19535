At an international expert conference of the Friedrich-Ebert Foundation about the responsibilities of police and intelligence services in the democratic rule-of-law state, Werthebach said in the Berlin Reichstag that this expansion of authority must be decided by politics. It would preserve the separation of powers and the independence of police and intelligence services. As the representative of the police, Leopold Schuster, head of the Counternarcotic Department in the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA], objected to Werthebach's statements. Expanding the tasks of the intelligence services is not absolutely necessary, he said. In addition, there are constitutional obstacles to it. Werthebach justified his proposal by saying that the BfV has experience in counterespionage and in keeping an eye on both national and international underground terrorist movements. His office is better equipped in terms of "means of surveillance" than the police. The precondition for taking over the task of combating crime is an increase in personnel as well as an amendment to the Federal Constitutional Protection Law. Werthebach sees potential work for the BfV in observing organized crime structures that might exert influence over the media. It is urgently necessary to harmonize the methods and legal bases of intelligence services all over Europe. In addition, in Germany there is no central interlocutor for the European intelligence services. Werthebach said that currently the most dangerous form of organized crime is the illegal transport of radioactive substances from the CIS into West Europe. Schuster explained his rejection of BfV cooperation by saying that preinvestigations are usual in the police and not a privilege of the intelligence services. Rather, in view of about 7 million crimes in 1993, the BKA is forced to cope with "considerable problems regarding resources." In order to "comprehensively" combat organized crime, the BKA demands the authority of a central body. According to Schuster, last year there were 776 investigations of 10,000 individuals suspected of involvement in organized crime.
