The field of bioprocessing technology at the Hamburg-Harburg Technical University (Professor Herbert Maerkl, Denickestrasse 15, 21071, Hamburg) has now, in cooperation with Preussag Noell Wassertechnik GmbH, developed a new type of bioreactor concept for increasing the decomposition effects. As reported by Maerkl, anaerobic biotechnical cleaning methods are generally held to be less effective than aerobic ones. This is due to the slow rate of growth of the anaerobic microorganisms. However, the decomposition effects per gram of biomass are comparable to those of aerobic microbes. For that reason, if it is possible to increase the biomass in the reactor, anaerobic methods are also very effective. This increase has been achieved with the biogas tower reactor from Hamburg by using the sludge bed process. Another problem with anaerobic bioreactors is transferring the generated biogas to the outside. Gas production can be so high that disposal is impossible to deal with or would lead to a loss of biomass through flotation. This problem is also solved by the tower reactor. Gas suction equipment has been built into the reactor container at various heights. This makes it possible to dispose of gas even at low levels. Technically, the suction equipment works by adding pockets in the form of sloping metal sheets in the reactor volume. They partition the reactor into several compartments connected with each other and catch the rising biogas. The gas bubble formed under the sheet can be drawn off through a vent placed there. By regulating the gas extraction at the various heights, it is possible to regulate the gas content so as to be uniform throughout the reactor. But the gas bubble under the pockets has other advantages as well. By means of the free surfaces formed on the liquid, floating biomass particles are also kept down. Therefore, the gas extraction is possible without loss of biomass. The pockets can also help when mixing the reactor content. It is important for the decomposition effect that the microorganisms and the added waste water are as evenly distributed as possible. Since some microbes live in the form of symbiotic agglomerates, this blending must have as little gravitational force as possible. This problem is elegantly solved in the biogas tower reactor. If the gas under the pockets is not removed, it continues to rise upward over an overflow edge. Through built-in flow channels this creates a circulating flow in the liquid. It can be controlled by the level of gas removal. In this way various blending intensities can be regulated in the various compartments of the reactor. The requirement to achieve good blending in the lower reactor areas and a high storage capacity for the biomass in the higher areas is easily met. By properly regulating the blending, the inhibiting effect of hydrogen sulfide, which is created from sulfate in the waste water, can also be reduced. At this time a 20-meter-high reactor with a diameter of one meter is being operated as a pilot facility. It has turned out to be successful in treating yeast waste water.
