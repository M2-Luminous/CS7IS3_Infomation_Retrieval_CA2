As concerns the military aspect of the relevant clause in the Moscow declaration, which Yeltsin and Clinton signed last week, the change of targets reduces the first-strike threat, the risk of an unsanctioned launch, and thereby the danger of nuclear war in general, according to Major-General Anatoliy Svetikov, who represented the Russian strategic missile forces at the briefing. The presidents promised to re-target their missiles not later than May 30, 1994. But in actual fact, target coordinates can be changed within 15 to 20 minutes, the general said. According to specialists, the procedure is not very complicated -- the target coordinates which can guide a missile to the United States or Russia will be replaced in the missile computer memory with the coordinates of one or another deserted areas in the world ocean. According to American sources, about twenty such areas have been identified to become the main targets in the missile computer memories. Reserve coordinates will be saved in the memory as well. If all coordinates are deleted from memory, the missile can hit land in the same area from which it was launched.
