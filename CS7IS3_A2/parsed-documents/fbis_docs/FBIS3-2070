"The Key Technologies for Our National Economic Development in the 1990's" is a guiding policy document. Through this document, the state -- proceeding from the overall needs of national economic development -- would make full use of the role of planning as well as the market as a means of regulation; guide along scientific and technological capabilities throughout the nation; put together human, material, and financial resources at the central and local levels; and bring into play the initiative of all quarters to emphatically solve a number of major scientific and technological problems closely related to national economic development, so as to promote readjustment of the industrial structure and push on the optimization and upgrading of the industrial structure. "The Key Technologies for Our National Economic Development in the 1990's" announced this time comprise mainly those in the following categories: 1. Agriculture: involving two kinds of technologies, including crop breeding and comprehensively tackling problems at moderate- and low-yield areas; 2. Energy and the environment: involving five kinds of technologies, including low- temperature nuclear heating, tertiary oil recovery, coal cleaning and utilization, and other technologies; 3. Transportation: involving three kinds of technologies, including high-speed railway transportation, high-grade highways, and inland river shipping; 4. Raw materials and resources: involving seven kinds of technologies, including the continuous casting and rolling of thin sheets and billets [bo ban bei lian zhu lian zha 5631 2647 0999 6647 6999 6647 6509], iron-smelting using oxygen and coal, deep processing and compounding of heavy oil, engineering plastics, plastic alloys, and others technologies; 5. Information and communications: involving nine kinds of technologies, including integrated circuits, computers, software, optic-fiber communications, and other technologiges; 6. Manufacturing: including numerical control technology, laser technology, technology for manufacturing large sets of thermoelectric generating equipment, and five other kinds of technologies; 7. Biotechnology: involving six kinds of technologies including genetic engineering for animals and plants, cross-breeding fibroma [za jiao liu 7177 0074 4058] technology, industrial microbiological technology, protein engineering, and other technologies.
