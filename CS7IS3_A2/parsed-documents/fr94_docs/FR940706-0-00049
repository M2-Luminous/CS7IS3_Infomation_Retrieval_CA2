FR940706-0-00049 FR940706-0-00011 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 658 [I.D. 062994E] Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Adjustment of the ending date of the Texas closure. SUMMARY: NMFS announces an adjustment of the ending date of the annual closure of the shrimp fishery in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off Texas. The closure normally ends on July 15 each year. Because biological data indicate that brown shrimp leaving the Texas estuaries will have reached the desired size by July 7, 1994, the ending date is changed to this earlier date. The Texas closure is intended to prohibit the harvest of brown shrimp during their major period of emigration from Texas estuaries to the Gulf of Mexico so the shrimp may reach a larger, more valuable size and to prevent the waste of brown shrimp that would be discarded in fishing operations because of their small size. EFFECTIVE DATES: The EEZ off Texas is closed to trawl fishing from 30 minutes after sunset, May 13, 1994, to 30 minutes after sunset, July 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael E. Justen, 813&hyph;893&hyph;3161. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery is managed under the Fishery Management Plan for the Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council and is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR part 658 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq .). The FMP's implementing regulations at 50 CFR 658.25 describe the Texas closure and provide for adjustments to the beginning and ending dates by the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, under specified criteria. Available information meeting the criteria specified at 50 CFR 658.25(b)(1) indicates that an early ending of the Texas closure is warranted and desirable. Biological data collected by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department indicate that ending the closure on July 7, 1994, will provide adequate protection of small brown shrimp emigrating from the Texas estuaries. Accordingly, the time and date at 50 CFR 658.25(a) for ending the Texas closure is changed from 30 minutes after sunset, July 15, 1994, to 30 minutes after sunset on July 7, 1994. During the closure, the area described at 50 CFR 658.25(a) is closed to all trawl fishing, except that a vessel may fish for royal red shrimp beyond the 100&hyph;fathom (183&hyph;m) depth contour. The waters of Texas are also closed during this period. Classification This action is authorized by 50 CFR 658.25 and has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. Dated: June 29, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
