The current conflict concerns the Aabenraa Hospital issue -- and illustrates the cool relations between the party's group chairman and its political spokesperson. The party chairman is irritated. The rank and file are irritated. And the group chairman and the political spokesperson are also irritated -- with each other. It is only four months since mutual accusations of destroying the party's credibility flew through the air. Energy Minister Jann Sjursen, the party chairman, had to call a meeting to clear the air and make sure that all four group members continued to support the government work. The background was a number of special communiques from the group's feminine wing, health spokesperson Inger Stilling Pedersen and political spokesperson Merethe Due Jensen, who took turns locking horns with the government's official position on the law regulating store closing hours, child care, elementary education, and mental illness. And in so doing they also clashed with the group's masculine side, group chairman Henning Lysholm Christensen and group secretary Ole M. Nielsen, behind the closed doors of the group's conference room. And now there is trouble again. This time it is the government's lightning move against the controversial payment system at Aabenraa Hospital that has divided the group. To such an extent that on Tuesday [8 February] evening the party itself considered it necessary to issue a press release on the split. And once more the disagreement draws an invisible line between the two women's adjoining offices and the two men's adjoining offices on the third floor on Proviantgarden in Christiansborg. The men support the proposal. The women oppose it. And at the same time they do not understand what could lead Nielsen and Christensen to change their position in the space of a few hours on a hectic Tuesday. The reason can be found in the big difference in their attitude toward working methods. And this also illustrates the crucial dilemma in the small party, which is more likely to come in below the Folketing cutoff barrier in the polls than above it. Despite their declarations of loyalty to the government, Merethe Jensen and Inger Pedersen are more preoccupied than Nielsen and Christensen with the party's "explanation problem" and stressing party viewpoints for the party's many nonsocialist voters. Nielsen and Christensen, on the other hand, are more inclined to regard achieving results by means of a quiet "tough long haul" as a virtue. That is why they did not take long to think it over when the prime minister inquired on Tuesday if at least two members of the group could support the government's legislative intervention -- to avoid an admission of total failure. The difference in their views on method is also personified by the relations between Jensen and Christensen. The two are very seldom seen in each other's offices and it is no secret in the party that the "chemistry and communication" between the two leave a lot to be desired. Party chairman Sjursen did not want to comment on that. However, he was annoyed that they had not managed to stand together on the Aabenraa proposal. "That was not smart. We should be able to agree. It is particularly annoying because the proposal expresses our party's position exactly," the chairman said. And thus implied that the group's two women should approve it. But in spite of the wrangling and fear of the coming election, none of the KrF politicians disagree on where the heavy emphasis should lie in a possible new government base: family policy and the right of parents to make free choices about child care. The question now is whether an ultimatum will be issued. For although no one wants to be quoted as saying so, the attitude in the small party is clear: The Center Democrats (CD) got something (through the government shakeup, ed.) -- now it is our turn.
