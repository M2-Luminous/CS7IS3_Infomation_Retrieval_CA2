In the conference, the ambassador briefed the content of a statement by Kang Sok-chu, first vice foreign minister, to reporters and said: Our country and the United States agreed to take a joint action for a solution to the nuclear issue in New York on 25 February. According to the agreement the International Atomic Energy Agency's inspection has started, beginning on 1 March, a working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South has resumed, and a statement was announced regarding the suspension of the Team Spirit joint military exercise. It is good thing that the agreement was reached on the joint action and that the work for their realization has begun. However, the measures taken for the joint action are still on a primary level [kichojok] and are nothing but a beginning. The problem we have now is how to implement the agreement. If the measures for the joint action are properly implemented the DPRK-U.S. talks will be able to proceed smoothly and the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula will be able to be resolved completely [kunwonjokuro]. The problem is that barriers [nangwan] should not be created by putting forth conditions. If barriers are created the situation will become grave again. We want the United States not to create obstacles to the implementation of the agreement any longer. The people in the world, as well, hope that the agreement reached between the DPRK and the United States is implemented as it is and that, accordingly, the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is resolved peacefully. However, acts are emerging now which arouse suspicions in implementing the DPRK-U.S. agreement on the measures for the joint action. In particular, Japan, not satisfied with the agreement between the DPRK and the United States, is kicking off a commotion, babbling that a special inspection should be conducted and the like. Japan is trying to hinder a solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and, thus, is aiming at justifying its nuclear armament. Japan has stockpiled large quantities of plutonium and completed the means of delivery of nuclear weapons. Now that Japan's nuclear armament has reached a very dangerous stage we cannot but enhance our alertness to this. It is because if Japan is armed with nuclear weapons the denuclearization of Northeast Asia cannot be realized nor will the declaration of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula be meaningful. Therefore, to achieve the overall denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the Northeast Asian region, Japan's nuclear armament must be thoroughly blocked. Whether or not the agreement on the measures for the joint action is faithfully implemented depends entirely on the U.S. side. We will keenly watch the U.S. side's actions. If the U.S. side fails to implement the agreement with unwarranted pretexts we will take corresponding countermeasures against it. The ambassador also revealed the South Korean authorities' crime of destroying the ecological environment and doing harm to people's health by dumping nuclear waste on sea. He then answered questions raised by reporters.
