Its expected output for 1994 is 720,000 tons. Coal exports have also increased rapidly with the export volume increasing from 170,000 tons in 1992 to 200,000 tons in 1993 and to an expected 300,000 tons this year." With its organizational advantage, military units engaged in coal production have operated effectively as state enterprises under the Army's Truong Son, Song Hong, and 11th Engineering General Corporations and have made their adequate contributions to the state budget. The first two general corporations have become members of the Coal Exporting Council since 1992. "The export through only one outlet has helped eliminate the state of competitive buying and selling and the forcible reduction of price. This export system is beneficial to both the state and the enterprises concerned. However, this system has created a situation in which military enterprises have concentrated only on production without paying any attention to world market demands." As these military enterprises do not have any frequent foreign customers, "they have been adversely affected by a decision of the COALIMEX (Coal Import-Export and Supply) Corporation under the Ministry of Energy to stop helping units outside the coal sector export their coal, beginning April 1994." "As of 1 April 1994, coal-exploiting military units had registered some 150,000 tons of coal still in backlog, including 100,000 tons exploited in the first quarter of 1994 and 50,000 tons left behind since last year. During the first quarter of 1994, military enterprises could only export 10,000 tons of coal or so, including 6,000 tons from the Truong Son Engineering General Corporation and over 5,000 tons from the 11th Engineering General Corporation. Should the managerial system for the production and sales of coal remain unchanged, it is certain that coal-producing military units will not achieve their marketing targets."
