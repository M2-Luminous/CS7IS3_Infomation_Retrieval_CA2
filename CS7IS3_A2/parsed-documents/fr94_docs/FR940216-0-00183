(1) The model given in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be used as given to determine VOC and toxics emissions, respectively, if the properties of the fuel being evaluated fall within the ranges shown in this paragraph (c). If the properties of the fuel being evaluated fall outside the range shown in this paragraph (c), the model may not be used to determine the VOC or toxics performance of the fuel: ␣ 1Fuel parameter 1Range Benzene content 0&hyph;2.5 vol % RVP 6.6&hyph;9.0 psi Oxygenate content 0&hyph;3.5 vol % Aromatics content 10&hyph;45 vol %
