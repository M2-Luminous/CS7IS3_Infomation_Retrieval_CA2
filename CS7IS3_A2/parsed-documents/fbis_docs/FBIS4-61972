The statement underlined that improvement of the system of taxation and establishment of the state budget was the main task of any government. The statement emphasized that since the state budget was not receiving taxes it could not pay wages to physicians, teachers, artists, and scientists. This limits the opportunities for the state in providing social security for pensioners, students and other not well-off categories of the population. However, the government continues to finance unprofitable enterprises which cannot sell their production freezing significant financial funds. The unjustified decrees in the purchasing capacity of the population hampers to sell products even if the actual demand for it exists. This aggravates the crisis in the Kyrgyz society and economy. The present situation lays the agreements with international financial organizations like the IMF and the World Bank open to possibility of a wreck in what concerns the financing of the economic and social reforms. No preferential financial resources could be attracted to the Republic under such circumstances. The statement also pointed out that the position and the moves of the government were absolutely illogical within the context of the aggravating economic and social situation. The government, however, keeps deferring works on development of the gold deposits with the participation of foreign investors for mutual benefits. Primarily, this means the delay in joint development of the Kumtor gold deposit with the participation of the Canadian Cameco company.
