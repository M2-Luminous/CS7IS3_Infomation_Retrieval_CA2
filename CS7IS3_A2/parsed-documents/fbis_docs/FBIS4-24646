Reform of state-owned enterprises is regarded as the key and bottleneck in wide-ranging reform because of their economic importance, and the close link to ideology. It will not be easy to push this reform, and it will even more difficult to realize it. Faced with the various knotty issues in reform of state-owned enterprises, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji went down south to Chongqing, a strategic industrial city, and personally made investigation and arrangements during the spring festival this year. He is bent on taking another bold step in Chongqing by selecting some large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises as experimental units for enforcing the bankruptcy law. The state-owned enterprises selected are those with poor management for a long time, with unmarketable products, with assets failing to cover debts, and unable to be reorganized or transformed through other channels. Chongqing selected a paper mill as the first step. Should it be successful, another two enterprises will be selected for further experiment. There is no obstacle to allowing those state-owned enterprises that can in no way continue operation to go bankrupt either in concept or legal principle, but it can be extremely difficult in implementation. Two years ago, Chongqing was the first on the mainland to allow a state-owned enterprise to go bankrupt. The bankrupt knitwear factory did not have many workers, but their problems have not been properly resolved as of today; the city government has taken up the burden itself. According to the enterprise institutional reform plan set last year, state-owned enterprises with a total loss of 100 million yuan per day should undergo comprehensive reform. While formulating a plan, experts and scholars offered many panaceas; however, taking ideology into consideration, the plan was ironed out and the final plan became smooth and slick. At that time, Zhu Rongji who was responsible for formulating the plan had to admit that that was the best they could do. The key to the reform of state-owned enterprises is the flow and reorganization of property rights, so that enterprises may genuinely operate on their own and assume sole responsibilities for their profits and losses, while the government retreats from enterprise involvement. It is very difficult to break the old framework of the existing structure to shape a new property ownership structure. It would take a long time to see the successes of 100 large and medium-sized enterprises selected as experimental units. Thus, Zhu Rongji decided to take a risk and boldly allow a number of state-owned enterprises to go bankrupt. Bankruptcy will shape into a terrorizing power and pressure enterprise circles, while promoting their renovation; on the other side of the coin, bankruptcy and reorganization will not involve the "deterioration" or "converting public into private ownership" of socialist enterprises, thus avoiding criticism from the orthodox school. Favorable external conditions in pushing enterprise bankruptcy lies in, first, the non-government and state-owned economies have already been separated, and risks to state-owned enterprises in boldly conducting reform have been greatly reduced; second, the concept of the market economy has taken root in people's minds, with changes in employment concepts and matured external conditions able to absorb and digest bankrupt enterprises; and third, there seems to be no obstacles to the implementation of the bankruptcy law today. The greatest risk of the bankruptcy of state-owned enterprises seems to be arrangements for workers. A complete and perfect social security system is absent in China mainland today. Should past government intervention be stopped in the absence of better ways, big problems would be ahead. That accounts for the principle of experimenting first before spreading the practice.
