Several supporters of the opposition St. Kitts-Nevis Labour Party demonstrated outside parliament as Governor General Sir Clement Arrindell read the traditional throne speech. The Labour Party is pressing for fresh general elections, saying the minority coalition People's Action Movement/Nevis Reformation Party government had no moral authority to run the twin-island state. The last general election here, in November 1993, produced no clear winner. PAM and the Labour Party each took four of the 11 seats at stake. The Nevis Reformation Party picked up just one seat and the Concerned Citizen's Movement two. The coalition controls just five of the 11 parliamentary seats. Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds this week appealed for the maintenance of law and order ahead of the demonstration. He said the police had given no permission for the demonstration and warned: "Those who break the law will be dealt with appropriately." On Wednesday, there was a strong police presence outside the parliament building.
