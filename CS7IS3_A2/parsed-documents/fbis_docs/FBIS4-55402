This fact has to be taken into consideration when the government is formed. From this point of view, the decisive factor is that the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is doomed to form a coalition, as is customary in all democracies, MSZP Deputy Chairman Gyorgy Janosi told NEPSZABADSAG. "It is thought-provoking that the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] is visibly expecting an expert prime minister and the name of the party chairman [party not defined] is not even raised as a possibility in governmental roles," Janosi said. Janosi said that now a democracy is needed that unites rather than divides the nation, and the political forces will also have to represent this. A government with the biggest possible social support will have to be formed because the example of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] showed the consequences of a rapid loss of support, Janosi pointed out. He emphasized that he would consider it improper for a single party of the three political poles to form the new cabinet. The MSZP must strive for a coalition even if it exceeds the 50-percent limit, he stated, adding that he sees a realistic 50-percent chance of this. In Janosi's view, the MDF implemented a one-party government together with two puppet partners, and proved that governing by one party revives the reflexes of the state party. All this can start a tragic erosion within the party within minutes. "We also have to consider the long-term interests of the left wing," he added. For this very reason, even if the Socialists gain an absolute majority, they will have to do all they can to establish a multiparty government. The greater the MSZP's advantage is, the greater its obligation will be to make gestures and compromise solutions. According to Janosi, the chances of an MSZP-SZDSZ coalition would be greatly increased if the two parties together exceeded the two-thirds limit in parliament. In connection with the MSZP's prime ministerial candidate, Janosi said that society expects the winning party to produce its own prime ministerial candidate. The name of the politician will have to be made public immediately after the second round, he confirmed, adding that the MSZP can only enter coalition talks if it has a candidate of its own. "We cannot enter into talks without a prime ministerial candidate, and we will have to produce the best possible candidate, although we do not yet know the result of the talks," he said. He believes that, if the candidate is a party politician, then the ministries can be given to experts, however, if the prime minister is a professional, then party politicians who also have professional expertise can be considered for the ministries. According to Janosi, everything possible has to be done in the interest of forming a coalition, up to the final, sensible limit of compromises. Naturally, this limit also depends on yet unknown factors like the proportion of mandates and the other side's openness. The bigger party has to make gestures and the smaller one must relinquish the use of blackmail. Only this can establish confidence as a basis for the next four years' governing, Janosi said, indicating that the MSZP is not yet familiar with the proposals of the other side. In reply to our question on [former Prime Minister] Miklos Nemeth, Janosi said that he can be excluded as a prime ministerial candidate for the MSZP, as this had been discussed before. However, it is possible, although the chance is small, that an outside third person's name will be raised as a compromise solution if the future coalition partners cannot agree. Janosi expounded that society wishes for a social-liberal coalition that has to be placed on an as broad as possible a basis. Janosi previously considered the participation of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] a key issue, but [Fidesz Chairman] Viktor Orban "spectacularly closed the door," therefore, there is no point in thinking about this anymore. In Janosi's view, the case of the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] is completely different: Coalition with them can be excluded because of the difference of the programs, and a possible change of people in the KDNP's leadership would not solve this problem, either. In replying to whether the MSZP wishes to create a deputy prime ministerial position, Janosi said that the MSZP had not raised this idea before because it is contrary to the program point advocating a cheaper state. However, the party is also open on this issue.
