The Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] which was in power in four of the six states, was able to form a ministry only in Rajasthan and that too, with the help of a few independents and faced defeat in the other three states. Delhi is the new one where BJP formed the ministry. The crushing defeat of the BJP in Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh will prove to be a good turning point in the future of Indian politics. In Uttar Pradesh Mulayam Singh Yadav-Kansi Ram coalition was successful. The voters did not care in casting their vote whether it was for a national party or a local party. All that they were concerned with was whetheror not the party could provide them with a better life. This has been amply demonstrated by the results. It is a wonder in the Indian political scene that the state that has been traditionally giving Prime Ministers to the nation elected regional parties. The results also indicate that the prefix, 'national' alone cannot bring about good results. P.V. Narasimha Rao is the first person from Southern India to hold the position of the Prime Minister and his position has now been well strengthened by these "mini-general elections." Now he can deal with his rivals in his party effectively and bring about control and discipline in the party. His stature now not only scares his own party men but also opposition parties. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalitha's recent visit to Delhi is an interesting example. During her last visit to the capital, she stayed with Advani and met with Rao's rivals--Arjun Singh and Sharat Pawar, much to the annoyance of Rao and came back without seeing the Prime Minister. This time, she sought time to see him in advance, met him, gave him a flower bouquet and a golden shawl, and also had pictures taken She forgot the 'generation gap', for publicity in the news media. She had to do this due to her fear. When fear creeps in, a person will do anything. Due to the breakdown of discipline, infighting and group politics, the Congress Party was pulled down to its present miserable plight. The Congress was taught a lesson for its dual stand in the case of Babri Mosque and Ram Janma Bhoomi issues. Neither Hindus nor Muslims accept the Congress Party's stand. The demolition of the mosque has brought down the prestige of India in the international arena. India's secularism and unity also suffered a severe blow. Though all this was due to the BJP, the Congress had to pay the price. In the future, the Congress Party has to be firm in protecting and enforcing secularism and also be very vigilant and nip in the bud any divisive movements and religious fanatics' activities with firmness and sincerity. This is the message that both Hindus and Muslims have jointly delivered to the Congress Party. This itself is a victory for secularism. The Janata Dal, which had grown to be a national alternative to the Congress in the northern states was rejected by the people. This is not a good sign for India's political health. Even for a lamp of gold to keep its flame steady and effective a device is necessary. Ruling parties should have effective opposition parties. The weakening of these parties is not a good sign. The people do not trust in the opportunistic alliance led by V.P. Singh Chandra Shekhar and Ajit Singh. It is better that those leaders who sincerely oppose the religious fanatics, should quit these groups and join the Congress. It will be good for them as well as the Congress Party. This may result in adding to the formation of another group within the Congress Party. Anybody could come into power and that too, with a big majority. During their regime, if the legitimate needs of the people are not provided for, the voters may throw out the rulers whom they installed in power. This has been proved just now. Attractive slogans may be sweet and pleasing to the ears of the people, but can not fill their stomachs. If there is a clash between ears and stomachs, undoubtedly the victory is always for the stomach. The many slogans and disguises of the BJP caused great disappointment to the people. Even the worst rulers, while in power, may appear to everybody that they are at the top of their popularity. But when the frustrated people wake up, they will give their rulers a crushing defeat, without any hope of their coming up again. This is the lesson from Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to the rulers, past and present. Our people are not fully literate, but they are endowed with a robust common sense. Attractive slogans, pomp and pageantry and agitations alone cannot deceive everybody all the time. This is the message, a lesson delivered by the voters of northern India to all the political parties. Greetings to the voters!
