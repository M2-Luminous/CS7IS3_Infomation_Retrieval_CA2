The committee of ministers of the organization, which comprises 32 states, will be chaired by Bulgaria, the first country of Central and East Europe to head the Council. Another important event was the signature by all of the organization's countries except Italy, because of the formation of its new government, of the protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights which set up a single court. Although the protocol has been signed by 31 states, the date when the court will be operational is not yet known. It is believed that it will not become operational until 1998 at the earliest, which is one year after all countries are expected to have ratified the protocol. At a news conference, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes recalled that Belgium had assumed the presidency of the Council of Europe and that of the European Union at the same time. He added: "There are still six weeks of troika ahead, and then we can have some rest." He said the 32 states had talked a lot about Russia's application for membership to the Council of Europe. Stressing that the presence of foreign troops on the territory of a sovereign state against the will of the latter is contrary to the principles of the Council of Europe, Mr. Claes stated that as far as he is concerned and as long as he is a member of the committee of ministers of the Council of Europe, he will say "no" to Russia's membership if its troops remain stationed in countries against their will. Questioned on the presence of neofascist ministers in the new Italian Government, Mr. Claes said he was convinced that "the emergence of individuals who have a nasty tendency to take away the freedom to think is a danger for the future of democracies." "I am not one of those who believe that electors cannot be wrong in a democratic state," he added. "All the European institutions will have to be very diligent in monitoring the application of democratic principles."
