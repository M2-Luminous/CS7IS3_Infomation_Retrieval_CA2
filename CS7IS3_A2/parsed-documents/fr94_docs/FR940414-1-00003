FR940414-1-00003 FR940414-1-00001 The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 1650 of the Act, a person subject to the Plan may file a petition with the Secretary stating that the Plan or any provision of the Plan, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Plan, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the Plan or an exemption from the Plan. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides that the district courts of the United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries on business are vested with jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that purpose is filed within 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. There are approximately 750 watermelon handlers and 5,000 watermelon producers in the contiguous 48 States of the United States who are subject to the Plan. There are approximately 140 importers of watermelons. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000 and small agricultural producers are defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of watermelon handlers, producers, and importers may be classified as small entities. The changes proposed to the Plan, rules and regulations, rules of practice for petitions, and procedures for conduct of referenda are as a result of amendments to the Act. The overall economic impact of these proposed changes is not expected to be significant. Including all 50 States and the District of Columbia under the Plan would have little impact. The producer exemption from assessments would be increased from 5 acres to 10 acres. This change would benefit small producers because it will increase the exemption level, and small producers would not have to pay the assessment. Neither the eligibility criteria for determining if a person is a handler or a producer nor the change to voting by mail ballot would have any economic impact. The elimination of refunds may have some impact on a small amount of producers and handlers who are currently entitled to refunds. There would also be a new burden on importers caused by the assessment of imports, but importers are currently benefiting from the activities which promote watermelons without paying assessments. The research and promotion program is expected to benefit producers, handlers, and importers subject to the plan by expanding and maintaining new and existing markets. Accordingly, the Administrator of AMS has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Paperwork Reduction In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 [40 U.S.C. chapter 35], the information collection requirements contained in the Plan have previously been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0093. There would be a new reporting burden on importers but the burden has been already approved by the OMB and assigned OMB control number 0581&hyph;0093. Therefore, this action adds no additional reporting burden. Under the Plan, the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board) administers a nationally coordinated program of research, development, advertising, and promotion designed to strengthen the watermelon's position in the market place and to establish, maintain, and expand markets for domestic watermelons. This program is financed by assessments on all producers, except those persons engaged in the growing of less than five acres of watermelons, and handlers of watermelons. The Plan specifies that handlers are responsible for collecting and submitting both the producer and handler assessments to the Board, reporting their handling of watermelons, and maintaining records necessary to verify their reporting.
