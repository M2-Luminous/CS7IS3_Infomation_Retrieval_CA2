These targets include completely restructuring and optimizing the overall layout of overseas investment by the end of this century to establish an initial network of overseas enterprises that cover the major markets of the six continents, are based on complementary economies, are of a fairly large scale, and have substantial strength and their own characteristics; to gradually transform the existing overseas enterprises into conglomerations or shareholding enterprises on the premise of voluntary participation and mutual benefits and turn them into modern enterprises developing diverse business while emphasizing a major trade; and to continuously expand the channels of foreign economic relations and trade, transmit, and exchange the information on the markets at home and abroad; and expand the economic strength and the scale to serve Heilongjiang's development of an open economy. Since 1984 when Heilongjiang established its first overseas enterprise in Hong Kong, the province had established 450 various types of enterprises overseas by the end of 1993, thus enabling its export commodities to enjoy a long and stable share in the world market and to promote the implementation of the strategy of diversifying the market. Due to a lack of understanding and overall guidance, however, the overseas enterprises have yet to fully develop their role. In view of this, Wang Zongzhang pointed out: To attain the medium- and long-term targets of overseas investment, the investment to be made overseas in the near future should be rearranged and distributed in a rational way and group companies or outlets with substantial strength should be established. In the next two to three years, about 10 large group companies should be established to develop transnational business and gradually achieve internationalization in business. The group companies established in developed countries should focus on imports of funds, technology, equipment, and modern managerial expertise and mastery of the trends in the international market and the world economy to provide favorable conditions for Heilongjiang to optimize the mix and the quality of its export commodities and achieve a larger share in the world market. The group companies established in developing countries should focus on the sectors that these countries and Heilongjiang can use to supplement and suit each other to expand the channels for the sales of Heilongjiang's export commodities. Enterprises established overseas should be integrated with the international practice and establish a managerial mechanism that meets the need of the modern market economy. Shareholding companies should be established on the basis of voluntary participation and mutual benefits. They should not only encourage the existing overseas enterprises to buy shares but also absorb the domestic and foreign funds, as well as the funds from in and outside the province. The enterprises established overseas should diversify their business while emphasizing a major trade. Guided by the demand of the international market and relying on Heilongjiang's advantages in resources, industries, and geographical position, they should develop production, trade, banking, technology, and service businesses to gradually become large multi-purpose industrial groups. Meanwhile, they should build bonded warehouses in the key areas of international transportation, as long as they are economical and convenient and help promote sales.
