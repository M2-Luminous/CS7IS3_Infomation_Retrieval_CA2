ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: With one exception, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a request from the U.S. Virgin Islands to revise its air pollution control plan prepared under the Clean Air Act to include a comprehensive revision to the Virgin Islands' air pollution control regulations. EPA is approving a special 1.5 percent sulfur content limit for residual fuel oil used by two specific sources, however, EPA is disapproving this special limit for Martin Marietta, St. Croix (now known as Virgin Islands Alumina Corporation). EPA is approving subsections 204&hyph;40(e) of ``Reports, Sampling and Analysis of Waste Fuels A and B,'' and 206&hyph;25(c) of ``Test Methods.'' However, these provisions permit the Commissioner to approve alternate requirements that are not incorporated in the Virgin Islands Implementation Plan. Any variances adopted pursuant to these subsections become applicable only if approved by EPA. EFFECTIVE DATE: This action will be effective May 18, 1994.
