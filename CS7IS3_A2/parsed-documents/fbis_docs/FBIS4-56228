FBIS4-56228 "drlat084_g_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-084 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 Guatemala Views Constitutionality Court Ruling Views Constitutionality Court Ruling PA3004235294 Guatemala City Teleonce Television in Spanish 0400 GMT 29 Apr 94 PA3004235294 Guatemala City Teleonce Television Spanish BFN [From the "Telepress" newscast] [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has commented on the ruling on the electoral process issued by the Constitutionality Court [CC] and on the implications of this ruling for the current political situation: [Begin De Leon recording] As for the resolution issued by the honorable CC, I said from the very beginning when the amparo was filed, that I would respect the independence of the state branches. The role of the Executive Branch is over. In a state of law in a legal regime, it is absolutely normal for a person, institution, or group to adopt the corresponding legal actions should he or it disagree with an action, resolution, or law. That is how any citizen, such as this deputy, files a recourse. At that time I said that I would respect the ruling issued by the CC, the top constitutional justice tribunal. That is just what I did. At that time I also said -- and this can be confirmed today -- that Guatemalans have great trust in one of the most credible institutions in Guatemala, the CC. They also trust the integrity, and above all, the juridical-political-electoral capabilities of the honorable magistrates who make up the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Given the experience and knowledge of this organization, the population was sure that the call for elections was based on legal grounds. [end recording]
