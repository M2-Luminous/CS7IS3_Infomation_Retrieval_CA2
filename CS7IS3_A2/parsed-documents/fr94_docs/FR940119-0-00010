FR940119-0-00010 FR940119-0-00002 The Department is primarily interested in the use of automated systems to provide more timely and accurate benefits to recipients as well as more program and system accountability and the APD process, the Department is emphasizing recipient protection when a system is under development as well as when the system is operational. Notices, expedited service and processing procedures are being emphasized. One commenter requested clarification regarding whether ``development'' of an automated system includes transfer and modification of an existing State system in an enhanced funding situation. The Department believes that current regulations at §§272.10(a)(3) and 277.18(d)(2)(ii) adequately address the requirement that a State, as part of the development of its automated system, assess whether the transfer or modification of an existing State system is cost effective. Transfer or modification may be reimbursed at either the regular or enhanced funding levels according to the criteria discussed above. Other Revisions An additional change is contained in these final provisions in order to correct language in 7 CFR 277.4 and 277.18 of current regulations. There is a typographical error in 7 CFR 277.4(b) (11) and (12), 277.18(b), under the definitions for enhanced funding or enhanced FFP and regular funding or regular FFP, and in 7 CFR 277.18(g)(1) and 277.18(g)(3). The word ``or'' appearing after the word ``development'' and before the word installation in these sections has been changed to ``and''.
