Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa, answering a question put by Former Foreign Minister Michio Feb. 18, said "in case economic sanctions are adopted by the UN Security Council with a final breakdown of agreement between North Korea and the IAEA, the Japanese Government would show a responsible response." This cannot be construed otherwise than a deliberate act to block a solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and bring the situation back to the extreme phase. Such act of the Japanese authorities blatantly getting on the nerve of the DPRK well shows that although they "appreciated" in word the result of the negotiation between the DPRK and the IAEA in Vienna Feb. 15, unable to ignore the unbiased public opinion, it was a reluctant talk and they still pursue, in actuality, the policy of isolating and stifling the DPRK through "economic sanctions." They have long since threatened "economic sanctions in the form of ban on imports and exports, ban on remittance, ban on the entry of ships into ports and freezing of North Korea's assets." This is a criminal act which may cause an unpredictable, dangerous result. Even at this time when the DPRK and the IAEA have reached an agreement on the inspection for the continuity of safeguards, the Japanese authorities are talking about "full-scale routine and ad hoc inspections" and "responsible response." It is not hard to guess that their ulterior intention is to frustrate the DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost, obstruct a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and step up in real earnest their ambitious plan to convert Japan into a nuclear power on the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. Their vicious scheme to put "economic sanctions" on the peaceloving DPRK by branding it as a "nuclear culprit" while keeping mum about their criminal attempt to build a nuclear power deserves criticism from unbiased public opinion. The Japanese reactionaries' outcry for "special inspection" and "economic sanctions" in duet with right-wing conservatives of the United States is as good as trying to push the DPRK out of the Nonproliferation Treaty. It is self-evident that such developments would bring irrevocable, grave consequences to Japan, too. The Japanese reactionaries must clearly see the staunch will of the Korean people who always maintain independence and are fully prepared for any contingency. They must look straight at the trend of the times, act with discretion and immediately stop the criminal campaign for "economic sanctions" against the DPRK.
