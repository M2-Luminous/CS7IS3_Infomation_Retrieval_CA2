Its aim is to obtain additional orders for the industrial research capacities that still exist in eastern Germany. To achieve this goal, the BDI wants to integrate industrial research in the "Shopping Offensive New Laender" launched with the Trust Agency. Within the framework of this action, 90 enterprises in the sphere of industry and trade agreed to clearly increase their purchases in eastern Germany. The BDI wants to present this initiative at the innovation forum of the Leipzig Fair on Wednesday [9 March]. The BDI is calling on industry in western Germany to spend a considerable portion of its funds on research in the new laender. It referred to the capacities of over 180 enterprises with 4,000 employees. Details have been listed in a catalogue by the Technology Transfer Agency in Berlin. The industrial association hopes to use this action to stop the further decline of capacities for industrial research in eastern Germany. Whereas a total of 86,000 persons were still employed in this sphere in 1989, the number has now fallen to 11,500. The BDI is aware that both private enterprises and numerous public institutions are competing for the annual research amount of just under 1 billion German marks. Yet it stressed that, as a result of public subsidies, east German enterprises are able to offer attractive services. The federal promotion scheme "Commissioned Research East-West," under which east German research institutes receive subsidies worth 35-40 percent of the overall research volume, has been prolonged until the end of 1994. The BDI hopes that existing research institutions will develop into fertile ground for new industrial structures in the new laender. It referred to numerous successful examples in western Germany of the transfer of technology from research institutions to regional enterprises. For cost reasons, numerous companies have reduced their research capacities. At the same time, however, they depend on new developments. Industrial research must make use of this opportunity, the BDI stressed.
