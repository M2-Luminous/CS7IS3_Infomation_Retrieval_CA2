The limits on coverage include severe restrictions on reporting by the broadcaster's Beijing correspondents and a ban on the entry of film crews and radio reporters. These moves have reduced the BBC's news gathering to public press functions around the capital. The restrictions, previously set to apply until mid- summer, have now been renewed for another six months, according to sources close to the BBC. The limits, never officially announced, were placed on the corporation after Beijing warned Britain about "serious consequences" if it allowed the BBC to screen a controversial documentary, Mao Zedong: The Last Emperor, a critical account of the late Communist Party chief's life. The hour-long film was never shown in China or on World Service Television, but drew heated protests from Beijing, infuriated by the broadcast on the BBC's United Kingdom domestic service. Quoting contacts in the Chinese capital, BBC sources last night said mainland authorities had "upgraded" the corporation to a list of "unfriendly" and possibly dangerous foreign media. The sources said both the foreign and broadcast ministries in Beijing had circulated documents ordering provincial and local authorities to "avoid relations" with the BBC, and to treat any requests by correspondents "coolly". "The other thing is a ban on all BBC reporters visiting China," one source said. "Usually, at any time, you're likely to have BBC teams in China, all up to various things: documentaries, World Service Television. "Since the Mao documentary, though, no one from the BBC had received official permission to go into China." Authorities refused to allow BBC coverage of the National People's Congress in March, despite the presence of American, Canadian, German, and Japanese crews. "When Xinhua (the New China News Agency) in Hong Kong made it clear that no one would get visas, London sent a letter to the government through the Beijing bureau and there was no response," a source said. The corporation's two Beijing correspondents, James Miles and Carrie Gracie, have had at least three applications for internal travel refused since December, while local authorities have maintained their longstanding refusal to accredit a camera crew to the service. "It's been almost a ban, except that the one application that was granted was for a time when they couldn't go," a source said. Another source said: "The indications we've had, as to when applications for travel or entry might be convenient, were originally that July would be the time. Now, though, the Chinese embassy in London has suggested that it would be a year (after the Mao documentary was shown)." Problems created by the documentary have been compounded by deteriorating Sino-British relations over Hong Kong and what one executive described as the increasing popularity of the BBC as it offers Mandarin-language TV broadcasts and wider penetration via transmission facilities in South Korea and Japan. The departure on Sunday of World Service Television from Star TV's north Asia broadcast service, which includes China and Hong Kong, has drawn no response from Beijing.
