Emphasizing that the development of the nation's foreign trade will be the first priority during his administration, he also emphasized the need to simplify the procedures in that sector and to intensify the processes of integration and establishment of bilateral commercial agreements. [EL UNIVERSO] What level of concern do foreign trade and the processes of integration merit? [Maldonado] During my administration, foreign trade will be the number one priority. It is essential that we speed up the processes of integration; strengthen the Andean Pact agreements and the relationships we must maintain with other countries as a community, as the Andean Pact; reinforce the bilateral relations our country has with other nations; strengthen the policy of fostering open trade with the world; and integrate our country in the world process and in technological and economic globalization. Blocs are being formed on every continent, and it is therefore necessary to strengthen our economic bloc in the Andean area, comprising Chile, Mexico, the MERCOSUR [Common Market of the South], and the rest of the Latin American countries. There is not the slightest doubt that, for Ecuador's nontraditional products in particular, the Latin American market is very important, very promising. [EL UNIVERSO] Is Ecuador experiencing difficulties with Colombia with regard to the sale of alcoholic beverages and iron to Venezuela? How will this situation be handled? [Maldonado] We must demand that all countries adhere to those mechanisms that the agreements in the Andean area already provide. This will perhaps be the focus of the first efforts made by the ministry. I will be meeting with representatives of the domestic liquor industry and the domestic iron and steel industry for the purpose of developing a strategy. This strategy must be one that is best suited to the standardization and regularization of the situation involving dumping and the marketing of liquors by the Accord Commission. All of the Andean countries must adhere to the mechanisms in effect. [EL UNIVERSO] What will the policy pursued with regard to medicines be? [Maldonado] Each industrial sector has its own special characteristics and its own production, market, sales, and price problems. I will have to meet with representatives of all the sectors, so that within the framework of an overall policy for the development of industry and trade, we can proceed to resolve each of the problems they encounter. [EL UNIVERSO] Do you advocate the liberalization of medicine prices? [Maldonado] That is a problem we will have to study at the ministry. I do not have a precise definition to give you on this matter. [EL UNIVERSO] Although the norms for holding back coffee are in effect, has it not been announced that Ecuador will not comply with these regulations? [Maldonado] I will be happy to respond to questions on these current issues after I have held meetings with the sectorial representatives and those who have studied this policy. What I should indeed mention is that the government will support all of the efforts made by the private sector to ensure growth and development, to create jobs, and to advance the social development of the country. [EL UNIVERSO] If you foresee an open door for the productive sectors, how will this be achieved? [Maldonado] It will be achieved based on mutual cooperation through permanent dialogue and the harmonizing of the policies pursued and the efforts made, and with a view to facing up successfully to the challenge of competition on our own market and foreign markets. We must modernize industry in terms of quality, obtain better yields and better prices, and provide the appropriate legal-reference framework that industry needs in order to develop. In the final analysis, the productive sector is demanding clear rules of the game and the simplification of the state. I have been in the forefront of the battle for modernization, and I am confident that I will be able to sign the draft decree that has been submitted to the president of the Republic before this week is over. This decree will abrogate a series of accords, regulations, and decrees that are definitely making the task of the state and the productive sector more difficult. We are going to put a very special effort into this process of simplifying the state, and to this end we will work together with the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and all of the sectors that deal with the nation's productive process on a daily basis. An effort is being made to simplify about 3,000 agreements, regulations, and normative Ecuadoran legislative texts that pertain not only to the norming of the productive sector, but to the state as a whole and to the procedures involved in importing raw materials and exporting. This means price setting and the elimination of a series of administrative hindrances. [EL UNIVERSO] Will the single form for exports be eliminated in this simplification process, as the business sector is demanding? [Maldonado] I cannot give you any details as yet, but as soon as I have the information, I will reveal everything involving this ministry. [EL UNIVERSO] It is said that with you in office, concrete agreements within the Andean Group are guaranteed. [Maldonado] I believe that considerable progress has been made. What we need to do is to speed up the process. A series of negotiations with other countries is being pursued by the Andean Pact, as a community, and very important bilateral agreements are also under way. The task of this ministry is not Andean integration alone, but foreign trade in general. It is obvious that we must therefore combine our efforts with those being made by the Ministries of Agriculture and Foreign Relations.
