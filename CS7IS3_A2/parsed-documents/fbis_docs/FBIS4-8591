At the moment the members of parliament are discussing the submitted draft resolution. Here is a report from Vladislav Stoychev in our studio at the National Assembly. [Stoychev] During the debate the parliamentary groups expressed the following basic views on the issue. The NSD [New Alliance for Democracy], Independence Parliamentary Group, and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms unconditionally supported the government's proposal. The SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] linked its support to criticism of the government for the manner in which it acted yesterday, circumventing parliament and becoming embroiled in a chaos of contradictions. The BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] motivated its negative stance with the following arguments. By citing the Constitution, the government acknowledged that the matter concerns foreign troops. According to the BSP, this runs counter to Bulgaria's decision of 19 April 1993 on nonintervention in conflicts in former Yugoslavia. The view of the BSP reminds parliament of Bulgaria's respect for the United Nations, the losses from the embargo, and the obligations of the United Nations and the UN Sanctions Committee toward Bulgaria. Incidentally, the issues of respect for the United Nations and the efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflicts figured prominently in the stated viewpoints of all the parliamentary groups. Gincho Pavlov of the Fatherland Party of Labor declared that the UN request has no other meaning in practice than a desire to create a precedent for the subsequent passage of Turkish blue helmets through Bulgarian territory. The BSP position was sharply criticized in the last statement that was made a short time ago, by SDS leader Filip Dimitrov. The debate continues.
