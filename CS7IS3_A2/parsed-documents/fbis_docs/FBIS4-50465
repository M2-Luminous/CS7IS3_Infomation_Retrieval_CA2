Each of them has a fixed account recording how much premium he or she hands in, and each will keep the account for good, no matter whether he or she switches jobs, loses a job or moves to another locality. The new system covers all staff in the city's administrations and enterprises, excluding foreign personnel in overseas-funded companies and some workers whose pensions are specially arranged by the government. Shanghai, China's biggest metropolis with a population of 13 million, has over two million people above the age of 60. Mayor Huang Ju said that Shanghai aims to set up a scientific and socialized retirement insurance system. In accordance with the new regulations, individuals should pay three per cent of their monthly salary as premium. The proportion will increase with the pace of growing incomes. And the amount of old-age pension will depend on the sum of premiums paid by individuals and will be adjusted in line with the cost of living index. People who work for private businesses can also benefit from the system.
