Eight thousand civilians and 7,500 Croat refugees are encircled in Busovaca. Our correspondent in Vitez reports that fears are increasing of a tragedy on the scale of Krizancevo Selo as the lives of 50-60 civilians from Buhine Kuce are in danger. We have just received a report from the Vitez operational zone command that troops of the British UN battalion are patrolling the Vitez-Busovaca road, extending their protection to civilians fleeing from Buhine Kuce and transporting them to Vitez. Six people have been taken care of so far, and a British liaison officer said that members of their tank units, located by the road, saw the bodies of two civilians. By 0800, three people were killed and 15 injured in the ongoing artillery attack on the center of Vitez. The HVO's [Croatian Defense Council] 111th Zepce Brigade reported that Muslims were also launching artillery attacks on Zepce and that many have been wounded there as well. According to the latest information, Muslims are attacking the Kuber area near Vitez from the direction of Zenica, while the HVO reports that the Muslim breakthrough in the Buhine Kuce area has been halted.
