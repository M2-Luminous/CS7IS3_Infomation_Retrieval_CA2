Today for the very first time a secretary general of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] arrived in South Africa on an official visit. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Linda van Tilburg] The OAU has been watching political developments in South Africa closely for decades. Now they're keeping an even closer watch on political developments here as observers during the country's first multiracial election. There are 15 here at present, but there will be more than 200 before the elections. On his arrival at Jan Smuts Airport, the OAU current secretary general, Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, underlined the continent's concern about the forthcoming election. [Salim] Africa is following these elections very closely, and there is going to be a very impressive, massive African presence during elections -- whether they come from the Organization of African Unity, whether they come from the Commonwealth, or whether they come from the United Nations. [Van Tilburg] During his four-day visit Dr. Salim will meet leaders of the government, the ANC [African National Congress], PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], Inkatha Freedom Party, and the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front]. Although he wouldn't elaborate, it is expected that he might try to convince General Constand Viljoen and Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi to participate in the election. [Salim] It is absolutely essential that all should be involved in the process of election. [Van Tilburg] Dr. Salim today said there would be massive support for South Africa's membership of the OAU. It's expected that South Africa will for the first time become part of the 33-year-old organization shortly after a government of national unity is formed. [end recording]
