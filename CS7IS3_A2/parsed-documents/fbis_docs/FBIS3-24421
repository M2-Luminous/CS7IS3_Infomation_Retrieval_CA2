"Working here is inconvenient, difficult, and dangerous," he explained his decision tersely, although he had been making great plans just two years ago and had even managed to act on some of them. His euphoria soon passed, however, after it had been throttled by Russian irresponsibility. Now he sees Moscow as only a transfer point--going from Sheremetyevo-2 to Sheremetyevo-1, and from there to Almaty, and then back home by the same route in reverse. In Kazakhstan he found what he could not find in Russia: a reliable and secure foundation for normal business activity. I would not exclude the possibility that he and his Western colleagues will now begin buying tickets to Tashkent as well. The harsh political climate in Uzbekistan unexpectedly turned out to be a favorable atmosphere for business. Unprecedented measures are being taken in Tashkent to carry out economic reforms, protect private property, develop business, and attract foreign investments on a broad scale. President I. Karimov did what Moscow had tried and failed to do in the reverse order: He began by strengthening his political base and then opened the door to the market economy while keeping his finger "on the pulse." When Yu. Abdullayev, Uzbekistan's ambassador in Moscow, was asked what had made this possible, his reply was brief and to the point: "The time was right." Judging by the edict the president of Uzbekistan issued on this matter, the mechanism of the process itself, which should be fine-tuned by various agencies in the next month (a special interdepartmental council was established to coordinate their work), should assign priority to the legal protection of non-governmental property, to administrative penalties and criminal liability for violations of the property rights of citizens, and to privileges, credits, and state guarantees for private owners within the limits specified by the Constitution of Uzbekistan. This means that the state will be responsible for securing a civilized business climate for those who are occasionally shot in Russia with the complete connivance or impotence of government officials (to which end the criminal and civil codes and other legal instruments in Uzbekistan will be supplemented and revised). Apparently, guarantees of this kind are essential before a person can start doing business within the territory of the former Union and even start taking an interest in economic conditions. Tashkent is letting the market faucet run at almost full blast. Joint-stock companies of the closed type, for example, are to be "opened up." Republic commercial exchanges will sell state property slated for privatization and sell stock in enterprises undergoing this process. Facilities in the trade and service sector and parcels of land may be acquired as private property in competitive bidding sessions. Furthermore, the bidder will not even be required to declare the source of the funds used for the acquisition of property. Existing bureaucratic obstacles in the licensing procedure will be eliminated to stimulate business activity. Permits for various types of business activity will be issued by seven different agencies, including the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Public Education. There will be no restrictions on the amount of foreign currency brought into the country or taken out of the country by citizens of Uzbekistan and by foreigners--unless, obviously, some aspect of the transfer is against republic law. The formation of joint ventures for the production of consumer goods will also be convenient in Uzbekistan. If the foreign share of the capital stock of these joint ventures exceeds 50 percent, they will be exempt from the payment of taxes on foreign currency receipts and from the obligatory sale of part of the foreign currency to the republic Central Bank for the first five years. Officials in Tashkent, in contrast to those in Moscow, felt it would be counterproductive to "shelter" local producers with high import duties and thereby strip the domestic consumer market bare. For this reason, customs duties on all but a few types of goods will not be charged until 1 July 1995. In addition, there are some export quotas, especially on foodstuffs. Customs duties on exports will range from 5 percent of the contract cost (for cotton fiber or raw silk, for example) to 50 percent (mixed feeds, table salt, and matches) and 100 percent (antiques of cultural value). These rates are temporary, of course, and are certain to be reviewed after the improvement of conditions in the food supply and several other spheres. One more item on the list of measures connected with economic reform is extremely important in the establishment of a free market. It concerns the host of bureaucrats who are smothering the businessmen in Russia. This is why the edict specifically stipulates (and we can only hope that this is not a mere declaration) that any kind of interference in the finances and management of enterprises, establishments, and organizations, irrespective of their property status, by the heads of administrations and superior administrative bodies will not be tolerated, and neither will the creation of various types of extra-budgetary funds in rayons and cities with deductions from the income of enterprises, establishments, and so forth. The innovations in Tashkent did not escape the notice of the West or the East. They are certain to influence economic processes in other Central Asian republics, where Tashkent would like to consolidate its influence, with the energetic encouragement of some rich Muslim countries, primarily Saudi Arabia. Karimov's recent trip to Turkey was no coincidence. We can assume that the first investments will begin flowing into Uzbekistan from Turkey. Karimov got his start in politics, but now he wants to win economic victories as well.
