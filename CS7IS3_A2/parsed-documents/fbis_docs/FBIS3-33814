Apparently, the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has set new conditions. The doubts exist because differences between the two parties to the political crisis have persisted. Reports from Aden said several Yemeni politicians fear that the situation might explode in light of the military deployments by the rival parties. A member of the committee that is tasked with setting a time and venue for a ceremony to sign the accord document, who demanded anonymity, has said that YSP Secretary General 'Ali Salim al-Bid has set new conditions for the signing. The committee member said the YSP wants to see, once the agreement is initialed, the implementation of its major clauses before a final settlement to the Yemeni crisis is reached. Al-Bid and other YSP officials, most of whom are in Aden, do not think it is necessary for them to go back to Sanaa after signing the agreement, even though the agreement stipulates their return. The committee member said Culture Minister Jarallah 'Umar, the YSP representative, told the committee al-Bid will not go back to Sanaa before these clauses are implemented. Al-Bid, who has been staying in Aden since 19 August 1993, wants security guarantees before he declares his readiness to sign the agreement, which was reached after extensive discussions that lasted two months. The agreement meets most of the YSP demands, especially with regard to a broad administrative decentralization and security arrangements. The member asserted that representatives of the General People's Congress, led by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping, under 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, have rejected this demand. They argue that the agreement is binding and that its implementation requires the contribution of all the leaders of the government coalition. The member added that the YSP wants the signing ceremony to be attended by representatives from the United States, the European Union, Russia, the PRC, Canada, Syria, Saudi Arabia, in addition to Fahim al-Qasimi, the secretary general of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The purpose of this is to have more guarantees. A source close to the president's party said this demand is part of political one-upmanship and efforts to internationalize the Yemeni crisis.
