And all that comes to be forgotten... In any human activity, as soon as some unseen threshold is crossed, there is a need for a historical study of what has occurred as a result of one's own work. This is probably the threshold separating childhood from adulthood, when things have already accumulated in the past about which there is a need to ponder deeply. If this version is correct, the space field became an adult in the 1980's. For twenty years before this everyone launched all kinds of objects. These launches were concealed from other parties. Some satellites exploded. Others were lost. And now all kinds of unknown objects are flying there above us... As a result a new science has been born and it can be called space archeology. Unfortunately, it is not concerned with traces of mysterious arrivals from the outside, but with our own objects. When the first artificial earth satellite was launched it was known only approximately how it would fly. Right up to the end they were not sure that it would fly at all. The accuracy of observation of the satellite, to be sure, was still low. But then telescopes appeared which were capable of tracking objects moving rapidly through the sky. It was far more difficult to determine exactly what was flying there. Any satellite in the strongest telescope is visible as a point -- more or less bright. And from the changes in this brightness an effort is made to determine what it looks like. Up to the middle of the 1970's it was possible only to distinguish a sphere from a cylinder and a cylinder from a plane. An entire institute in Great Britain, breaking its head over this problem, deemed a more detailed solution to be unattainable. But in 1981 the young Russian scientists A. Bagrov and M. Smirnov, working in the geodynamics section, Astronomical Council, USSR Academy of Sciences (now the INASAN), appeared on the scene. They were able to cut the Gordian knot: they began... to detect the sun's flashes. The fact of the matter is that the parts of the satellite send quite conspicuous blinks earthward. And by observing them it is possible to visualize from what parts this satellite consists. When observing one ordinary satellite a very strange leaping blink was discovered. As if someone sent a flash from a hand mirror and it oscillated slightly. An ordinary satellite cannot produce such a picture. But it was announced as being specifically an ordinary communication satellite. But the blinks betrayed its secret: it was a scanning television system which shifted its "eye" to the right and left and accordingly the satellite oscillated and the sun flash jumped. The enemy was thereby exposed. Another problem. A satellite is launched. We attempt to communicate with it, but no luck. There it is -- it can be seen clearly, even with the naked eye. But it is silent. It is very possible that it is talking, but not to us. That is, its antenna is not turned in the right direction. Or the solar cells remained undeployed, for some reason or another could not be opened. And again the detection of the flashes makes it possible to ascertain the truth. Then it is possible to send a correcting signal from the Flight Control Center and the satellite will do that which it is told to do and everything will be in order. What good are the blinks from a satellite? They can be seen clearly. When the light spot shines in the eye, the brightness of the object may increase a thousandfold. You can't hide that. Incidentally, if you saw in the sky that a moving star suddenly appeared, and then disappeared, you know: this is not a flying saucer, this is a simple sun flash. From a satellite. In the late 1980's we learned to identify satellites even without the blinks. Using a computer. The author of these lines also was engaged in this work. No method is a panacea. A satellite can be camouflaged. The very same M. Smirnov mentioned a combination of celestial bodies which it is difficult to identify. Visualize a small satellite to which a large, several times larger satellite, an inflated balloon, is coupled by a short tether. As much as you look at such a formation, as many calculations are made on computers, only the balloon can be distinguished. But let's return to space archeology. It is necessary to determine the configuration not only of working satellites, but also the remnants of old ones. Some are continuing their orbital flight in the form of a grouping of individual parts. Others have exploded. And still others, crippled with time, fly on intact. And there are so many of them that sometimes it is difficult to observe the stars. The blinking of the fragments interferes. A new term has appeared: space trash. We already have succeeded there, in space, in cluttering the place up. Some regions of near space are becoming dangerous for a large object, such as an orbital station. The velocity of a station is 7 km/s, but toward them move tiny fragments, sharp as nails, also moving at 7 km/s, a total of 14 km/s (for a bullet -- 800 m/s). No skin will hold up under that. And how many different flying objects of all types are there in space? About 5 thousand intact vehicles alone. There are 15 thousand large pieces measuring more than 10 cm. There are more than 100 thousand pieces of an intermediate size (1-10 cm). And there are about a million small ones (1-10 mm). Intact vehicles are listed in catalogues and they are observed. It would be good to observe both the large and the intermediate fragments, but for the time being neither we nor the Americans have money for that. Now these fragments are flying in small groups. There are, for example, even permanent groups over India and Ecuador. And if we know the shapes of these fragments we can determine how the pressure of sunlight acts on them and where the pieces will move in the future. M. Smirnov and his colleague A. Mikshin have encouraging words with respect to this problem: with time all these groups will break up, being uniformly distributed in all of near space, and then will fall to the surface. So that we can boldly clutter up the heavens in the future as well. It is true that with time it will be necessary for there to be a break in flights for some 30 thousand years, but on the other hand then everything will be cleaned up. And over the course of these 30 thousand years space archeology will flourish.
