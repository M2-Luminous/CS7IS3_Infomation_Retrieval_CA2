FR941110-0-00299 FR941110-0-00018 Goats ( Capra hircus ), native to the Middle East and India, were first successfully introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in 1792. Feral goats now occupy a wide variety of habitats from lowland dry forests to montane grasslands on Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii, where they consume native vegetation, trample roots and seedlings, accelerate erosion, and promote the invasion of alien plants (Stone 1985, van Riper and van Riper 1982). Goats are significantly degrading the habitat of at least five species in this rule. On Kauai, goats contribute to the substantial decline of one population of Bonamia menziesii, four populations of Flueggea neowawraea, and one population of Plantago princeps var. anomala (HHP 1992d18, 1992d30, 1992d31, 1992i2; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On Oahu, encroaching urbanization and hunting pressure tend to concentrate the goat population in the dry upper slopes of the Waianae Mountains, where one population of Bonamia menziesii and two populations of Flueggea neowawraea exist (HHP 1992d15; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). The goat population in the Waianae area is apparently increasing, becoming an even greater threat to the rare plants that grow there. On Molokai, two populations of Diellia erecta in Halawa Valley and Puu Kolekole and one population of Neraudia sericea at Makolelau are presently threatened by goats (HHP 1992c12, 1992c13; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Until a few years ago, feral goats were a major threat to rare plants in Haleakala National Park on East Maui, but because of an active ungulate control program, the goat population was reduced to 100 by 1988. While they are no longer a significant threat, the future ingress and reestablishment of goats are still a possibility (Lloyd Loope, National Park Service (NPS), pers. comm., 1992) and could potentially affect the three populations of Plantago princeps var. laxiflora found in the park (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Eight individuals of axis deer ( Axis axis ), introduced to the island of Molokai in 1868, increased to thousands of animals within about 30 years (Tomich 1986). By the turn of the century, the herds so damaged the vegetation of Molokai that professional hunters were hired to control their numbers (Tomich 1986). By then, the native vegetation had suffered irreparable damage from overgrazing by axis deer. They degrade the habitat by trampling and overgrazing vegetation, which removes ground cover and exposes the soil to erosion (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Activity of deer on Molokai has resulted in loss of habitat and/or individuals of at least six of the species. In the absence of a protective fence, axis deer continue to invade the unfenced areas and threaten to trample the plants. On both Molokai and Lanai, the axis deer populations are presently actively managed for recreational hunting by the Hawaii State Department of Land and Natural Resources. Extensive red erosional scars caused by decades of deer activity are evident on Lanai. The habitat of three Lanai populations of Bonamia menziesii and one population of Hibiscus brackenridgei ssp. brackenridgei on that island is negatively affected by axis deer (HHP 1992e1; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Two populations of Sesbania tomentosa at Paomai and Mahana on Lanai were last seen in the mid-1950s (HHP 1992j17, 1992j38). Those areas have long supported axis deer, which probably pose the primary threat to those two Sesbania populations. Elsewhere on Lanai, one population of Vigna o-wahuensis above Lapaiki and one population of Spermolepis hawaiiensis at Kapoho are threatened by axis deer (HHP 1992L7, 1992m23). To control deer in what remains of Lanai's dry forests, The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii (TNCH) is presently erecting fenced exclosures to protect populations of rare taxa (including two populations of Bonamia menziesii ) that occur within Kanepuu Preserve (Heidi Bornhorst, TNCH, and J. Lau, pers. comms., 1992). Although the fence is high enough to normally inhibit entry by deer, human pressure can force the deer to jump over the fence. On Maui, deer damaged plants of two populations of Hibiscus brackenridgei ssp. brackenridgei at Puu O Kali by stripping the bark and breaking limbs (HHP 1992e1, 1992e8).
