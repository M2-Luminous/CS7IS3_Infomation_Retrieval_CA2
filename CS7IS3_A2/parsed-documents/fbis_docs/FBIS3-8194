Its members discussed preparations for early parliamentary and local elections and elected new officials of the Movement's council. The final briefing was attended by newly elected Chairman Arpad Matejka and HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar. Peter Toman, representing our Radiozurnal, interviewed them. [Begin recording] [Toman] Mr. Chairman, what in your view are the most important conclusions reached at today's session of the Council? [Meciar] In substance, a decision was made to form working groups to work on the final draft of the Movement's program--that is, our election program--which we expect to turn subsequently into our government program. The other important thing was the election of the bodies of the Council: new Chairman Arpad Matejka and new Deputy Chairman Zlocha. Mr. Mihalik continues to be the secretary. They were elected by secret ballot in several rounds. The third thing I consider important is that the strategy of two options has been more or less drafted: either to go three times to election ballot boxes--i.e., a referendum and major elections and small elections [not further explained]--or just to have the two elections. These issues were drafted and agreed upon, and I think that everybody is [word indistinct] going to work on them. [Toman] Did you discuss preparations for local elections, too? [Meciar] Yes, the selection of candidates and coalition strategy is a matter for local bodies. [passage omitted] [end recording]
