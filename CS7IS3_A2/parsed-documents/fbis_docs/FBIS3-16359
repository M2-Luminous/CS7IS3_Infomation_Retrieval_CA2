He also reported that since the beginning of this year analogical problems appeared among telecommunications employees who only now received payment for last year's debts for broadcasting of state TV and radio programs. In addition, agreements with TV and radio companies have not been concluded yet because the quantity of broadcasting to be done is as yet unknown. Nazeikin underlined that the issues concerning mutual payments between collectives of broadcasting centers and TV and radio companies were to be solved in the course of the meeting between representatives of telecommunications workers and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin scheduled "for the near term." However, this meeting has not taken place. If this continues till the end of March, Nazeikin continued, we shall be forced to cut back TV and radio broadcasting time for the majority of Russia's regions. (On February 10 broadcasting was limited in 61 regions -- INTERFAX).
