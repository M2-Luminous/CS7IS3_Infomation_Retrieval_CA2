He was reacting to charges by the ANC leader at a Natal election rally that the ISD should disband, following the massacre of 11 people on Saturday night in Bhambayi, north of Durban. The call showed how blind the ANC was to the real causes of violence, Mr Kriel said. "This attitude can only inflict more death and misery on the people because while Mr Ramaphosa and the ANC waste time and energy falsely blaming the SA Police, the true causes of violence go unaddressed." Mr Ramaphosa should address the real causes of violence -- political intolerance and control of supporters, instead of throwing away the opportunity to work for peace at grassroots level, Mr Kriel added.
