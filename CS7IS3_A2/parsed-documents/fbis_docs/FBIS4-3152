Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, was presiding over the two-day meeting together with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown. At the concluding ceremony, both Wu and Brown spoke highly of the results of the meeting, which concentrated on a review of the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries over the past few years and an exchange of views on broadening this cooperation. Wu said, "China and the United States have much in common in their economic interests and can count on a bright prospect in bilateral economic and trade cooperation." "We have every reason to get rid of the negative effect brought by the most favored nation status issue." This afternoon Wu and Brown signed a joint statement indicating that the two sides had agreed to set up working groups, on trade and investment, trade promotion, and law of commerce respectively. During the meeting, Wu Yi met with U.S. Vice President Albert Gore and Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen.
