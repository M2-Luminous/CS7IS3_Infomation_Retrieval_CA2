Kuts: "From Mutual Rights to Mutual Obligations"] [Text] A draft agreement on border issues, which was discussed by the heads of Russian and Belarusian border departments [as published] in Minsk in mid-February, can become a basic document for further regulations of relations between both countries, including the issues concerning the external CIS borders. If the internal CIS borders are to block a free transfer of goods and services, then the economic union proclaimed by CIS state heads will be devoid of all sense. With regard to this, the need for safe protection of the CIS external borders emerges, thus providing relations between both countries with a greater mutual responsibility. Now, while protecting the borders with the non-CIS countries, Belarus will protect not only its national interests, but also Russian ones. The Russian Federation will commit itself to analogous obligations. The question regards a quite different type of relations between the two states. These relations, as is assumed, will evolve from a system of mutual rights to a system of mutual obligations, which will help to save significant material means.
