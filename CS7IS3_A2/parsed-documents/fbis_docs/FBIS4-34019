He made this request at a news conference held after delivering his closing speech at the 24th OAS General Assembly in this, the capital city of Para State. Amorim noted that because funding for drug enforcement operations is very limited in Brazil, it is very important for our country to receive financial cooperation from countries where drugs are consumed. Amorim said: Drug-producing countries are receiving resources to implement alternative crops. Yet countries that are being used as drug routes have not received the same kind of support. [passage omitted] Amorim also emphasized the significance of the Ibero-American summit scheduled to open next week in Colombia, and especially the presence there of the heads of government of Spain and Portugal, which are member countries of the European Union and leading counterparts in our trade talks with Europe. Amorim said: The path to follow appears to be one marked by greater trade liberalization between the European Union and Latin American subregional groups, the Common Market of the South included.
