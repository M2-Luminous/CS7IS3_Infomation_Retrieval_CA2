He highly assessed an agreement on the removal of nuclear weapons from the Ukrainian territory, signed by the three presidents. Maslin reminded of the fact that talks on this problem had been going on since 1992 and it was only now that the talks came to a logical end. Maslin informed journalists that currently, there are 176 launching installations of intercontinental ballistic missiles (IBM) in Ukraine, including 130 installations of SS-19 type and 46 of SS-24 type. There are also around 40 heavy bombers Tu-160 and Tu-95 capable of launching air-based long-range cruise missiles. The overall number of warheads stationed in Ukraine includes 1,300 warheads for IBM and over 600 warheads for air-based cruise missiles. In the opinion of the military expert, nuclear safety in Ukraine causes permanent concern of experts. According to Maslin, ammunition depots are overloaded with warheads and nuclear ammunition removed from combat alert, which resulted in a considerable increase of the radiation level. This was confirmed by experts of the Russian nuclear centre "Arzamas-15" who visited Ukraine in September, 1993. The designed life of the majority of warheads has expired, while maintenance preventive checks had not been carried out and some missiles are currently in a critical condition. As an example, Maslin mentioned three nuclear warheads which had to be hastily removed from the Ukrainian territory as they were in a critical condition. It is difficult to say how many hazardous warheads are in Ukraine yet because there is a lack of experts exercising control over the safety of nuclear weapons, Maslin said. The expert pointed out that any delay in removing and dismantling nuclear weapons is inadmissible since it is fraught with unpredictable consequences. However, there are still people in the republic who either do not realise this or are deliberately playing out "the nuclear card," he said. Maslin pointed out that Russian experts can give Ukraine guarantees of safety of all operations in the process of removal and utilization of strategic weapons.
