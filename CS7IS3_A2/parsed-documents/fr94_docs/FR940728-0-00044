FR940728-0-00044 FR940728-0-00016 40 CFR Part 52 [MA&hyph;12&hyph;01&hyph;6162; A&hyph;1&hyph;FRL&hyph;5003&hyph;6] Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Massachusetts; RACT for S. Bent and Brothers AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This revision establishes and requires reasonably available control technology (RACT) for S. Bent and Brothers in Gardner, Massachusetts. The intended effect of this action is to approve a source-specific RACT determination made by Massachusetts in accordance with commitments specified in its Ozone Attainment Plan approved by EPA on November 9, 1983. This action is being taken in accordance with section 110 of the Clean Air Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule will become effective on August 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours, by appointment at the Air, Pesticides and Toxics Management Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region I, One Congress Street, 10th floor, Boston, MA; and Division of Air Quality Control, Department of Environmental Protection, One Winter Street, 8th floor, Boston, MA 02108. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jeanne Cosgrove, (617) 565&hyph;3246. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 31, 1991 (56 FR 24765), EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The NPR proposed approval of a plan approval submitted by Massachusetts on November 2, 1990 which defined and imposed reasonably available control technology (RACT) for S. Bent and Brothers in Gardner, Massachusetts. The NPR indicated that final approval would be contingent upon the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) providing additional technical support documenting that the limits established for S. Bent represent RACT. A revised Plan approval was submitted as a SIP revision by Massachusetts on August 26, 1992. This SIP revision provides the additional technical support requested by EPA in its NPR. The DEP issued this plan approval pursuant to the requirements found in 310 CMR 7.18(17), which was approved by EPA on November 9, 1983 (48 FR 51480) as part of Massachusetts' Ozone Attainment Plan. Massachusetts Regulation 310 CMR 7.18(17), ``Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT),'' requires the DEP to determine and impose RACT on otherwise unregulated stationary sources of VOC with the potential to emit greater than or equal to 100 tons per year. Massachusett's revised final approval lowers the VOC content in the sealer coating category to 5.43 pounds of VOC per gallon of coating (minus water). Reporting requirements were also amended to track long term VOC emissions in tons on a 12 consecutive month rolling VOC limit instead of a 12 month calendar limit. For the reasons outlined in the Technical Support Document prepared for this revision, EPA believes that the limits the DEP has established represent RACT for S. Bent and Brothers. Other specific requirements of the plan approval and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. No public comments were received on the NPR. Final Action EPA is approving this plan approval for S. Bent and Brothers as a revision to the Massachusetts SIP. The plan approval defines and imposes RACT on S. Bent, a manufacturer and coater of wood furniture in Gardner, Massachusetts. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225).
