The implementation of the programme will make it possible to lower the emission of nitric oxides 2-2.5-fold, sulphur dioxide 1.5-2-fold, oil products jointly with service water 8-10-fold, sulphates 5-6-fold, while virtually, eliminating suspended particles emissions, all by 2010. However, it is still unclear whether it will be at all possible to implement this scheme. The point is that nature-conserving undertakings are relatively capital intensive in the power industry. The cost of purifying installations in the West alone comes to 40 percent of the cost of the basic plant. The programme makes provision for the creation of a special-purpose section at the Moscow City Ecological Fund which will be busy accumulating funds to modernize the power industry. Energy producers insist on introducing increments on electricity and heating tariffs by approximately 1-3 percent. From the standpoint of consumers it would be fairer if producers were to deduct a certain sum for ecological measures from their payments for environmental pollution. This year power industry workers have been able to collect 1.5 billion roubles from different sources. On the other hand, four billion roubles will be required annually for the installation of catalytic nitrogen purification equipment for Moscow's thermoelectric plants alone. Unless serious investments in the programme have been found, Muscovites will have to continue to inhale polluted air even in the 21st century.
