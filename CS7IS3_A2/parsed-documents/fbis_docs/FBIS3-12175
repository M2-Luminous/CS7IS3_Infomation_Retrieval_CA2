In the course of his interview, Minister Sarid expresses his belief that an inquiry commission should be set up, as proposed in the cabinet meeting, stressing though that "there is no doubt that today's murder was carried out by a single individual who acted alone. He was the only shooter." As for how he managed to carry out his act in the Cave of the Patriarchs unhindered by the Army, Sarid says: "An explanation was given by the Army. I believe it should be given by the Army. There was a door there which should have been locked, and the officer who was in charge of the scene at the time tried to enter the prayer hall but was pushed back by the crowd of worshipers who fled outside." Minister Sarid also emphasizes the decision by the commander of the Central Command, as reported to the cabinet today, on the curfew imposed on Jews in Hebron "who are allowed to move freely only in their area of residence, but, for the first time, are not allowed to enter the town of Hebron. As for Qiryat Arba', the closure means it is possible to enter and exit Qiryat Arba' only at a special request for permission from the IDF." During his interview, Police Minister Shahal is asked whether today's incident is not the result of police's helplessness in enforcing the law on the settlers, specifically Kakh members. He responded that the police are not responsible for public order in the territories at all. Still, in its capacity of opening files against criminals, the police does so when evidence is collected, but "there was no concrete material" against this morning's murderer, except for talk which took place a few months ago [reference is to the radio interview cited in second referent item]. Israel is a country of law, and "in this and other cases, when the material was brought up by the Shin Bet and other elements, the conclusion was that there were not sufficient evidence to put the persons involved on trial." If material and evidence warrant, then per the attorney general and as proposed in the cabinet meeting today, individuals can also be removed or exiled.
