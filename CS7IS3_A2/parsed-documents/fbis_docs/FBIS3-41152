This is precisely how it should be. Heroin consumption, for example, is on the increase in the United States. This in turn triggers the spread of poppy fields in Peru--in Cajamarca, Amazonas, part of San Martin, and Madre de Dios--thus creating problems that our country did not have before. Despite this, rules should be set on how and where this joint collaboration is to be undertaken. With regard to coca, two special reports published by EXPRESO this week clearly state that the interdiction policy furthered by the Peruvian Armed Forces in the Huallaga region has been quite successful, so much so that it has caused the price of a kilogram of cocaine paste to plummet from $1,500 in 1993 to its current value of $200. The cultivation of traditional crops like rice, corn, and cotton has been partially resumed thanks to the reopening of highways. This has nonetheless been a very difficult decision, as it entailed the impoverishment of farmers. It goes without saying that the decline in the coca business in the Huallaga region does not necessarily mean that it has been reduced in the whole of Peru. It has shifted toward other areas, with resulting effects in terms of environmental devastation and corruption. The government has, however, already launched a thrust against drug kingpins. The capture of "El Vaticano" has been a great step forward. What merits highlighting for the purpose of our discussion is that both the mass exodus of drug traffickers from the Huallaga region--the leading coca production center in Peru--and the arrest of "El Vaticano" took place precisely during the year in which the United States withdrew nearly all its aid for the fight against drug trafficking. The effort has, therefore, been made by Peru--only by Peru. This all goes to prove that, at least on a short term basis, one obtains better results without U.S. aid than with it. Does this mean that all joint endeavors should be left aside? Not necessarily. It means that this concerted effort ought to revolve around crop substitution rather than interdiction or police-related considerations. Peru has managed, of late, to develop a relatively advanced, shrewd, and intelligent technology that is also respectful of human rights. In this area, we would rather work on our own. We do, however, need financial resources for crop substitution programs, especially as we are channeling all our resources into drug enforcement operations. These kinds of subjects are, incidentally, what the two partners should today be discussing.
