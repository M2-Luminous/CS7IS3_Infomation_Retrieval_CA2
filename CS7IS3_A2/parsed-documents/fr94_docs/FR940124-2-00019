SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Eureka County Board of Commissioners has applied to lease an existing airstrip which serves the unincorporated Town of Crescent Valley, Nevada, and surrounding vicinity. The lands were previously leased for airport purposes by a succession of private individuals; however, the lease was allowed to expire the Eureka County has now applied to lease the airstrip. The land is not required for any Federal purpose. Issuance of the lease would be consistent with the Bureau's planning for the area. The described lands were previously segregated from mineral entry by virtue of the previous lease, but were never opened to entry upon expiration of the lease. Accordingly, this notice continues to segregate the lands from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining laws. Upon termination of the lease, the segregative effect would terminate as specified in an opening order published in the Federal Register. The lease when issued, will be subject to the provisions of the Act of May 24, 1928, and applicable regulations (43 CFR 2911) of the Secretary of the Interior. On or before March 10, 1994 interested parties may submit comments to the District Manager, Elko District Office, P.O. Box 831, Elko, NV 89803. Any objections will be evaluated by the State Director, who may sustain, vacate or modify this realty action.
