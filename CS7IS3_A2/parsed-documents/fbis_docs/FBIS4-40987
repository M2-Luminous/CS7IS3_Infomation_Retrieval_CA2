He stressed that these sanctions could not last forever and would have to be dropped sooner or later best of all by civilized means. In his words, "even now there is an explicit erosion of the sanctions." "For instance, there is evidence of the Turks siphoning oil from the oil pipe-line, going from Iraq. In other words, an appropriate process is underway, and the world community should take it under control," he said. He argues that the UN Security Council should set a six-month term for monitoring Iraq's compliance with the Security Council's resolution. "Even now one can say that Baghdad has fulfilled the UN Security Council's resolution 687 on disarmament in full. After this term, the UN Security Council could discuss the possibility of lifting or softening the sanctions. The Security Council imposed them, and it was for it to abolish them," the diplomat stressed.
