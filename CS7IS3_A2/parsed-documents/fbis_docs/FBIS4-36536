What is your general assessment of this situation in light of these changes? [Fadlallah] When we discuss the negotiations that seek to end this conflict, we note a prominent, vital point in these negotiations. This point is that there is an Israeli decision in line with a U.S. decision, and which is encouraged by the United States, to turn the Arab world into one bloc that does not react to any Zionist action or any Western interests, especially those of the United States. The aim is to change the term "Arab moderation" into "Arab capitulation." They are trying to minimize its effect and express it in terms in line with the new world order because the Arabs want to incorporate themselves into this order. Thus, we have noticed that Zionism, in coordination with the United States, worked to humiliate the Palestinian negotiator and exhaust the Palestinian people during the negotiations phase. This caused political confusion to the negotiators, who accepted the negotiations as a transitional measure that will eventually lead to an Arab regime lacking the structure of a state. This regime, which does not enjoy the people's support, will join all other Arab regimes that suffer separation between their officials and peoples. This will create complexities for the self-rule officials as soon as the rule begins touching off political and security disorder in which they will be unable to adjust to the experiment that Israel said it will monitor prior to deciding its stance on subsequent self-rule negotiations. Israel will work to benefit from all contradictions in the arena and will use them to cause political and security chaos in the Palestinian situation. Israel will tell the world that the Palestinian people are not qualified to govern themselves. Therefore, we must know that there is a plan to cause confusion for the Palestinians through the negotiations and that there is a plan to humiliate the Palestinian man who will move to strike out and kill. In such a situation, massacres will be committed in the Palestinian arena and daily killings will occur without any U.S. response except general talk about mutual violence. On the other hand, we notice that the jihad operations carried out by Islamist Palestinians have attracted much attention from U.S. officials to the extent that they deal with 'Arafat based on his rejection of these operations. They want 'Arafat's rejection to be expressed in harsh words and strong denunciation, not just regret, when the United States is satisfied with just expressing regret for all massacres of Muslims committed by the Jews. We notice that the Israelis--with encouragement from the United States--are working to demoralize the Palestinians so that they will not contemplate any rejectionist stance as a prelude to demoralizing the Arab and Islamic spirit. It is in this context that we view Zionism's handling of the question of ties with Syria which still stands with considerable steadfastness through its demands countering the Israeli demands. We notice that Israel sought to empty the Geneva summit of every substantial point that would give Syria moral strength in the view of the U.S. public and administration and we notice that Israel is seeking through its statements to humiliate the Syrian position. From this quick review, we can deduce a political fact in the political reality and the negotiations, namely that the negotiations must result in the submission of the Arab spirit to the Israeli character by imposing all sorts of political and security pressures on the Arab arena so that the Arab will have no choice but to say no to war and yes to all the morale-sapping stands required of him. In view of this, we believe that the Islamists -- who are aware of their nation's issues of freedom through their belief in one God and in freedom for all forces in the universe -- are the ones confirming the movement of freedom through their jihad activities, their political belief, and all their actions that aim to restore vigor to the nation in one way or another. [Ahmad] Moving on to the Lebanese file, I have noticed several internal political developments in Lebanese life since my arrival in Beirut, including the opening of the old Christian files. In light of your experience and your role in Beirut, do you believe that what is happening now is a sign that Lebanon's health has been restored following the reconciliation, or is it the start of a new stage in the internal struggles? [Fadlallah] I believe that there is a point that we must stress, namely that the harsh or lenient Lebanese decisions made in the domestic arena, which are influenced by more than one foreign side, do not stem from a purely internal Lebanese reality. Even the issue of rebuilding the state, which is a popular demand made by all Lebanese people, came as a result of foreign decisions which had unleashed the war in Lebanon by exploiting the Lebanese contradictions inside the country. They were the ones that brought about peace when war stopped being of any use or benefit to this international party or that regional one. Therefore, there is a decision made through the al-Ta'if accord which is wholly American, though it is under an Arab umbrella and has Lebanese signatures. It was American-born but was implemented by the Arabs. The al-Ta'if accord includes the rebuilding of Lebanon in its calculations. The U.S. plan is this: to eliminate the French influence which is active to a great extent within the Maronite and Christian ranks and possibly within some Islamic ranks that are appendages to political Maronism. The U.S. policy is to sweep away the French influence from its positions, even as some of the latter are opening their eyes to the new U.S. atmosphere. There is a French need for influence that finds an advanced position for itself in Christianity and specifically Maronism, through which it can implement its policy by exploiting sectarian emotions. Therefore, I believe that the plan is to rebuild the state in a way that will establish U.S. influence in Lebanon. The United States is planning Lebanon's future in a way that will make it part of the future regional order and therefore there will be a country that has the power to oppose any European, Islamic, or Arab influence. This is the plan. It is not the signal of a new phase in sharp internal Lebanese instability that leads the country to war because we believe that the intra-Lebanese war is over because it is of no use any more to any international or regional party and is not locally possible because the Lebanese have exhausted all their energies in the war. [Ahmad] Turning to political issues, the region, including Lebanon of course, is being groomed for the so-called Middle East market which, we believe, stands for finalizing greater Israel. The word "market" is misleading and does not stand for the truth. What is your assessment of that concept and the general schemes associated with it? [Fadlallah] I cannot confirm the issue of greater Israel. First; judging by the nature of the political, economic, and social climate being prepared for the region, the next stage does not give Israel more than it is already taking from the Arab-Israeli conciliation. Second; monitoring America's actions, we see that it is trying to adjust the area to its wishes, so that nothing passes unless it goes through America. Even if Israel can afford to put some pressure on the U.S. Administration in the Arab-Israeli conflict, we know that it cannot exert such pressure when it comes to the American-Israeli economic conflict. In other words, the Zionist lobby cannot pressure the American administration into making concessions to Israel. What can happen is the facilitation of Israeli transactions in parallel with American ones. America seeks a free hand in the oil-rich areas. If it is trying to preclude any European, Russian, Japanese, or Chinese role in oil-related matters, how can it make Israel a partner? Israel, for its part, is planning a partnership with Europe and America in that field. Therefore, I believe that the issue of a Greater Israel is a finished dream. There is another matter, however. Raising the issue of the Middle East as a substitute for the Arab world derives from plans to establish Israel as a natural member of the region. Normally, Israel could not be part of a region made up of Arabs. But if that region is turned into a Middle East, Israel can be part of it. This is particularly true when we realize that there is a future plan to divide the regional security system into sections, with Turkey and Israel in the forefront, giving Arabs a role inferior to that of Turkey and disproportionate to the size of Arabs at the international level. This is what makes us think that we have to undertake a careful study of the region's economic market -- the water economy, the oil economy, and the agricultural and industrial economy -- against the American-European dispute concerning the export of consumer or military goods to the Arab world. Monitoring the future, we have to see economic matters in their strategic perspective; whereas security-wise, we have to view the future in light of the confrontation with the Islamic inclination or the difficult conflicts involving native or national movements that reality generates. We also have to monitor the new plan America might work out by encircling the Islamic Republic of Iran through a Middle East steered by the American strategy that is open to other strategies in the region. [Ahmad] Are we content with the role of bystander or do you have a specific vision of this confrontation? [Fadlallah] We talk about monitoring because we are trying to analyze reality and future prospects. But in the meantime, we are not neutral regarding that reality. As Islamists, we seek to revive the Islamic inclination by all means possible. We have our own rational and diligent study that measures reality against objectives to distort that American-Israeli plan. As Islamists, we proceed on the basis of integration with pan-Arabists, that is if they are determined to free the Arab political, security, and economic aspects from the American fist and if they have not already sunk in the dreams America is trying to make them live by using words like moderation and so on. I believe that we have to relate with nationalists, pan-Arabists, and even with the Marxists who adopt a creed different from ours. [passage omitted] [Ahmad] A final word by Your Eminence to your readers in Egypt. [Fadlallah] As I speak about the great Islamic homeland in Egypt, I tell all our kinsfolk, brothers, and fellow citizens that they should preserve Egypt as a strength for Arabs, Muslims, and Africa and as a source of strength for anyone who seeks freedom and justice. We believe that the Egyptian nation is one of the best and most honest, open and loving nations. We do not count on the regime--any regime--to stand against this intelligence game but believe that, with its Islamic awareness, Christian openness, and originality, the Egyptian nation will foil this intelligence game. We want to say to the Egyptians--the regime and people--that the regime will not benefit from this kind of bloodshed, neither now nor in the future because the international ploy does not want this nation to be stable. God has urged us to argue our cases in an amicable way, to promote the cause of God with wisdom and friendly advice, to act with goodness to turn our enemies into friends, to be patient over our differences and problems to know how to reconcile our differences and solve our problems. We are sad, very sad, about what is happening in Egypt and do not believe that the Islamists mean harm to Egypt or to its people. Perhaps some people differ with them over certain methods and concepts but we can only say that they are loyal to the Egyptian people and the Islamic cause. We remind the Egyptians of what Imam 'Ali said about the renegades and we do not want to talk about the Islamists as renegades or talk about the regime this way. We are not in the habit of characterizing people but we seek the idea: "Do not fight the renegades for their mistakes because anyone who seeks right and errs is not like one who seeks and does what is wrong." If you claim that the Islamists are wrong--indeed, some of them use the wrong methods for rightful ends--try to initiate a broad and the best kind of dialogue to caution them about what is wrong if there is anything and in this case their Islamic origins will lead them to retreat from the wrong if they are convinced. Those who believe that the state's engagement in dialogue means a loss of prestige for the state are mistaken, because the state's prestige is commensurate with the protection it offers to its people and its persuading them to integrate with it. I ask all our regimes: You have fought wars against Israel that destroyed your economy, security, and policy and are now talking about peace with the Jews who are the fiercest enemies of the believers but why don't you talk about peace with the Muslims who believe in God, His messenger, and the world hereafter? They might err in their interpretations and methods but they were not wrong in testifying that there is no god but God, that Muhammad is his messenger, that the Koran and the world hereafter are true, and that anyone who does not care for Muslims is not a Muslim. Come to common agreement with the Muslims, come to common agreement with people of other religions, come to common terms with all the oppressed who seek freedom against all arrogant people.
