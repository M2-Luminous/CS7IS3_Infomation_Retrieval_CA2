Charat said that a tripartite committee including highways authorities in Thailand, Laos, and China will be set up soon to study the project. The Asian Development Bank held a meeting two weeks ago to survey the road route through Laos. The study will be completed in September. Charat said that the committee will help the Asian Development Bank to summarize the survey faster. Yunnan Governor He Zhiqiang said he is interested in jointly building a road from Thailand into Xishuangbanna. The governor said that there are two possible routes. One is from Chiang Khong of Chiang Rai Province in Thailand through Bokeo Province, Luang Namtha Province, and Boten district in Laos to the border of China. Another one is from Mae Sai of Chiang Rai Province through Tachilek, Kengtung in Burma to Daluo in China. Deputy Communications Minister Charat said that Thailand is more interested in the route through Laos because Thailand just signed a memorandum of understanding with Laos last week agreeing to support Lao transport and communications business. He also said that the second route through Burma is not so safe because it would face problems with Burmese minorities. Regarding waterway transport along the Mekong River from Chiang Rai to Xishuangbanna, the Thai deputy communications minister said that the Thai Government has approved the construction of permanent piers at Chiang Khong and Chiang Saen to be international customs posts. The government will provide 20 million baht for each pier.
