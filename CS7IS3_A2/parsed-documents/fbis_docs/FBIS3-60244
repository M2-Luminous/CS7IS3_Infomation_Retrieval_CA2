The two nations will announce the plan in February at a summit meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Washington, Deputy Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura told a joint press conference. Japan and the U.S. reached the agreement during a second round of talks on a common agenda for global cooperation under a trade framework agreement reached between the two nations in July. The meeting was held Wednesday morning at the Foreign Ministry. Matsuura headed the Japanese delegation and the U.S. side was led by Timothy Wirth, a State Department counselor. During the meeting, Japan and the U.S. agreed that Russia's dumping of radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan was a "regrettable" act and agreed to continue exchanging information and discussing the matter, Matsuura said. James Baker, U.S. undersecretary of commerce for oceanic and atmospheric affairs, told the news conference the countries strongly oppose any dumping of radioactive waste under the London Dumping Convention. "We believe that Russians have acted in violation of the agreement by the London Dumping Convention," Baker said. "Our joint support of the ban on dumping has been an important new step here," he said. The two sides agreed to start a fellowship program for engineers from January. Some 30 U.S. engineers from companies such as Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. will study for a year at Japanese firms like Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co., Hitachi Ltd. and Sony Corp. For the next fiscal year, about 100 engineers will come to Japan under the fellowship. Japan and the U.S. also discussed setting up a committee to cooperate on improvement of the environment in central and eastern Europe and are close to agreement on its establishment, Matsuura said. Wirth said the two nations' cooperation in the area will make a "significant contribution in helping clean up enormous environmental problems that plague" the region.
