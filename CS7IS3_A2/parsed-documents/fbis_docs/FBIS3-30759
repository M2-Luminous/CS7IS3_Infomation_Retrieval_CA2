Answering journalists' questions regarding what happened at the roundtable meeting, [SNS Chairman] Ludovit Cernak said, and I quote, you will be informed by the well-tested pair [Meciar-Prokes]. Afterward, journalists were addressed at a short news briefing by [HZDS Chairman] Vladimir Meciar and Jozef Prokes [SNP honorary chairman and deputy speaker of Slovak parliament]. [Begin Meciar recording] The main issue we addressed was whether Mr. Cernak, as SNS chairman, still feels personally committed to the coalition agreement between the HZDS and SNS. The other issue was whether he was willing to coordinate actions at the [parliament's] plenary session on 16 February so as to ensure our [SNS and HZDS coalition] joint behavior and actions. He answered that the only thing he was willing to follow was purely his conscience. I personally urged him to step down from the post of deputy chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic because the only reason for his holding this post is that, as a coalition, we agreed to render political support to him. In this situation, the HZDS is unable to support Mr. Cernak's remaining in the post of deputy chairman of the National Council. He replied that [word indistinct] if we think we have enough votes to recall him, we should go for it. We also asked whether it [Cernak's faction in the SNS] was ready to respect the unity of the deputies' club, thus specifying our willingness to talk only to those representatives delegated by the SNS. We received a negative answer. Given these circumstances, the HZDS will continue to ensure that agreed coalition undertakings are fulfilled. It pledges to support the SNS as [?a whole]. We are interested in the SNS being a strong partner. We will be coordinating our actions in the National Council with all those who want to coordinate their actions with us. [end recording] [passage omitted] [Begin Prokes recording] It is questionable at the present time whether Mr. Cernak, as deputy chairman of the National Council, represents the SNS because the SNS Central Council clearly voiced a lack of confidence in him. That is one aspect of the matter. The other aspect is that all of the deputies, including those siding with Mr. Cernak, were asked to take part in joint talks with the HZDS and the SNS [deputies'] club. None of them took part in these talks, however. Thus, the issue of whether this group actually intends to respect coalition agreements was the correct issue to raise. I think that the SNS assembly scheduled for 19 February will unequivocally resolve this question. After all, SNS district conferences have indicated a certain solution to this issue. But, in any case, I think that once there is a partnership, problems should be discussed internally rather than passing them to the mass media. [end recording]
