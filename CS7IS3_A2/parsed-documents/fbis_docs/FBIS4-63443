This measure, adopted by the recent deputy commander of the Group of Russian Forces in the Caucasus, is aimed at preventing crimes by the rank and file and officer corps of the Georgian Army. The situation as far as violations of the law is concerned is complicated by the fact that there are no legislative acts in Georgia regulating the ownership of short-barrelled weapons. Thus, citizens have free access to pistols and revolvers.
