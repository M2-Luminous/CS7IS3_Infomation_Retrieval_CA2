FR940719-1-00082 FR940719-1-00015 Executive Order 12866 requires that regulatory agencies assess the impact to the government for any regulation determined to be a significant regulatory action. MSHA does not believe that the proposed rule will create any significant cost impacts to the government. The proposed regulation can be implemented under existing government practices without any substantial equipment or facility expenditures by the government. The incremental compliance costs for all underground coal mines are listed by provision in Table I.
