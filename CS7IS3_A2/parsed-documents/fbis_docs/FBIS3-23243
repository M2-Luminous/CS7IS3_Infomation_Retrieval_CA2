The FIDA claimed responsibility for Saturday's killings in a statement faxed to AFP. Asselah, 55, was shot several times in the face by two or three men early Saturday shortly after he left his car and was walking to his office in the school building, a university spokesman said. His son Rabah, a student at the university, was shot in the abdomen and died later. The assailants fled. Asselah was prominent in the so-called "democratic" movement which opposes Islamic fundamentalism. He was the brother of Algerian independence hero Hocine Asselah, for whom one of Algiers' main avenues is named. "The Armed Islamic Jihad Front F.I.D.A claims the attack perpetrated against Ahmed Asselah and his son," the statement in Arabic and French said, before quoting a Koranic verse to the effect that "offenders will know what fate awaits them." The group first emerged when it claimed responsibility in an anonymous telephone call to AFP for the February 21 murder of French librarian Vincent Grau in an attack here. Muslim extremists started a war against the authorities and began targetting intellectuals after the January 1992 cancellation of the second round of a general election the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was set to win.
