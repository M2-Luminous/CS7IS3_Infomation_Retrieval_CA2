Tereshchenko): Esteemed Chairman, esteemed deputies of the Supreme Kenges of Kazakhstan: The Council of Ministers has submitted a new document for consideration by the parliament, a memorandum which includes information on the government's moves to implement the program of urgent anticrisis measures and broaden the reform, as well as the main program objectives of the government's economic midterm policy resulting from the president's address to the Supreme Kenges. Besides, the government has completed its elaboration of the program of actions aimed at accelerating the reform and stabilizing the economy, making specific the main provisions of the president's address to parliament and the memorandum you received earlier. This program is based on the proposals selected by the commission set up by the president in January this year. The program takes into account the opinions of entrepreneurs, industrialists, researchers, ministries, and departments. It was discussed at the congress of industrialists and entrepreneurs and at yesterday's session of the Council of Ministers. President Nazarbayev made some comments on it. The program will be further elaborated and submitted for your discussion. Its main guidelines are depicted in the memorandum and in the illustrative materials. To avoid repeating the aforementioned documents, I believe it appropriate to dwell in my speech on an analysis of the reform's progress and on the main problems, and also to highlight the key directions of our work, the essence and substance of the government's measures to be taken in the coming period. The toughness and duration of the process of radically transforming a planned economy into a market one depend mainly on which approaches are used. In our republic, the government's course comprises three basic measures: 1. Economic liberalization through removal of controls over prices and manufacturers; 2. Macroeconomic stabilization through regulation of the money in circulation and achievement of a balanced budget; 3. The sale of state property to individuals and/or organizations. The course of reforms carried out by the government in previous years was objectively predestined and unavoidable. One can say that it was mistaken; one can object to it; one can, so to say, "forcefully" express lack of confidence in it. However, nothing can change the realistic assessment of that course. No matter who headed the government or who the members of the government were, the government would have pushed the reform in the same direction. To say that some things might have been done better is quite another matter, but that would be to speak only of some quantitative changes, not qualitative ones. The results would have been exactly the same -- deterioration, inflation, a decline of living standards. Can one seriously speak about implementing any other measures given that the USSR and the common economic area have disintegrated but the common ruble is still there, and that we lost big financial sources and inherited an exceptionally unbalanced economy at the start of the reform after Russia began its reforms? Certainly not! Anything the government says or does is now criticized. I am quite sure that somebody will again ask: "How long are you going to keep referring to the former USSR to 1992?" Nevertheless, unless we look back to the starting point, one cannot digest the logic and dynamics of changes, one cannot understand what we have already achieved or the position in which we find ourselves, the point we have reached in the course of transition and what our next steps will be. In this respect, the further away we are from 1992, the better and deeper we see the underwater part of the whole iceberg of the problems we have had to tackle. It is absolutely clear today that to transfer the economy from one state into a qualitatively new one which is on a much higher level demands money, and a lot of money. We began our reform under ultimately unfavorable conditions when, after the collapse of the USSR, we lost large subsidies and subventions from the center, when the source supplying us with cheap petrodollars was depleted, and when "Gorbachev's" foreign loans were coming to their end. All this meant knowing full well first, that the budget demanded significant cuts even without reforms, second, that we would have to implement the reforms at our own expense. The latter meant in fact that we would have to be very tough toward the production and social sphere. In fact, we have done that. The burden of taxes was constantly increasing. The debit side of the budget was kept within the necessary limits at the expense of continuing cuts in the social sphere. When we were in the ruble zone, we could for a certain time compensate for all our production budget cuts with the help of a softer crediting policy. But after Russia had introduced corresponding accounts, and later when the ruble zone collapsed, we had to be much tougher in our crediting policy. Any softening of loans or budget after the introduction of our own national currency would have meant inflation and a fall in the tenge exchange rate, and further blows for the production and social sphere. If you like, this is all there is to know about the ins and outs of the ongoing processes, and this is the state of finance in the period of reforms. Of late, we have got so used psychologically to negative processes in our society and economy that we do not pay sufficient attention to positive phenomena. Without timely evaluation and support for the latter, we cannot view the long term prospects or correctly grasp our strategic development. Since the beginning of the reform and Kazakhstan's acquisition of state independence two and a half years ago, we have done quite a lot. This enabled us to achieve noticeable positive changes which ensure the irreversibility of our society on its way from the command-distribution system to a market economy. 1. First of all, cardinal changes are occurring in the ownership relations which are the basis for all structural and economic reforms. The ratio between the state and private sectors of the economy are changing significantly. The private sector's share in the overall gross domestic product in the previous five years has almost trebled -- from 9 percent in 1988 to 26 perceent in 1993. The ongoing process of privatization, which is strictly channeled along all three directions, enhances the growth of the private sector. 2. A complete replacement of the centralized state pricing system by a free market pricing system is a positive step. The previous state pricing system disguised deep structural biases and disproportions which had emerged in the republic's economy. Very often the system did not react to the dynamically changing demands and requirements of specific consumers, and systematically generated a devastating shortage of various goods and services. Today most of the prices are set by manufacturers themselves, by distributors and sellers who take into account the ratio between supply and demand on the commodity markets. Currently, free market prices, which very quickly react to any changes in consumers' demands and even to decisions made by the government, very often force enterprises and individual entrepreneurs to radically restructure their work. 3. The government has achieved positive changes in liberalizing domestic and foreign trade. The discredited system of centralized distribution of material and technical resources has been practically fully dismantled. It did not allow state enterprises to independently sell their products directly to buyers. Because of this, useless stockpiles of unwanted products built up in warehouses and resources were in short supply. Today enterprises are absolutely free to choose their trade partners and they can freely determine with them all contractual provisions and all agreements on production and delivery of goods. The government no longer interferes in the establishment of economic links; on the contrary, it strives to assist domestic enterprises, especially when mutual deliveries to enterprises in Russia and other CIS member countries are concerned. The list of licensed and quoted goods has been significantly reduced, both for exports and imports. Restrictions on the export of goods sold for the national currency have been lifted. Customs duties and tariffs have been seriously re-examined. Social and economic stability, and the government's consistency in implementing the reform, have provided firm guarantees for foreign investors. During the previous two years, the volume of investment has nearly trebled. The republic had a positive trade balance in 1993 for the very first time. 4. As far as the budget reform is concerned, the government and the previous Supreme Kenges established a system of taxes and tariffs which is an integral whole, though it may be far from perfect. Direct budget subsidies for enterprises have been eliminated. Subsidies for regulated prices are also being eliminated. The government has consistently decreased budget expenditures on subsidies for loss-making enterprises and compensations for differences in related costs and prices. In 1992 they equalled 11.6 percent of all expenditures, and in 1993 they were only 6.2 percent. Import subsidies have also been discontinued. Apart from implementing its nationwide objectives, the budget is becoming more and more socially oriented owing to the targeted support for the least protected groups of the population. Along with this, the Finance Ministry is gaining more control. The government's relations with the national bank are becoming more market oriented. The national bank is concentrating on monetary circulation matters and on strengthening the national currency in the framework of the two-tier banking system.
