[Mubarak] There is cooperation between Egypt and China in many fields. I hope this cooperation will continue. China has a great deal of potential and capabilities and we can benefit from them. The similarity between Egypt and China in many aspects calls on us to maintain that cooperation and enhance it. China is a Third World country. It is a big state that has strong determination. Everyone here must work; there is no room here for empty talk. I admire the Chinese for their determination to develop and progress. They see world progress and work to develop themselves. The type of development we have seen, in fields like journalism and communications, calls for admiration. China is a Third World state and we have always called for cooperation with it within the framework of south-south cooperation. [Correspondent] How can we benefit from China's experience in increasing rates of development while sustaining political, economic, and social stability in the country in spite of the huge population, and how can this experience benefit us in economic reform and openness? [Mubarak] You know that we always consult with China in the areas of development. China's development rate might have been very high. However, many disadvantages were involved. The Chinese decided to reduce these rates. When the rates resulted in very high standards, prices increased. A steep drop in these rates involved a number of problems, too. They are trying to determine the rate that suits the citizens most. This is exactly what we are doing. They keep social justice and the quality of the citizens' lives in mind. The same thing happens with us. In all our actions, we must see how the citizen will cope. Sometimes our citizens complain of increasing prices, but [words indistinct] are unavoidable. Problems arise [words indistinct] and it is the same with China. [Correspondent] China is a nuclear state. What is the Chinese stance on your call for making the Middle East free from weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons? [Mubarak] I am making this call. Being a nuclear state itself, America is making the same call. Why should I talk about America or China? Why should I get involved in such an issue? All countries agree that the Middle East should be free from nuclear and chemical weapons. [Correspondent] What about the talks between Your Excellency and the Chinese president? [Mubarak] We have excellent relations with China. We are linked by very strong ties. The first time I visited China was on 17 April 1976, when I was vice president. As an Egyptian citizen, I share the same problems with the Chinese citizens. We talked with the Chinese president about all international issues. We have almost the same views and have no differences as to how to tackle international issues. China has supported Arab rights in the Middle East issue from the outset. It has adopted noble stances regarding the Arab nation, particularly Egypt. Of course we discussed bilateral relations. I think that scopes of cooperation are very wide. Thank you.
