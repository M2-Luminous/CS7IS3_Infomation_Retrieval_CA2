Ragnar Nordgren asked in ARBEIDERBLADET on 10 January if supporting EU membership if Sweden and Finland join is compatible with membership in Social Democrats Against the EU (SME). We do not scrutinize the hearts and minds of anyone who wants to join SME, but such an attitude is incompatible with SME's views. The arguments against membership are equally important regardless of what Sweden and Finland do. At the same time I do not see that Swedish and Finnish membership would introduce decisive new elements that would invalidate these arguments. In our opinion, EU membership would lessen democratic influence on our own national development. It would be harder to combat unemployment, there would be greater disparities in Norway, Norwegian authorities would lose their influence on economic policy, it would be harder to preserve and strengthen the welfare state, and the labor movement would be weakened. Regional, resource and residential, and environmental considerations will be just as important even if Sweden and Finland become members. It will also be just as important for us to be able to speak with our own voice in international organizations. If one believes that small countries can occasionally play a role precisely because they are outside the big power blocs and that the Nordic voice has made a positive contribution to the international community, this supports the argument that it will be more important for Norway to stay out of the EU if Finland and Sweden join, although I realize that Nordgren does not share this view. In an article in ARBEIDERBLADET on 13 January, Peder Figenbaum saw fit to "remind" me that the most important reason why Norway is applying for membership is that our partners in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) have done so and that if Finland or Sweden says no, the Norwegian application will lose much of its purpose. He may be right that Norwegian support would then collapse due to the strong EU opposition in this country. But it is not correct that Norwegian membership depends on Sweden and Finland also becoming members. Obviously it is important to clarify this matter. Therefore I asked party leader Thorbjorn Jagland last year if the Labor Party supports membership if Sweden and Finland do not become members. I was told that the party leadership had not yet discussed this. Later that year, in response to a similar question, deputy leader Jens Stoltenberg stated that the Labor Party supports Norwegian membership regardless of whether or not Sweden and Finland become members. And that is the only logical position. It would certainly seem strange if proponents regard the usual arguments for membership -- that Norway "belongs to Europe," that we must join in order to influence EU policy, control financial forces, and change the EU in cooperation with other Social Democratic parties, as well as for security and environmental reasons -- as being so unimportant that they do not apply if Sweden or Finland remains outside. Figenbaum presents some arguments suggesting that Finland's and Sweden's relationship are also important for us. He mentions the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, relations with our Nordic neighbors, and, the most important consideration for him, our relations with Europe. Figenbaum claims that the government views the EEA agreement as "absurd" if the other applicants become EU members. If so, it would mean that the government prefers a trade agreement of the kind we had up to 31 December, which also has Center and Socialist Left (SV) support. I do not think this is true and I do not know where Figenbaum thinks he got it from. The EEA agreement expands free trade to include services and public tenders and also regulates competitive conditions so that they are the same within the entire EEA area. There is no reason why the EU should not want to have such an agreement with Norway and Iceland even if Sweden, Finland, and Austria become members. Figenbaum says our situation will be "pretty hopeless with an unguarded 1,300-km border with the economic and political superpower that the EU will undoubtedly be and only little Iceland to back us up." I do not know what kind of encroachment Figenbaum imagines Norway has to fear from the EU. Personally I have no doubt that the EU will continue to live up to its agreements and desire good relations with Norway. In 1972, EC supporters said it would present no obstacle to expanded Nordic cooperation if Norway and Denmark became members and the other three countries remained outside. So it is hard to see that we could not have good Nordic cooperation now with some Nordic countries that are EU members and others that are not. And even if Sweden, Finland, and Norway should all become EU members, surely we will continue to include Iceland in Nordic cooperation. With respect to relations with the EU, if Sweden and Finland are members, we will have three close friends and neighbors inside the organization. Surely that would not make cooperation and contacts with the EU more difficult.
