FR940728-2-00146 FR940728-2-00106 Proposed Absolute Priority 1_Closed-Captioned Daytime Television Programs Background This proposed priority would continue and expand closed-captioning of a variety of daytime television programs broadcast nationally for persons who are deaf or hard of hearing during this segment of the day that has proven to be the most difficult in terms of private sector support. Priority: To be considered for funding under this proposed priority, a project must_ (1) Include the criteria used to determine which programs are proposed for captioning. These criteria must take into account the preference of consumers for particular programs, the diversity of programming available, and the contribution of programs to the general educational and cultural experiences of individuals with hearing impairments; (2) Determine the total number of hours and the projected cost per hour for each program to be captioned; (3) For each proposed program to be captioned, identify the source of private or other public support and the projected dollar amount of that support; (4) Identify the methods of captioning to be used for each hour and the projected cost per hour for each method used; (5) Provide and maintain back-up systems that would ensure successful, timely captioning service; (6) Demonstrate the willingness of major national television networks and companies to permit captioning of their programs; and (7) Implement procedures for monitoring the extent to which full and accurate captioning is provided and use this information to make refinements in captioning operations. Proposed Absolute Priority 2_Cultural Experiences for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Individuals Background This priority supports a variety of cultural activities designed to enrich the lives of deaf and hard of hearing individuals, including children and youth, as well as adults. These activities must use an integrated approach that mixes children, youth, and adults, who are deaf and hard of hearing with those who can hear while conducting cultural experiences that will increase public awareness and understanding of deafness and other hearing impairments and of the artistic and intellectual achievements of deaf and hard of hearing individuals. During FY 1992 the Department funded projects that: (1) provided theatrical experiences for deaf and hard of hearing individuals, and (2) used integrated approaches by having among cast members a mixture of deaf, hard of hearing and hearing performers. During FY 1993 cultural experiences were extended specifically to younger people with hearing impairments and to the creation of art as well as theatrical experiences, using the same approaches. Projects under this proposed priority can include a variety of artistic approaches such as the creation of works of art (painting, drawing, designing, etc.), dance, and storytelling, as well as developing and performing dramatic productions. A grantee may not use funds under this priority for passive activities such as viewing a play or video, or passively watching a storyteller or artist at work. Priority: To be considered for funding under this priority, a project must_ (1) Use an integrated approach that mixes children, youth, and adults who are deaf and hard of hearing, with those who are hearing in carrying out project activities; and (2) Develop and implement strategies that will increase public awareness and understanding of deafness and other hearing impairments and of the artistic and intellectual achievements of deaf and hard of hearing individuals, including children, youth, and adults. Outreach activities such as promoting the project to schools, community organizations, news media, and relevant national organizations are encouraged.

However, pursuant to 34 CFR 75.105(c)(i), an application that meets this invitational priority does not receive competitive or absolute preference over applications that do not meet this priority:
