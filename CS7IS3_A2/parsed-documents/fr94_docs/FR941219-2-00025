Take notice that on December 2, 1994, CNG Transmission Corporation (CNG), 445 West Main Street, Clarksburg, West Virginia 26031, filed in an abbreviated application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing CNG to construct and operate, for the transmission of natural gas, 4.73 miles of 30-inch underground pipeline in Rotterdam Township, Schenectady County, New York, all as more fully set forth in the application which is one file with the Commission and open to public inspection. The construction cost is estimated by CNG to be $7,991,600 dollars. The proposed facility, designated CNG's TL&hyph;450 Extension 5, is needed by CNG to continue to maintain pressure requirements and meet post Order No. 636 obligations for Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation's distribution system serving the Albany, New York area. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before January 3, 1995, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C., 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceedings. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for CNG to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
