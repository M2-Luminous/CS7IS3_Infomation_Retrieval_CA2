FR940406-0-00070 FR940406-0-00005 (ii) Within 6 months of the date of approval of the 1995 closures and realignments unless the community requests a postponement as provided in paragraph (a)(7) of this section. (5) These timeframes afford Federal Agencies sufficient time to assess their needs, submit initial expressions of interest to the Department of Defense, and apply for the property. During this period, Agencies sponsoring public benefit conveyances should also consider the suitability for such purposes. The Military Departments should provide other Federal Agencies as full and complete information as practicable on the property in the Notice of Availability. Requests for transfers of property submitted by other Federal Agencies will normally be accommodated. Decisions on the transfer of property to other Federal Agencies shall be made by the Military Department concerned in consultation with the local redevelopment authority. (6) Military Departments should make the notices of availability available to the local redevelopment authorities, State and local governments. (7) Within the 6 month screening period in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the Military Departments shall consult with the local redevelopment authority and make appropriate final determinations whether a Federal Agency has identified a use for, or shall accept transfer of, any portion of the property. If no Federal Agency requests the property, the property shall be declared surplus. However, the local redevelopment authority may request the Military Department concerned to delay this final surplus declaration. All requests for delay must be in writing and made before May 1, 1994 for 1988, 1991 and 1993 closures and realignments and within 5 months of the approval of the 1995 base closures and realignments. If there is a Federal Agency request for transfer, the Secretary concerned may postpone the determination to transfer and the Secretary may also postpone the determination of surplus for all or any part of the property at the installation for such period as the Secretary concerned determines is in the best interest of the communities affected by the closure of the installation. (8) Screening of real property with State and local government agencies shall take place concurrently with McKinney Act screening. The screening notice should state: Uses to assist the homeless shall take precedence unless the Secretary concerned or the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) determines that a competing request under 40 U.S.C. 484(k) is so meritorious and compelling as to outweigh the needs of the homeless. (9) Withdrawn public domain lands are those lands which have been transferred from the Department of Interior to a Military Department for its temporary use. (i) These lands on closing or realigning bases are to be returned to the Secretary of Interior when the Secretary of the Military Department concerned no longer has need for these lands, if they are still suitable for the programs of the Secretary of Interior. (ii) The Military Department concerned will notify the Secretary of Interior, normally through the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), when withdrawn public domain lands are included within an installation to be closed.
