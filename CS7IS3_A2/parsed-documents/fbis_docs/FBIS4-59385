[Al-Surani] Forming the Palestinian authority or the government is not an easy issue that can be ended in hours or days. There are numerous normal contacts, because we are moving from one phase to another...from the revolution, which has numerous concerns but limited requirements, to the phase of taking responsibility for a people's life, including health, education, housing, transportation, post, food, electricity, and other needs. [passage omitted] [Khashanah] When will consultations be completed as regards forming the authority, and when will it be officially announced? [Al-Surani] We must first complete the consultations between those inside and those outside and also among those outside. It is a difficult equation. The objective is to ensure that the ship is heading -- right from the start -- toward the shore of safety. [Khashanah] Have you agreed at least on the foundations and criteria? [Al-Surani] That too is among the issues we are currently discussing. I expect the consultations to be completed within a week or 10 days at the latest. [passage omitted] [Khashanah] In practice, how will the Executive Committee be the authority for the National Authority? [Al-Surani] That decision was taken by the Central Council in its October session, because the Executive Committee represents the Palestinian people's unity. If the national authority inside is for those inside only, it would be as if we are saying that the Palestinian people in the diaspora have nothing to do with Palestine. The Executive Committee's being the authority qualifies it to continue to be the political and spiritual bond for the Palestinians inside, about 3 million of them, and the Palestinians outside, about 3 million of them. It means that the problem of the diaspora Palestinians will continue to exist and will not be solved except with the deferred issues -- Jerusalem, dismantling of the settlements, and self-determination. [Khashanah] Does that mean that the Palestinian state will continue to be based in Tunis? [Al-Surani] Foreign activity will remain in Tunis. Because under the accord signed in Washington, the Palestinian authority is not entitled to have foreign relations. But the PLO has secured the recognition of 127 states, and we shall safeguard these relations and exploit them in the interests of our people inside and outside. Because it is unreasonable for Israel to be in charge of our relations with the world, especially as we have secured this international recognition through the sacrifices made by our people. [passage omitted] [Khashanah] It is said that there are criticisms against granting Fatah sensitive posts.... [Al-Surani] First, no one disputes that Fatah is the mother organization. Second, those who get posts now are not the winners, because the early posts are very demanding. Anyhow, such talk did not take place at the Executive Committee's meetings. On the contrary, it asked everyone to participate, the Popular Front, Hamas, the Democratic Front.... [Khashanah] What will the Executive Committee's fate be after the formation of the authority and its entry into Jericho? [Al-Surani] It will continue to exist and operate until the National Council elects a new Executive Committee at its next session.
