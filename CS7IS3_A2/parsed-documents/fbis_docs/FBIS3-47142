The (?seamy) side of the case was disclosed in December last year. The puppet Army-prosecution joint investigation headquarters clinched off the case as a "mere fraud" committed by a South Korean arms broker and a French arms dealer vis-a-vis the logistics headquarters of the puppet Defence Ministry. The Democratic Party in a commentary January 7 branded the joint investigation headquarters' behavior as ridiculous, and urged the invocation of the "parliamentary investigation power" in order to probe the truth of the case. The national party in a statement demanded that the "government" nullify the results of investigation of the headquarters and appoint a special prosecutor to make a full reinvestigation into the case.
