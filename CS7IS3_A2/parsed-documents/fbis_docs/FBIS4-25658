Taku Yamasaki, a House of Representatives member of the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and his colleague met with Tang before leaving for a visit of "two or three" days to North Korea. His visit comes a day after North Korea announced late Monday it will withdraw from the IAEA in retaliation to the IAEA's cancellation last Friday of technical assistance to Pyongyang. "The IAEA sanctions caused this result, China abstained from voting (on the sanctions) and calls for a peaceful solution through dialogue," Yamasaki quoted Tang as saying. "China is continuing consular efforts, we are doing this in a more positive way, but the North Korean attitude is very firm. I think our efforts will not be decisive," Tang was quoted as saying. "The most important thing is not to force North Korea out of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)," Tang told Yamasaki. "We are at a critical moment. The international community should promote a peaceful solution, mainly through dialogue between North Korea and the United States." In Pyongyang, Yamasaki hopes to discuss with North Korean leaders recent developments concerning the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and the ongoing consultations in the UN Security Council of sanctions on North Korea. He said Li Shuzheng, head of the International Liaison Department of the Chinese Communist Party, said at a meeting Monday that China should not be counted on to abstain on Security Council sanctions on North Korea as they did on the IAEA sanctions. "We have not decided what to do. We will decide according to the situation at the time," he quoted Li as telling him. Yamasaki is also expected to discuss North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program and its refusal to allow IAEA inspections of the refueling of a 5-megawatt experimental nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang.
