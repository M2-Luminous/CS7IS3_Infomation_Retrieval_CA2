Within auto, electric, and machinery industries, some manufacturers are planning to set up a new management system on the assumption that the yen's rate against the dollar will be 100 and lower. While establishing short-term measures, they are also trying to cope with the yen's further appreciation by taking mid-to-long-range measures such as changing management systems in hopes of cutting the trade surplus through the expansion of imports and benefiting from the yen appreciation. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., in the next two to three years starting this fiscal year, plans to increase to 30 percent the rate of material purchases from foreign nations. Mitsubishi seems to have already increased this rate to 15-16 percent this fiscal year. Mitsubishi says that "we will set up a new system that can deal with a possible 95 yen to $1" (according to Chairman Yotaro Iida) by doubling its purchase of materials overseas. NEC Corporation plans to halve its total production costs, hopefully by the end of 1995. NEC plans to purchase key parts of personal computers from Taiwanese makers. It also plans to buy up those parts from its subsidiary company in Hong Kong starting this autumn. Underlying Japanese manufacturers' increasing procurement of parts from foreign makers is the fact that to compete with foreign companies who sell their products cheap in Japan by taking advantage of the appreciated yen, it is necessary for Japanese companies to lower parts purchase costs for their products. IBM Japan said that a loss in exports for the period January-December 1993 increased 20 billion yen when compared with that of 1992. As of late March, IBM Japan has shifted its production base for hard disk units to Thailand as part of its measures to improve profit-earning efficiency. It also plans to relocate factories for producing other disk units to Malaysia. However, within the industrial circles, there is deep concern about the possibility that such rapid shifting of production bases overseas will lead to industrial "hollowing out" (according to Sony Corporation President Norio Ohga). As far as the electronic industry is concerned, Aiwa Co., Ltd., which specializes in manufacturing audiovisual (AV) products, has already shifted most of its production base overseas. It produces 70 percent of its total products in its foreign factories, and has produced excellent results. This is because "it is impossible for Japanese makers to produce all the parts of their products in Japan when the employment situation in Japan is considered" (according to Sony President Ohga). Since there is no effective measure to deal with the appreciated yen, the private sector for its part has no choice but to cut the trade surplus as much as possible, which is a main cause of the yen appreciation. Since over 50 percent of the U.S. deficit in trade with Japan is in the area of automobiles and auto parts trade, the Japanese automakers, while promoting their own restructuring efforts, have started giving serious study to a further increase in imports of finished autos from the United States. A senior Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association member shows his view, saying, "The yen appreciation this time reflects the situation wherein Japan is given the alternative of opening its market or allowing the yen to rise further." The Japanese say that "Japan will face further pressure unless the auto issue is solved." In this way, there is a voice calling for further opening of the auto dealers' network to the U.S. makers.
