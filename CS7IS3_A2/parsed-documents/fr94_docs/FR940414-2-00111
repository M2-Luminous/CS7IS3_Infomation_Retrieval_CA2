FR940414-2-00111 FR940414-2-00076 15. The General Partner has made capital commitments to the MS Venture Capital Funds in an aggregate amount of approximately 10.6% of the aggregate capital commitments of the Funds, of which approximately 94% will be funded by MSVC II and approximately 6% will be funded by the individual general partners and limited partners of the General Partner. 16. The General Partner will be paid an annual management fee equal to 2 percent of the Partnership's aggregate capital commitments, subject to reduction as specified in the Partnership's limited partnership agreement. However, to the extent the General Partner, its constituent general partners or its employees receive any officers', directors', broken-deal, remunerative or other net fees (i.e., excluding expense reimbursement) from portfolio companies, affiliates of portfolio companies, and potential portfolio companies, or to the extent employees of another member of the Morgan Stanley Group who serve as officers or directors of such entities pursuant to rights held by the Partnership to designate such officers or directors receive any officers' or directors' fees (excluding expense reimbursement), a portion of such net fees will reduce the management fee on a dollar-for-dollar basis. 17. The General Partner will pay out of the management fee its normal operating expenses, including rent, salaries of its personnel, expenses incurred by its personnel in investigating investment opportunities, and communications and travel expenses. The Partnership will pay certain enumerated expenses of the General Partner and the Partnership incurred in connection with the organization, operation, and dissolution of the Partnership. Expenses borne by the Partnership may include the fees, commissions, and expenses of a member of the Morgan Stanley Group for services performed by such member to the Partnership, including, without limitation, brokerage or clearing services. 18. The General Partner will be entitled to receive a ``carried interest'' of 12% of the realized and unrealized gains and losses of the Partnership. The remaining 88% will be shared by all Partners in proportion to their capital commitments. A ``carried interest'' is an allocation to the General Partner of the Partnership's net gains in addition to the amount allocable to the General Partner that is in proportion to its capital contributions. For purposes of determining he Partnership's net gains, management fees and expenses borne by the Partnership, in addition to the Partnership's realized and unrealized losses, will be netted against the Partnership's realized and unrealized gains. The entire 12% carried interest received by the General Partner will be paid to the individual general and limited partners of the General Partner. The General Partner's carried interest is structured to comply with the requirements of rule 205&hyph;3 promulgated under the Advisers Act. 19. The Partnership will invest all of its capital in investment opportunities in which the MS Venture Capital Funds invest. The Partnership will not be permitted to make investments other than co-investments with the MS Venture Capital Funds. In connection with any investment opportunity, except with the consent of an advisory committee consisting of limited partners of one or both of the MS Venture Capital Funds (the ``Fund Advisory Committee''), the amount of the Partnership co-investment generally will bear the same proportion to the aggregate investments of the MS Venture Capital Funds and the Partnership as the aggregate capital commitments of the Partnership bears to the aggregate capital commitments of the MS Venture Capital Funds and the Partnership (other than with regard to differences that result from the specific expenses incurred by the MS Venture Capital Funds and the Partnership). In addition, except with the consent of the Fund Advisory Committee, the Partnership will be required to make any co-investments on terms no more favorable than those applicable to the investments by the MS Venture Capital Funds. 2 2‚ê£It is anticipated that the economic terms applicable to the Partnership's investments will be the same as those applicable to the corresponding investments by the MS Venture Capital Funds. It is possible, however, that the investment of the MS Venture Capital Funds will have more favorable non-economic terms (e.g., the right to representation on the board of directors of the portfolio company) in light of regulatory or other considerations. 20. The co-investments by the Partnership with the MS Venture Capital Funds are expected to include: (a) Majority or 100% ownership interests in portfolio companies; (b) Publicly traded securities; and (c) securities purchased in growth company buyouts.
