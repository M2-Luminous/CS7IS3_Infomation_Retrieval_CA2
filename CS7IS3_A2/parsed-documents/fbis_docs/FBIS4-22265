European Affairs Call for Closer Attention"] [Text] After the Cold War The October events in Moscow would seem to have cleared the decks for a more flexible and active Russian policy in Europe. After all, it was the dissolved Supreme Soviet that did quite a lot to block a rapprochement between Russia and the West. We will know the position of the new Russian parliament after the coming elections. At the moment there is strong evidence that European developments are gradually restricting Russian diplomacy's room for manoeuvre. Not long ago people in Europe, which had entered a period of sweeping change, were under the impression that a painless end of the division of the continent was in the offing. Democratic revolutions had created an atmosphere of expectation of early European unity. The East and the West stopped looking on each other as adversaries, both sides extending a hand of friendship, as the Declaration of 22 signed by WTO and NATO countries in Paris on November 19, 1990, put it. But over optimistic expectations gradually gave way to some realistic thinking. The Yugoslav crisis and the disintegration of the country accompanied by armed clashes and civil wars, a phenomenon which Europe had forgotten about, and the breakup of the Soviet Union, which extended the area of conflict, dampened the idyllic mood of architects of a new Europe, making them ponder on how to stop Europe's incipient return to the era of internecine wars, to Hobbes's "war of all against all". As a result, Europe remained virtually divided, except that what we have this time is not military and political alignments but an economically and socially backward "Eastern periphery" and a West that is ahead of it on many counts. In spite of a process of transformation of relations in Europe, the equation of the new continental architecture still included many unknowns, making its assumption of a reasonably marked character difficult. The formation of a pluralist Europe relying on a whole set of organisations rather that an only organisation is a product of the concept of mutually reinforcing institutions. In line with a kind of division of labour, it was expected to bring in the CSCE, NATO, North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), EC, Western European Union (WEU), Council of Europe. But it was not easy for these organisations (except the NACC, they all came into being in Cold War years) to find a new identity after the end of that war. There even developed a certain competition between them. While the United States gave preference to preserving NATO's role or searching for a new one, France focussed on extending the powers of the EC in the area of security policy, stressing the need to revive the WEU. Paris also saw a priority in strengthening the CSCE, not NATO, as an instrument of European security policy, with the North Atlantic alliance playing only an auxiliary role, it is probably safe to say that the controversy over which of the European organisations was particularly important took as much time as the search for solutions to the thorny problems encountered by Europe of late. The CSCE: A Prospect for the Whole of Europe? Today the CSCE is the only European institution which includes Russia as a full-fledged member. This explains Moscow's effort to help the CSCE and its institutions play a bigger role in European politics. Unlike other ex-Soviet republics, Russia did not have to go though any special procedure of admission to the Conference, for as a state continuing the Soviet Union, it had also inherited the latter's seat in that forum. The mechanisms of the Helsinki process have undergone visible changes in recent years. Under the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe, new bodies have been set up: the CSCE Council composed of the members' Foreign Ministers, the Committee of Senior Officials (CSO), the Conflict Prevention Centre (CPC) in Vienna, the Office for Free Elections in Warsaw (now called the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights) and the Secretariat in Prague. Ever since 1992, annual meetings have been held by the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly. The first meeting of the CSCE Council (Berlin, June 1991) approved a Mechanism for Consultations and Cooperation with Regard to Emergency Situations, which makes it possible to call extraordinary meetings of the CSO to this end without waiting for the go-ahead of all member states. Immediately after that, the CSO tackled the crisis in ex-Yugoslavia, and ever since 1992 it has also been concerned with the conflicts in the ex-Soviet Union. The second meeting of the Council (Prague, January 1992) admitted the majority of ex-Soviet republics to the CSCE. Georgia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina became participating states in March and May 1992; Czechia and Slovakia have held similar status since their peaceful "divorce" in 1992. Currently the CSCE comprises 53 countries. The same Prague meeting resolved to extend the powers of the new institutions of the Helsinki process. The CSO became in effect the central body of the Conference Council representing the latter in between meetings and responsible for coordinating the work of other institutions. Established within the framework of the CSO was a CSCE Economic Forum, which first met in April 1993 in Prague. The political functions of the Conflict Prevention Centre were extended. The rule demanding that decisions be made consensually was partly revised. At present decisions can be made according to the formula "consensus minus one", at least as far as fulfilling obligations within the framework of the human dimension are concerned. Further steps to strengthen CSCE institutions were taken at a meeting in the Finnish capital that opened on March 24 and culminated in a summit on July 9-10, 1992. The 1992 document adopted at Helsinki confirmed the key role of the Council and extended still further the CSO's power to make decisions. The Committee was assigned the chief role in giving early warning of emerging conflicts, managing crises, settling disputes by peaceful means and carrying out peace-keeping operations. From 1993 on, the CSO has not only met in Prague every month but had its working group hold weekly meetings in Vienna that have become a standing body, for some of the senior officials empowered to represent their countries are stationed in Vienna. Also growing in the system of CSCE mechanisms is the role of the Acting Chairman -- the Foreign Minister of the country where the Council's latest meeting took place. The 1992 Helsinki Document instructed the Warsaw Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights to monitor compliance with commitments within the CSCE human dimension, meet to discuss this matter, hold specialised seminars and fulfil other tasks. In December 1992, the newly established post of CSCE High Commissioner for National Minorities was entrusted to former Dutch Foreign Minister Max van der Stoel. The powers of the CPC, a consultative committee, were extended. Specifically, it was authorised to make decisions on sending fact-finding missions and rapporteurs to the field with a view to detecting potential conflicts at an early date as well as to managing crises. Besides, the Centre is to assist the CSO in peace-keeping operations. By decision of the CSCE Helsinki meeting (September 1992), a CSCE Forum for Security Cooperation has begun functioning in Vienna. It is intended to help work out new accords on arms control, disarmament and confidence and security building (within the framework of the Forum's Special Committee) as well as to search for ways and means of settling conflicts (within the framework of the Consultative Committee, whose work is closely linked with the CPC's tasks). The third meeting of the Council (Stockholm, December 1992) established the post of CSCE Secretary-General (in April 1993, without waiting for its Rome meeting set for late 1993, it gave the post to a German diplomat, Ambassador Wilhelm Hoynck). His functions include not only seeing to the proper organisation of the work of the secretariats of diverse CSCE structures but assisting the Acting Chairman. The Convention on Conciliation and Arbitration within the CSCE was signed in Stockholm by 29 countries. The extended powers and functions of new CSCE structures and institutions undoubtedly reflect an effort to react to the dramatic events taking place in Europe and help at first sight strengthen the trend towards making the CSCE a key component of the new European security mechanism. But prudent opinion's prevail more and more over the euphoria generated by the early steps towards institutionalising the Helsinki process. Initially it looked as if the CSCE could undertake to gradually form a community of countries sharing the common values of pluralist democracy, human rights, economic freedom and social responsibility set out in the Conference's Bonn and Copenhagen documents (1990) and in the Charter of Paris. Yet the solution of this problem is being put off indefinitely, not to say becoming impossible, due above all to the extension of the CSCE membership in 1992 and the inclusion in it of all the sovereign states established on ex-Soviet territory, Who had expected the CSCE to become a collective peace-keeping instrument in Europe were also in for disappointment. While the conflicts in ex-Yugoslavia and the CIS are the object of intensive CSCE debates, hardly anyone today would venture to associate an eventual settlement of these conflicts with precisely the CSCE. Nor did the situation change with the adoption of the 1992 Helsinki Document, which declared the CSCE a regional agency of the UN and provided for eventual peace-keeping operations to be funded by NATO, the EC and WEU. Nor was solution made any easier by the establishment in June 1993 of priorities in decision-making on the use of force by the international community to maintain peace in Europe, which implied that these matters must first be settled at the level of the UN Security Council or the CSCE, after which appropriate powers can be delegated to NATO or other entities. The very process of decision-making, which presupposes a consensus, proved so cumbersome as to make it impossible for the CSCE to act promptly and effectively. As for the emerging tendency to revise the principle of consensus and make decisions by majority vote, it is fraught with a different danger. Excluding one of the parties to a conflict from the drafting of decisions complicates the implementation of recommendations. Ex-Yugoslavia is a case in point. Following the suspension of Siberian membership in the CSCE (amounting to that country's de facto expulsion from the Conference) in July 1992, Belgrade demanded the withdrawal of CSCE observers from Kosovo and the Macedonian border. Needless to say, this reduced the Conference's ability to influence developments in the region. Currently the role of the CSCE in European politics, though important enough, is more modest than expected. Its decisions lend all-Europe legitimacy to efforts exerted by individual groups of nations in conflict zones (as was the case in, say, July and August 1991, when the first extraordinary meetings of the CSO confirmed the EC mandate for mediation in Yugoslavia). The CSCE also performs an important function by establishing facts on the spot and monitoring developments through observers sent to conflict zones. In some cases the Conference makes attempts at mediation that generally produce little effect.[.sup]1[/] The blame for disillusionment with its potentialities must obviously be put not so much on the organisation itself as on the excessive hopes and promises that found expression in 1990. Realising this fact, however, cannot add to the prestige of the CSCE. This is evident from, for instance, Austria's approach to the Helsinki process. In March 1992, Foreign Minister Alois Mock made a sensational statement about Vienna's desire to seek a rapprochement with NATO structures.[.sup]2[/] Subsequently that trend in Austrian policy grew stronger even though it was offset by putting emphasis on closer relations primarily with the WEU.[.sup]3[/] It follows that Austria has in fact gone back on its earlier view of the CSCE as a highly important instrument of European security. A debate on a rapprochement with or even entry into NATO is also going on in Finland. The Swedes are talking about the need to partly revise their traditional policy of neutrality. Swiss policy, too, betrays disappointment at the CSCE. It will be seen that the Conference's obvious failures and the drop in the rating of the concept of an all-Europe collective security system, like the emerging trend towards a rapprochement between ex-WTO members and the EC and NATO, directly face neutrals with the issue of their future place in new European security structures. An Extended NATO? In 1990, NATO's starting positions in the new Europe did not at all seem preferable to those of the CSCE. True, both the London Declaration of its Council (July 1990) and documents of its Rome meeting (November 1991), which formulated the alliance's new strategy, underlined the need to preserve the alliance as an important instrument of European security. But due to controversies inside the alliance, primarily the attitude of France, the future of NATO looked most uncertain, all the more so because this organisation is associated with the sad legacy of the Cold War more often than others. Paradoxical as it may seem, the alliance's new legitimacy received the strongest support from the pro-Atlantic position of East European countries, which have been saying, especially since January 1991, that they would like to join the alliance at some stage as full-fledged members. Yet there are many circumstances holding up such a transition. One of the stipulations of the accords on German unification reached by Mikhail Gorbachev with the West was the latter's readiness not to extend NATO's sphere of influence towards the East. Besides, the alliance itself was in no hurry to throw its door wide open to new members, fearing as it did that this might complicate decision-making and compel it to tackle problems of East European countries. What NATO proposed were mostly stopgaps. In November 1991, after a long period of resistance from France, the Rome meeting of the NATO Council resolved to set up the NACC.[.sup]4[/] The latter's constituent meeting on December 20, 1991 coincided with the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and it was not long before sovereign states that had sprung up on ex-Soviet territory became NACC members along with East European and Baltia states. Compositionally, the only difference between the NACC and the CSCE today is that the former includes no neutrals although Finland secured observer status in June 1992 while Austria and Sweden in 1993 joined in drafting recommendations for peace-keeping operations. The NACC and the working bodies formed by it have no explicit procedures. This may be regarded as a certain demerit but, on the other hand, it stresses the flexibility of the new structure, which makes no political decisions but offers nonparticipating states opportunities for dialogue with NATO. Besides assisting "partner states", as NATO now officially describes Central and East European countries, including the ex-Soviet Union, in a number of sectors agreed in 1992, the Ad Hoc Group for Peace-keeping Operations set up by the Council submitted to the fifth regular meeting of the NACC at the level of Foreign Ministers (Copenhagen, June 1993) recommendations for the promotion of interaction between European institutions in maintaining peace on the continent. In the nearly two years since it was established, however, the NACC has evolved no clear vision of its role in ensuring European security. What is perhaps particularly typical of it is that it leaves various options open depending on developments in Europe. Occasionally it may become something of an anteroom of NATO through which a country wishing to join the alliance must pass and a transitional structure on the road to the formation of a collective security system. Events of 1993 seem to have brought us visibly closer to the final solution of this dilemma. As late as 1992, nobody in NATO would hear of admitting any Central European countries (meaning primarily Poland, Hungary, Czechia and Slovakia) but in early 1993 German Defence Minister Volker R�uhe made a cautious statement in favour of not ruling out such a possibility. An unexpected change in the debate on this subject came about after President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Warsaw in August 1993. Previously Russia had taken a reserved or even negative stand on an extended NATO membership but in Warsaw the President said he "appreciated" Poland's intention to join NATO. "In the long term," said the Joint Russo-Polish Declaration of August 25, "such a decision by sovereign Poland, being directed towards all-Europe integration, does not run counter to the interests of other countries, including the interests of Russia." The Warsaw Declaration was seen as Russia's consent to the inclusion of the four Central European countries in NATO although Russian diplomacy took steps to ease that impression by making a decision on this matter conditional on the evolution of relations between Russia and NATO. Be that as it may, the document signed in Warsaw created an important and irreversible precedent: it cannot be retracted. And while Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu in September 1993 said that Romania did not find it necessary in shaping its foreign policy line to ask Boris Yeltsin's or anyone else's permission, it would be hard to overestimate the Warsaw Declaration. Indeed, its signing was followed by a lively debate on the outlook for the admission of Central European countries to NATO, some comments striking a note entirely different from those sounded earlier. Many in NATO still doubt the wisdom of extending its membership, and yet the general tenor of the debate suggests that the day is not far off when a fundamental decision may be made on this issue. In mid-October 1993, a spokesman for the US State Department said that the Administration was seriously considering the position it should adopt on an extension of NATO. Volker R�uhe on September 15 was more explicit -- he declared for admitting the four Central European countries to NATO. He even allowed for the possibility of their being admitted to NATO earlier than to the EC. Discussion was postponed until the NATO summit in January 1994, which is most likely to adopt a political decision paving the way for talks with Central European countries on their joining the alliance. This would probably be tantamount to the decision of the Copenhagen meeting of the European Council, which opened the door to the EC for several Central and East European countries. As in the case of the EC, nothing is said about the possible time limit of admitting new members, but such a development would influence the formation of European security mechanisms by predetermining an option not in favour of building an all-Europe collective security system in at least the foreseeable future. Since October last, the debate on extending NATO has centred on the concept of "partnership for peace", which US Secretary of State Warren Christopher advanced during his tour of Moscow, Alma-Ata, Kiev, and Minsk. His initiative met with approval in Moscow as well as in Paris and other West European capitals. Its substance has yet to be studied on the threshold of the Brussels summit of NATO scheduled for January 10 but the main ideas are clear: all NACC members can in principle join NATO provided that they meet a number of criteria (including reliable civilian control over the armed forces and a democratic system). Meanwhile they are invited to further their ties with NATO on a bilateral basis, in particular by preparing in common to join in peace-keeping operations. As for natural disasters, a longer list of areas of cooperation will have to be specified within NATO. "Partnership for peace" nominally puts all NACC members on an equal footing but this initiative marks a change in the thinking of alliance members. The very possibility of extending NATO is no longer called into question. Approval of this concept at the Brussels meeting of the NATO Council will probably mean as much as the Copenhagen decision of the European Council. But NATO feels in no hurry to say a final yes to the question about which of today's seekers of membership are most eligible. Washington and Brussels alike are careful not to antagonise Russia so long as there remain prospects for democratic and market reforms here. Nevertheless, agreeing the parameters of "special" relations between Russia and NATO is bound to remove these fears and will go a long way towards opening the alliance's door to new members. A New Yalta? There is no telling how far the likely echo of Boris Yeltsin's Warsaw statement was forecast and taken into account by today's makers of Russian policy, who are now engrossed primarily in internal affairs. It is beyond doubt, however, that such important decisions will necessitate modifications in Moscow's policy in both the short term and the more distant future. The main effect of the events of last fall is unquestionably the near-inevitable extension of NATO by admitting primarily the four Central European countries, which may be followed later on by Romania, Bulgaria and the Baltia countries. Still, the problem is not that this may happen. Such a development could have been foreseen even earlier. The events in question have merely brought it nearer. The problem is the conclusion which Russian diplomacy must draw. We have gotten away from the notion that NATO is an aggressive bloc. It is now clear that the alliance poses no threat to us. The important thing is that a fundamental political decision to extend NATO virtually would put an end to the debate on a European security system even if it were to set no timeframe for this. The expanding West European collective defence system is becoming the mainstay of European security and will guarantee primarily the stability of its member countries more effectively than any other system. This means that interest in playing an active role in stabilisation outside this system now that a series of attempts in ex-Yugoslavia has failed will decline to the extent that developments outside the new zone of NATO responsibility are safe for the organisation's members. If this is true, Russian diplomacy must draw important conclusions. First among them is the conclusion that the present emphasis on building up the CSCE needs to be revised for all that it is important for Russia to preserve organisational possibilities of developing all-Europe structures. The Helsinki process will hardly become the pivot of European policy in the foreseeable future. It is therefore necessary, as well as strengthening the CSCE, to adjust policy to closer interaction with West European and transatlantic structures, primarily the EC and NATO. The question of promoting partnership with the EC is being discussed as preparations go on for a comprehensive treaty with the Community, including a provision for the creation of a mechanism for political dialogue between Russia and the EC, which has turned out to be probably the easiest thing in the course of the talks. The problem of NATO is a harder nut to crack. In view of the prospect of an extension of the alliance, there is reason to forecast (this is another point on which a decision must be made) the possibility of a gradual diminution of the role of the NACC, which largely owes its rise to a desire to draw Central European countries into the drafting of NATO decisions. It follows that Russian membership of the Council, which will retain its importance as a channel for dialogue with ex-Soviet republics, will hardly be enough as a means of bringing about proper interaction with NATO. This leads Russian experts to various conclusions. Sergei Karaganov, for one, proposes making Russia's parallel joining of NATO one condition for the extension of the alliance.[.sup]5[/] I believe, however, that this is unlikely and that, besides, such a solution is unnecessary. It is obviously more important to agree with NATO (even before it admits Central European countries to membership) mechanisms for a direct political and military-political dialogue and interaction between Russia and NATO (without the NACC as mediator), such as would enable Russia to defend its European interests before the alliance makes decisions likely to affect these interests. If this were done, the seemingly negative consequences of extending NATO could be compensated for in the course of direct and close cooperation between Russia and NATO. The more remote effects of political decisions to be made by Russia today seem far more complicated. After all, to extend NATO and the EC would mean seeking to finalise the West's priority interests in Europe, which is what they would concentrate on above all else. Because the geographic zone in question does not include the greater part of the ex-Soviet Union (except the Baltia states), such a decision would strengthen the tendency to recognise that Russia bears special responsibility for the maintenance of stability and peace in the CIS. It is by no means accidental that visible concern about the prospect of an extended NATO is felt in the former European republics of the ex-Soviet Union, especially Ukraine, where an effort is being made to break out of the vast Eurasian area and "get rid", as some Ukrainians word it, of dependence on Russia by gradually integrating into European structures. If this trend in Russian and European politics were to gain the upper hand, the result might prove paradoxical. Moving on from the postwar Yalta order, we would arrive at a new division of spheres of influence, not at a united Europe, and besides, Russia's sphere of influence would shrink greatly compared with that of the ex-Soviet Union. Couldn't this become a pretext for fresh redivisions of Europe after things in our country began looking up and Russia became once again a decisive factor in European politics, as we hope will be the case?
