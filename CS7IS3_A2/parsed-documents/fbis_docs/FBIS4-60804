Pavlov: "Government Knockout: Beginning 4 May a Kilowatt of Electricity for the Population Will Cost 63.6 Rubles"] [Text] This piece of news was delivered the day before yesterday at a scheduled meeting of the kray council of heads of administration by Dalenergo representative Yu. Ivanov. It left those present feeling shell-shocked. As it turned out, Government Decree No. 352, signed on 22 April, had not been coordinated with the regions, including Maritime Kray. So far, preferential rates, wrangled out by the kray administration with incredible difficulty, remain in effect. It was only thanks to this that the kray was able to survive a harsh winter without extraordinary losses. The government's new knockout, which repeals all preferences for Maritime Kray, may be a mortal blow for us. Enterprises and organizations already owe 178 billion rubles [R] in unpaid electric power bills. Of this, R98 billion is to be reimbursed from the federal budget. Now it is frankly giving the kray the finger. The chronic lack of money stemming from nonpayments and the massive decline in production is resulting in a considerable drop in budget revenue. At the same time, expenditures are growing, especially in the social sphere. S. Tereshkov, chief of the kray administration's financial department, emphasized at the council that budget revenue from kray sources is less than half as large as the expense part. Therefore it is quite realistic that the central government once again will freeze wages in budget-financed spheres. In short, the situation is more than alarming. As to our fuel and energy sector, it is, without exaggeration, catastrophic. Repairs of equipment at central heat delivery systems alone require R403 billion. Practically none of this money is available. Despite the fact that with the advent of warm weather electricity use has dropped by 40 percent, no accumulation of fuel is taking place. Moreover, reserves are dropping. Beginning 22 April suppliers stopped shipping coal to the kray. It is quite possible that as early as May restrictions on consumers will be introduced. The kray commission on emergency situations will have to search in the nearest future for cardinal ways out of the critical situation. "If the government sets a price of R120 per kw for electricity delivered to enterprises, this will mean death to the Khrustalninsk mining and enrichment combine, as well as other industrial collectives," A. Akifyev, deputy head of Kavalerovskiy Rayon administration, said without hesitation. "They will never recover." Is there a way out of the lethal situation into which our "dear" central government has pushed Maritime Kray and the rest of the country? Replying to this question, I. Lebedinets, chairman of the kray emergency commission, said that there is only one solution: mobilize all production and human resources in Maritime Kray into an all-people's construction project, which has never let us down in the past, and increase production of our own coal. Nobody will save us except ourselves. No one would object to this idea, but there is catastrophically little time left for its implementation. If we are late... It is frightening to think of the consequences.
