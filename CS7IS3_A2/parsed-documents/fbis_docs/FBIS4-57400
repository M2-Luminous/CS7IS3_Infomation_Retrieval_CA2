Speaking before more than 200 delegates, among them the presidents of 48 CPA's [agricultural-livestock cooperatives], whose production cost per peso does not exceed 50 centavos, Lugo, who is a member of the Council of State, reiterated that, for the economy, that is the useful path to take. At this cooperative and small-farmer event, which is being held in the capital on the occasion of 17 May, Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan spoke of incorporating (Fregatte) irrigating machines as part of the strategy aimed at increasing production. Jordan pointed out, as a serious current difficulty, the acquisition of seeds, as well as the need for each producer to produce and preserve the seeds he uses to grow his crops.
