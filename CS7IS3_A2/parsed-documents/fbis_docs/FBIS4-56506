At several meetings, during which the Political Commission of the FMLN examined in detail the operational and organizational conditions of the new Legislative Assembly, the Political Commission unanimously agreed that the assembly's current internal organization imposes a presidentialist system [regimen presidencialista] that fails to proportionately reflect representation that characterizes this branch of state and that it obstructs the democratic fulfillment of parliamentary and legislative endeavors. For this reason, the commission agreed to seek a consensus with all political parties and their deputies to reform the internal organization and thereby democratize the Legislative Assembly, demanding, among other things, the formation of a board of directors that more accurately reflects the ratios achieve in the 20 March elections. 2. While we held these discussions, ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] unexpectedly had the previous Legislative Assembly approve, at its final session on the evening on 29 April, a reform of the regulation that set the number of board members at 10 and granted a double vote to the assembly president -- now a female president. ARENA has thereby seized a majority that the people did not grant the party by way of their votes. The reform states that under no circumstances can the opposition make decisions within the board of directors without the board's approval. This reform has worsened the assembly's presidentialist and antidemocratic nature. 3. This situation was exacerbated by the decision of ARENA and some of its allies to break away from the consensus achieved at Copaz [National Commission for the Consolidation of Peace] to reform the Constitution on those points recommended by the Truth Commission. The message was clear: ARENA has decided to exert its influence and turn its back on the commitments that emerged from the Chapultepec Agreement. 4. In response to this new situation, the Political Commission, expanded by the participation of elected FMLN deputies, decided by a majority vote not to participate in the Legislative Assembly's board of directors until its internal organization is reformed, and to announce that the FMLN will soon present a bill explaining this. In turn, the FMLN's Political Commission has abstained from approving any individual candidates or lists of candidates for positions within the Legislative Assembly Directorate. 5. Despite this situation, seven deputies from our legislative faction voted during the board elections at the 1 May plenary and two of them, Ana Guadalupe Martinez and Eduardo Sancho, accepted the posts of vice president and secretary, respectively. 6. Consequently, we must make it clear to all that these deputies do not represent the FMLN as a faction or the FMLN itself in the Legislative Assembly's board of directors, and that none of their actions, opinions, or commitments are binding with the FMLN. In this way, the FMLN's representation has been usurped with the support of the ARENA deputies' votes. 7. The general coordinator of the FMLN is discussing this problem to the party's rank-and-file and factions to enable the FMLN to make relevant decisions. 8. The FMLN will remain faithful to democratic revolutionary ideology, popular interests, programs of democratization, and social justice, as outlined in the Chapultepec agreement and the FMLN's Charter, goals, and programmatic platform, and it will redouble its efforts to achieve their fulfillment. [Dated] San Salvador, 3 May 94 [Signed] Shafik Jorge Handal, general coordinator of the FMLN
