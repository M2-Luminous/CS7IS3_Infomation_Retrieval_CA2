The amendments prohibit a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer (``Participating Underwriter'') from purchasing or selling municipal securities unless the Participating Underwriter has reasonably determined that an issuer of municipal securities or an obligated person has undertaken in a written agreement or contract for the benefit of holders of such securities to provide certain annual financial information and event notices to various information repositories; and prohibit a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer from recommending the purchase or sale of a municipal security unless it has procedures in place that provide reasonable assurance that it will receive promptly any event notices with respect to that security.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction and Summary The Commission has long been concerned with disclosure in both the primary and secondary markets for municipal securities. 1 As part of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Congress established a limited regulatory scheme for the municipal securities market. This limited regulatory scheme included mandatory registration of municipal securities brokers and dealers, and the creation of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``MSRB''). In 1989, acting in response to consistently slow dissemination of information in connection with primary offerings of municipal securities, the Commission, pursuant to its authority under Exchange Act Section 15(c)(2), 2 adopted Rule 15c2&hyph;12 3 and an accompanying interpretation concerning the due diligence obligations of underwriters of municipal securities. 4 In 1993, the Commission's Division of Market Regulation conducted a comprehensive review of many aspects of the municipal securities market, including secondary market disclosure. 5 Findings in the September, 1993 Staff Report on the Municipal Securities Market (`` Staff Report '') regarding the growing participation of individual investors, who may not be sophisticated in financial matters, as well as the proliferation of complex derivative municipal securities, underscored the need for improved disclosure practices in both the primary and secondary municipal securities markets. 6 Information about the issuer and other obligated persons is as critical to the secondary market, 7 where little information about municipal issuers and obligated persons is regularly disseminated, as it is in primary offerings, where, as a general matter, good disclosure practices exist. As one industry group testified, today ``secondary market information is difficult to come by even for professional municipal analysts, to say nothing of retail investors.'' 8 1 Both the Securities Act and the Exchange Act were enacted with broad exemptions for municipal securities from all of their provisions except the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act Section 17(a) and Exchange Act Section 10(b). Municipal securities received special exemptions not only based on considerations of federal-state comity, but also due to the lack of perceived abuses, at the time of enactment, in the municipal securities market as compared with the corporate market. Furthermore, until recently, the typical purchasers of municipal securities were institutional investors with financial expertise. 2 Section 15(c)(2) of the Exchange Act prohibits municipal securities dealers from effecting any transaction in, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of, any municipal security by means of a ``fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative act or practice,'' and authorizes the Commission, by rules and regulations, to define and prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent such acts and practices. Exchange Act Section 15(c)(2), 15 U.S.C. 78 o (c)(2). Rule 15c2&hyph;12 also was adopted pursuant to the Commission's authority under Exchange Act Section 2, 3, 10, 15, 15B, and 23; 15 U.S.C. 78b, 78c, 78j, 78 o , 78 o &hyph;4, 78q, and 78w. 3 17 CFR 240.15c2&hyph;12. Rule 15c2&hyph;12 was proposed for adoption in 1988, and adopted in 1989. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26100 (Sept. 22, 1988), 53 FR 37778 (``1988 Release''); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26985 (June 28, 1989), 54 FR 28799 (``1989 Release''). Rule 15c2&hyph;12 requires an underwriter of municipal securities (1) to obtain and review an issuer's official statement that, except for certain information, is ``deemed final'' by an issuer prior to making a purchase, offer, or sale of municipal securities; (2) in negotiated sales, to provide the issuer's most recent preliminary official statement (if one exists) to potential customers; (3) to deliver to customers, upon request, copies of the final official statement for a specified period of time; and (4) to contract to receive, within a specified time, sufficient copies of the issuer's final official statement to comply with the rule's delivery requirement, and the requirements of the rules of the MSRB. 4 The 1989 Release also stated that issuers are primarily responsible for the content of their disclosure documents, and may be held primarily liable under the federal securities laws for misleading disclosure. See 1989 Release at n. 84. 5 Since September, 1993, other initiatives related to the municipal securities market have been taken. On April 7, 1994, the Commission approved changes to MSRB rule G&hyph;19 concerning suitability of recommendations, and rule G&hyph;8 concerning recordkeeping. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33869 (April 7, 1994), 59 FR 17632. These changes are designed to ensure that dealers, before making recommendations to customers, take appropriate steps to determine that the transaction is suitable. Concurrently, the Commission approved MSRB rule G&hyph;37 relating to the linkage between political contributions and the municipal securities business. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33868 (April 7, 1994), 59 FR 17621. The rule seeks to end ``pay to play'' abuses in the municipal securities market by prohibiting dealers from conducting certain types of business with an issuer within two years after any contribution by the dealer or certain affiliated persons of the issuer who could influence the awarding of municipal securities business. On June 20, 1994, the MSRB filed with the Commission a proposal to amend MSRB rule G&hyph;14 concerning reports of sales or purchases, and procedures for reporting inter-dealer transactions. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34458 (July 28, 1994), 59 FR 39803. The proposed rule change is a first step to increase transparency in the municipal securities market by collecting and disseminating information on interdealer transactions. On December 19, 1993, the Commission issued a release proposing for public comment amendments to the rule regulating money market funds, Rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Investment Company Act Release No. 19959 (Dec. 28, 1993), 58 FR 68585. 6 By 1993, individual investors, including those holding through mutual funds and money market funds, held approximately 76% of municipal debt outstanding, as compared with 44% in 1983. The Bond Buyer , ``Holders of Municipal Debt,'' (July 1, 1994) at 5. 7 The municipal securities market is not the only market for debt securities that suffers from information inefficiencies. For that reason, the Commission also is exploring means to increase the amount of information concerning issuers of corporate debt securities.
