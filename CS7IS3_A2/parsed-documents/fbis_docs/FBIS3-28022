The nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula arose from the introduction of nuclear weapons into South Korea by the United States. The United States had no sooner unilaterally scrapped subparagraph 13d of the Korean Armistice Agreement banning the introduction of combat equipment and supplies from outside Korea in June, 1957 than it officially declared through an announcement of the U.S. Army authorities that it would start arming the U.S. troops present in South Korea with nuclear weapons. Then it shipped 280 mm a-guns and Honest John nuclear missiles into South Korea in February 1958, and deployed them near Uijongbu close to the Military Demarcation Line. The U.S. imperialists have introduced over 1,000 pieces of nuclear weapons into South Korea in more than 30 years since then, turning South Korea into their biggest nuclear forward base in the Far East. The density of U.S. nuclear weapon deployment in South Korea is one per 100 square kilometers, or quadruple that in the NATO nations. The United States has not ceased provocative acts threatening the DPRK, wielding the large number of nuclear weapons in South Korea. All types of nuclear-capable planes ranging from B-52 nuclear strategic bomber to F-16 tactical nuclear bomber and nuclear weapons from intermediary-range Lance nuclear missile to back pack nuke of Green Beret commandoes are mobilized in the "Team Spirit" joint military exercise, a test nuclear war, against the DPRK annually staged in South Korea since 1976. Even E-4B, a nuclear war commanding plane is hurled into it. The United States announced the "withdrawal" of nuclear weapons from South Korea at the end of 1991, yielding to the strong demand of the Korean people and the world progressive people for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons from South Korea. But it revealed for itself that its withdrawal of nuclear weapons was a lie by opposing a comprehensive inpsection of the U.S. nuclear weapons and nuclear bases in South Korea which was raised by the DPRK. And the United States and the South Korean puppets spread the fiction of "suspected nuclear development by the North" in order to mislead public opinion. The United States, not satisfied with the deployment of a large number of nuclear weapons in South Korea, is going to massively introduce sophisticated "Patriot" missiles into South Korea. And it openly declared that it would continue to stage other joint military exercises larger in scale, even if the "Team Spirit" were suspended, taking issue again with the fictitious "nuclear problem" of the DPRK. As facts show, the outcries of the United States and the South Korean puppets over the non-existent "nuclear issue" of the North remind us of a thief crying "stop thief "
