FR941102-1-00012 FR941102-1-00003 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 92-ASW-37] Airworthiness Directives; Sikorsky Aircraft Model S-76B Helicopters AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Proposed rule; withdrawal. SUMMARY: This action withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft Model S&hyph;76B helicopters. That action would have limited the applicability of the inspections of the left and right engine input drive shaft assemblies (shaft assemblies) for loose balance weights or cracks to those shaft assemblies of original (or initial) design only, and would have excluded redesigned shaft assemblies from those inspections. Since the issuance of the NPRM, the FAA has received a report of a fatigue crack in a redesigned shaft assembly indicating a need to continue the existing inspections of the redesigned shaft assembly. Accordingly, the proposed rule is withdrawn. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Terry Fahr, Aerospace Engineer, Boston Aircraft Certification Office, ANE&hyph;153, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, Massachusetts 01803, telephone (617) 238&hyph;7155, fax (617) 238&hyph;7199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to supersede an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft Model S&hyph;76B helicopters, was published in the Federal Register on November 2, 1992 (57 FR 49431). The proposed rule would have limited the applicability of AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;02 by requiring initial and repetitive 25 hours time-in-service inspections of the shaft assemblies of original (or initial) design only, excluding the redesigned shaft assemblies from the inspections. That action was prompted by the introduction of a redesigned shaft assembly that was designed to eliminate the cause of cracks in the original shaft assemblies. The proposed actions were intended to prevent failure of certain shaft assemblies and subsequent loss of power to the helicopter rotor system. Since the issuance of that NPRM, the FAA has received a report of a fatigue crack in a redesigned shaft assembly. Therefore, the FAA issued Priority Letter AD 93&hyph;1&hyph;05 on June 4, 1993, to require inspections of the redesigned shaft assemblies at intervals not to exceed 6 hours time-in-service from the last inspection. Upon further consideration, the FAA has determined that the proposed rule to exclude redesigned shaft assemblies from the AD inspections is no longer appropriate. Accordingly, the proposed rule is hereby withdrawn. Withdrawal of this notice of proposed rulemaking constitutes only such action, and does not preclude the agency from issuing another notice in the future, nor does it commit the agency to any course of action in the future. Since this action only withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking, it is neither a proposed nor a final rule and therefore, is not covered under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979).

The Withdrawal Accordingly, the notice of proposed rulemaking, Docket 92&hyph;ASW&hyph;37, published in the Federal Register on November 2, 1992, (57 FR 49431), is withdrawn. Issued in Fort Worth, Texas, on October 26, 1994. Eric Bries, Acting Manager, Rotorcraft Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
