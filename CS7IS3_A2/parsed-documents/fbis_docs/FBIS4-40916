According to the country's laws, the president now has got three days to make his decision. Kranich and Rummo, both from the Liberal Democratic Party, entered their resignations last Tuesday. The Liberal Democratic Party on the same day announced its stepping out from the Pro Patria-led ruling coalition. Recent media reports have mentioned Kalle Jurgenson, deputy chairman of the Pro Patria faction in the parliament, as a most likely candidate for the post of the finance minister, as well as Tonis Lukas, the director of the Estonian National Museum, as a possible new culture and education minister. Both have denied having received proposals to accept the positions. Also mentioned have been Andres Lipstok, local administration leader in the western Laanemaa county, as possible new finance minister, and Tiit Sinissaar, head of the Pro Patria faction in the parliament, as minister of culture and education. Estonia currently also has the position of the defense minister vacant. Official reports name Raul Opik as still the main candidate for the office. The prime minister in interviews earlier has expressed hope that the new ministers will be sworn in at summer emergency sessions of the parliament, due at the end of this month.
