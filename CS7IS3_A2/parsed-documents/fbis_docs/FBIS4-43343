The association's bulletin of the latest economic information, CONGIUNTURA FLASH, said that a reconsideration of the parameters used by the Treasury recently shows a public sector borrowing requirement of 75.4 trillion lire in the first five months of the year, compared to 87.8 trillion in the same period last year. As Industry Minister Vito Gnutti told a meeting of Roman Confindustria members that the Berlusconi government had inherited a "dramatic" situation from previous governments, Confindustria said a condition for turning in the better than forecast results was that controls on expenditure should remain severe. According to Confindustria, the government's forecast of a 10-trillion-lire fall in the tax take due to growth of only 1.3 percent in gross domestic product should be scotched by events since growth should be more sustained and produce a tax take take 3-4 trillion lire higher than the government expected. The analysis suggested that a few trillion lire in savings might also be achieved despite the costs of getting the railways, EFIM [Manufacturing Industry Holding and Financial Company] and similar situations back onto track. According to Confindustria, these could be offset by revenue from privatisation. The analysis suggested that savings on interest payments thanks to lower rates could rise as high as 30 trillion lire, with further advantages accruing in 1995. According to Confindustria, the official forecast of a deficit of 180 trillion lire in 1995 would in fact leave space for a "significant increase in public expenditure." Confindustria pointed out that international organisations are currently upgrading their economic growth forecasts, with Italy moving into economic recovery "with some uncertainty." The analysis said that industrial production rose by 1.3 percent in April, but fell again by 1.1 percent in May. Foreign demand remained strong, and domestic demand is showing signs of new life. But inflation was stuck at 4.1 percent, rather than falling further as expected. Gnutti charged that governments of the last five years had failed to keep their promises as regards reining in the public deficit. He also claimed that the penalty for failing to make radical change in the way the economy is run would be to leave the European "area of competition and growth...for a model of underdevelopment." He also argued against what he described as "still-born" investments, citing the EFIM debacle which he said had run up a consolidated debt of 20 trillion lire for 30,000 employees, giving a final loss of 600 million lire per employee. According to Gnutti, a large part of the public debt of 2,000 trillion lire consists of "so many EFIMs." Confindustria Chairman Luigi Abete told the meeting that Italy's economic strategy must be based on: internationalisation, with a long look at emerging countries such as India and China; fiscal modernisation since the issue of growth and tax equity must be resolved together; and a market in which the rules are stronger and the lead actors stronger thanks to improved capitalisation. He also urged rapid privatisation as a form of value added to competitivity.
