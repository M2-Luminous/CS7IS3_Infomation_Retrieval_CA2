He is to attend a congress of Cape Verdean cadres. Walter Medeiros interviewed him. [Begin recording] [Medeiros] [passage omitted] What are you hoping for from this congress? [Mascarenhas] Well, this congress is a historic event of capital importance because as you know Cape Verde places great trust in its diaspora. We believe that it is an integral part of the Cape Verde nation. I will have the honor of opening the first congress of Cape Verdean cadres abroad, and I believe that this congress represents a strong wish of the diaspora to participate in the development of Cape Verde. [Medeiros] Will you appeal to them to invest more in their country and appeal also for national unity, as is known more Cape Verdeans live outside the country than inside? [Mascarenhas] Obviously it will also be an appeal. I believe at the moment the conditions have been met to enable all Cape Verdeans to participate in the process of deepening our democracy and of laying the foundations for a sustainable economic development. I hope that palpable results will emerge from the congress for the good of Cape Verde and the good of the diaspora. [Medeiros] [passage omitted] Has Cape Verde the conditions to receive its people living abroad? [Mascarenhas] Of course not. At the moment we have about 600,000 or 700,000 Cape Verdeans abroad, which is virtually twice the number of those living in Cape Verde. But I believe that the diaspora can participate, can make its contribution, and we are counting on it. So, this congress will be a landmark in bringing the Cape Verdeans abroad closer to their motherland. I hope the congress will take place and will be a successful one. [Medeiros] [passage omitted] What is the future for a Lusophone commonwealth? [Mascarenhas] I think a rosy future, because it is a community that has virtues and potential to develop. The seven Portuguese-speaking countries are countries with very strong historic and cultural ties. I would even say there is great solidarity and fraternity; these values must be preserved and deepened. [end recording]
