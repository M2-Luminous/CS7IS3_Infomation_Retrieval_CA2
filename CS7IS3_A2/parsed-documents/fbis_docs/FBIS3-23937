Responding to journalists' friendly question why he is being nominated from the Republic of Tatarstan when he is not a resident of Tatarstan, the candidate said the sovereign republic's concerns are close to him, for as a member of the USSR Supreme Soviet he studied the problems of state organization, took part in preparing the federative agreement, and spoke out in support of granting autonomous Tatarstan the status of a union republic at that time. Burlatskiy told the journalists that, as a deputy in the State Duma, he could be useful to Tatarstan in several areas. First of all, he has good contacts in the current parliament and the parties of democratic persuasion. Secondly, by having high international prestige, being in favor with many presidents, and by being a professor at three universities (Oxford, Harvard, and Heidelberg), he could help to strengthen Tatarstan further in the international arena. Noted commentator Burlatskiy really is tremendously popular. He is familiar to many people from television and his articles in LITERATURKA, where he has been a political columnist and the editor in chief. Fedor Mikhaylovich has written political biographies of Khrushchev, Dobrolyubov, Mao, Kennedy, Franco, and Machiavelli... He has been persecuted repeatedly by the powers that be. in 1967 he was dismissed from PRAVDA for articles aginast the cult of personality and censorship. Even before that, in 1964, he resigned from a prestigious position as head of a group of consultants in the International Department of the CPSU Central Committee to show his disagreement with policy based on a revival of Stalinism. Acquainting the journalists with his work as a former people's deputy of the USSR, Burlatskiy said he was involved in drafting laws on freedom of the press, religion, and movement. As chairman of the public Commission on Human Rights and the International Human Rights Movement (Carter's wife is cochairman of the latter), he brought about the release of over 400 persons who were imprisoned for so-called religious crimes. The commission has provided assistance in resolving political, housing, and other problems for 300,000 persons. At present, Fedor Burlatskiy is working at the State and Law Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He has three children, and his wife is a journalist at NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. Burlatskiy's favorite hero is Don Quixote.
