Allaying apprehensions expressed by opposition members on the London talks between Indian and U.S. officials, the parliamentary affairs minister, Mr. V.C. Shukla, in the Lok Sabha and the minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, in the Rajya Sabha made it clear that there is absolutely no rethinking on the NPT issue. Mr. Shukla said there is no secrecy about the talks and it was held in London only because it was convenient to both the sides. Describing the talks as preparatory to the prime minister's forthcoming visit to the United States, he urged the members to ensure that both Parliament and the people strengthen the hands of Mr. Narasimha Rao in safeguarding the nation's interests. Mr. Shukla said that whenever summit meetings are planned, such preparatory talks are held to discuss various points which will come up. Mr. Salman Khurshid said that government will abide by the Rajiv Gandhi action plan on nuclear disarmament; and earlier raising the issue during zero hour in the Lok Sabha, Mr. Saifuddin Chaudhary and other opposition leaders demanded a statement on the London talks, as it has created apprehensions in the minds of the people because of various press reports about the secrecy of the meeting. Raising the issue in the Rajya Sabha, Mr. J.P. Mathur, BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], said that utterances by the U.S. officials have hurt the self-respect of the country.
