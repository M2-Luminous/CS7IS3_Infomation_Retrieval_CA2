In his report from the Bihac region, Mirza Sadikovic says that "the Serbian aggressor forces' offensive on the Bihac region has entered its second month with unabated ferocity. The past 24 hours have been marked by constant aggressor's artillery operations on the outskirts of the Bihac and Cazin communes. Yesterday afternoon and last night, howitzers and mortars targeted the Cazin region more. The situation along the defense lines was as usual: With the activity with Bofors weapons, [word indistinct], (?machine-guns), mortars of all kinds, and an increased sniper activity on Grabez, (Hasin Vrh), and Grmusko-Srbljanski Height, the Chetniks marked last night and the morning so far. In this period, a dozen people were seriously or lightly wounded. The Serbian aggressors acted along the lines of the fighters of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] of the Bihac region, particularly in the Pljesevica region and shelled parts of Veliki Skocaj." A report by the Press Center of the Maglaj Commune War Presidency read by an unidentified correspondent says that "yesterday and this morning on the Maglaj battlefield there has been a strange lull with only occasional artillery provocations along the entire line of separation and sniper activity on [word indistinct] in the northern part of the city. However, the visit by [Serbian Republic Presidency Member Biljana] Plavsic and Mirko Jovic [chairman of the Serbian National Defense] to Ozren, as well as an intensive concentration and regrouping of manpower and artillery pieces around Maglaj, harbinger a continuation of even fiercer attacks on the city soon." A partly indistinct report by a Press Center of the 3d Corps says that "shots fired from the HVO positions in the zone covered by the 3d Corps can be counted on the fingers of one hand. A sniper is heard from time to time, as was the case in Stari Vitez. A mortar bomb fell on (Busovaca) [word indistinct]. These were incidents that failed to seriously threaten the truce. "However, the Chetniks have not been calm. At 2030 last night, they fired seven howitzer shells from (Zmetan) on Travnik. On the Zavidovici battlefield [word indistinct] and Karaula, Chetniks opened fire from antiaircraft weapons. In the Bugojno region, they occasionally acted with infantry weapons. At about 0800 this morning, a general danger alarm was sounded in Zenica. Three shells were launched from the Chetnik strongholds on Vlasic. According to reports so far, two people have been lightly injured. "Prisoners were exchanged yesterday between the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the HVO in the region of Zepce. Seventeen Croatian fighters were released by our side, while 31 fighters of our army left Zepce."
