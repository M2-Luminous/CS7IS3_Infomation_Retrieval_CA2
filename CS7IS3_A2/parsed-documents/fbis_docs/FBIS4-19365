For 45 years such state control of Swedish strategic goods was contrary to the neutrality policy, but is now being implemented as an adjustment to an altered surrounding world. A bill with a legislative proposal lies ready on the government's table for adoption Thursday [24 March]. The new law is called the Law on Strategic Products. Last Loophole Eliminated With that, the last loophole in Swedish export control is being eliminated. Previously, it has not been possible to halt export of Swedish-manufactured civilian technology that can also be used for military purposes, such as data systems or ships, by legal means. In the new law export of this so-called dual use, Swedish technology is being added to the existing legislation for missile and rocket technology, substances for biological and chemical weapons, nuclear technology, and advanced technology controlled abroad. Strategic Goods This is being done by expanding the existing Law on Prohibition of Export of Products Usable for Purposes of Mass Destruction to become a universal law for strategic goods. The high-technology ordinance, which the Palme government introduced in 1986 after several incidences of smuggling and pressure from the United States, will thus be superseded and abolished; it only covers foreign advanced technology. It is proposed that the War Materials Inspectorate should be given greater resources and comprehensive responsibility for control and export licenses based on the new law. Henceforth the Customs Office, which today issues certain export permits, will only devote itself to control. If the number of cases becomes too large for the War Materials Inspectorate, in a later phase they could be given over to the Board of Commerce. With this bill Sweden will acquire the same export controls as the NATO countries, which since 1949 have cooperated on a technology embargo against the East bloc. This has taken place under the leadership of the United States in Cocom [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls], a child of the Cold War, which began its activity in deepest secrecy in Paris in 1949. Top Secret An informal and top-secret Swedish cooperation was in existence between 1950 and 1967 and after the mid-1980's. Not until 1992 did Sweden officially establish contacts with Cocom, at the same time as the countries in the former East bloc. [passage omitted]
