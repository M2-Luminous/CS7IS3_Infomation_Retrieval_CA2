"I am in favour of the civilised approach to the situation which has taken shape around the possible creation of nuclear weapons in North Korea," Lukin said. He explained that the approach in question stemmed from "Russia's determination not to allow the appearance of nuclear weapons close to its border. "It is not a question of our attitude toward aspects of North Korea's domestic policy, but of our vital interests which call for the non-proliferation of nuclear arms," he said. As concerns the North Korean angle, Lukin said that the North Korean regime was probably seeing "its hind [as received] to the world community that it is able to create nuclear weapons inside the country as the only lever to make others take it into account". North Korea is averse to any intervention in its internal affairs, lukin stressed. In this context Lukin thinks it wise for all countries concerned, i.e. Russia, the United States, South Korea, Japan and China, to begin negotiations with North Korea on the provision of guarantees of non-intervention in its domestic affairs. These negotiations should aim to obtain North Korea's agreement to inspection of its nuclear facilities. All the countries concerned should resort to "collective resolute sanctions" against North Korea only if they find out that North Korea is using the negotiations in order to win time for the development of the nuclear arms. Lukin stressed that he regards as a mistake the statement by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Russia is ready to fully or partially annul the treaty of friendship and cooperation with North Korea two years before the expiration of its term.
