He said the Security Council should issue a "very firm warning" to convince Pyongyang to allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to carry out the necessary inspections. The IAEA Board of Governors decided Monday to refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. Speculation has increased that the Council might decide on punitive action against North Korea, suspected of developing nuclear weapons.
