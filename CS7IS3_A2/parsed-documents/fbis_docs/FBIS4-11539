The foreign relations ministers of the Rio Group and the EU constructively and openly reviewed the issues that interest them most. The ministers confirmed that the two regions share common cultural traits and political and socioeconomic values and principles, and agreed on the steps they will take to attain joint objectives and strengthen mutual relations. The ministers underscored the scope and depth that the dialogue between the two regions attained during the past year, especially at the Copenhagen meeting and at the 48th UN General Assembly meeting. Within this framework the ministers approved the following Declaration of Sao Paulo: Common Principles and Values A. The ministers reasserted their governments' commitment to representative democracy and to the state of law, and their firm decision to secure full respect for universal human rights and basic liberties, in keeping with the provisions of international agreements on human rights. They thus rejected any attempts to disrupt the democratic and constitutional order and proposed to coordinate efforts aimed at the strengthening of democracy, which implies especially the subordination of all sectors to legally established civilian authority. B. In keeping with the principles set forth in the Declaration and Program for Action of the World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna in 1993, the minister agreed that the right to development is part of basic human rights, the human being is the central subject of development, and the lack of development cannot be used as an excuse to justify disrespect for internationally acknowledged human rights. The ministers also recognized that democracy, respect for human rights, and development are closely intertwined, and that they all play an equally important role in the strengthening of international cooperation and trust. C. The ministers agreed that sustainable development, protection of the environment and sustainable exploitation of natural resources, economic growth, creation of productive jobs, and a fairer income distribution will encourage full respect for the principles set forth in this declaration and its effective implementation. D. The ministers pledged to help overcome the differences in the level of social and economic development among the nations, and agreed to protect social and labor rights in line with the principles and provisions of the various International Labor Organization conventions. E. The ministers state that the strengthening of the norms, regulations, and institutions governing the Multilateral Trade System, as well as the removal of stumbling blocks to trade and the rejection of arbitrary unilateral actions, are at the center of international trade in accordance with the GATT principles. F. The ministers condemn without reservation every form of racism and xenophobia. G. The ministers reaffirm the key role played by regional integration in terms of the objective to promote political and socioeconomic cohesion. This objective also entails the involvement of all sectors of society in the development process of each country, with a view to making it more competitive on the international economic market. H. The ministers condemn without reservations and labeled as an unjustifiable crime all kinds of terrorist actions wherever they are committed by anyone and for whatever reason, because they endanger and eliminate human lives, offend the dignity of the human being, and attack democracy and the state of law. I. The ministers condemn the production of, trafficking in, and unlawful consumption of drugs, as well as the laundering of the profits generated by these activities. J. The ministers agree in stating that cooperation between the two regions is based on principles of solidarity that are translated into support for social and regional development, including objectives such as fighting poverty and protecting less favored segments of the population, the promotion of effective democratic systems, and complementary actions in economic, trade, industrial, scientific, and technological areas that would be mutually beneficial. In accordance with these common principles and values, the ministers agree in stating that the two regions should strengthen their relations in the future, identifying the appropriate structures for dialogue and for cooperation as well as new instruments that would enrich the current framework of their relations and mutual interest. To ensure a greater impact and coherence, the ministers agree on the need to develop future actions within the framework of a medium- and long-term strategy. To this end, they commit themselves to promoting a broad analysis to define the objectives and guidelines of this strategy.

Ways to strengthen the UN role as protector and promoter of all human rights by ensuring overall support for the high commissioner for human rights, and fighting prejudice and discrimination based on race, sex, language, religion, or any other issue.

The ministers agree on the advisability of carrying out an additional high-level meeting between the Rio Group and the EU on economic and trade matters before the Fifth Institutionalized Ministerial Meeting is held. The ministers stress that this specialized forum for permanent talks has proven to be very useful in exchanging points of views on current events and subjects of common interest, such as: A. To study the effects of the Single European Market [Mercado Unico Europeu], the eventual extension of the EU and other contractual developments of the EU, as well as the Latin American regional integration programs and free trade zones. B. To analyze the effects of the trade measures adopted by the two regions with the purpose of making joint efforts to promote trade. 9. The Rio Group ministers reject the unilateral imposition of political, economic, social, or environmental conditions on access to markets within the framework of international trade relations. 10. The ministers stress the importance of the trade preferences granted by the EU to the Rio Group countries. The ministers of the Rio Group express their conviction that the reform of the Generalized System of Preferences [GSP] should maintain and increase its benefits for the Latin American countries without any kind of conditions or discriminations based on their social economic development, and it must also extend its coverage, further deregulate trade, establish rules of origin with the purpose of promoting trade, and adopt region cumulative laws for all the Latin American countries. The EU ministers hereby take into consideration the terms expressed in this declaration, and express their willingness to examine them. They recall that the real purpose of the GSP has been and continues to be the promotion and diversification of the economies of the developing countries with the purpose of a more effective integration of the international economy. At the same time the GSP constitutes on its own an autonomous instrument subject to adjustment. 11. The ministers promise to adopt the necessary measures to quickly implement the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round of GATT talks. The ministers agree to ensure that the World Trade Organization will bring more openness and legal efficiency to trade norms, including the controversy-solving procedures. The ministers agree on the usefulness of carrying out a joint study of the opportunities that will be created following the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round for the benefit of all economic agents. 12. The ministers also agree on the significance of the UN Conference on Multizone Fish Species and Highly Migratory Fish Species located both inside and outside the exclusive economic zones. 13. The ministers promise to continue to support the different efforts to attain regional integration and cooperation, aimed at the gradual and progressive formation of a common Latin American market within a context of openness and dynamic interaction in the international economy. 14. The ministers promise to encourage initiatives that will increase investments between the two regions. Taking into account the current dynamics of the flow of investments of the private sectors of the two regions, the ministers agree to encourage the signature of additional bilateral agreements between countries of the Rio Group and the EU to promote and protect investments and to avoid double taxation, and to adopt measures to reinforce the protection of intellectual property rights. 15. With the same purpose, the ministers recognize the importance for the European Investment Bank to play a more active role in Latin America. The ministers favor greater cooperation between the European Investment Bank and other financial institutions, especially with the Inter-American Development Bank [IDB] with the purpose of possibly cofinancing regional projects. 16. The ministers point out the importance of the recent decision of global recapitalization of the IDB and of increasing the stock participation of the EU members, as well as reinforcing the Special Operations Fund. 17. The ministers acknowledge the importance and the great level of cooperation there is between the two regions, and agree to make an effort to attain a genuine partnership in the economic, trade, industrial, scientific, and technological fields for the benefit of the two regions. With this purpose, the ministers mainly stress: A. The intensification of cooperation activities at regional, subregional, and bilateral levels; B. The consolidation of the current activities of the training programs, the fast implementation of the "FORCE-RIO" program and the possibility of broadening this kind of cooperation; C. The future cooperation in the scientific and technological fields to allow the participation of the member countries of the Rio Group in the Fourth Program-Chart [Programa-Quadro] of Science and Technology; D. The fast implementation of the AL-INVEST [expansion unknown] program and the expeditious implementation of measures under the ECIP [expansion unknown] program; E) The importance of the quick implementation of the Inter-University Cooperation Program (ALFA) so as to intensify, develop, and expand ties between the academic and scientific communities of the two regions. 18.
