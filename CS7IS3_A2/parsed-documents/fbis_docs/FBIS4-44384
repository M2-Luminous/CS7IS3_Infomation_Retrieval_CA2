The main risk to their outlook now is inflation, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) warned. For the six Dynamic Asian Economies (DAEs) -- Korea, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand -- are growing at a pace barely below their estimated potential or capacity for growth, it argued. Forecasting average GDP growth of 6.9 percent in the six economies both this year and in 1995, up from 6.4 percent last year and 5.8 percent in 1992, it said the downtrend in annual expansion that began in the DAEs in 1987 was clearly reversed last year. OECD projections put Malaysia in the lead with growth rates of 8.4 percent in 1994 and 8.0 percent in 1995. Next came Thailand (8.2 percent both years), Singapore (8.0 and 7.0 percent), Korea (7.0 percent both years), Taiwan (6.0 and 6.5 percent), and Hong Kong (5.5 and 5.0 percent). Noting with a streak of envy that their 1993 growth was "higher even than in OECD countries that were experiencing a recovery," the OECD's semi-annual Economic Outlook said the DAEs' trade performance was boosted by three factors. First, domestic demand growth in China and in the DAEs themselves was "very strong." Second, recovery in the United States and other English-speaking industrial countries increased demand for their exports. And third, the DAEs competitive position was improved by the appreciation of the Japanese yen. As an example, the OECD said the Korean car, steel and telecommunications industries cashed in heavily on the yen's rise. They won large market shares in developing Asian economies, especially in China, which almost doubled imports from Korea in 1993. Pointing out that trade among the DAEs now accounts for nearly 20 percent of their overall exports, the OECD said their forecast brisk growth of output in 1994-95 could keep imports of manufactures growing by some 10-11 percent, the same rates as in 1993. This further boost to intra-regional trade could keep the "Dragons'" combined current account balance broadly unchanged after last year's rise to a surplus of just over 4 billion dollars. The OECD said that over the next 18 months, "the main forces driving growth (in the DAEs) last year should continue to operate, or even strengthen." "As recovery gets under way in Japan and Europe, export market growth for the countries in the area could rise to around 8.0 percent, permitting their export volumes to rise again by 10 percent or so," it said. At the same time, domestic economic policies should continue to have an "overall stimulative effect" throughout the area. Monetary policy was eased last year in most of these countries, helping to sustain buoyant domestic demand. But the OECD said a tightening was probable if inflation were to accelerate beyond the projected average of 5.5 percent for 1994-95. It said an uptrend in prices could be strengthened by such factors as the acceleration of growth "to virtually its potential rate," a high level of capacity utilization, and special developments in some countries.
