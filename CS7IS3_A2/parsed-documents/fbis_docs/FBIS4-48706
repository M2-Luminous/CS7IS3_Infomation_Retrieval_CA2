The incident occurred in the town of Baomahun, 170 kilometers east of the capital. The town was attacked and briefly held three weeks ago by the guerrillas of the United Revolutionary Front. One hypothesis suggested by diplomats was that the guerrillas died after drinking cyanide-tainted alcohol they had robbed from a gold mine. The mine personnel had fled ahead of the insurgent attack. The rebels have been fighting the government of this small West African country since March 1991. Since the beginning of May, apart from the latest 50, 67 guerrillas have died in clashes with government forces, the government says. Sixty-five civilians and 10 soldiers have also died.
