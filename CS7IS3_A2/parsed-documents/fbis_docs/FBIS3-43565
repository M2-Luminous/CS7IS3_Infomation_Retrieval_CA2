FBIS3-43565 "drafr006_c_94020" FBIS-AFR-94-006 Document Type:Daily Report 10 Jan 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 10 Jan MB1001123294 MB1001123294 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE CITIZEN Call To Disband SDUs -- Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 7 January in its page 6 editorial thinks it "would be better if the ANC [African National Congress] immediately disbanded all SDUs [Self-Defense Units] that are causing trouble and phased out the rest. After all, the 10,000-strong National Peacekeeping Force is about to be formed and trained and will be deployed not later than the end of March. We never thought SDUs were necessary in the first place -- and recent events show what an undisciplined and dangerous crowd some of them are." THE STAR TEC Must Intervene in SAP-PAC Dispute -- The death of a 14-year- old boy in a clash between South African Police, SAP, and Pan- Africanist Congress, PAC, supporters in Gugulethu near Cape Town, "has aggravated an already tense situation," declares a page 8 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 10 January. The SAP and Transkei have both appealed to the Transitional Executive Council, TEC, to intervene, and "so it should. But the Transkei demand -- voiced by its military ruler Bantu Holomisa -- that the TEC should appoint an independent commission composed of foreigners should be rejected. The TEC has a chance to prove that it can help South Africans to resolve their own disputes. It must accept the challenge." `Tenuous' ANC Hold on Self-Defense Units -- Patrick Laurence writes in an article on the same page that the "tenuous hold" of the ANC on township SDUs, "some of which are spinning dangerously out of control," is "hardly reassuring, particularly because of the ANC's status as government-in-waiting." Laurence cites "discontent among former Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- MK] members" as contributing to the "threat posed by out of control SDUs. Many former MK members are ensconced in SDUs." The formation of the National Peacekeeping Force and the emergence of a new national defense force "may help by providing work for MK members who want to serve as soldiers in a 'liberated' South Africa." Ultimately, what South Africa needs is 'a political settlement which will make private armies, including SDUs, obsolete." BUSINESS DAY Banks Suspend Mortgage Loans to East Rand Townships -- "The row over the major banks' decision to suspend mortgage lending to the East Rand townships is, like other politically rooted disputes, unlikely to be solved until a government committed to restoring law and order is in place," points out a page 6 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 10 January. "The bank's position is understandable. One third of mortgage loans to blacks are in arrears, with a far higher proportion on the East Rand. Anarchy there prevents the banks from servicing loans or valuing properties. It is unclear is arrears are due to hardship, anarchy or bond boycotts. But nothing will be resolved even by a new government if anarchy persists." CAPE TIMES Call To Abolish Internal Security Act -- The PAC has been "inconsistent and equivocal in its statements on violence and terrorist outrages such as the Heidelberg atrocity," notes a page 4 editorial in Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English on 5 January. They have "only themselves to blame" if there is little public sympathy for the Western Cape PAC leaders who have been detained for interrogation under Section 29 of the Internal Security Act, ISA. However, the use of the ISA is "retrograde and wholly unacceptable." The country should be "turning its back on this kind of thing, which is a travesty of law. It is up to the TEC to put a stop to it. You cannot fight barbarism with barbarism."
