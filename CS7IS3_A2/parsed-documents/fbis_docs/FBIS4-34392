Before anything else, I want to congratulate Ernesto Samper Pizano. [cheers] Before anything else, I want to congratulate Ernesto Samper for his election as president of the Republic. [cheers] We bid him the best of luck; we bid him the best of luck because we want the best of luck for Colombia. We were contenders in this campaign, but the campaign ended. We are no longer divided between Samperists and Andreists today. We are all Colombians, [cheers] and nothing is more important than fighting for the future of our fatherland and liberating it from the politics and poverty of the past. We thank the 3.5 million Colombians who supported us, those who shared our hopes, and those who demonstrated they want the change we proposed. I truly tell them this is not Andres' time, but we are going to do everything within our reach so that this can be Colombia's time. [cheers] I did this campaign independent of the economic groups. I did this campaign against the political machineries, against corruption, and against the drug traffickers. That is why [crowd shouts: "No"] that is why [repeats himself] I assured the country a president who has received money from drug trafficking has no moral right to lead Colombia. We recovered our campaign's moral tone and the sense of decency in politics, and that is what the Colombian people voted for today. That was the motivation behind the struggle of this campaign, and it is the foundation of the new political phase that I am inviting you to initiate with us as of today. [applause, cheers] The people's vote is the strongest of voices in a free society. We have heard that voice today, and we will obey it. We will continue to strive for educational reform so that we can prepare our people for the work that lies ahead in the 21st century. We will continue to support training and programs of improvement for our workers and work-oriented educational plans so as to make new opportunities for the young people who cannot go to a university. We will continue to defend drinking water as a basic right and not a privilege. We hope and expect the 660,000 housing units will become a reality for our fellow Colombians who have no home. We will be determined in our search for peace and security for all our fellow Colombians, particularly the weakest. We will continue to oppose with all our strength the legalization of drugs. [cheers] All of these things were by no means mere presidential campaign promises; they were and remain commitments we hold deep in our minds and in the bottom of our heart. Allow me to tell the 3.5 million Colombians--the 3.5 million of you who supported us--and all Colombians alike that as of right now we begin fighting for these commitments and more. [cheers] We have begun to fight for these and other commitments to make Colombia the country of our dreams. In conclusion, I want to thank you. [cheers, chants] I finally want to thank all of those who worked hard with us in this campaign. I want to thank all of those who supported us in this voyage for change without giving up the faith in their hearts. We want to thank the women, the workers, the peasants, the young people, and all those who campaigned along with their parents as they never did before. I also want to thank the children who campaigned along with their parents as we had never seen before. Allow me to express my deep feelings of gratitude to Luis Fernando Ramirez. [cheers] He is going to be a powerful force in Colombia's future. We have already seen his capabilities and work in the social security reforms. They will reach each and every Colombian thanks to him . I especially want to thank the companion of my life, the mother of my children, [cheers, chants] my friend, and my trustworthy partner. She was with me all the way, touring the country inch by inch. Thank you. I also want to thank my parents and my brothers for their support and confidence. [cheers] They are the source of my inspiration. I also want to thank all the individuals whom I discovered throughout this marvelous country. I want to thank those people who are willing to give everything they can to carry out the hard work we all want in order to make changes. I will never forget the hands I shook during each one of my tours. I will never forget the places we visited nor each one of the conversations I had with you, face to face; with you, the Colombian people; [shouts] with you, the people of Colombia and each and every one of you who welcomed us, who welcomed Nora, Luis Hernando, and Emilia; all of us, in each one of your cities, of your neighborhoods, plazas, blocks, and streets; and above all, those who received us in your hearts. I thank you all. This has been a campaign of the people. It was among you that I found the strength and the reason to run for president [applause], and it is from you that I will keep finding the strength to continue seeking the well-being of all Colombians. Your needs, your hopes are my reasons. I did not seek the Colombian Presidency for its importance or to simply obtain a title. I did it because I believe it is the president's duty to struggle for the people's work. The president has the opportunity to make Colombia a country of opportunities. [shouts] That challenge goes beyond any time or any campaign. A new generation of leaders makes us keep on moving ahead. Therefore, I ask you tonight to keep loving our country, to keep helping our country advance, and together with each one of our actions, let us continue to serve the people and not the powerful. [shouts] That has been and will remain our objective. That was and remains our vision. Not today, but some day not too far away, we will have the opportunity to make it a reality. Thank you. [applause]
