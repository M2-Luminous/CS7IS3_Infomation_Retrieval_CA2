Verbych: "Nationalist Ideas and Elections"] [Excerpt] Delegates from most of the oblast's rayons arrived for a conference of the Volyn branch of the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists [KUN]. Representatives of parties and civil unions which are members of the Prosperity, Justice, and Order bloc also participated in the conference. Serhiy Hodlevskyy, a member of the oblast branch of KUN, presented to the participants an electoral platform of nationalists entitled "Ukrainian Choice -- 94." In particular, the document says that "the Ukrainian state faces a deadly threat today." It also appeals for consolidation of all social forces which support the national and state interests of Ukraine. The platform also demands that officials who are responsible for massive pilferage of national property and bribery be brought to account. The document proclaims a ceaseless war against nomenklatura and Mafia structures. KUN will also fight against those forces which advocate racist, chauvinist, imperial, and communist ideas. Admitting the necessity of privatization and the establishment of a middle class, KUN will resist unfair privatization [prykhvatyzatsiya -- relates to Supreme Chairman Plyushch's mispronunciation of the word "pryvatyzatsiya"]. Ukraine's nuclear potential is considered an essential security guarantee. KUN's legislative candidates base their positions on such values as the individual, family, nation, and state. Meletiy Semenyuk, head of the oblast branch of KUN and head of the Volyn branch of the Brotherhood of Ukrainian Insurrection Army Troops, analyzed the current sociopolitical situation. Speaking about prospects for state building, he emphasized that "nobody will build our state except we ourselves." Special attention was paid to the necessity of preserving unshaken spirits and allegiance to the ideas of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists [OUN] and the Ukrainian Insurrection Army [UPA]. Meletiy Semenyuk condemned the dissemination of leaflets signed in the name of "inheritors of national patriotism." In particular, one of the leaflets signed by mythical political leader "Lebed" and strategist-analyst "Uchytel," deputy centurion of the Volyn Security Century, says: "We call on professional racketeers, whose hands have not yet been soiled with blood, to join the Brotherhood of OUN-UPA Troops..." M. Semenyuk believes that activities of the so-called "inheritors of national patriotism" are aimed at bringing discredit upon the Brotherhood of UPA Troops and KUN. "We will not allow them to discredit our movement," he stated, appealing to law enforcement authorities for investigating those structures which are hidden behind the "inheritors of national patriotism."
