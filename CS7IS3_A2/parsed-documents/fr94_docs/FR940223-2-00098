FR940223-2-00098 FR940223-2-00052 (B) The differences in extreme weather conditions which exist along the Pacific coast as opposed to those found along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. In 1992, The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) identified and mapped all undeveloped coastal barriers of the Pacific coast which meet the definition of undeveloped coastal barriers as defined by section 2 of the CBIA and defined in the revised criteria published in the Federal Register , March 4, 1985 (50 FR 8698). The Service prepared draft maps for the states of Washington, Oregon, California, and Hawaii. The draft maps were released for a 90 day public review and comment period. Separate notices of Availability for each state were published in the Federal Register on April 23, 1992 (57 FR 14846) for Oregon; May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22821) for Washington; July 7, 1992 (57 FR 29883) for California; and August 14, 1992 (57 FR 36668) for Hawaii. Following the 90 day public comment periods, the draft maps were subsequently revised to address any technical errors noted during the comment period. The revised draft maps and all comments received were forwarded to the appropriate Governors for their review and use in eventual formulation of their recommendations as to which areas the Governors felt should be included in the System. With publication of the December 17, 1993, Federal Register notice, the Service announced the availability of the Draft Pacific Coastal Barriers Study and the accompanying maps for public review and comment. This notice announces the continued availability for public review. All written comments received during the public comment period will be forwarded to the appropriate State Governors. By the end of the Governor's review period, the Service is soliciting the recommendations of the appropriate Governors for which areas should be included in the System. The recommendations of the Governors will be forwarded to Congress in their entirety along with the recommendations of the Secretary in the final Pacific Costal Barriers Study and accompanying maps.
