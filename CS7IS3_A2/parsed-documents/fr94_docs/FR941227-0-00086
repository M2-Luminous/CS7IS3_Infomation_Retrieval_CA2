FR941227-0-00086 FR941227-0-00016 Section 1.01&hyph;30 is revised to delete reference to the authority of command, warrant, and petty officers of the Coast Guard to assist in discharging the duties of the Captain of the Port. This authority is now contained in a new §1.01&hyph;90 which reflects that the authority exists to carry out the functions of District and Area Commanders, and Officers in Charge, Marine Inspection in addition to Captains of the Ports. Section 1.01&hyph;70 is revised to reflect delegations of authority under CERCLA to each District Commander to enforce requirements for financial responsibility of vessels and the assessment of civil penalties. Section 1.01&hyph;80 is added to reflect delegations to Area and District Commanders that are currently located in §153.105(a); delegations of authority to the Coast Guard's Chief, Office of Marine Safety, Security, and Environmental Protection, that are currently located in §153.105(b); and delegations to On-Scene Coordinators that are currently located in §153.105(c). The text of §1.01&hyph;80 also includes delegations of functions under provisions of OPA 90, such as new authority for assessment of civil penalties provided in section 4303 of OPA 90 [33 U.S.C. 2716a], and amendments to section 311 of the FWPCA regarding additional authority for inspection and entry provided in section 4305 of OPA 90 [33 U.S.C. 1321(m)]. Section 1.01&hyph;85 is added by redesignating the delegations of authority currently found in 153.107 and revising them with respect to officers under the staff and command of individuals delegated authority in §1.01&hyph;80. Section 1.01&hyph;90 is added to allow authorization of any commissioned, warrant, or petty officer of the U.S. Coast Guard to carry out functions delegated to superior officials under §§1.01&hyph;1, 1.01&hyph;20, 1.01&hyph;30, 1.01&hyph;70, and 1.01&hyph;80, or redelegated under §1.01&hyph;85, within the jurisdiction of the cognizant official. The authority cite for subpart 1.07 has been revised to restore an inadvertent deletion during a prior rulemaking. Section 153.105 is revised to reflect the administrative move of FWPCA delegations of authority to the new §1.01&hyph;80. Section 153.107 is removed; and the text, revised to cite §1.01&hyph;80 authorities, is included in new §1.01&hyph;85. Regulatory Evaluation This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) [44 FR 11304 (February 26, 1979)]. The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. This rulemaking expedites the Coast Guard's ability to respond to discharges of oil and hazardous substances and thereby limits the potential effect of those discharges. Because the changes to its regulations relate to agency management and organization, the Coast Guard finds that under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) [5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2)] notice and the opportunity for public comment are unnecessary. Further, since the regulations are being revised to accurately reflect statutory changes, the Coast Guard finds good cause under the APA [5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)] for the final rule to be effective on the date of publication in the Federal Register . Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act [5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .], the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. This rule does not require a general notice of proposed rulemaking and, therefore, is exempt from the requirements of the Act. Although this rule is exempt, the Coast Guard has reviewed it for potential impact on small entities.
