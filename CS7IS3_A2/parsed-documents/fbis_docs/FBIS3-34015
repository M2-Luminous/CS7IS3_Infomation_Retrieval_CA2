The two rebel sides, John Garang's wing and Riak Machar's breakaway faction, SPLA-United, keep having talks only to go back to the bush and start fighting each other again. They had another go at burying the hatchet in Nairobi in early January. Well, Riak Machar is currently in London and Robin White asked him what the state of relations was now. [Begin recording] [Machar] I think that relations are improving. [White] Has there been any fighting at all since that meeting in early January? [Machar] Not that reported to me, no. [White] So, what happens next? [Machar] Well, we are hoping to have another meeting to work out our relationship in terms of how we could cooperate at the frontline. [White] And when would that meeting be? [Machar] I hope it will take place on 7 [February] if that it is going to be made possible by the Kenyans. [White] That is this weekend? [Machar] Yes. [White] And you will meet face to face with John Garang? [Machar] Yes, we have been meeting face to face. [White] How do you get on when you meet each other? [Machar] We talk. [White] Do you argue? [Machar] Naturally, we had differences and we had to argue them out, yes. [White] What are still the differences between you? [Machar] The first difference, which we have now overcome, is the objective of the movement. Garang has accepted the right of self-determination for the people of south Sudan. The other outstanding issues are the issues on democracy and issues on human rights. [White] That was one of the initial reasons for you breaking away and that you accused him of human rights abuses and of being dictatorial. In fact, since then he has released a lot of people from jail, so has he done most of what you asked him or not? [Machar] Well, he has released most of the people and many others escaped and there are still others in jail. The three Martins -- Martin Makul, Martin Majir, Martin Quigbera -- and Kawaye Makwaye are still in jail. [White] Where are they being held? [Machar] I don't know. [White] The objection that Garang seems to be having against you of late is that he claims that you are not doing any fighting against the Sudanese Army -- the Northern Sudanese Army -- you are too busy fighting him. Is that true? Do you accept that? [Machar] He may be too busy fighting me, not the other way round. I don't think that we are not fighting the Sudan Government. First, look at the strategy of the Sudan Government. The strategy of the Sudan Government today is to take control of the borders, and the borders which they think are viable to the SPLA are Uganda and Kenya, and the person who is at those borders is John Garang forces. [as heard] [White] Garang seems to think that you have some secret deal with the Sudanese Government in which the Sudanese Government will not attack you. [Machar] Well, I don't think there is any secret deal between SPLA-United and the Sudan Government. If there is one let him produce it. [White] The signs are that there is a major offensive on the way from the Khartoum Government, can you withstand this? [Machar] Well, there is a major offensive. It will be the 12th major offensive since we started the war in 1983 and we withstood the previous ones. I think, yes, we will withstand this also. [White] But might you not this time lose? Isn't the enemy -- your enemy -- getting stronger? [Machar] By the way, even if the enemy takes over all the towns which are under the SPLAs' -- both SPLA -- that is not the end of the war. We will quickly revert to guerrilla tactics. [White] Do you think the people of southern Sudan can stand much more? [Machar] They have been fighting nearly now for 40 years. It is because they believe in the cause of the struggle. Yes, it is true that there is a desperate humanitarian situation. But they are not giving up the fight now. [White] But are you quite sure that the people regard your soldiers as friends? [Machar] Our soldiers come from the people. They are children of South Sudan. They have fathers, they have mothers, they have families who are South Sudanese, so they are friends of people of South Sudan. [White] They are not the bringers of death and destruction? [Machar] Not at all because if they were regarded as such then the civil population would not contribute their children to go and fight this war. [White] Won't you accept that things have never sank so low, things were never so bad as now in the southern Sudan? [Machar] Every liberation movement has its ups and downs. [end recording] Well, it seems the government offensive in southern Sudan is, in fact, well underway, according to reports from neighboring Uganda. From Kampala, our correspondent Eppajar Ojulu telexed this report. [read by announcer] According to travelers arriving from the northwestern Arua region, the offensive started during the middle of last week. The travelers included businessmen who usually frequent the Uganda-Sudan border and they told me that during the past two days, loud explosions coming from inside Sudan have been heard from Uganda's side of the border. They said the explosions sounded like long-range heavy artillery pounding suspected rebel positions. I have been informed by usually reliable sources that Colonel John Garang's SPLA faction was the main target of the dry season offensive, which is concentrating on the rebel-occupied areas in the Eastern Equatoria and Western Equatoria Provinces. The sources said that thousands of troops supported by artillery were advancing southwards towards the Uganda border on one front and the Kenyan border on the other. The objective of the offensive is to cut off Garang's forces from their main supply routes suspected to be in Uganda and Kenya. The offensive has become the subject of discussion among the people in Arua, who are yet again beginning to see a new influx of refugees. One businessman, who claims he sometimes goes deep inside the rebel-controlled area, said that the shelling was being done randomly by the government troops. He claimed that three days ago, one of the shells had landed on a church and smashed it.
