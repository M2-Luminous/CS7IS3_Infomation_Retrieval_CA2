However, there was hope for the future, he added. He mentioned in a televised interview that Head of the Georgian delegation, Jaba Ioseliani, had made a statement on the 'ethnic cleansing' carried out in the Abkhazian region of Ghali. Ioseliani also blamed the Abkhazian party for failure of the agreements on return of refugees to this region achieved at the previous January round of the negotiations. A member of the Abkhazian delegation, Plenipotentiary Representative of Abkhazia to the Western Europe, Vyacheslav Chirikba, stressed that the negotiations were hampered by the categorical and uncompromising statements of the Georgian delegation, which impeded the negotiations and adoption of constructive decisions." According to him, the Abkhazian party continues to stand for deployment of peacekeeping forces on the Georgian-Abkhazian border of the Inguri River. The Georgian delegation insisted that these forces be brought to Abkhazia to control all its territory. Speaking on return of refugees, Chirikba said that the Abkhazian delegation had confirmed the preparedness to receive all refugees except those who had committed military crimes against Abkhazians. Chirikba announced that the parties had put forward their proposals on the status of Abkhazia which was to be discussed in a few days. The Abkhazian plenipotentiary representative's press service told Interfax that three main issues were to be considered in Geneva - refugees, the status of Abkhazia and deployment of the peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone. The Abkhazian delegation is headed by Abkhazian Premier Sokrat Jinjoliya. Deputy Russian Foreign Minister, Boris Pastukhov, represents the Russian party.
