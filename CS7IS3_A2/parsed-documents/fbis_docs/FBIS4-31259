"The numbers mentioned are totally unverified," a U.S. Embassy spokesman said, and added: "There is talk about 40, 60, or 70 people, but I only know about 25." The same spokesman said that what actually happened was that the witnesses were summoned normally and according to the law, except for a few cases where certain persons were summoned by the police. These remarks give rise to reasonable questions even among the Albanian opposition, whose leading members claim openly that the shadow of some U.S. secret agencies hovers behind the Albanian Government's actions. Commenting on [Albanian President] Sali Berisha's policy, Servet Pellumbi, first vice chairman of the Socialist Party of Albania, sarcastically said yesterday that "one can find many good things about Berisha, but ideas are not among them." He added: "No matter how crazy Berisha might be, he cannot possibly act alone." As he explained, it is impossible for the policy of Berisha and the Albanian Government not to be guided by other foreign powers and primarily the United States. However, he stressed: "We should know, however, that the U.S. policy toward Albania is not unified. There is congressional policy, State Department policy, and the secret agencies' policy." Pellumbi added that things in the political field recently seem to be changing as the U.S. Embassy is slowly approaching the other political parties, even the Socialist Party. Leading members of other Albanian parties agree with this assessment by Servet Pellumbi and they also maintain that this means a change in the stance of Americans toward Albania. However, this view is not shared by a foreign diplomat in Tirana, who said that the Americans' opening up to all the Albanian parties shows precisely their determination to be regulators of domestic affairs in Albania--and in a broader sense of its foreign relations--for a long time. According to a statement to a Greek correspondent by Servet Pellumbi, the Socialist Party of Albania insists on the path of dialogue with Greece and not the escalation of tension. Pellumbi made it clear that this position forms the basis of criticism that the Socialist Party of Albania makes against the government and President Seli Berisha on the issue of Greek-Albanian relations. At the same time, Pellumbi expressed satisfaction at the cool and reasonable stance maintained by the Greek Government during the recent crisis in the two countries' relations and stressed in particular the fact that the Greek side did not play its card of Albanian immigrants as the Konstandinos Mitsotakis government had done in the past. He added that the latter fact had a favorable effect on the Albanian people and it is something which, as he noted, Berisha himself did not understand. On the subject of the Albanian president, Pellumbi said that he has no cohesion in his policy whatsoever and that he seems to like Europe but his mind is really elsewhere. However, referring to Greece, the socialist leader said that there are some chauvinistic circles from which he believes the Greek Government should be cut off and moreover that Greece should respect the autocephalous status of the Albanian Orthodox Church and not link it to the Albanian state from which it was already separated as of 1928. Pellumbi also condemned the ugly incidents during Easter and stressed that "unfortunately, the two countries' governments became involved in them afterward." In conclusion, Pellumbi stressed that until now the U.S. Embassy in Tirana has supported the Albanian Government's policy. Concerning Europe, he said that "for Berisha it constitutes the font in which he will be pardoned for all the violations of political and human rights in the name of the internal and external `dangers' facing Albania and which nevertheless are the result of the lack of capability of Berisha himself and his government."
