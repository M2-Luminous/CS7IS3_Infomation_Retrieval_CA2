The first condition is that the parties concerned, especially Israel, prove with practical deeds that this process is not being used for maneuvers or compromises over firm principles. One of these principles is that there must be security for both the Arab Palestinian and Israeli sides. This means that Israel should not place the issue of its own security above all other considerations, especially the security of the Palestinians and their legitimate human and political rights. The second condition is that all parties should scrupulously adhere to all the agreements they reach, especially on the timetables of these agreements. As events and developments have proved, it is indisputable that Israel's non-adherence to the timetables of the Declaration of Principles and the Gaza-Jericho Agreement has given the enemies and opponents of peace a chance to try to scuttle the peace process. The third condition is that all international regional and international circumstances dictate the need to speed up the peace process. We say this in the light of the announcement early today that the Palestinian and Israeli sides have reached an agreement on the security arrangements in Hebron. The details of this agreement will be announced later. The negotiations will then directly move to the current bas in the way he talks. Sources close to the talks have stated that Egyptian diplomacy has played a key role in helping the two sides to reach an agreement on the security arrangements in Hebron. These sources have stated that the focal point of these arrangements is the two sides' agreement on a strong international presence after a prolonged Israel hesitation in accepting it. A major issue in during the phase of Palestinian self-rule, lasting until agreement is reached on the final status of the occupied territories, should now be addressed -- that is, mutual security in these territories. Events since the al-Ibrahim Mosque crime prove, as they have since 1967, that it is impossible for Israel to remain solely responsible for security in these occupied territories. The legacy of enmity and hatred between the Palestinians and Israelis, especially the extremist Israelis, is heavy. Events and developments indicate in no uncertain terms that the Jewish settlements in the occupied territories are illegal and a grave mistake from the practical point of view. Those who have agreed to settle among the Palestinians in areas of high population density are mostly ultra-extremists and adventurists. The repressive practices of the occupation forces prove that these forces cannot get rid of their hatred and fanaticism toward the Palestinians. Therefore, the strong international presence in Hebron must extend to the remaining occupied territories, including Jerusalem, so that the final peace agreement can provide for the disengagement of the two sides. In any case, it is somewhat reassuring that the peace process has so far been proceeding on a correct course despite the substantial obstacles and difficulties facing it.
