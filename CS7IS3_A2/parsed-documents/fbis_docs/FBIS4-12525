The meeting, which was kept secret by the Omani authorities, ended yesterday. Diplomatic sources said that the participation of Israeli experts in an official meeting in an Arab country in the Gulf for the first time since the establishment of the Jewish state was behind the restricted reporting on the meeting. The same sources added that experts from Oman, the United Kingdom, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and other countries attended the two-day meeting which was sponsored by the Omani Foreign Ministry. The discussions dealt with the Omani experiment regarding the desalination of sea water and a study prepared by the Omanis to be presented to the meeting of the water committee affiliated with the Middle East peace conference which will be held in Muscat on 27 April. The conferees reviewed the four five-year plans implemented in Oman in terms of building and developing water desalination stations, particularly the major water desalination plant in al- Ghabrah in the area of the capital, in which hundreds of millions of dollars are invested and which is the main source of drinking water for residents of the capital. It appears that the need for further studies, researches, and working papers emerged during the meeting to crystallize Omani and Gulf concern for developing water desalination technology and reducing high economic costs.
