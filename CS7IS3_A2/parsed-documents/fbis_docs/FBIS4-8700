Jovanovic, who arrived in Bulgaria from Greece late on Saturday, has told TANJUG the talks brought to light a shared view that the embargo has been rendered obsolete by developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that it was detrimental to all the countries in the region. Jovanovic, who has ended his visit to Sofia and left for Belgrade, said that there were no questions outstanding or any serious problems between the two friendly countries. Bulgaria and Yugoslavia have a large stock of good will and awareness of the importance of the neighbours and the inter-relations of their interests and fates, which will allow their relations to bloom after the lifting of the sanctions, said Jovanovic.
