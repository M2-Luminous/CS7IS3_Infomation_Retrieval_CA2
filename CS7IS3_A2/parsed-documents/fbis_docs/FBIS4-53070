"With no new policy measures such as fresh public works, I can't say that there will be no effects on the economy at all," Saito told a regular news conference. Last week, the government decided to supplement a 40-day 11 trillion yen provisional budget on the 40 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994 that started April 1. The stopgap budget expires on May 20. Diet deliberations on the full budget, deadlocked due to political turmoil, is expected to begin soon with still lingering uncertainties. Saito said details of the planned supplementary budget is still undecided, but noted that new policy outlays will not be included as in the provisional budget. "That's why we are calling for early passage of the full budget," he said. Turning to tax issues, Saito said current laws do not allow for different advisory panels to the prime minister to form a joint subcommittee, thus denying such reported plans by the tax and administrative reform committees. He also brushed aside reports that some members of the coalition parties are insisting that deciding on permanent income tax cuts alone and leaving offsetting tax hikes would be sufficient measures to take as Japan promised to do only that in its March market-opening package. "I shouldn't comment on things that I haven't heard," saito said. But referring to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's policy speech, he noted, "we are to decide on full tax reform in June and make it into law by the end of the year."
