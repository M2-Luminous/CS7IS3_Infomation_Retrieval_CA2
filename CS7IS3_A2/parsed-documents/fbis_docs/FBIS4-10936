Regretting the fact that the reduction of coca leaf plantations did not take place at the pace established in bilateral agreements with the United States, which undoubtedly prompted some comments on the reduction of international cooperation, Cardenas said the reduction process was slow, not because the new government did not have the will but rather due to the electoral process that had its natural impact on state activities. He added that the structural changes proposed by the government have hindered the fulfillment of those contracts, "but the executive branch's determination to fight drug trafficking is greater than that of past governments." He said the Bolivian and U.S. Governments must negotiate with that criteria to establish the goals of the new anti-drug cooperation agreements and for alternative development. Regarding U.S. cooperation in these fields, he said that no cooperation will be enough to solve the drug trafficking problem the country is enduring. Cardenas said it is necessary that instead of reducing cooperation in the reduction of coca plantations, the efforts for alternative development must be increased. "The people get involved in coca production or drug trafficking, not out of habit but due to the poverty affecting large sectors of the nation." He added that although international cooperation is important for alternative development, the existence of foreign markets for Bolivian products is no less important. He added that if Bolivia finds markets it also will find important partners abroad that will make coca production unnecessary to sustain a more stable economy. Regarding the controversy surrounding the subject of reducing coca plantations, which in the opinion of the industry's authorities increase in a sustained manner, Cardenas said that only those plantations classified as legal by Law No. 1008 should be maintained, "but that surplus plantations must be reduced through agreements between coca growers and the government in a voluntary rather than a compulsory manner."
