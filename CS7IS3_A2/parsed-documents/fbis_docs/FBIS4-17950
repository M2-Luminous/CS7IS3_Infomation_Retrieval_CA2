V. Silin, deputy leader of Moscow's construction department, has become the company's president in place of A. Khazhakyan (who came to the post in 1992 after being managing director of the Russian Commodities and Raw Materials Exchange). The former has taken charge of "City's" board of directors. These personnel changes are subject to confirmation at the annual shareholders' meeting 30 April. The tempting idea of having something akin to New York's Manhattan in the Russian capital was conceived two years ago. Since then an architectural design for the center has come into being, a plan of its transport links has been prepared, and many negotiations have been conducted with possible major foreign investors, of which one has, it seems, agreed to finance phase 1 of the construction operations. And that is all as regards specific results of the activities of the joint-stock company, which has among its shareholders 99 organizations, companies, and other legal entities, as well as more than 17,000 individual share holders. Evidently, such a slow pace in implementing this project which affects the global prestige of Moscow, its government, and Mayor Yu. Luzhkov personally, provoked the justified concern of the city authorities. Deputy Minister I. Ordzhonikidze brought the government's concern to the notice of the joint-stock company's board of directors, after which practical conclusions were made -- A. Khazhakyan was dismissed. The creation of MIBC ("Moscow-City") continues to be one of the city's priority programs. Apart from the construction of a metro line, the clearance of site of the future center, the laying of underground roads, utilities, and main sewers, this work also involves the construction of three buildings. They include an office and hotel complex costing $150 million built by the "Reforma" fund together with foreign partners, a 300-400-room four-star hotel, and an administrative and business block. The city government's patronage will soon be officially recorded in documentary form as a special decree signed by the premier, in which the government's present task is formulated as "participating in the preparation of infrastructure to attract foreign investment." In other words the city authorities are establishing strict control over the execution of "Moscow-City" project, with a view to there being something to show on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment by as early as fall 1997 -- the 850th anniversary of the Russian capital.
