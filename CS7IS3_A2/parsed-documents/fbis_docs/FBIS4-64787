Hardly had he been appointed Morihoto Hosokawa's successor when his grand coalition collapsed, and while he toured Europe in an effort to demonstrate his country's goodwill, his own justice minister, Shigeto Nagano, disgraced him with the most inappropriate comment that Japan never started a war against any Asian country in 1937-38. Indignation soared in China and South Korea. Hata had to call his unruly colleague from Paris and reprimand him, but he made up for this by saying that Japan has caused unbearable suffering in its recent history. Germany's friend did not have to expect any trouble in Bonn. Naturally, just like Francis Mitterrand in Paris, his German interlocutors, Helmut Kohl and Klaus Kinkel, asked him to open up Japanese markets wider than before. Hata could not and would not contradict their arguments, for it is apparent that the sooner Japan facilitates access to its markets, the better will German-Japanese trade relations develop. The Japanese guest, therefore, promised an improvement. But whether he is able (or willing) to coax Japan's stubborn bureaucracy into a more open attitude remains doubtful. In any case, during his talks on the Rhine, Hata appeared as a pleasant interlocutor who is willing to cooperate constructively with the Germans, whom he values so highly, as well as with other Europeans and the Americans. He will have a practical opportunity to do so at the world economic summit in Naples in early July, unless the parliamentary majority at home topples him before then.
