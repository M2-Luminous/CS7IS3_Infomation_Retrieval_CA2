The IAEA team had studied the possibility of leaving some inspectors behind to handle the transport of equipment and samples weighing about 300 kilograms, but decided against it, the officials said. An IAEA official stressed that the idea of leaving some members behind had been contemplated purely because of equipment shipping problems. He said he understood that the inspection work had proceeded without a hitch so far. The official added, however, that he did not know whether the team had carried out all of its inspection plans. One of the inspectors has already gone to Vienna and the remaining six are scheduled to return on Thursday via Beijing. The IAEA's nuclear safeguards bureau will receive a report from the team before submitting its own report to Director-General Hans Blix on whether there was any change in the North Korean situation. The report will help determine the need for convening a special Board of Governors meeting, they said. At the regular Board of Governors meeting in February, the IAEA agreed to call a special meeting if the inspection team's activities were restricted or if it determined that continuity in nuclear safeguards had been disrupted in North Korea.
