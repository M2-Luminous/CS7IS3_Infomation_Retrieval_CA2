The two countries have experienced tensions in the past created by the civil war on the PNG island of Bougainville, on the Solomon's border. PNG military forces on several occasions crossed into Solomon's territory and opened fire on Solomon's villages. Saemala returned here Friday from a United Nations Development Programme [UNDP] funded study tour of Torres Strait Islands, an Australian territory near PNG. Saemala said the UNDP told him it was willing to fund technical aspects of an initiative taken by the government here to seek a lasting peace on the border with PNG. Negotiations on the treaty will start after the technical aspects here are finalised.
