The accord was announced by the commanders after their first face-to-face meeting at the Amahoro Hotel. United Nations troops meanwhile evacuated hundreds of civilians trapped for weeks behind the battlelines to safe areas, after an early morning delay caused by fierce artillery duels and difficulties in obtaining guarantees of security from both sides, UN officials said. Mainly Hutu government supporters were driven in white UN trucks from the Amahoro stadium, in rebel-held territory, to government-controlled areas south of the embattled capital Kigali.
