FR940118-1-00016 FR940118-1-00006 Commencement of Proceedings; Content of Petitions. Section 251.61 describes the commencement of adjustment proceedings for the applicable compulsory licenses. Adjustment is either automatic, as in the case of non-commercial broadcasting, or by petition, as in the cases of cable, phonorecords, jukeboxes, and audio home recording devices and media. The section implements the changes made by the Reform Act with respect to the dates when proceedings begin or when petitions may be filed. Thus, cable rate adjustment petitions may be filed in 1995 and every 5 years thereafter; those for phonorecords in 1997 and every 10 years thereafter; those for jukeboxes within one year of termination or expiration of a negotiated license; and those for audio home recording devices and media from October 29, 1997 to October 28, 1998 and not more than once a year thereafter. In the case of noncommercial educational broadcasting, the Librarian will publish notice of initiation of arbitration proceedings on June 30, 1997, and every 5 years thereafter. Section 251.62 adopts the former Tribunal's rules governing the content of a petition. Period for Consideration. Section 251.63 is an important provision. Although it adopts the 90-day ``cooling off'' period used by the Tribunal to facilitate settlements after the filing of a petition, or prior to a non-commercial educational broadcasting rate adjustment, the 90-day period is significant for other purposes. This same 90-day period is used to conduct precontroversy discovery and exchange of documents (§251.45), and to file objections to names on the arbitrator list (§251.4). The Librarian will designate the 90-day period for consideration by publishing notice in the Federal Register , including the effective beginning and ending dates of that period. Disposition of Petition; Initiation of Proceeding. After the expiration of the 90-day period, and after the Librarian has resolved all motions submitted during that period, section 251.64 prescribes that the Librarian will determine the sufficiency of the rate adjustment petition. If the petition is sufficient, the Librarian will publish in the Federal Register a declaration of a controversy and, at the same time, a notice of initiation of an arbitration proceeding. The same declaration and notice of initiation shall be done for noncommercial educational broadcasting in accordance with 17 U.S.C. 118(b) and (c). The declaration and notice of initiation will commence the 180-day period for proceedings described in 17 U.S.C. 802. Deduction of Costs. The final section of Subpart F, §251.65, implements section 802(h)(1) of the Copyright Act which allows the Copyright Office and the Library to assess their reasonable costs for the rate adjustment proceeding directly to the participating parties. These costs include any administrative services provided under U.S.C. 801(d). 7. Subpart G_Royalty Fee Distribution Proceedings Subpart G is like Subpart F in that it prescribes additional procedural requirements inherent in certain royalty distribution proceedings. There are three compulsory licenses that require royalty-fee distributions: cable, satellite and digital audio. Section 251.70 states that the provisions of Subpart G apply to these licenses, and underscores that, in the case of inconsistencies, Subpart G takes precedence over Subpart E. Commencement of Proceedings; Determination of Controversy. Section 251.71 describes the commencement of distribution proceedings by prescribing the time period for the filing of royalty claims. 6 In the case of cable, claims must be filed during the month of July; for satellite during July; and for digital audio during January and February. Under section 251.72, after the filing of claims as prescribed by 17 U.S.C. §§111(d)(4)(B) (cable). 119(b)(4)(B) (satellite carrier), and 1007(b) (digital audio), the Librarian must determine whether a controversy exists. The Librarian may issue requests for information or conduct hearings to assist in determining the existence of a controversy, with notice of the proceedings to be published in the Federal Register . 6 The procedures for filing claims are described in Parts 252, 256, and 258. Declaration of Controversy; Initiation of Proceeding. Once the Librarian has determined that controversy exists, he/she shall publish in the Federal Register a declaration of controversy along with a notice of initiation of arbitration. The notice is to include a description of the nature, structure and schedule of the proceeding. Deduction of Costs. Section §251.74 is the royalty-distribution counterpart of §251.65; it allows the Library and the Copyright Office to deduct their reasonable costs incurred as a result of a distribution proceeding. These expenses include administrative services provided under 17 U.S.C. 801(d). B. Part 252_Filing of Claims to Cable Royalty Fees Part 252 prescribes the filing requirements for claims to cable royalties. The Part significantly revises the former Tribunal's rules governing the filing of cable claims by implementing a procedural system similar to that adopted by the Tribunal for the filing of digital audio claims. See 58 FR 53822 (1993). Section 252.1 defines the scope of Part 252. Time of Filing. Section 252.2 specifies the time of filing for cable claims. Claims for cable royalties from the preceding calendar year must be filed during the month of July, and no distribution will be made to any party failing to make a timely filing. Cable claims may be filed jointly or singly as the submitting parties choose.
