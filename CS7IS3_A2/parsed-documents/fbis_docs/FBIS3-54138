According defense sources assessments, the opponents of the peace agreement, especially members of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], will continue to attempt to obstruct the political process. The security sources noted that there had been an improvement in Israel's strategic situation and that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] enjoyed clear superiority over its main foe, Syria. Damascus, nevertheless, had not abandoned the military option, and even if the peace process continued to progress at the present rate this could not guarantee that the Arab armies would either cut back in size or halt their military buildup. As for Israel's relations with the United States, the sources explained that in future, domestic economic problems may have a detrimental effect on Washington's readiness to rapidly meet Israel's needs.
