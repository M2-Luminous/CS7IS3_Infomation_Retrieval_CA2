The PLO exploited Basil's death and quickly sent a high-level delegation, led by Faruq Qaddumi, also known as Abu-al-Lutf, to clear the air which has been heavily clouded by sharp differences following the announcement of the results of the secret Oslo talks and tha Declaration of Principles between Israel and the PLO. 'Arafat was not satisfied with this step. He personally participated in offering condolences to President al-Asad to break the ice between the two sides, which has cast a heavy shadow on Syrian-PLO relations. Coincidence has also served Syrian-Iraqi ties -- still the number one example of hostile relations between Arab regimes. Basil al-Asad's death coincided with the convening of a conference for Arab agriculture ministers in Damascus. Iraq was one of the countries that took part in the conference. Observers said Iraq's attendance of the conference, despite the fact that it held in Damascus, was a positive sign of Iraq's desire to improve relations with Syria. An Arab diplomatic source in Amman said: Apparently, Iraq's response to the conference's invitation in Damascus reflects positive signs between the two countries that have been increasing secretly over the past months. The diplomat told SHIHAN that Iraqi Agriculture Minister Bashir 'Alwan Hammadi offered condolences to President al-Asad on behalf of Iraqi President Saddam Husayn. This shows relations between the two sides are developing to some extent. The diplomat pointed out that the Iraqi minister made political contacts with several Syrian officials in Damascus. Other Arab agriculture ministers noticed that Minister 'Alwan missed several conference sessions, and that some Syrian Foreign Ministry officials were seen accompanying him. This means the Iraqi minister was holding talks with Syrian officials regarding developing relations between the two countries. SHIHAN has learned that Damascus turned down a draft resolution proposed by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain calling for an Arab protocol to exchange agricultural products between Arab states, excluding Iraq, in accordance with Security Council resolutions. Sources said Syrian Agriculture Minister As'ad Mustafa refused even to include the draft on the agenda, telling Gulf agriculture ministers that the Arab Agriculture Organization is an Arab, and not international, organization and has nothing to do with commitment to Security Council resolutions. This Syrian position reflects progress toward improving relations with Iraq, which is being done quietly, slowly, and away from media clamor.
