Both sides suffered considerable losses in manpower in heavy fighting -- hand-to-hand in many places -- over the last five days, in which all available weapons and heavy artillery were used. However, the soldiers of the republic of Srpska army have almost completely regained temporarily lost areas and pushed the Muslim units back to their initial positions. Muslim forces fired more than 300 shells on residential areas during the clashes, targeting Priboj and Lopare, said Major-General Novica Simic, commander of the eastern Bosnia Corps. Chlorine-charged shells were even fired on the primary school in Priboj, Simic said, pointing out that Majevica was attacked from all directions and that it was the site of fiercest fighting currently taking place in the republic of Srpska.
