FR940404-0-00025 FR940404-0-00013 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 80 [FRL&hyph;4857&hyph;9] Approval of Tennessee's Petition To Relax the Federal Reid Vapor Pressure Volatility Standard From 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Direct final rule. SUMMARY: In this document EPA is approving as a direct final rule Tennessee's petition to relax the Reid Vapor Pressure Standard (RVP) applicable to gasoline introduced into commerce from June 1 to September 15 in the former Knox County ozone nonattainment area from 7.8 pounds per square inches (psi) to 9.0 psi. Knox County, Tennessee has met the requirements for redesignation from nonattainment to attainment status contained in section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Clean Air Act. Tennessee's petition is based on evidence that the Knox County area does not need the 7.8 psi standard to maintain ozone attainment. EPA believes that further imposition of the 7.8 psi volatility standard would impose needless costs in light of Tennessee's attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality standard. This action is being taken without prior proposal because EPA believes that this final rulemaking is noncontroversial, for the reasons discussed above and due to the limited scope of this rulemaking. DATES: This action will be effective on June 3, 1994 unless notice is received within 30 days that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments. If notice of intention to submit adverse comments is received within the 30 days, EPA will withdraw this final rule and re-publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register . Please direct all correspondence to the following addresses. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted (in duplicate if possible) to Docket A&hyph;94&hyph;07. The docket is located at the Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center (formerly known as the ``Air Docket'') (LE&hyph;131), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460, in room M&hyph;1500 Waterside Mall. EPA has placed materials relevant to this rulemaking in the docket. Documents be inspected from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. A reasonable fee may be charged for copying docket material.
