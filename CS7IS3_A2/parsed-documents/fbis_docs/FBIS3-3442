The Ford-China joint venture, which has been under consideration for nearly two years, was expected to be announced "in next couple of months or even sooner than that," James Paulsen, president of the Ford China operations, said in an interview with XINHUA here today. "We are optimistic that we can put together a good program and meets the needs of the Chinese people and Chinese business," Paulsen said. "We will get the approval we would like to see." Paulsen became the president of the newly established Ford China operations on March 1. With some 60 people involved in China businesses in the Ford's world headquarters here, Paulsen described the principle task of his unit as "to provide one voice for Ford and a single point of contact" with China, with the top priority of exploring manufacturing joint venture for vehicles. He said that since the Chinese government is still in the process of rationalizing and harmonizing China's auto industry, Ford is prepared to fully participate in China's efforts of industrial consolidation. Paulsen noted that in China, whose economic growth is the fastest in the world, vehicles presently may not be affordable to average individuals. "There certainly is a great institutional need for more vehicles," he said, adding that when the individual market for cars develops in the future, "we will be there." "With the volume and expected growth (in China's car sales), there is much more potential than what is already in place there," the president of Ford's China operations said. According to Paulsen, the sales of passenger cars in China is expected to increase from the present 200,000 units a year to 1.8 million by the year 2000. The Chinese market for the car, which carries seven to eight passengers with enough space for luggage, will witness "very very high growth rate," he said. China's vehicle market is as large as one million units a year, with 80 percent of domestic production and 20 percent of imports. Annual sales of vehicles will reach two million by the year 2000, China said. Paulsen noted that a great deal of feasibility studies were still going on in Ford as to produce what kind of vehicles in China. Besides multipurpose vehicles, ford is reportedly showing interest in the market of cargo trucks in China. "We need to look at the market demand and understand what the demand is," Paulsen stressed. Ford sold over 3,000 and 6,200 vehicles in China in 1992 and 1993 respectively, including the Tempo, Taurus, Crown Victoria, Aerostar and Lincoln town car, mostly coming from government purchase. Ford is reportedly targeting China's private sectors for car sales of as many as 4,000 units this year. As early as in 1987, when Henry Ford II became one of the first U.S. businessmen to visit the people's republic, the company showed interests in the development of the automotive industry in China. Its 750 F-series trucks sold in China in the middle of 1979 were the first of its kind coming from the U.S. since 1949, the piece of history that Ford today still proudly recalls. Despite its time and energy in negotiating a joint venture in China, Ford, the fourth largest manufacturer in the world, is still behind the General Motors Company and Chrysler Corp. in locating vehicle assembly lines in China. "Our products are the best in terms of quality and value. They are well-styled, well-designed to represent the very high value for dollar and yuan," which is the Chinese currency, Paulsen said. He said, "our objective would be to participate fully in the (Chinese) market, eventually have a full line of vehicles that would meet the various market needs in China. It takes time." Paulsen, who will be in Washington next week, said, in particular, that ford hopes that the Clinton administration would support Ford's on-going efforts in China. On the Most Favored Nation trade status (MFN) for China, Paulsen stressed that "if MFN is not extended, it will be more difficult for us," calling it "disruptive" which might force Ford to change its China strategy. "As a businessman, I would hope that the MFN is extended. I believe that business prospering in China should help the Chinese people to raise economy and I think that would also help the social situation," he said. Ford's operation in China is now mainly in the form of component manufacturing, technology licensing and joint scientific and technology research. It has dealers in 10 major Chinese cities plus some service facilities. Paulsen, 55, described his first two weeks in office as "very very busy." he will visit China for three weeks in April to announce the finalists for Ford-China Joint Research Fund, with Ford contributing 800,000 U.S. dollars.
