Virgilijus Bulovas, head of the group, said the two-day talks in the Belarusian capital will be mainly devoted to visa requirements for the CIS that will come into effect March 1. Bulovas said he intends to hold several "semi-official" meetings in the Belarusian parliament and the Foreign Ministry. State border delimitation and the problem of the Adutiskis railroad station may be touched upon during these meetings, he said. As previously reported, Lithuanian and Belarusian premiers signed an agreement last September saying that the Adutiskis station belongs to Lithuania, but some Belarussian lawmakers recently began to question the lawfulness of the decision and demand to revoke it. Kazys Bobelis, chairman of the Lithuanian parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, said it is necessary to determine border between Lithuania and Belarus as soon as possible and to start developing neighborly and trade relations. Commenting on the replacement of the Belarusian head of state, Bobelis told Lithuanian radio Tuesday that a victory was won by politicians who advocate closer relations with Russia and whose policy is most likely to differ from that of the previous leadership of the parliament.
