As information from various major summer grain and oil-bearing seed production bases indicates, this year's summer crops are growing well. Especially since the last 10-day period of April, there have been several rainfalls which are very beneficial to the bumper harvest of wheat. Despite damage from drought, waterlogging, and freezing, the total output of summer oil-bearing seed crops is expected to be higher than last year. At present, summer crops are entering the yellow maturity period from north to south. According to experts from the Ministry of Agriculture, this is a critical stage for the bumper harvest of wheat, and it is imperative to pay attention to field management to ensure a bumper harvest of summer crops. How can we do a good job in promoting short-term agricultural production? According to relevant departments of the central authorities, the following five points are very important: First, it is necessary to have a full understanding of the importance of field management during the yellow maturity period. We should seize the opportunity and use every possible means to increase the grain number and grain weight so as to enhance the per unit output and make up for what is affected by the decreased sown acreage. All localities should take effective measures according to local conditions. In particular, they should provide enough irrigation water during the filling period. This is a critical measure for increasing the grain weight. Second, government departments at all levels should strengthen guidance and service to agricultural production. Cadres at all levels should go down to grass-roots units and help peasants solve concrete problems. Departments in charge of means of production, farming machines, oil, and transportation should properly arrange the production and shipment of various means of agricultural production and ensure their supply in a timely fashion. Agricultural departments at all levels should organize scientific and technological personnel to go down to the first line of production and provide technical guidance and pest prevention service. Third, it is necessary to always foster an ideology of fighting against natural disasters to reap bumper harvests. Efforts should be made to avert peril. According to weather predictions, in the last 10-day period of May, there will be two rainfalls and possibly rainstorms, gales, or hail. In addition, dry winds might come at the end of May. All agricultural production areas should closely watch the weather changes and do their best to prepare to prevent various natural disasters. They should also do a good job in pest prevention. Once the harvesting begins, all-out efforts should be made to bring the crops in as soon as possible. Fourth, good preparation should be made for the purchase of summer crops. Governments at all levels should take active measures to ensure enough funds before the purchase season arrives. Departments at all levels should be responsible for their work. Efforts should be made to ensure that peasants will not be given IOU's for crops sold to the government. Financial, grain, and banking departments should work together, pay attention to the market situation, and ensure the pooling of enough funds for the purchase. It is necessary to strengthen management of the grain and edible oil market, and ensure the smooth progress of purchase work. Fifth, while concentrating on the purchase of summer crops, all localities should lose no time in promoting summer field management and summer planting. Particular effort should be made to enlarge sown acreage of summer crops. Relevant departments of the central authorities held that the bumper harvest of summer crops has a direct bearing on this year's agricultural production. All localities should try every possible way to achieve a good result in "the summer harvest, summer planting, and summer field management." They should work hard in the summer to enjoy a good harvest in autumn. In this way, they can ensure a year-round bumper harvest.
