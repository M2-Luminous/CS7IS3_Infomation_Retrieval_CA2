S. Rasshcheplyayev, V. A. Shcherbachev; UDC 621.391] [Abstract]Algorithms are build to evaluate the location of a radiation source which is stationary relative to the surface of the Earth by using the results of combined measurements of differences in distance and their derivatives. Based on the least-squares technique, expressions are obtained for evaluating the coordinates of the source of radiation in the form of explicit functions of the initial measurements. Properties of the evaluations which are obtained and their precision characteristics are studied by using modelling. Figures 2; references 7.
