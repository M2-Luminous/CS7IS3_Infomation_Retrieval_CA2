It became clear on Wednesday [9 February] how sensitively the besiegers react to this language. When signs increased that the West was serious this time, they wanted to withdraw their heavy artillery quickly from the hills surrounding the capital and without demanding anything in return. This is more than the peace mediators have achieved in the past two years. Still, one should not delude oneself now that peace will break out in the foreseeable future. Irrespective of the situation in Sarajevo, a strong Serbian offensive is under way in central Bosnia. Unimpressed by the threats of NATO, the Serbian aggressors tighten the noose in the Tuzla basin, thus threatening about 1 million people. The Serbs are clearly impressed by the position of NATO, which, however, cannot stop the immense war machinery of the Serbs. Determination and good political judgment are now more urgently needed than ever before -- not least out of consideration for Russia's policy that decided to strictly reject a military intervention in Bosnia across all ideological camps. One can hardly assume that the West, after its long hesitation in the Balkans crisis, wants to risk a serious conflict with the pan-Slavic bloc at this particular point. The next 10 days might become a test that will go far beyond the Bosnian issue. Basically, what was to be prevented by all means has now become a political reality: The Balkans has become the biggest burden for the newly defined relationship between Russia and the West.
