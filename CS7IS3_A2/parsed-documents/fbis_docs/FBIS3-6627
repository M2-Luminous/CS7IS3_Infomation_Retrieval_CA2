Being an ex-newspaper reporter, Mr. Hosokawa is said to have polished the words of apology for "the past" on the airplane while he was on the way to the Japan-South Korea heads of state conference. Writing is probably his forte. His grandfather, Fumimaro Konoe, also left the "Konoe diary." "Since the battle off the Mariana Islands centering on Saipan, the government and the people have been overcome with sorrow by the adverse tide of the war. In particular, the pain and anxiety regarding countermeasures for this has not been an easy matter for senior statesmen, not to mention the Imperial Palace. I intend to leave an account summarizing the actions related to this for future reference." With the opening lines of "At Ogi villa on 5 July 1944," the diary thus kept spelled out the politics Konoe observed from 21 June to 24 July 1944. It is a record about one year before the unconditional surrender of Japan. Saying that "All my ancestors have kept diaries and therefore, I must at least do it verbally," Konoe seems to have stated verbally the exchanges with visitors that were written in the House of Peers memos. However, at that time, Konoe was promoting a scheme to overthrow the Tojo regime to contrive an early peace and secretly kept a diary while under surveillance by the military police. According to his close associates, the "Hosokawa diary" is preparation for writing memoirs. That is why it is inviting speculation that Hosokawa has made up his mind to resign when he has done all he can. Hosokawa himself spoke of these aspirations directly after his appointment as prime minister. "I intend to embrace political reform under my right arm, economic reform under my left arm, and jump down from the castle tower." The enthusiasm is strongly felt that if he can cut a way for political reform and economic reform which no one has been able to accomplish, his value as a statesman will remain even if his term is short. South Korean President Kim Yong-sam told Hosokawa at the heads of state conference in the old capital of Kyongju that "the mass media of South Korea are calling my reforms a revolution." Hosokawa, who had stated at a meeting with Mayor Chirac of Paris that "I feel that expectations for me are not the expectations for a politician; they are the expectations for a revolutionary," gave a big nod as if he heartily agreed. It is said that since Kim Yong-sam has changed the meals at government and ruling party leaders conferences to the frugal fare of three dishes of kimchi, some of the ruling party leaders eat lunch in their car on the way there or back. Hosokawa also dislikes using Japanese restaurants and scolded the deputy chief cabinet secretary for having made arrangements at a Japanese restaurant for the noon meeting of members of the political secretaries group. His temperament probably is already that of a "revolutionary." Kajiyama Astounded by Ozawa "In the future, I want to be active as a politician." On 15 November [1993], the "100th day" since the fateful day (6 August) when Hosokawa was chosen prime minister, Seiroku Kajiyama, former secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], who had crushed political reform, was branded a class-A war criminal who caused the LDP to lose political power, and had been confined in seclusion, gathered with friendly Diet members like Kanezo Muraoka and Koichi Kato and proclaimed "the end of mourning." For the LDP, which has lost its hold on political power and is under the complete control of Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], who is taking advantage of the LDP's despondency, Kajiyama's comeback must be like the return of its strong arm. It is probably like the return to the battleline of a leading soccer player who had been red-carded and ejected from the game. Kajiyama seems to have analyzed Ozawa's methods intently. He is amazed by Ozawa's quick attack, saying, "At any rate, he is extremely fast. He anticipates necessary measures a step ahead of time." Kajiyama's return to the battleline also means that the Obuchi faction that seemed to have been emasculated and was degraded to a small faction has jumped out to the front of the political situation. That will no doubt complicate the rumors of political reorganization that have been swirling around Nagata-cho. Political reform has sucked the life's blood of many, such as Toshiki Kaifu and Kiichi Miyazawa. A political reform-related bill that answered the prayers of Hosokawa has passed the House of Representatives, but still is awaiting "the wolf at the back door," the House of Councillors. The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] has the power in the House of Councillors. Even if the House of Representatives has removed the LDP "1955 rule," the House of Councillors can be still under the LDP "1955 rule." If 10 people from the SDPJ in the House of Councillors turn to opposition, the bill will be killed. There is another big hurdle. It is "district division." If the political reform-related bill is approved and an advisory council to demarcate district division is established, there is a view that "district division" will be carried out smoothly because this council is a third party organ; however, since there is an obligation under the Constitution that "district division," upon which the life or death of Diet members depend, be determined by law, they must once more be put before the Diet. Thus, there is a great possibility that political reorganization will occur surrounding "district division." Whether political reform is realized or collapsed, there will be price whichever way it turns. If Morihiro Hosokawa risks his own political life, it will be the crucial moment for the LDP of whether or not the party itself can survive. The SDPJ also is right in the middle of a battle risking its existence. There probably no longer is a way for the LDP to get back political power independently as before. Thus, there are not many ways for the LDP to survive. Unless it would be satisfiedtobe the strongest opposition party forever, reorganization will probably be the only way. It needs to create a "new LDP" with the LDP as an axis and come back to the seat of political power to recapture the power. This road is further divided into two paths. It is the choice of creating a regime that has booted out the detested Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito, or uniting with Ozawa. The bloodshot eyes of the LDP are being directed toward political reorganization, but there have been actions in the coalition ruling party that are in sympathy with this as well. Takemura Acts Fiercely Among them, the actions of Sakigake [Harbinger] Party representative, Masayoshi Takemura (chief cabinet secretary) have been intense. Takemura has met secretly with former Deputy Prime Minister Masaharu Gotoda whom he reveres as a mentor. When Takemura joined the Ministry of Home Affairs, Gotoda, who was the director of the Local Tax Bureau, was the examiner. His friendship is implied in the words "I probably am an unworthy disciple." Incidentally, the one who interviewed him was Yosoji Kobayashi, administrative vice minister of the Home Affairs Ministry. Takemura recollects that Kobayashi teased Takemura, who was already married, asking him, "Did you study for the test in bed with your wife?" There is no doubt about such a mentor-disciple relationship, but the talks between Takemura and Gotoda really smell fishy. "What does Ichiro Ozawa think? Where will he take Japan after he has completed political reform?" The concerns of the two are concentrated on an analysis of the intentions and aims of Ozawa who now is the linchpin of the coalition regime. After the July [1993] general election when the LDP lost its majority, Takemura was intent on having "Gotoda" as the standard bearer. Now it seems that he is endeavoring to enlist the help of Gotoda to complete political reform. When this Masayoshi Takemura proposed a compromise of "275" in the authorized number of single-seat constituencies between the "250" of the government's bill and the "300" proposed by the LDP, no one doubted that the Hosokawa cabinet was resolved to settle political reform by any means. However, the concealed aim of what should be called the risk of political reorganization is hidden in Takemura's "275." "If it is 275, 150 will follow along from the LDP." It is said that Takemura frequently met with boss Hiroshi Mitsuzuka and Masajuro Shiokawa of the former faction to which he was affiliated, and in addition, Toshiki Kaifu and others. He has also been meeting secretly with Yoshiaki Kibe, who is a close associate of Yasuhiro Nakasone and is serving as chairman of the General Council, and with Yoshitaka Yotsumoto, president of Sanko Construction Industries, who has become a supporter of Hosokawa and Takemura. Break With Ozawa and Ichikawa Takemura's concept of reorganization is said to be as follows: "Break off relations with Ichiro Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, add the Constitution safeguard group of the LDP and the liberal group of the SDPJ, and take up political power again." In numbers, it will exceed a majority if a total of 150 from the LDP follow along, the liberals of the SDPJ, the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and then if Japan New Party and Sakigake are added. A force that would still support Hosokawa, or Kaifu, or Gotoda, defend the Constitution, and create a rather stable Japan would take political power. The aim is to distance themselves from Shinseito and Komeito and exhaust themselves in reorganizing political power. If they kick out Hosokawa, it will be a coup d'etat, but since the Japan New Party becomes an indispensable element in this concept, a correct interpretation probably would be a "rearrangement" of the coalition regime. It was indeed during that time SANKEI SHIMBUN wrote in its article titled, "A Matter of LDP Leaders," that Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito representative secretary general, sounded out Noda (Takeshi Noda, LDP chief director of House of Representatives Ad Hoc Committee on Political Reform) about "275." Ozawa was angry. Saying that "It is incorrect to use facts that are different from my own opinion to dilute it," Ozawa shut out the SANKEI SHIMBUN from the press conference along with NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN which had written on the rice problem that Ozawa was aware of the government bill which would conditionally permit tariffication without exception. The expression, "dilute," has been a part that cannot be explained from the context. However, Ozawa's feelings become clear if one reads it as "to dilute the fact that it is an (LDP) scheme." Gotoda himself paid no heed, saying, "I too am a politician. If I were younger, I might do it (be prime minister), but the future will be the age for the generation born since 1935." He probably means that he is no longer interested in participating in the scheme. However, it was just a half year ago, that Ichiro Ozawa, who was still in the LDP, encouraged "Gotoda." It was during the long weekend at the end of April that Sadao Hirano, a House of Councillors Diet member who is Ozawa's right-hand man, had a talk with Sadao Yamahana, chairman of the SDPJ. [Hirano] We are thinking of going with Gotoda. We would like your kind regards. [Yamahana] Really? Hirano immediately met Ichiro Ozawa and reported, "I conveyed to him that we are going with Gotoda." Opening wide his narrow eyes, Ozawa muttered, "You said something really drastic." There cannot be any conflict of interest between Ozawa and Hirano. Ozawa met secretly with Gotoda without delay. There is no way to know what they discussed, but from the circumstances at the time, the following conversation was probably exchanged. [Ichiro Ozawa] We must realize political reform. I am not one who fears disorder, but neigher am I one who particularly desires disorder. If you accept, we will act together. [Masaharu Gotoda] I appreciate your feelings, Ozawa. However, I have a health problem. Let me think about it. Gotoda later sounded out Secretary General Seiroku Kajiyama and others. Kajiyama read that Gotoda had a secret understanding with Ozawa and others and bared his hostility, saying, "Gotoda is ambitious. I will knock him down." Ultimately, Gotoda's heart ailment worsened and he gave it up. Ozawa and others revealed the impression that "After all Gotoda is also a bureaucrat." In the end, he became firm in his resolve to fight, even if it meant spliting the LDP. When the Takeshita cabinet fell and it appeared that Masayoshi Ito would be entrusted as the successor, Ito, although he was interested, bowed to the entreaties of his wife who was worried about his health and sacrificed the premiership. He was criticized as a very stubborn man of Aizu, "the fellow who gave the boot to the premiership," but there was also strong criticism that if he were a politician, he should have accepted it, even if he risked his life for it. There probably was the thought that like Ito, Gotoda was fleeing from the most momentous hour. Nervous Hosokawa It is natural that Ozawa would try to confine the actions of Takemura, but it is said that Hosokawa also was nervous about those actions. Political reform is approaching the crucial moment and problems have been surging up like "tsunami" with the opening of the rice market, recovery of the economy, and raise in the consumption tax rate, but those are issues which must be surmounted whoever takes political power. The collapse of the LDP is welcomed, but the coalition regime must not collapse along with it. Hosokawa and Ozawa are keeping in perfect time with each other. It is said that the two talk with each other on the telephone twice a day. Ozawa's close associate says, "Hosokawa listens to whatever Ozawa says." Meanwhile, reports of a falling out between Hosokawa and Takemura are running around political circles. Takemura does not deny the rumor either; he says, "The Prime Minister does not tell me everything he discusses with Ozawa." Because the chief cabinet secretary has the role of a wife to the prime minister, one is apt to think that they are on good terms, but in reality that is not always true. But Hosokawa and Takemura are very friendly. They have lunch together and come face to face with each other several times a day. There probably is no breach between them, but since Hosokawa "has the habit of changing the people upon whom he depends" (those around the prime minister), the rumor seems to be uttered with some credibility. The fact that Hosokawa has doggedly excluded the Takemura route of groping for a compromise with the LDP is being mentioned as proof of the switch to Ozawa. Watanabe Draws Close to Ozawa It was a shocking event that Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime minister, tried to participate as a nonpartisan in the "General Economic Policy Research Committee" (Takeo Nishioka, chairman) planned by Tetsuo Yamaguchi, who is close to Shinseito. Ultimately, Watanabe decided not to participate due to opposition in the faction, but a picture linking Ozawa and Watanabe by an underground channel has been brought into relief. When Watanabe fought with Kiichi Miyazawa and Hiroshi Mitsuzuka for the post-Kaifu spot, he felt a debt of gratitude to him, saying, "Ozawa was the only one who recommended me." Nakasone, who hates Ozawa, is enraged by the sudden closeness of the two and has warned him: "If you want to become prime minister, break it off with Ozawa." Nakasone once approved recommending him in the LDP presidential election on the condition that Watanabe dissociate himself from Ozawa. Such being the case, Watanabe is suspected of having "an alliance" with Ozawa one of these days, and there is a view that if Watanabe should be routed out of the LDP, the spark of life in the LDP will go out. Some say that is exactly the Ozawa strategy. However, it is also said that the unprecedented strategy of former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was behind Watanabe's decision to participate in the research committee. The story has been whispered with plausibility that Nakasone revealed, "I joined the Sato cabinet as minister of transport, leaping to a spot within sword's distance. Now, I think that I will try leaping to the bosom of Ozawa." It is not certain whether Nakasone was "serious," or that Nakasone, whom Ozawa regards as a "bitter enemy," will be accepted, but there is former Prime Minister Takeshita who never criticizes Ozawa, saying,"We never know when we may join hands again." The LDP, which is being beaten about in the throes of death, continues to spew every possible measure for survival. How will this "picture of chaos" be depicted in the "Hosokawa diary"?
