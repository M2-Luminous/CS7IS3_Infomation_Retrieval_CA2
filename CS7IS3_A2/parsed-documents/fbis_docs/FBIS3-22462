Statistics released by the Department of Health yesterday showed eight new cases of AIDS had been reported since October 31, while there had been two deaths since then. The eight new cases were classified as five intravenous drug abusers, two heterosexuals and one homosexual/bisexual. The two who died were a heterosexual and a drug addict. The IV drug user category now accounts for 168 (45 percent) of those who have contracted full-blown AIDS, while 122 people (32 percent) are classed as homosexual/bisexuals. The figures showed 21,219 people underwent tests for HIV antibodies for insurance reasons up to November 30, of which one tested positive. A total of 77,991 tests were carried out up to the end of last month, of which 1,442 tested positive, an increase of 12 positive cases in just one month. Drug abusers represented just over half of the positive cases, homosexuals 19 percent and heterosexuals 13 percent. The stated reason for 8,991 of the tests was visa requests and one of these tested positive. None of the 1,804 hospital or "occupational hazard" staff tested had a positive result while 96 of the 1,236 in the "children at risk" category tested positive. Up to the end of last month, six babies born to drug abusers had died of AIDS-related illnesses and there were 17 deaths in the haemophiliac category.
