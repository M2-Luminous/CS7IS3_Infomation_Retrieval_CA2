It is the first time that a North Korean official has definitely hinted at the possibility of IAEA inspectors taking samples of spent fuel at the experimental atomic reactor. The North Korean official told a MAINICHI SHIMBUN reporter about the possibility on 18 May. So far, North Korea has refused to allow IAEA inspectors to take the samples of spent fuel to determine if North Korea has diverted uranium for military purposes. North Korea appears to have begun to soften its stand on the issue now that the United States has taken up the issue seriously. Asked to comment on reports that "a substantially large number of fuel rods" have been replaced at the experimental atomic reactor, the North Korean diplomat said: "I do not know how many fuel rod have been replaced."
