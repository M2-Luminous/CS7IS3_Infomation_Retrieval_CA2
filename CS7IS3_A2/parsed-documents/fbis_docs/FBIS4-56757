In an official statement, the Cuban Government stated the election results end an arduous process of negotiations between South Africa's leading political forces, a process that will pave the way to racial equality, freedom, and justice for the South African people. The statement also said the end of apartheid befits the process of profound transformations that took place in the African South Cone following the battle of Cuito Cuanavale in Angola, which effected a change in the correlation of forces in that region of the world. In the same document, Cuba also stated it is willing to establish diplomatic relations with South Africa, to which Cuba offered cooperation and support in the new stage of reconstruction and consolidation of national unity. The Cuban people, the note added, have made the South African people's cause their own and, together with all progressive forces, bids the new government success in the complex and lofty tasks that lie ahead.
