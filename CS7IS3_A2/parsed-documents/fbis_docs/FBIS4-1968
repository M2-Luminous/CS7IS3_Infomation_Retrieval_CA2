The session was characterized by democracy, solidarity, seeking truth from facts, and dealing with concrete matters relating to work. The deputies deliberated and approved Premier Li Peng's government work report and other work reports, and decided on the work principle and tasks of continuing to deepen reform, expand opening up, promote production, and maintain stability. The year 1994 is a crucial one for China in the transition from the planned economy structure to the socialist market economy structure, and one of accelerating the building of the socialist market economy structure, maintaining the sustained and healthy development of the national economy, and promoting social progress in a comprehensive way. This year, a series of major reform measures will be presented, and they will be implemented steadily. It seems that the tasks for this year are arduous, but the prospects are bright. Just as the government work report indicates, it is imperative to handle earnestly and well the relationships among reform, development and stability. Economic construction is the center of all work, and reform and opening up are the impetus for development, whereas development and reform are the foundation for socialist stability and lasting order in the state, and the maintenance of social stability is the indispensable condition for the development of the economy and the smooth progress of reform. All work in China this year will subject to and serve the overall situation of deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability. While strengthening reform, opening up and economic construction, the principle of "grasping two types of work simultaneously, while paying equal attention to both" will be adhered to. The building of socialist spiritual civilization, socialist democracy, and the legal system will be strengthened. All social undertakings will be developed enthusiastically. Efforts will be exerted to elevate educational, agricultural, cultural and art undertakings to a new plane. We believe that through hard work, China will be able to achieve these plans one by one. China implemented the planned economy for a long period, now it is advancing with long strides toward the market economy. Doubtless it will face many difficult problems. In addition, the building of a new structure itself is extremely arduous and complicated. From building to consolidation and maturity takes time and calls for society's all-out support. During the session, however, people could see that China has already discovered problems, and is beginning to look difficulties squarely. As long as the chance is seized, China will be very hopeful. In the deputies' own words, the political situation in China is stable and the opportunity is rare; the tasks are heavy and the road ahead is long. From now on, China's economic development and construction will operate by relying on the legal system, and the lasting order of the state will be guaranteed so that people can live and work in peace and contentment.
