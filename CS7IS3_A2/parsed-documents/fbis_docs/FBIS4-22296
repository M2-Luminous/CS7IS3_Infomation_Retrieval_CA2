Chernomyrdin by ARGUMENTY I FAKTY Editor in Chief V. Starkov; place and date not given: "V. Chernomyrdin: `I Will Not Be Distracted!'"] [Text] [Starkov] Viktor Stepanovich, how do you feel about criticism? [Chernomyrdin] I take it rather calmly. I realize that it is inevitable. I am not against being criticized. And frankly, there is not much to praise me for--this is a very difficult period! But I am a realist. And an optimist. It so happened that I became a big boss a long time ago. What I learned over these years is that emotions at work should be kept to a minimum. I follow the rule: Look calmly and select what is right and realistic. And discard the rest. [Starkov] It so happens that we are meeting and talking at a time of sharp political turns. It is clear now what kind of "mess" you have found yourself in: inflation, prices, strikes, production decline, pickets at the White House... [Chernomyrdin] Yours is not a regular newspaper--it is popular. I have not met with anyone as frequently as you--this is the third time. It is true that it is a difficult time. But when was it easy? Now even those who had absolutely no faith in me are amazed: What is this--Chernomyrdin is still prime minister, as before, and nothing has got worse? They kept saying: Since Fedorov and Gaydar have left, everything will disintegrate. As if I worked "under" them. No, Chernomyrdin keeps working, as before. [Starkov] I talked to Gaydar recently. He said that as prime minister you have three choices. One--to give money to everyone who asks for it. Then you will be the "good guy." Second--not give anything to anybody. That will make you "bad." Gaydar suggested that you, with your typical managerial skill, will choose some third option: You will remain on friendly terms with enterprise directors while at the same time not allowing money to be handed out right and left. [Chernomyrdin] Correct. He worked with me and understands my tactics. Even when he asked, I frequently refused. By the way, I do not have any bad feelings about Yegor Timurovich. And I do not particularly criticize him anywhere. The only thing that irks me is when people say: this is "Chernomyrdin's," this is "Gaydar's," this is "Fedorov's..." We all worked together, as one team, and made decisions jointly. [Starkov] I remember you telling me that you did not want to turn into a politician; that you are an economic manager. But politics drew you into its vortex; it is amazing that you find enough strength to withstand it. In other countries at a time of fundamental reforms the government changes three times a month; you have managed to survive for almost a year and a half. What is this: cunning, smarts, or something else? What is your main secret? [Chernomyrdin] I would prefer not to oversimplify matters. For instance, I have never been afraid to learn, no matter how high a job I held. I learn from everybody. From you, too, by the way (laughs). I take everything that is best, useful for work. I am not afraid to ask something I do not understand. I will never say that I can do everything, that I have a ready answer for everything. [Starkov] Do you not have a sense of panic? [Chernomyrdin] No, I absolutely do not. Yes, things are difficult now. But unfortunately, it is impossible to travel our road without losses. We have to travel it with dignity, without panic. The country, the president, and I. I do not want people to separate us. I do not want to shift my work onto him. I am responsible for what I do, and I will face this responsibility. [Starkov] That is, you do not run to him for advice on every matter. [Chernomyrdin] God forbid; this would be insulting for me. [Starkov] I can feel that today you are on a sort of equal footing with him. [Chernomyrdin] When it is a major issue, I will find the president myself wherever he is and will definitely seek his advice. And Boris Nikolayevich, too, now consults with me increasingly more often. There are questions that only the president deals with; nobody else is needed there, not Chernomyrdin or anyone else. But there also are matters that are purely mine, and I am against others interfering in them. [Starkov] How can the following be combined: reforms and minimal losses? [Chernomyrdin] For instance, anybody who is knowledgeable in economics realizes that it is impossible to increase the production rate when inflation runs high. We have been conducting a tight monetary policy and reached a 12 percent level of inflation in December 1993. With whichever methods--correct or incorrect--we had to bring inflation down, and we did so. The subsequent jump in prices in January was a result of the fact that our society reacts to everything: rumors, any political changes. This causes the ruble rate to drop. Besides, January is a special month: many holidays; everybody is just beginning to get up to speed. In February inflation slowed down to 9.9 percent, and in March it will be 8 percent. But I do not get elated over this. Bringing inflation down is not a panacea. Forceful compression of the money supply does not solve all the problems. We need not only a monetarist, fiscal, so to say, approach; first and foremost we need regulators that provide incentives for people to work. For that, we need the appropriate laws to exist and operate. There should be a normative base for a state enterprise, a private or joint-stock one, a farmer, and a partnership. The foundation, the basis of our life, is still agriculture. The most difficult reforms today are in the agrarian sector. We are criticized for them, and we understand that it is fair criticism. But we just cannot bring ourselves to take a radical step. Of course, God forbid we make a mistake in the disposition of land. We recently held for the first time an interesting auction in Nizhniy Novgorod. Here is the principle that was applied there. A kolkhoz was divided; each peasant got his share. They received the documents, too. One for material values (a combine, a tractor, machinery), and the other for land. Participation in the auction was only permitted with these documents, each person with his own share. As a result, three leaders emerged. They won the auction and began organizing their farms. And each peasant, a former kolkhoz member, decided which one to join, to whom to give his documents and his share. We now want to take this mechanism as a basis, make it part of the national program. We have agreed that if Central Russia--Nizhniy Novgorod and Saratov Oblast, Chuvashia, and Mordovia--feel that this model is suitable for them, let them use it and give it a try. [Starkov] And what do pensioners do, those who no longer work? [Chernomyrdin] Pensioners decided on their own which farm they wanted to be with. They contribute their share. One of the new owners--a young guy, by the way--undertook an obligation to provide each pensioner with fuel and three liters of milk daily. What this means in a village everybody knows--a comfortable life. He leased the pensioners' land. He intends to pay them both in money and in-kind. [Starkov] But he will soon start begging the state: "Give me money, give me equipment, give me gasoline!" [Chernomyrdin] Well, he is welcome to go and buy it. He already has land and equipment today. He can take a loan and pay later. He will have to work well. Otherwise life will pull him under. [Starkov] And then they will be looking for a new owner? [Chernomyrdin] Maybe they will. But they can also hire themselves a manager, even a foreign one. They will pay him, and he will organize production working on a contract, for hire. [Starkov] Did Chubays support all this? [Chernomyrdin] He was there with me and supported it. [Starkov] By the way, Luzhkov was here; he just left. He does not accept "privatization Chubays-style." Whose side are you on--Chubays' or Luzhkov's? You probably have to do a balancing act. Are they not both close to you? [Chernomyrdin] No matter how good I feel about someone, the truth should take precedence in every case. Of course, there is only one Moscow. And it is difficult to fit it into some blueprint, and it is difficult to get adjusted to it. Conditions in the regions are completely different from those in Moscow. Without question, under any circumstances Moscow always requires a special approach. [Starkov] As probably other major cities? [Chernomyrdin] Precisely. Major centers: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhniy Novgorod, Yekaterinburg... Luzhkov insists on conducting privatization for money. Chubays' program is aimed at first completing voucher-based privatization, and then begin it for money from 1 July. Luzhkov already had small retail stores and enterprises privatized. When it came to large enterprises, he came to the conclusion that we should not wait until 1 July; that even right now, if someone does not have enough vouchers, he should be able to buy an enterprise out for money. [Starkov] Perhaps this makes sense? [Chernomyrdin] Chubays' line is correct, and I support him. And how can I not support my deputy anyway! But I also understand Luzhkov: It is an urgent matter. The ZIL [Imeni Lenina Automotive Works] or AZLK [Imeni Leninskogo Komsomola Automotive Works], for instance... Luzhkov is convinced that the money should go into the budget. In this respect I do not agree with him. We should not count on this money. It should go to the same privatized enterprises--for modernization, reconstruction, new technologies. In the final analysis our goal is for the privatized enterprise to have a master. It is not important whether it is one, or 10, or a collective. The enterprise should start working, stop begging, and establish its own channels for both sales and material supply. But at the same time save jobs. And make competitive products. This is what we want. And this can only be done with money. It takes trillions of rubles. This is one side of the coin. But there is also another side. It is important who will buy a large enterprise. The rich are already standing about ready to buy; they are circling like crows. So in this respect Chubays is right: Privatization should be done though conversion to joint-stock holding, through auctions. To do this, means have to be brought together, accumulated, in order to participate in privatization for money tomorrow... We also have to be prepared to sell some enterprises, as they say, "for a consideration of one ruble." For instance, if a plant or a factory is very old, and does not have any prospects. The Germans are doing this now in East Germany, when there is a person who is willing to undertake reconstruction of an old enterprise. We set these terms: No layoffs--not even a single person; replace all technology after five years; for a period of one year continue to produce the current product. If you are willing to comply with these terms--take it for "one ruble." [Starkov] So it turns out that privatization is a multicolored thing; one blueprint does not work here... [Chernomyrdin] Of course. Next we should not be afraid of foreign investors. But we have to start restoring production ourselves. Otherwise nobody will come to us. As long as foreigners see that we ourselves have not put anything into our own production--quite the opposite, put our money in their banks rather than ours--they are not going to invest a single penny. In time, enterprises may be privatized by foreign buyers as well. They will invest their money, modernize them. For us, it is important to have jobs, collect taxes, receive income. So that people who work well can earn well and live well. Foreign investors, if they come along, should invest their money in technologies, housing construction, and pull a number of productions out of the crisis. Russia does not have the money today to do it all on its own. There have been reports recently, including in ARGUMENTY I FAKTY, that Chernomyrdin hands money out right and left. Where does this come from? Let us look at the situation with miners. You cannot say that they are wrong. I do not want to say that only we are right and they are wrong. Unfortunately, we still have not closed unprofitable mines from which we have long been receiving nothing. [Starkov] The situation is similar to that which existed in England under Margaret Thatcher. [Chernomyrdin] Yes, over there the miners were on strike for a year, but the mines were nevertheless closed. I would rather not see the conflict here reach this sort of tension. But there is a program to close 11 mines this year. Money should be appropriated to support those who work there. There should be an employment program for those laid off. Those left without jobs should receive benefits. People need to be retrained. We have built these expenditures into the budget. [Starkov] Still, what are you going to do about the miners now? Their demands are justified. [Chernomyrdin] Wages have to be paid under any circumstances. If an enterprise operates, if people work, if we have not found another solution--we have to pay. But the coal industry workers say that they need 11.8 trillion rubles [R] in subsidies. The Ministry of Finance figured R5.7 trillion. But they are demanding precisely R11.8 trillion! The government decided to increase the subsidy to R7.8 trillion. Let us start from there, and then we will see. I am not saying: You will get nothing, and that is it! But to go on strike to get precisely what they themselves have calculated (although there is no proof that they are correct)--this is wrong. [Starkov] But where are you going to get these trillions? The army wants money, culture wants money, pensioners want money. And you have to give it to them! The way I see it, this situation can drive you to despair! [Chernomyrdin] What we need is an honest, realistic budget. How many versions of it have we had! For the first time now the Ministry of Finance did this immense job on its own. [Starkov] Did you get a budget that is more economic than political? [Chernomyrdin] We agreed at the outset to make as realistic a budget as possible. Enough lies. The budget came out with a substantial deficit. How do we cover it? Some things can still be changed within the budget, shifted between line items. I can see it. A few days ago we received the forecast for this year's prices. It was prepared by the Ministry of the Economy. And we saw once again that we could have approached it differently. In order to get R120 trillion in revenue, you have to work very hard. Not cry or whine. All mechanisms have to work, including the tax system. We have to create opportunities for effective domestic and foreign economic activities. Put everything at stake to make the economy work. As to the R62 trillion deficit, it has to be covered somehow. [Starkov] How? [Chernomyrdin] The difference between expenses (R180 trillion with some "kopeks") and revenue, that is, the R62 trillion deficit, we will cover with Central Bank credits, and the rest--with income from foreign economic activities. We will trade more, earn more abroad, drag foreign currency in here, and hopefully cover this deficit. [Starkov] Now I want to ask you about taxes. One businessman of my acquaintance told me that he has to pay a 113 percent tax if he does everything honestly and by the law. How can he live, how will he develop his own production? [Chernomyrdin] This is a serious problem. Both the president and the government have decided that the tax policy needs improvement; we, on the other hand, have slammed everyone with a 23 percent value-added tax. The tax policy should stimulate production instead of tying it down. By the way, your businessman friend is maybe telling the truth, except that the truth here is somewhat bent. He was talking about the sum of expenses, including taxes. The net tax should amount to 58-62 kopeks per ruble. I am talking, of course, about a theoretical ruble. A person buys materials, pays salaries--this takes another 40 kopeks out of each ruble. Those who can manage on 40 kopeks are all right, but some cannot make it even on 60 kopeks. This is how you get 113 percent. Bad as our system is, it will not permit in principle 92 kopeks out of a ruble to go for taxes. Although it is true that our tax system does not work correctly everywhere. And when we measure everyone with the same yardstick, some do indeed jump over 100 percent. On the other hand, you can inflate salaries so much that no tax system will sustain it. But if you want to have a life of luxury--and we cannot prohibit anyone to have a life of luxury--then, of course, you cannot fit into that ruble. [Starkov] The government recently introduced customs duties for foodstuffs. Do you believe this was a correct decision? Luzhkov says that this will lead to a sharp rise in food prices. [Chernomyrdin] In market economy countries the most powerful lever in the hands of the state is custom duties. Many economic processes can be regulated this way, The easiest thing is to open borders and flood the country with cheap cars, clothing, and food--good or bad. And I would quickly become popular. We would have lasted a year. We have a different approach, however. What are we to do with our goods? We cannot strangle our own producer. This is impermissible; this means death. Such things have already happened in history, when everything was ruined. We need to buy foodstuffs in Tver and Orel... Right now, for instance, warehouses in Orel or Krasnodar Kray are filled to capacity with meat and butter--we can no longer tolerate this. They are begging: Take the products. Of course, the production cost of our product is much higher; not all mechanisms are working here yet. But we are not going to solve all these problems overnight. Therefore, overall we are not going to give up on custom duties. Although some things will be adjusted. [Starkov] So there are indeed some mistakes in this? [Chernomyrdin] Probably. Perhaps we should reduce custom duties on foodstuffs going to major cities--for instance, Moscow. The president also disagreed with higher custom duties on children's clothing. I do not think either that our children are all that spoiled. Let those who can afford it buy imported goods for them. We will not spare anything for the children, until we ourselves learn to live nicely. [Starkov] Is it not going to happen that all these new custom duties will result in even greater price increases for food? [Chernomyrdin] Of course, we are protecting first and foremost the Russian producer, but we do warn them: If some get out of line and begin to raise prices, they will get different customs duties, much lower, and then they will have to compete very seriously with imports. [Starkov] We can see from letters to the editors that people expect calm. The country has been upside down for too long. We need a working period. [Chernomyrdin] The task we have set for ourselves is to calm the country--politically and economically, without clamor, shouting, and emotions. We are not doing it for ourselves. We are doing it for Russia. I could probably convince the president now to get more loans. But this is mortally dangerous for Russia. Therefore, tough measures are necessary. We may make mistakes. But I believe in moving forward, even if mistakes are made in the process. It is better to correct them as we go. If we made a mistake with custom duties--we will correct it. But at least we will know where we have made a mistake, and tomorrow we will not make it. To sit and wait, doing nothing and being afraid, is to get nowhere. Then it is better not to be prime minister. There was all this clamor a year ago: We are facing a famine. We will not be hungry. We are not a poor country. We ourselves have made it poor. Russia, with its immense potential, should not live from hand to mouth. Be rich in fuel and freeze; be rich in grain and starve. True, there are some who want it to happen--for us to be weak, so that we could be taken from any side and dismembered. They do not want to see one whole Russia, a strong Russia. [Starkov] Do you think that some accord is emerging in society after all? [Chernomyrdin] We find understanding with many people. For instance, it is much easier now to work with the Duma leadership than it was with the old Supreme Soviet. I can see that the Duma now is shifting to more constructive work. At least the government now feels its support. Take, for instance, the same budget: I am certain that we will make adjustments to it together, but we will also answer for it together. This does not mean that I want to shift the responsibility onto someone else. But the Duma will know, too, what to ask from us. [Starkov] I get the feeling from everything you say lately that you seem to argue constantly with an invisible opponent. I also feel something between the lines here. Please explain what is happening. [Chernomyrdin] I am disgusted with the hoopla around me. Can you seriously consider that I, in my position of head of the government, would think about running for president in 1996 and waste time on political squabbles?! All you need to do is spend time with me, sit at my desk by my side, live my life, to understand me better. I do not want and do not intend to run for president. And anyway, I consider it unethical to talk on this subject with the live president who has two years to go on his term. And I still have to survive until 1996! Those who do not have responsibility for anything--they can wait. They have time and no responsibility. Nobody holds them to answer for anything; they do nothing other than prepare themselves for the presidency. Well, this is their right. If someone believes that the life of the president or the prime minister is all sweetness and light, that anyone can do it just like that--let them try. Right now we really have to balance on a tightrope. Any wrong step upsets the people. Any wrong decision in financial policy, in economic matters, also makes them nervous. Give a bit more to anyone--inflation will kill you right away. Tighten the screws more--production will grind to a halt, and the entire country with it. First and foremost, I urge everyone to reach an accord. Sometimes I get the impression that someone wants us not to work. But we cannot allow it. And I want to tell you in all seriousness--I will not be distracted. [Starkov] During the sad October events you took a principled position, which earned you increased respect. How do you feel now, though, having your office in this building? Will the White House finally stop being a haunted place? Are you going to move from here? [Chernomyrdin] Absolutely not. We have fixed the White House and are convinced that it will not become "black" again. I am certain that it will become a House of Business People, where important and needed decisions are made.
