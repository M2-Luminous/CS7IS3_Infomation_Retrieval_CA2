Datuk Mohamed Zahir Ismail, speaker of the House of Representatives of Malaysia [HRM], and a high-level HRM delegation will pay an official friendship to the LPDR from 27 to 30 March. The multiethnic Lao people nationwide, especially residents of Vientiane and members of the LPDR NA, are very pleased and extremely exuberant to have the honor to welcome H.E. the speaker and the high-level delegation of the HRM. The visit to the LPDR by H.E. the speaker and the high-level delegation of the HRM takes place after several delegations of the LPDR and Malaysia at various levels have exchanged visits with one another, especially delegations concerned with the economic and cooperation sectors of the two countries. Therefore, it can be said that the visit to the LPDR by H.E. and speaker and the high-level delegation of the HRM tomorrow is very significant and will contribute to strengthening the long-standing relations of friendship and cooperation of good neighborliness between the two countries and peoples of Laos and Malaysia, especially to developing and increasing the relations and cooperation between the legislative organizations of the two countries. The relations of friendship and cooperation as good neighbors between the two countries and peoples have existed since ancient times. The Lao people always follow with profound interest the development of Malaysia. Lao and Malaysian peoples share similar traditions, customs, and characteristics. We cherish peace, self-mastership, national sovereignty, progress, and social justice. We detest aggression, interference, and exploitation of other countries. Nonetheless, our two countries were once victims of foreign aggression and occupation. Therefore, both Lao and Malaysian peoples encountered the same fate in the past. Through the arduous and prolonged struggles for national liberation and independence, the Lao and Malaysian people deeply appreciate the value of peace, freedom, and national independence. We also realize the utmost importance of the genuine friendship and cooperation for mutual benefits in the relations of our two countries and legislative institutions. With regard to the issue of promoting peace, friendship, and cooperation among the countries in Southeast Asia, we are of the view that Malaysia has played an important role in this initiative and has actively carried out activities regarding this issue, notably in initiating a plan to turn Southeast Asia into a region of neutrality, creating the economic grouping of the eastern Asian countries, and implementing the Vision-2020 policy outlined by H.E. Prime Minister Datuk Mahathir bin Mohamed. The success expected from the official friendship visit to the LPDR by H.E. Datuk Mohamed Zahir Ismail, speaker of the House of Representatives of Malaysia, and his delegation will open a new era for the legislative institutions of the two countries to normalize and broaden mutual relations and cooperation and to more frequently exchange visits by delegations at various levels. The delegations can draw experience and lessons from one another aside from the current development of cooperation in various fields between the governments of the two countries. We hope that the friendship visit to the LPDR by H.E. the speaker of the HRM and its high-level delegation will be a brilliant success.
