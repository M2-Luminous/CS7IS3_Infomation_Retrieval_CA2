Marked achievements were made in our province's economic construction, reform, opening up, and various undertakings in society. In the course of organizing economic work of the whole province, our provincial government gained a clear understanding of the situation very early, took prompt action, and grasped its work expeditiously. Governments at all levels did much effective work. The session pointed out: The guiding thought, tasks, targets, policies, and measures defined by our government work report for our national economic and social development in 1994 conform with reality, and can be achieved through our hard work. The session stressed: This year is a crucial one for the establishment of the socialist market economy system. It is also an important year in which we will concentrate our efforts on speeding up infrastructure projects and pushing Jiangxi's economy to a new height. We must correctly handle the relationship among reform, development and stability; seize the favorable opportunity; deepen reform; expand opening up; promote development; and safeguard stability. We must accelerate the pace of establishing our socialist market economy system, and must strengthen and improve macroscopic regulation and control so as to maintain the sustained, rapid and healthy development of our national economy. We must promote the building of our socialist spiritual civilization, and the all-round progress of the society. The session called on people of the whole province to arm their minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, they must unite as one, be of one heart and one mind, explore their way forward, and make still greater contributions to invigorating Jiangxi. Participants in the session unanimously voted for six resolutions by a show of hands. [passage omitted]
