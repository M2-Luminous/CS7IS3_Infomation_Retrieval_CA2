The outlines of a middle-aged, well-educated Rotarian with a good income were pencilled in today by Giuseppe De Rita, the director general of the Center for Social Investment Studies (CENSIS) who also reported that 61 percent of the hopefuls are "second string" politicians, with records of service as members of municipal, provincial and regional governments. As a result of the devastation wrought on the nation's political scene by more than two years of investigations into business and public works corruption, illegal political party funding and other wrongdoings, candidates who are former MPs account for only 17.5 percent of the 4,352 in the running. The head of CENSIS said, on the basis of interviews of 535 candidates, the uninominal system adopted "will not renew the leadership class." In the place of front-rank politicians are those arriving from the second and third ranks, lowering the Parliament to a super-provincial council. "But even more worrying is the barrier to access, which is of two types, on the basis of the census and profession," De Rita continued. "Future members of parliament will form a nobility which will not be easy to replace. There will be a niche, a segment of society which is not the general class, without an ability to govern. I think we will still have to have Ciampi governments which can interpret general interests," said the CENSIS secretary general with reference to the premier, former Bank of Italy government Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, not a member of parliament or a party. According to CENSIS, the arrival to parliament of a "multitude" elected in small electoral districts from along "low-level leaders" will mean a wealth of "micro-lobbies of the old nobility." Back on the figures, CENSIS said 35.9 percent of the candidates vaunts degrees in law and another 17.4 percent degrees in medicine for a line of "total continuity with the tradition in which an elite formed almost exclusively of these disciplines always prevailed."
