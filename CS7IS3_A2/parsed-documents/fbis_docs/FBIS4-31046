The "close air support" was called in by the local UN commander, said Major Rob Annink for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR). He said the Serbs fired seven rounds within five minutes Wednesday afternoon near the UN British base in the central town of Bugojno. One of the shells came down inside the base but caused only material damage. The Serbs fired six more shells and two rockets into the town Wednesday evening after the UNPROFOR command had sent a protest letter to the Bosnian Serb headquarters and evacuated all non-essential UN personnel -- 220 people -- to the town of Gornji Vakuf, 15 kilometers (nine miles) away. The UN commander in Bugojno requested close air support from the UNPROFOR commander for ex-Yugoslavia General Bertrand de Lapresle and special UN envoy Yasushi Akashi, Annink said. He said De Lapresle and Akashi authorized the flights at 8:50 P.M. (1850 GMT), while the Serb attacks were still under way. Shortly before that, UNPROFOR Chief-of-Staff in Bosnia General Adrian Van Baal called his Serb counterpart, General Manojlo Milovanovic, "discussing with him the possibility of close air support," Annink said. The UN planes were in the air over Bugojno and saw the tanks but did not use force because "they were not sure these were the tanks that were firing into the town," the spokesman said. But the attacks stopped a short time later, with Milovanovic confirming the shelling was over in a second telehphone call to Van Baal. It was the second time in a week that the threat of close air support prompted an end to a Serb attack on UNPROFOR facilities. The other incident happened Tuesday [31 May] in the northern town of Tuzla, a UN safe area, when the local UN commander asked for close air support after Serbs shelled the Tuzla air base. The flights were not authorized in that case because the Serb shelling stopped after a phone conversation between Van Baal and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. Annink said the two incidents showed "that close air support is a good means of deterrence of attacks."
