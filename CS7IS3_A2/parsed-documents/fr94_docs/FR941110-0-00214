FR941110-0-00214 FR941110-0-00016 Response: We are not adopting this recommendation because we believe that there may be instances in which termination is necessary despite the fact that it may cause hardship to residents. Usually, HCFA and the State will impose alternative remedies prior to terminating a facility, including a mandatory denial of payment for new admissions remedy imposed at the 3rd month; however, there may be instances when this is not possible. For example, a facility could refuse to allow access to the surveyors, or could refuse to submit a plan of correction. A facility might also remain out of substantial compliance with requirements after a 6-month period of correction, at which time the Act would no longer authorize continued payment, despite hardships to the residents. We believe that in those cases in which termination becomes necessary, the termination is for the ultimate benefit of the residents to assure that they receive the care to which they are entitled. Comment: A few commenters suggested that States should be allowed the discretion to develop their own enforcement systems. Response: The enforcement scheme delineated at §488.408, Selection of Remedies, is a model that States must adopt. States have the authority granted them under section 1919(h)(2)(A) of the Act to specify their own criteria as to when and how to apply each of the remedies provided by the Act. Moreover, States are authorized to develop alternative remedies, in accordance with section 1919(h)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act, and we encourage them to do so. Section 488.454␣Duration of Remedies Comment: In the proposed rule, we said that alternative remedies would continue until HCFA or the State determines that the facility has corrected all deficiencies, until HCFA or the State terminates the provider agreement, and until HCFA discontinues FFP. This statement included a typographical error (``and'' was used instead of ``or'') that changed the meaning of the statement. We meant to say that alternative remedies would continue until HCFA or the State determines that the facility has corrected all deficiencies, until HCFA or the State terminates the provider agreement, or until HCFA discontinues FFP. Some commenters expressed concern over when deficiencies are considered to be corrected: •One said that it is not clear whether compliance is considered achieved when procedures for alleviating the problem are in place, or when the actual problem no longer exists. •One said that once the facility has notified HCFA that a deficiency has been corrected, penalties should be suspended immediately until the survey team is able to return to the facility to alleviate a possible financial burden on the facility. •Another said that the State should be required to do a follow-up within a specified period of time, and, if it fails to do so, the remedy should be lifted automatically. A number of commenters said that the duration of alternative remedies should be linked solely to the deficiencies that led to their imposition, not to the correction of all deficiencies. They said that consideration should be given for significant progress and substantial compliance, suggesting that remedies should be lifted as soon as the facility corrects all deficiencies that led to the imposition of the remedy. One commenter suggested that even if a deficiency remains uncorrected, the remedy should be lifted if the scope and severity combination is brought down to a level that does not authorize the remedy. Response: Sections 1819(h)(3) and 1919(h)(4) of the Act specifically state that the denial of payment sanction ends when HCFA or the State determines that the facility is in ``substantial compliance'' with program requirements. In this final rule, we are extending this principle to all other alternative remedies as well. The determination that the facility is in substantial compliance may be made either through a survey team's revisit, or, through some other review, if HCFA or the State, based on credible evidence which can be verified without an on-site visit, determines that at least substantial compliance has been achieved. However, the Act, at sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D), and at sections 1819(h)(2)(B) and 1919(h)(2)(A)(iii) provides for certain additional qualifications as to when remedies are lifted, and we are incorporating them in the regulation as follows: •In the case of temporary management, and in the cases of denial of payment and State monitoring imposed because of repeated substandard quality of care, the remedy continues in effect until the facility has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the State or HCFA, that it is in substantial compliance, and that it is capable of remaining in substantial compliance. (See §488.414) In addition, with respect to the duration of all other remedies, we state in this final regulation they remain in effect until_ •A revisit confirms that the facility has achieved substantial compliance; •The date HCFA or the State, based on credible written evidence which can be verified without an on-site visit, determines that the facility has achieved substantial compliance; or •HCFA or the State terminates the provider agreement. In accordance with §488.430(i)(7), if a facility can show that substantial compliance was achieved on a date earlier than a revisit by a survey team or before the State or HCFA receives or examines acceptable credible evidence, the remedies cease to apply as of that date.
