The conversation was initiated by the U.S. An aide of the Russian Defense Minister, Yelena Agapova, told Interfax that Grachev had confirmed his position on NATO air attacks against the Serb positions in Gorazde considering them unreasonable. Grachev stressed that the civilian population would suffer the most during such actions. Grachev put forward several proposals concerning a settlement in Bosnia. In particular, he considered it necessary to refrain from any more air attacks since this could make the conflict uncontrollable and lead to a deterioration in the situation. Grachev proposed to strengthen the UN peacekeeping contingency in Gorazde and to take measures in order to prevent arms deliveries to the conflicting parties. He emphasized that the population must be regularly provided with humanitarian aid.
