Our people reached the point where they could stand the dictatorship of the shah's puppet government no longer and rose up and succeeded in toppling it with their magnificent revolution of 11 February 1979. The objective was to establish freedom, independence, and the peoples' sovereignty over the country's capital and national resources so they would be used for the prosperity and happiness of the people of Iran. They also wanted equal opportunity for Iranian youth so they would grow in a society based on justice and the rule of law. [passage omitted] In truth, how many ordeals we have endured! There is no doubt that regardless of how much we speak of the cruelty and crimes of Khomeyni, his treachery and destruction, it still does not do it justice. The destruction of the social structure, and of institutions of economic development can be appraised on the basis of statistics regarding the Khomeyni era. We have regressed by 50 years and perhaps we have lost the opportunity for growth and development to the same extent. Can we even truthfully know at what juncture Iran and its people stand? Certainly not. Khomeyni's crimes and treachery are, of course, limitless. [words indistinct] For all these 15 years, the conditions in Iran have been like the two sides of a coin. We have always been and still are in the crucible of a test--a contest for the existence or destruction of a nation, one historic for our great nation. In this turbulent era of upheaval, [words indistinct]. On the one side of the coin is the reality of the tyranny and devastation inflicted by the Khomeyni regime. On the other side of the coin is the sacrificial resistance of a wounded nation, unprecedented in today's world, without any exaggeration. The passage of time will highlight both sides of the coin clearly and more precisely and will continue to do so. [passage omitted] Compatriots, if we view in retrospect the dimensions of the treachery and destruction of the Khomeyni regime, we were the ones in the past, the Iranian resistance who [words indistinct]. The performance of the clerics is so black and disgraceful that they are forced to admit it themselves or to complain about domestic shortages which in some way come about during the course of their domestic strife and tussling. In any case, the regime has itself divulged the extent of the devastation it has caused. The dimensions of the economic bankruptcy of the regime is such that they themselves state openly that all the oil income for the next year will be less than the amount of the arrears on foreign debts. The estimated income from oil sales is less than or [words indistinct] the calculated foreign debts of the regime is approximately (?$50) billion. [passage omitted] Details of the tortures inflicted by the Khomeyni regime cannot be covered in this brief speech. Only after these filthy fiends are toppled will the goings on in their torture chambers be revealed. Hands amputated, eyes gouged out, stonings to death, people hurled from heights -- these are only a few (?examples) of the 15 years of heinous atrocities perpetrated by the Khomeyni regime. As regards thievery, pillage, misappropriating public property, depositing oil income in private accounts, the clerics have (?surpassed) criminals. [passage omitted] The people of Zahedan, Mashhad, and Arak [words indistinct] rose up against the brutal clerics, demanding the freedom of the people. The regime's agents are becoming helpless in the face of these cities and their residents. At the same time the axis of the sources of emulation and the leadership of the regime is atrophying and presents a decrepit and tattered (?image) more than ever before and is becoming weaker and weaker. According to Khomeyni, the Velayat-e Faqih should be a source of emulation before anything else. We heard that the head of the regime's judiciary and its executions, the cleric Yazdi, announced that [words indistinct] and they can express support but not intervene in judicial affairs. The sources of emulation can speak on the (?minor points) of how to offer prayers, but they should not enter politics. How strange that the fate of the Khomeyni regime is such that God has inflicted his curse on them and each one says something different and thus appears more and more ludicrous. One day Khomeyni said that we would fight the war for 20 years, until victory; Jerusalem through Karbala'! What spurious slogans! Later he said: I made a mistake and I have taken the chalice of poison! [passage indistinct] The people and the popular forces should know that [words indistinct] that the elite of Iran's offspring are in the ranks of the National Liberation Army and are endowed with the essence of heroism and combat capabilities. They have always said that this regime must be toppled. God willing, it will be, under the aegis of (?their efforts).
