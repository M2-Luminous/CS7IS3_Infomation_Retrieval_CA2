This visit, which is the first ever by a head of the Albanian state, is an extremely important event in the relations between the two countries, relations that, in an interview granted to us before he had left his country, President Berisha termed as friendly. During the visit the Friendship and Cooperation Treaty between Romania and Albania will be signed, as well as other conventions intended to establish, as President Berisha said, the legal basis for our close cooperation. The Albanian president is accompanied by Finance Minister Piro Dishnica, Maksim Konomi, chairman of the Science and Technology Committee, and other officials. Upon his arrival, the president of Albania was met by a honor mission headed by Dan Mircea Popescu, state minister and labor and social protection minister. The official reception of President Berisha by Romanian President Ion Iliescu will take place tomorrow morning at Cotroceni Palace.
