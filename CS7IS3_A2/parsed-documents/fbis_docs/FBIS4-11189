It is a day when the Salvadoran people, with their vote, support -- necessary support -- marking the path that El Salvador must follow. In this sense, the democratic process is being consolidated. Peace is also being consolidated. We are attaining that blessed stability El Salvador needs for development and progress and to provide the help we need, the help thousands upon thousands of Salvadoran brothers need. I wish to invite the Salvadoran people to cast their vote. Let us express and consolidate our strongest wishes for the consolidation of democracy and peace. This process will be part of our history. It is a historical process in which, for the first time, Salvadorans who had never believed or participated in the democratic process are now participating. This participation has made these elections historical and the process has become historical. El Salvador is setting new standards. El Salvador is setting new standards for plural participation. We are establishing pluralism, which is possible with this democracy we are building, to which each of us are contributing. I wish to ask the people to vote. Only by voting can we ensure the future of our children. Only with our vote can we ensure progress, welfare, development, and improved standards of living so greatly needed in El Salvador. Only in this manner can we ensure better and clearer institutions for the good of all Salvadorans. I can see that all is going well. The guidelines established by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal are working. The people are finding that voting is much easier today. The voting tables have been set up in alphabetical order. Getting information is much easier today. No one should refrain from casting his vote. We must all express our sovereign will. It is not possible to refrain from participating; it is not possible to remain isolated; it is not possible to refrain from voting when it is our marvelous duty to express our wishes. Let the countries and peoples see the democracy the Salvadorans are proudly building. Onward, fellow countrymen. Onward, Salvadoran people. Let us all vote and express our sovereign will. Thank you for this opportunity you have given me to call on the people and to tell them that all is going nicely, and we hope it will remain so. We hope there will be nothing for us to regret. This is a civic feast. This is a feast for all Salvadorans to celebrate with the joy, with that flavor the Salvadoran people give to all these great events.
