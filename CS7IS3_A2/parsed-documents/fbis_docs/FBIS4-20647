In the past there has been a concern with finding methods of reducing the harm to the environment while saving energy if a separation film process were to be used to purify petroleum. Both the technological and financial aspects of the problem have been discussed. As the result of about one year of research, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) reports that such applications are in fact possible, and is therefore establishing the Advanced Materials Laboratory at the High Polymer Center. MITI is also embarking on this research and development in cooperation with the film manufacturers Tore and Nitto Electric, as well as with petroleum purification companies, the engineering industry, and universities. The separation of liquids and gases with polymer films has made great technological strides in recent years and is used for a wide range of applications. However, distillation is still the basic step in the petroleum purification process. The use of separation films has merit, but MITI says that new technological advances are required because "these liquids have high viscosity." In fact, there are as yet no examples of successful application anywhere in the world. MITI's Center for Promoting the Petroleum Industry has been investigating the suitability of separation films for pertroleum purification. Their conclusion is that the technology is difficult but application is possible if the necessary advances can be made in polymer technology. MITI also said that it will support increased technical cooperation with oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia. The focus of this research and development will be the High Polymer Center. Technical investigations will be carried out by the Joint International Separation Film Specialists Research Committee, studying the state of experimental research. Participants include scholars such as Professor Naoshi Kimura of Tokyo University and Professor Teruhiko Oya of Yokohama National University, the Materials Engineering Technology Laboratory, Arabia Oil, Shukko Kosan, Chiyoda Kako Kensetsu, Tore, and Nitto Electric. Research will be conducted at the Advanced Materials Laboratory that is expected to be completed by February of next year, with Tore and Nitto Electric in charge. The 1993 budget calls for expenditures of about Â¥200 million (about $2 million), and MITI expects the project to last 10 years. Film materials are currently made from polyimides or PPS, but materials of higher functionality will be sought. MITI also says that research will attempt to find applications through modularization and bench plants.
