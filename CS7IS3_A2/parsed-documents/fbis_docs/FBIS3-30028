Kosuke Nakahira, vice finance minister for international affairs, told a hastily called press conference that media reports' "reference to specific yen-rate levels are not a fact." He was referring to a report Thursday by the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN about a discussion between U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at their meeting last month in Tokyo. The major economic daily reported Bentsen as indicating the United States is willing to allow the dollar to rise to 110 yen. Nakahira said the report's "comments on exchange rates are completely misleading and warped," but he declined to disclose what Bentsen and Hosokawa actually discussed, saying, "they both agreed not to comment." Asked if the yen's fall against the dollar is viewed as undesirable before the meeting of Group of Seven (G-7) finance ministers and central bankers Saturday in Germany, Nakahira said, "that's absolutely not in my mind." Nakahira said he wants to scotch "as soon as possible rumors that do not reflect the facts." Currency dealings are now conducted 24 hours a day, he noted, when asked about the timing of the press conference during Tokyo trading hours. Nakahira also rejected suggestions of pressure from the United States, saying, "we are in close contact every day." He also said he wants to make it clear that monetary authorities do not "guide or tolerate exchange rates."
