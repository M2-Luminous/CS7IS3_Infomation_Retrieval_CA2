FR940930-0-00222 FR940930-0-00029 Section 234.203␣Control Circuits The proposed rule requires that all control circuits that affect the safe operation of a highway-rail grade crossing warning system be designed on the closed circuit principle. This requirement was intended to ensure that failure of any part or component of the circuit will cause the warning system to activate (fail-safe principle). Interested parties commented that not all elements of control circuits for all warning systems can be designed on the closed circuit principle. The labor/management group also expressed concern that the proposed rule is a design standard and could conflict with the language in the MUTCD. The final rule is changed to reflect a performance standard versus a design standard. Final Rule The final rule requires that all control circuits that affect the safe operation of a highway-rail grade crossing warning system shall operate on the fail-safe principle. Section 234.205␣Operating Characteristics of Warning System Apparatus The proposed rule requires that operating characteristics of electromagnetic, electronic, or electrical apparatus of each crossing warning system be maintained in accordance with the limits within which it is designed to operate. The labor/management group supports the proposed rule. There were no other specific comments on the proposal. In order to comply with this section, each carrier should have specifications available which set forth the pick-up values, release values, working values, and condemning limits of these values for all electromagnetic, electronic, or electrical devices used in highway-rail grade crossing warning systems. Final Rule The final rule is adopted as proposed. It requires that operating characteristics of electromagnetic, electronic, or electrical apparatus of each highway-rail crossing warning system shall be maintained in accordance with the limits within which the system is designed to operate. Section 234.207␣Adjustment, Repair, or Replacement of Component Paragraph (a) of the proposal requires that when any essential component of a highway-rail grade crossing warning system fails to perform its intended function, the cause shall be determined and the faulty component shall be adjusted, repaired, or replaced without undue delay. Commenters expressed differing views on this provision. NJ Transit found the language consistent with FRA's signal and train control rules and stated that ``it seems adequately defined and workable.'' The labor/management group also supported the rule as proposed. The Southern Pacific recommended that the rule be clarified to make clear that it does not, in every case, require that repairs be made before the next train movement. Paragraph (b) of the proposal which requires appropriate action under §234.105 or §234.107, is written on the assumption that at least in some situations a train will arrive at the crossing before repairs are completed. The Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) concurred with use of the term ``without undue delay'' when concerning the ``total time it takes to make such repairs.'' However, the ICC stated that the rule should more specifically address the amount of time it takes railroad signal personnel to begin on-site repairs after receipt of a credible false activation report. ICC recommended that the time limit for response be set at two hours. Similarly, Washington Public Utilities Commission viewed the phrase ``undue delay'' as too general or open ended. As was stated in the NPRM, ``[i]t is of paramount importance that remedial action begin as soon as possible after a credible report of a malfunction is received by a railroad. In general, adjustment, repair, or replacement without undue delay will require that remedial action be taken in as timely a manner as possible. Successful, practical application of these general principles may be the objective of this regulatory proceeding that is most crucial to the safety of the motoring public; and the safety of employees and rail operations is also implicated.'' Because of the great variety of factors involved with malfunctioning warning systems, including the location of the crossing, frequency of train movements, type of corrective action needed, availability of personnel, and other competing emergency situations we are unwilling at this time to establish specific time limits for actions. FRA continues to believe that the requirements of this section, taken together with the alternative protective measures required under §§234.105 and 234.107 will provide the needed measure of safety.
