European Union (EU) companies lost "several billion dollars" in 1993 due to U.S. trade barriers, but the signature of the GATT agreement allows the hope of an improvement in transatlantic trade in 1994. This is the EC view in its 10th annual report on U.S. barriers to trade and investment. As it presented the document yesterday, the European Executive deplored the fact that "worries about the competitiveness of U.S. companies continue to orientate the trade policies" of Washington. The Europeans are concerned in particular about the resurrection in March of the so-called Super 301 procedure, which allows the United States to decide unilaterally to take sanctions against a trading partner suspected of unfair trading practices. "That indicates that they are allowing themselves to once again be tempted by increased recourse to unilateral or bilateral trade measures," the EC said. Taken together, the tariff and regulatory barriers listed in the EC's report constitute lost earnings of "several billion dollars" for European companies which would like to export across the Atlantic. The EU member states had a trading deficit of ECU6.5 billion in 1993, considered as "reasonable and moderate" by Brussels. Transatlantic trade flows were ECU165 billion and EU exports reached a new high, increasing from ECU73.9 billion in 1992 to ECU80 billion in 1993. The EC's annual report denounces the U.S. barriers, most of which are well known. In addition to unilateral measures, which Washington wants to keep even though they contradict the spirit of the Uruguay Round agreement, the document lists fiscal barriers (which affect cars in particular), the large number of standards, the rules protecting industrial property and the unequal treatment of non-U.S. subsidiaries. The EC also regrets the "frequent recourse to the notion of national security," and the interpretation of certain political and environmental rules to the detriment of European companies. According to the EC, European companies have also suffered considerably from the high customs duties which can exceed 40 percent for some products like textiles, clothing, and table and glassware. However, reductions in these "tariff peaks" are provided for under the GATT agreement and Europe will monitor their application. Let us add that from the other side of the ocean, the report by the U.S. Administration on "trade barriers," published on 31 March, pointed its finger at Japan above all. But the EU was cited in particular for its system of protection for audiovisual products.
