In his words, national interests in the Caspian region will be protected by developing the network of export oil pipe-lines and by helping Russian companies to consolidate their position on oil markets. "Charges that Moscow is striving to dominate or assume some exceptional rights to develop Caspian oil deposits are ludicrous and disregard one simple fact: the bulk of the oil extracted on the shelf will all the same be exported across the territory of Russia," the official said. He described as "a campaign coordinated in favour of western firms" press reports that Russia is demanding the right to veto the Caspian shelf's development. The British newspaper Financial Times has reported with reference to Russian government sources that in a confidential letter to London Russia's Foreign Ministry made it clear that a sanction from Moscow is essential for implementing all Caspian shelf projects.
