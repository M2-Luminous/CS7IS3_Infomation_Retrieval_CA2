Other costs necessary for the effective administration of the program, including salaries for grant organization employees, benefits, and other direct and indirect costs per detailed instructions in the application package. E/P encourages cost-sharing, which may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The Recipient must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation, as well as costs to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;110, Attachment E, ``Cost-sharing and Matching,'' and should be described in the proposal. In the event the Recipient does not meet the minimum amount of cost-sharing as stipulated in the Recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution. Please Note All participants will be covered under the terms of a USIA-sponsored health insurance policy. The premium is paid by USIA directly to the insurance company. Application Requirements Proposals must be structured in accordance with the instructions contained in the application package. Confirmation letters from U.S. and foreign co-sponsors noting their intention to participate in the program will enhance a proposal. Review Process USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility. Proposals will be deemed ineligible if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines established herein and in the application package. Eligible proposals will be forwarded to panels of USIA officers for advisory review. Proposals will be reviewed by USIS posts and by USIA's Office of Near Eastern, North African, and South Asian Affairs. Proposals may also be reviewed by the Office of the General Counsel or by other Agency elements. Funding decisions are at the discretion of the Associate Director for Educational and Cultural Affairs. Final technical authority for granting awards resides with USIA's contracting officer. The awarding of any grant is subject to availability of funds. The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject any or all applications received. USIA will not pay for design and development costs associated with submitting a proposal. Applications are submitted at the risk of the applicant; should circumstances prevent the awarding of a grant, all preparation and submission costs are at the applicant's expense. USIA will not award funds for activities conducted prior to the actual grant award. Review Criteria USIA will consider proposals based on the following criteria: 1. Quality of Program Idea: Proposals should exhibit substance, originality, rigor, and relevance to the Agency mission. They should demonstrate the matching of U.S. resources to a clearly defined need. 2. Institutional Reputation/Ability: Institutions should demonstrate their potential for effective program design and implementation and provide, if available, evidence of having conducted successful programs. If an applicant has previously received a USIA grant, responsible fiscal management and full compliance with all reporting requirements for past Agency grants, as determined by USIA's Office of Contracts (M/KG), will be considered. Evaluations of previous projects may also be considered in this assessment.
