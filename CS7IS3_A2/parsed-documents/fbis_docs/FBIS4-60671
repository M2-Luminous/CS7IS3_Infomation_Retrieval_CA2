[passage omitted] PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat has appointed Fatimah Barnawi as head of the Palestinian Police women's unit. Barnawi was the first Palestinian woman prisoner following the Six-Day War, according to a senior Palestinian source in Tunis. Barnawi, 40, was a resident of East Jerusalem. In September 1967 she was the first one who attempted to carry out an attack in Jerusalem, but the bomb she planted in a cinema was discovered and safely detonated. Barnawi was incarcerated in Israel until 1977, after which she resided in Lebanon. Approximately 10 years ago she settled in Tunis. Barnawi is a member of Fatah's Revolutionary Council. Two Palestinian prisoners who were members of Fatah's first terror squads, which were headed by Yasir 'Arafat, were released yesterday after serving life sentences in the Nabulus prison. The two, Tajj-al-din al-Husayni, 55, and 'Isa al-Qaysi, 60, were imprisoned 27 years ago for terrorist activity.
