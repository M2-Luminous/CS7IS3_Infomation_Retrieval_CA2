Bulger] [Text] Pretoria April 18 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] on Monday [18 April] established a Public Service Forum to ease civil servants into post-election administrations. Members of the TEC's management committee made the announcement after a day long meeting with public servants from central government, the TVBC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states and the self-governing territories. Public sector unions were also represented. The forum was formed to "ensure that in all matters relating to the public service during the transition period there will be transparency, consultation and employee participation". The forum would deal with issues like promotions, pensions and salary parity, TEC Management Committee Member Pravin Gordhan said. He was speaking after a plenary session which followed 11 separate meetings of public sector workers in Pretoria. The meetings were held following continuing discontent among public sector workers, in particular in the homelands where vital sectors of public service provision have broken down by striking workers demanding their pensions and job security in future administrative arrangements. The TEC's task force on the public service, comprising trade unionist Philip Dexter and Administration Minister Sam de Beer, was mandated to attend to a number of issues in which disputes have arisen, among them the threatened breakdown in health services and outstanding allowances. The forum will meet for the first time on Wednesday this week. Speaking after the plenary session, Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said the reorganisation of South Africa's civil service structure was going to require hard work. "The transition is going to require rationalisation of the various administrations into one central and nine provincial governments. It is going to require good management. We all have to work hard to achieve these goals," Mr Meyer said. He said the TEC was the one body that was in a position to give civil servants valid reassurances on their future. African National Congress Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa said civil servants would be in the forefront of a new government. "The new government of national unity will be able to rely on the civil service of our country serving under a new flag and a new constitution," he said. He said South Africa was entering a "very trying period". "The election is really going to have to rely on you if it is going to succeed," Mr Ramaphosa said.
