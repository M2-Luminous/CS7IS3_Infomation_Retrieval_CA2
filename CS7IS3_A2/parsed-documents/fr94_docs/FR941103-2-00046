FR941103-2-00046 FR941103-2-00030 Implementation of Special Refund Procedures AGENCY: Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of Implementation of Special Refund Procedures. SUMMARY: The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) announces the proposed procedures for disbursement of the total amount of $5,982.32 in crude oil overcharges obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Remedial Order that DOE issued to Doma Corporation (DOMA) and Don Martin (Martin), Case No. LEF&hyph;0049. OHA has determined that the funds obtained from DOMA and Martin, plus accrued interest, will be distributed in accordance with DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas L. Wieker, Deputy Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, 1000 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20585, (202) 586&hyph;2400. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(c), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Decision and Order set out below. The Decision sets forth the procedures that DOE has formulated to distribute to eligible claimants $5,982.32, plus accrued interest, obtained under the terms of a Remedial Order that DOE issued to Doma Corporation and Don Martin on July 25, 1985. The Remedial Order found that Doma Corporation and its President, Don Martin, both violated provisions of the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations involving the sale of crude oil during the period of November 1973 through June 1977. OHA will distribute the Remedial Order funds in accordance with DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases (the MSRP). 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986). Under the MSRP, crude oil overcharge monies are divided between the Federal government, the states, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Refunds to the states are distributed in proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum products during the price control period. Refunds to eligible purchasers are based on the total volume of petroleum products purchased and the degree to which they can demonstrate injury. Because the June 30, 1994 deadline for crude oil refund applications has passed, no new applications for purchasers of refined petroleum products will be accepted for these funds. Instead, the share allocated to these purchasers will be added to the general crude oil overcharge pool used for direct restitution. Dated: October 27, 1994. George B. Breznay, Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals.
