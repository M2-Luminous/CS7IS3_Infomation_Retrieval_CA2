The DPRK, in a telephone message from Premier Kang Song-san to his South Korean counterpart Yi Yong-tok said that a seven-member delegation will go to the summit preparatory talks at the truce village of Panmunjom. "The tense political situation on the peninsula has now made the opening of a summit more mandatory than at any other time," Kang said in the message. He noted, this highest-level meeting of the two sides will be a historic event which will give the 70 million Korean people "the joy of reconciliation and unity" and renew hopes for a country of peace and unification. A South Korean Government official welcomed the DPRK's reply, saying that "the message came within the quickest timeframe we had thought of and it was in agreement with our proposal. This suggests that they are sincere in approaching the summit." After a visit to Pyongyang last week, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter took a message to Seoul that the DPRK's President Kim Il-song wants to hold a summit with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam without delay. Seoul immediately accepted and proposed a working-level contact at Panmunjom on the morning of June 28. Some sources said Deputy Prime Minister and the National Unification Board (NUB) Minister Yi Hong-ku is the likely Seoul-side chief delegate to the contact meeting, while Pyongyang may send over its Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam.
