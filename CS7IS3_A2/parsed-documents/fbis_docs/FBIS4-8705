Vladimir Nikolic reports: [Begin recording] The debate is under way about the text of the declaration condemning the air raid on Serbian positions around Gorazde by NATO under UN auspices. Deputy Miodrag Vukovic expressed surprise that some media presented the declaration adopted at the Citizens' Chamber yesterday as the Federal Assembly's declaration and the Chamber of Republics is deciding on it only now. Until a document is adopted by both Federal Assembly chambers, it has not really been adopted, Vukovic said. Deputy Novak Kilbarda is of the opinion that the declaration cannot be adopted this way. It is incomprehensible that the activities of both chambers are not synchronized when such major themes are at stake. Kilbarda has nothing against the declaration and wants it to be adopted, but does not agree with its text. He wondered why it does not say in the declaration that these were the Serbian defense positions and that what was involved is the Serbian Republic, and not the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Deputy Ilija Darmanovic criticized the fact that the declaration was adopted by the Chamber of Citizens without a debate and without anybody having said a thing. In Darmanovic's opinion, the text of the declaration is mild and was the reason the Serbian Radical Party deputies walked out of the session yesterday. [passage omitted]
