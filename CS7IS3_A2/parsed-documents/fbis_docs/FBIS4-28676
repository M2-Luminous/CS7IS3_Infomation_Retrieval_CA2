According to a radio report from Seoul, traitor Kim Yong-sam had a telephone dialogue with U.S. President Clinton on 10 June and babbled that sanctions against North must be promoted continuously, and in a telephone dialogue with Japanese Prime Minister Hata on 9 June, he said that sanctions by the United Nations against the North is inevitable. On 11 June, the puppet National Unification Board Minister Yi Hong-ku and the puppet Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu separately met U.S. Undersecretary of State Tarnoff who flew into Seoul and babbled that the UN Security Council's sanctions against the North are inevitable and so on. Han Sung-chu also held talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Kakizawa who crawled into South Korea on 11 June and said that the current situation on the North's nuclear issue makes it inevitable to make the UN Security Council promote sanctions. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique are never-to-be condoned nation sellers entrusting the nation's fate to the outside forces through their acts, and all the more clearly showed that it is a civilian fascist group pursuing only war by wearing the mask of civilian rule.
