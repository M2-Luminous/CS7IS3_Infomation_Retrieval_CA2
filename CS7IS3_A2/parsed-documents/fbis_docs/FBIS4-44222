A statement points out that because of the northern location, long distances, and structure of Finland and the unsatisfactory package that resulted from the negotiations, agriculture and market gardening are not ready to meet the competition in the EU. The congress, which was unanimous in its statement, had reformulated the executive's proposed statement. This was thought to be "toothless." The executive's resolution did not contain any clear stance. The resolution stresses that if, despite everything, the referendum leads to membership, the SLC expects there to be national consensus on domestic food production and on rural policy. The SLC is also demanding that the scale of the proposed national support measures for agriculture be approved by the Eduskunta and also by the EU Commission before they form the basis for the referendum. Ola Rosendahl, who was reelected SLC chairman yesterday, said in general terms in a review of the situation that despite all the shortcomings of the government's decision in principle it has to be admitted that this government could hardly have produced a better support package and that the next government will not even come anywhere near. He said that it remains for agriculture to consider what possibility there is of living with the support package, and what possibility there is of achieving a no to membership in the referendum and how in such a situation what shape agriculture policy can take.
