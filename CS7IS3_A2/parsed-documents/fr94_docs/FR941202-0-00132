FR941202-0-00132 FR941202-0-00012 Contractor company means a company that has employees who perform safety-sensitive functions by contract for an employer. DOT agency means an agency (or ``operating administration'') of the United States Department of Transportation administering regulations requiring drug testing (14 CFR part 61 et al.; 46 CFR part 16; 49 CFR parts 199, 219, and 382) in accordance with 49 CFR part 40. Positive rate means the number of positive results for random drug tests conducted under this appendix plus the number of refusals to take random tests required by this appendix, divided by the total number of random drug tests conducted under this appendix plus the number of refusals to take random tests required by this appendix. Refusal to submit means that an individual failed to provide a urine sample as required by 49 CFR part 40, without a genuine inability to provide a specimen (as determined by a medical evaluation), after he or she has received notice of the requirement to be tested in accordance with this appendix, or engaged in conduct that clearly obstructed the testing process. * * * * * 3. Appendix I, Section V, Paragraph C is revised to read as follows: Appendix I to Part 121_Drug Testing Program * * * * * V. Types of Drug Testing. * * * * * C. Random testing. 1. Except as provided in paragraphs 2 &hyph;4 of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing shall be 50 percent of covered employees. 2. The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is based on the reported positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this determination is drawn from the statistical reports required by section X of this appendix. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional information or reports from employers, and may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry positive rate. Each year, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following publication. 3. When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of this appendix for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is less than 1.0 percent. 4. When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of this appendix for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing to 50 percent of all covered employees. 5. The selection of employees for random drug testing shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random-number table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. 6. The employer shall randomly select a sufficient number of covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing determined by the Administrator. If the employer conducts random drug testing through a consortium, the number of employees to be tested may be calculated for each individual employer or may be based on the total number of covered employees covered by the consortium who are subject to random drug testing at the same minimum annual percentage rate under this part or any DOT drug testing rule. 7. Each employer shall ensure that random drug tests conducted under this appendix are unannounced and that the dates for administering random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year. 8. If a given covered employee is subject to random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employee shall be subject to random drug testing at the percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's function. 9. If an employer is required to conduct random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employer may_ (a) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same required rate; or (b) Randomly select covered employees for testing at the highest percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to which the employer is subject. 10. An employer required to conduct random drug testing under the anti drug rules of more than one DOT agency shall provide each such agency access to the employer's records of random drug testing, as determined to be necessary by the agency to ensure the employer's compliance with the rule. Issued in Washington, DC on November 22, 1994. David R. Hinson, Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration.
