A Seoul government official said on Wednesday that even if there is a dramatic inter-Korean accord on the exchange soon, it would be hard to materialize it before the March 21 talks in view of a period of time needed in preparing for the exchange. He noted that it was earlier decided that special envoys would be exchanged prior to the third-round U.S.-North Korea talks. "There is no change in this decision on the part of South Korea and the United States," he said. At least 15 days' preparatory period is necessary for the exchange, said the official, adding that this means that even if the two sides agree on the exchange at the next contact slated for coming Saturday, March 12, it would be physically impossible to exchange envoys before March 21. He said it appears North Korea is trying to drive a wedge into the South Korea-U.S. cooperative system by deliberately postponing the exchange of envoys until after March 21. The official said that if North Korea suggests at Saturday's contact for the exchange of envoys after March 21, South Korea and the United States would not turn it down as a breach of agreement. In such an event, he said, the third-stage Washington-Pyongyang talks would be put off until after the materialization of the exchange of envoys. The official added, however, that if North Korea keeps shunning the exchange even at the upcoming contact, the recent U.S.-North Korea agreement on the North Korean nuclear issue would automatically be nullified. "In this case, there exists the strong possibility that the conditional suspension of the '94 Team Spirit exercise and the planned third-round U.S.-North Korea talks would be withdrawn," he said.
