According to the words of Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef Moravcik, "the president's visit to Poland has been prepared for quite some time and was preceded by extensive diplomatic activity." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed which treaties ought to be signed during the visit, and the composition of the delegation was determined accordingly. A discussion on the specific agenda of the visit took place also during the president's bilateral talks with the president of the Republic of Poland in Prague, on the occasion of the meeting of representatives of the Visegrad Four countries with President Clinton. The talks between the presidents of Poland and Slovakia were attended also by ministers Jozef Moravcik and Jan Ducky. In the course of these talks, they arrived at the opinion that steps must be taken to increase economic cooperation between the two countries. For these reasons, Minister of the Economy Jan Ducky and other representatives of our economic life were to be members of the official delegation. It is therefore incomprehensible that the prime minister learned about the Slovak president's planned official visit to Poland only on 19 January 1993, as he declared at the 26th meeting of the National Council of the Slovak Republic. In spite of instances of misunderstanding between constitutional bodies, which have also been reported in the press, we are able to state that the Slovak president's official visit to the Republic of Poland was successful and represents a major contribution to the development of Polish-Slovak relations. On the other hand, the questioning of the activity of any central state body and its representatives is damaging to the interests and the good name of the Slovak Republic abroad.
