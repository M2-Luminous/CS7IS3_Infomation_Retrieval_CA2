During his stay in Angola, Robaina will be received by Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. He also will meet with Prime Minister Marcolino Moco and the president of the parliament, Franca Van Dunem. Also on the agenda is a meeting with the Cuban community in Angola, which numbers some 300 people. Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio da Moura said in Luanda today that it is a privilege for his country to have, as its first visitor in 1994, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina. Upon beginning the official talks between the two leaders today, da Moura stressed that Robaina's presence comes at a moment particularly difficult for the Angolan people because of the war led by the opposition group UNITA. Speaking of relations with Cuba, the Angolan foreign minister said that despite these difficulties, his country intends to work to strengthen the ties of cooperation that Angola has historically had with Cuba. For his part, Robaina said that his visit to Angola is part of a diplomatic offensive in a changing world in which the Cuban authorities are searching for the appropriate milieu for Cuba.
