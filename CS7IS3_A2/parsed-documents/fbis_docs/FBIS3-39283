Citizens are becoming fund of politics again.They realize they are protagonists and want to participate. Resentment towards the parties has relented; there is interest and there is an effort to understand and cooperate. "There no longer is the bitterness, for example, when we used to mention the DC [Christian Democratic Party]...." says Giorgio Calo, director of Directa, a Milan institute specializing in opinion polls. Tangentopoli [Bribe City] has swept away an arrogant, corrupt political system that created hatred in the country. Now there is a new and evidently credible sense of involvement. "Today people may be confused, but they are certainly interested. They feel like they are participating in the creation of the new Republic," Calo said. This is an important element that comes from the polls various institutes are conducting in view of the 27 March elections. The last poll conducted by Directa says that only 16 percent of those polled is uncertain, doubtful, does not know what to do. The rest already know how they will vote. Of those who have already decided, 35.2 percent chose the progressive grouping, 30.7 percent chose the center of Martinazzoli and Segni, and 34.1 percent chose a coalition of the right (Bossi, Berlusconi, and Fini). Therefore it will be an election that will be decided by a thin margin. Directa reached these conclusions after having interviwed 1,300 individuals distributed throughout 98 localities, "with a double stratification, by geographic area and according to the size of the centers," Calo explained. Separating certain data shows that Segni and Martinazzoli forming an imperfect balance at the center: 15.1 percent to the former and 15.6 percent to the latter. On the right, Bossi's League comes in at 13 percent, the Snake [Forza Italia] at 9.2 percent, and Fini's National Alliance at 11.9 percent. Where does Forza Italia, squeezed between the League's north and the MSI's [Italian Social Movement] south, place itself territorially? "The movement is well distributed throughout the country, but more so in the center-south," Calo explained. The director of Directa adds: "In contrast to the last administrative elections, where the phenomenon of the politics of personality was clear, things are different in this election. Ideologies having gone out the door, values are coming in through the window. Certainly, the politics of personality continues, but mostly it involves the top leaders. Today the voters are facing off on democracy, the social welfare state, and free enterprise." The director of Directa therefore pinpoints three factors that will determine the victory or defeat of the various groupings: the impact of the leader, values, and what he defines as a "good product," that is, the quality of the candidate in the electoral college.
