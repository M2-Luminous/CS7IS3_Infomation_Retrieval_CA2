But politics is not made of dreams. We are therefore aiming at a federal and democratic state inside the current Iraqi borders, as long as the country is freed from Saddam's dictatorship." This is how Patriotic Union of Kurdistan leader Jalal Talabani, who was received yesterday by President Scalfaro and trade union and political leaders (including [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary Occhetto), summarizes up the objective of his party, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, in this interview. [Bertinetto] Mr. Talabani, the news that comes from Iraqi Kurdistan is not very positive. In addition to the continuing economic crisis, there are reports of divergencies and even of some armed clashes between your people and supporters of Barzani. What is happening? [Talabani] In effect there are difficulties. Despite the considerable progress made in relaunching agriculture, industrial activity is stagnant, also because of the three-sided embargo of which we are the victims: the internal embargo imposed upon us by Baghdad, that of the neighboring countries, and the international embargo decreed upon by the United Nations against Iraq (which, though directed at Saddam, also involves Kurdistan). The same holds true for the production of electricity and for infrastructure work in general, which are at a very low level. Among our major problems is the forced exile of 300,000 Kurdish people who the Iraqi authorities are preventing from returning. As for the incidents between our forces and those of our allies, these are restricted to certain areas and have been caused by the mistakes made by the local leaders of the Democratic Party, as Barzani himself admitted. The situation is now getting back to normal. [Bertinetto] What do the two parties agree and disagree on? [Talabani] There is accord on participating in an alliance whose objectives are the democratization of society, defense from outside aggression, and the consolidation of a regional self-government. There is disagreement on the types of reforms to be implemented. In general, one can say that a national democratic trend and a social democratic trend are face-to-face. [Bertinetto] How do you judge the support given by the United Nations to Iraqi Kurdistan? [Talabani] I would say that not enough is being done. A lot of money has in fact been spent, but a lot has also been wasted in the bureaucratic management of aid. We would prefer to see a decision on the use of funds made in coordination with our local government. If this does not happen, I do not think that it is a matter of our not being trusted, since all the foreign visitors recognize the fact that we have made great steps ahead. Especially if you consider that we started from practically nothing after the devastation caused by the Iraqi military, which also left us with 22 million mines spread throughout our territory, many of which are Italian made. [Bertinetto] Kurdistan is currently much more than an autonomous region but much less than an independent state. What would you like to become in the future? [Talabani] It depends. If the dictatorship were to fall, we would be in favor of a democratic and federal state that would comprise the Kurds and Iraqis. If tyranny remains, the Kurds will have to seek other paths. [Bertinetto] Do you think that Saddam is still strong? [Talabani] Things are worsening in Iraq. Discontent is increasing among the people and even in the Army. However, you must not overlook the groups in the Armed Forces and the police that consistently pledge absolute loyalty to Saddam. [Bertinetto] Let us assume that the dictatorship is overthrown. Would the creation of a federal state mean abandoning the historical project of uniting all the Kurds in a single state between the existing borders of Iraq, Iran, and Turkey? [Talabani] It is a known fact that Kurdistan was artificially divided after the World War I. We Kurds are the victims of a conspiracy against us. However, we must be realistic. At present it is impossible to modify the borders between all the countries in the area. The unity of all the Kurds does remain the final objective, because a divided nation cannot give up its dream to be united. It remains inside us, but it is a dream, and a responsible political leadership cannot act on the basis of dreams. [Bertinetto] Last year you tried to mediate between the Turkish Goverment and the PKK [Workers' Party of Kurdistan] rebels. A truce was reached, but then, unfortunately, fighting started again, and it was even bloodier than before. Why? [Talabani] One of the reasons was the death of President Turgut Ozal. He was one of the Turkish authorities most willing to negotiate. One also can say the the atmosphere was still not ready for a political solution. [Bertinetto] The Turkish Kurds, the PKK, and affiliated groups complain that Europe is not showing any interest in their cause, and in this way they justify the often clamorous, and sometimes violent, protest demonstrations they incite in the cities of countries where there are massive numbers of Kurdish emigrants, primarily Germany. What do you think? [Talabani] I do not think that Europe has shown little interest in the Kurdish issue. The European Council and the European Parliament voted on resolutions that call for human rights to be respected, Germany has stopped the supply of weapons to Ankara, and the Bundestag has asked for a political solution to the conflict. Perhaps all of this is not enough, perhaps certain Kurdish groups expect more, but this cannot justify the violation of laws in countries in which they are guests, because in this way they would lose support and sympathy.
