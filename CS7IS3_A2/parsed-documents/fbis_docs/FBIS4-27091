Earlier, Judge Marciano Bacalla of Branch 216 of Quezon City Regional Trial Court issued a temporary restraining order [TRO]. Under Judge Bacalla's directive, Renato Constantino Jr., Augusto Miclat and their colleagues have been barred from conducting the East Timor conference. Judge Bacalla has also ordered University of the Philippines [UP] President Emilio Javier and UP Law Dean Pacifico Agabin not to allow UP and its facilities to be used for the conference. The court's restraining order will take effect on 30 May and will last until 4 June. Meanwhile, Renato Constantino Jr., in reaction to the restraining order said their lawyers are studying the order of Judge Bacalla. Constantino's group is organizing the conference. UP President Emilio Javier has declined comment. It will be recalled that Javier had denied Malacanang's [presidential office] request not to hold the conference at UP. Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Renato De Villa said the conference cannot be held anywhere in the country. [Begin recording in English] [De Villa] It says here very clearly, whether the venue be within or outside of the premises of the University of the Philippines. So, they cannot hold it anywhere until this TRO is lifted. [Correspondent] Sir, don't you think this will create more trouble? [De Villa] I cannot say because we don't know what's going to happen.
