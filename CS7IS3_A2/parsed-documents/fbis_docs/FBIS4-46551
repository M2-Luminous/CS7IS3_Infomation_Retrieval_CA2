He participated in bombings by the Azerbaijani air forces of villages in Mardakertskiy Rayon, which led to losses of human life and large amounts of destruction. Belichenko, who formally is considered to be a citizen of Ukraine (where he was called up into the Soviet Army of that period), and served in Azerbaijan. After the collapse of the USSR and the withdrawal of Russian troops, he continued to serve there. His aircraft was shot down after a combat sortie and, according to the data in the investigation, the pilot admitted that he had been recruited for $10,000 monthly, plus a bonus for successful bombing. Incidentally, there is another pilot -- true, a Russian one, Chistyakov -- who is in a similar situation. The only difference is that the court that is trying him in Stepanakert is still in session and the sentence has not yet been pronounced. Belichenko, however, is left with the possibility of requesting the presidium of the NKR [Nagorno-Karabakh Republic] Supreme Council to pardon him, but, according to data provided by the miliary procurator, such a request has not yet been made. According to certain information, the Ukrainian authorities have not shown any interest in Belichenko's fate, despite his formal Ukrainian citizenship. The reason that they give is that his actions were the consequence of a personal choice and that he himself bears the responsibility for them. As a mercenary, this pilot cannot be recognized as a prisoner of war, and the laws governing the protection of prisoners of war do not extend to him. Nevertheless Belichenko's wife, who now lives with their children in Krasnodar Kray, has sent telegrams to Russian minister of foreign affairs Kozyrev and to the Karabakh authorities, requesting them to take part in her husband's fate. Something that can serve as a formal precedent for such participation is the situation involving six Russian mercenaries who were sentenced to death in Baku for having participated in combat actions on the side of the Karabakh Armenians. At that time they were handed over to the Russian authorities in exchange for several Azerbaijanis who had been taken prisoner. Karabakh official consultations that have already been conducted by the Russian MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs], are linked with the possibility of exchanging Belichenko for five Armenians who also have been sentenced to death -- they are incriminated in the murder of Azerbaijani journalist Salatyn Askerova (originally, seven persons had been accused, but two of them have already died in prison, and the fate of the remaining persons still remains unknown). As for pilot Chistyakov, it is not precluded that, after the sentence has been pronounced, he will be handed over to Russia and will serve his punishment on its territory. Meanwhile the Radical Party has decided to choose the example of Belichenko to carry out a demonstration to abolish the death penalty and to establish a permanent international tribunal on military crimes. Party members who picketed yesterday in front of the Armenian Embassy in Moscow feel that crimes similar to those that Belichenko is accused of committing should be under the jurisdiction of an international criminal court with supranational powers, and they have stated that "the incident with him is viewed as a model one, and we are speaking not about a humanitarian, but a political problem." Having shared their views with Armenian ambassador Mamikonyan, who received them and who stated that "the context spoils the idea: pity concerning the sentencing of a person whose actions led to the death of peaceful citizens, was expressed with a complete lack of an attempt to analyze other similar incidents from the opposite side," the participants in the demonstration expressed their readiness to picket the Azerbaijani Embassy also.
