It is called a silicide fuel (silica uranium dispersed aluminum alloy = 4.8 grams/cm[.sup]3[/] uranium density) with 20% enrichment [.sup]235[/]U. The 26 day-operation of the JAERI's Japan Material Test Reactor (JMTR) using the new fuel reconfirmed its applicability. Up to now, above 90% enriched fuels have been used in test/research reactors, but, as a result of the international nuclear fuel cycle evaluation, and in line with nonproliferation policy, the world is moving toward reduced enrichment of less than 20%. This latest research achievement is in line with this worldwide target, making the latest efforts by the JMTR for slight enrichment 19th in the world, while achieving the world's highest neutron flux (4x10[.sup]14[/]/second/cm[.sup]2[/]). This accomplishment will boost efforts for slight enrichment of fuels for test and research reactors throughout the world. JAERI has been working on the slight enrichment program since 1977. In 1986, they developed a 45% enriched fuel through converting a 93% enriched [.sup]235[/]U fuel to intermediately enriched uranium fuel. The newly developed fuel achieved 20% enrichment based on this first stage fuel development. The silicide fuel was formed through compression of a mixture of uranium and silicon alloy and aluminum powders. Aluminum alloy was used as a coating material. Cadmium wire 0.3mm in diameter was placed on the side of the fuel elements in order to control excess reactivity at the onset of the operation. [.sup]235[/]U of each fuel element indicates 310-410 grams of intermediately enriched uranium fuel. JAERI had conducted tests using 2 fuel elements from 24 October 1993 to 20 December 1993, reconfirming their applicability. This time, 50 megawatts thermal output was achieved using slightly enriched uranium fuels for all 27 fuel elements. JAERI claims that the number of nuclear reactor operation interruptions will be reduced by lengthening the past 12-day continuous operation to 26 days. Of all nuclear research reactors of above 1 megawatt output worldwide, approximately 60 -- excluding those in the former Soviet Union -- require slightly enriched fuels; 18 reactors have been modified to use slightly enriched fuels. JAERI has developed the world's first slightly enriched fuel with a high neutron flux density, essential for materials testing.
