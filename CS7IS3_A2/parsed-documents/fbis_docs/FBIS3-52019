Camacho said the postponement of the reply, which had been announced on 25 January for 1800 GMT today, is due to the fact that he had received in the last few hours "new information and elements that allow progress toward a dialogue." Camacho reiterated that the only objective of this entire effort is achieving an end to hostilities, and that is why he decided to postpone the reply. "This is a delicate moment, which we must handle with utmost responsibility," Camacho Solis said.
