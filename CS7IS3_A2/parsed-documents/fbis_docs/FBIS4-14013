According to the sources, al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, member of the Fatah Central Committee and PLO ambassador to Jordan, demanded that confidence be withdrawn from Sha'th, while Major General Nasr Yusuf, chief of the Palestinian police and security, attacked him. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim surprised participants by his reservations about what is happening in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, as he was considered until recently one of the supporters of the course of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. Some observers do not rule out the possibility of Arab influences behind this position. The sources also said that Sha'th was criticized almost unanimously for his performance in the negotiations and for his statements to the press. The most marked criticisms aimed against Sha'th are his failure to adhere to the foundations, from which he must not deviate in any negotiations with Israel, and also his media performance following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron, whether because of his statement that this massacre would not affect the peace process, or the permanent broad smile that appeared on his face, even amid the Palestinian people's grief.
