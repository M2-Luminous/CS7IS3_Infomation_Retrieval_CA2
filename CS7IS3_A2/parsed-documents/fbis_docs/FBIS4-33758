In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Jesus Escamilla, coordinator of the solidarity group Let's Go for Cuba, reported that on this occasion they managed to collect 160 tons of hydraulic oil, 14 tons of rice, and a yet undetermined amount of medicine, school supplies, and various other materials. The humanitarian aid, he added, will soon be transported to the Port of Tampico and from there will be shipped to its final destination in the largest of the Antilles. Also, on Thursday members of organizations that support Cuba gathered in front of the headquarters of Mexican Petroleum (Pemex) and disclosed the text of a note handed to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari at the National Palace. The document urges the Mexican chief of state to take advantage of the high-level contacts that will take place in upcoming days between the governments of the two nations to produce and strengthen agreements in the economic and political areas that would represent progress in the struggle against the U.S. blockade. Moreover, the document adds that the difficult energy situation facing the Cuban people forces us to urge the government of this country to adopt a number of measures, on a priority basis, to favor mechanisms to supply petroleum to Cuba. It points out that the blockade must be broken up, not with words, but with concrete actions to show the Washington administration that it cannot step over the sovereignty of peoples and nations. The organization points out that it is pleased with the progress achieved by trade agreements on fossil fuels, which for some time were among the goals of this movement in solidarity with Cuba. Organization members said this third campaign showed that concrete people-to-people solidarity actions reflect the determination to erect a wall to block U.S. restrictions against Cuba.
