The move follows the Cabinet's approval of the move and the signing of the Jordanian-Palestinian economic accord, which regulates the financial and economic ties between the two parties. CBJ Governor Dr. Muhammad Sa'id al-Nabulsi yesterday told AL-DUSTUR that the CBJ has given initial licenses to five Jordanian banks to reopen branches in the occupied Palestinian towns as follows: The Arab Bank: Two branches, one in Nabulus, one in Gaza. The Jordan Bank: One branch in Janin. Jordan and Gulf Bank: One branch in Nabulus. Jordan National Bank: One branch in Nabulus. Arab Land Bank: Two branches, one in Bethlehem, one in Gaza. Dr. al-Nabulsi noted that these licenses are initial, and the banks that are allowed to open branches must complete all measures and file all the necessary documents. AL-DUSTUR learned that these branches will start their work after gaining the approval of the Israeli monetary authorities in accordance with the agreement reached through the Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli economic committee meetings in Washington.
