Welcoming the guest, the president said that it is important for Poland and Hungary to speak up on issues that are important for Europe because "others can do something for us and without us [as received]." In Walesa's opinion, both countries should maintain working contacts "in the context" of the situation in Europe, "which determines our security and prosperity." Walesa said that the Partnership for Peace proposal can be a considerable partnership if "we decide about its shape ourselves." He added that the gifts are nice but do not always "suit our appetite." Minister Jeszenszky stated that decisions made in Brussels and Prague "would not have been as significant without the work of Poland and the Polish president." He added that it is important to keep U.S. and West European politicians to their word and ensure that they fulfill their promises. "We have reasons to hope, but we also have reasons to be concerned," Jeszenszky said.
