Speaking at a news conference at the conclusion of the meetings, Byron said that it had discussed the items on its agenda. On the issue of the reunification of Palestinian families, the group welcomed the noticeable increase in the number of cases since its last meeting in Tunis. He added that a French working group will follow up on this issue and urged the involved parties to show more flexibility. In the sphere of developing human resources and creating new job opportunities for Palestinian refugees, the Canadian official said that the United States, Turkey, Germany, China, the Netherlands, and Israel have declared new initiatives aimed at increasing job opportunities for refugees and enabling them to be self-reliant. The head of the working group on refugees said that constructive initiatives were proposed in the sphere of public health that took into account the needs of the refugees in the West Bank and the neighboring countries. In the field of child care, Mark Byron said that Sweden proposed a plan and made an initial contribution of $2 million for the psychological rehabilitation program. In the field of social infrastructure, the working group noted the need to provide for the needs of the refugees within the framework of what was announced previously. The group also heard a report by an international investigation committee on the living conditions of the Palestinian refugees in Jordan's camps. He added that it was agreed to prepare a data base for strengthening the Palestinian statistics office, and that Norway, Canada, the United States, and the EU pledged to prepare it. The Canadian official said that improving the refugees' living standards will promote the peace process, noting that the Canadian foreign minister announced yesterday that his country had decided to give $2.7 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency to be used to fund health, educational, and housing projects for refugees in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan. He added that the overall aid that the international community has pledged to the Palestinian refugees since the end of October 1993 has reached $50 million.
