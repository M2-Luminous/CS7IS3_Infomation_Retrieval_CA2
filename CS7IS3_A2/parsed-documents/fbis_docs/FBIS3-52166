What is going on here? [Peres] I must note that the two men you mentioned did not participate in the negotiations. However, Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], who was appointed head of the delegation by Yasir 'Arafat, appeared publicly with me to declare that both delegations had reached agreement. [Rosen] When you arrived back in Israel last night, were you convinced that an agreement with the PLO had been reached? Were you surprised by the reactions and by what happened today? [Peres] Not completely. The agreement is between the two delegations. I knew it had to be approved by the PLO leadership. I realized that there could be dissenting views within the PLO leadership so I was not totally surprised. [Rosen] Did the statements made in Cairo yesterday, and the remarks made by Abu-Mazin lead you to understand that the PLO team was satisfied with the budding agreement? [Peres] I believe the delegation felt, just as we did, that we had met each other half way after starting off from very disparate positions. I imagine that they felt that this was the most they could attain. I must say that most of the delegation, including Abu-Mazin, understand that we cannot stray far from the Declaration of Principles. It is impossible to constantly renew negotiations over the negotiations. Therefore, my assessment is that despite the various statements that have been made, the situation has not changed in any fundamental way. [Rosen] What is the state of things now? What are we actually waiting for? [Peres] The current situation is that the Taba committee can resume its work, and we are waiting for an official and formal notice from the PLO leadership regarding the joint communique reached yesterday. [Rosen] You usually avoid using the term crisis. But have we not actually reached a crisis with the PLO? The PLO is not sticking to the agreements. [Peres] Look, that is the partner we have. The PLO is the only partner we have to negotiate with, and we shall continue to do this. This is the kind of thing that is neither final, nor a total crisis. This is part of the negotiations process. [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew at 1800 GMT on 30 December reports that "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is waiting for an official statement from the PLO regarding the Cairo draft agreement before making any public reaction. Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports that Jerusalem is displeased with reports that Yasir 'Arafat has rejected the draft." Israel Television goes on to note that "Egyptian officials told our correspondent this evening that President Mubarak was disappointed with 'Arafat's attitude and has therefore decided to reduce the level of Egyptian involvement in mediation efforts between the PLO and Israel. Mubarak has therefore decided not to send Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa to Israel for talks on this matter."]
