A letter sent by Iraq's permanent Arab League delegate to the League's secretariat noted that the facilities extended to the aircraft violating Iraqi airspace pose a threat to the security, sovereignty, and national unity of the country. From 17 to 23 May, these aircraft mounted 372 sorties, having taken off from bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Iraq's League delegate asked that copies of the letter, which detailed the violations, be circulated among the member states.
