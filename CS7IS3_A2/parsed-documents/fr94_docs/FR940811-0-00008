(a) This subpart sets forth the terms and conditions for the payment to CCC of marketing assessments for beet sugar and raw cane sugar produced during the 1991 through 1997 crop years and marketed during the 1992 through 1998 fiscal years. (b) The marketing assessment applies to: (1) The marketing by first processors of all raw cane sugar produced from the 1991 through 1997 crops of domestically produced sugarcane or sugarcane molasses and marketed during the 1992 through 1998 fiscal years; and (2) The marketing by first processors of all beet sugar produced from the 1991 through 1997 crops of domestically produced sugar beets or sugar beet molasses and marketed during the 1992 through 1998 fiscal years. (c) All first processors of sugar beets and sugarcane are responsible to remit the marketing assessments. (d) The marketing assessments shall be due and payable to CCC by the thirtieth calendar day following the end of the month in which the beet sugar or raw cane was marketed. §1435.201 Definitions. Beet sugar means sugar, whether or not principally of crystalline structure, which is processed directly or indirectly from domestically produced sugar beets (including sugar produced from sugar beet molasses). Crop year and crop shall have the same meanings as are ascribed to such terms in §1435.3 of this part, with the customary allowance for a continuous harvest as provided for in §1435.5(a)(2) of this part. In addition, beet sugar or raw cane sugar processed from molasses or thick juice produced from domestically produced sugar beets or sugarcane shall be considered to have been produced during the crop year in which such sugar beets or sugarcane was harvested. First processor means a person who commercially produces beet sugar or raw cane sugar, directly or indirectly, from domestically produced sugar beets or sugarcane, or from molasses or thick juice derived from domestically produced sugar beets or sugarcane. Fiscal year means CCC's fiscal year which runs from October 1 to September 30. Integrated processor-refiner means a first processor of raw cane sugar who also refines raw cane sugar into refined sugar. Market or marketing means the sale or disposition of raw cane sugar or beet sugar in commerce in the 50 United States, the several territories, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, including, with respect to any integrated processor-refiner, the movement of raw cane sugar into the refining process. For purposes of this subpart, the forfeiture to the CCC of raw cane sugar or beet sugar used as collateral for a price support loan is also considered a marketing. Raw cane sugar means any sugar, cane syrup or edible molasses, whether or not principally of crystalline structure, processed from domestically produced sugarcane or sugarcane molasses. Raw value shall have the same meaning as is ascribed to such term in §1435.401 of this part. §1435.202 Amount of the marketing assessment. (a) The amount of the beet sugar marketing assessment to be remitted shall be the sum determined by multiplying the number of pounds of beet sugar marketed in a calendar month by the assessment rate. The assessment rate for fiscal years 1992 through 1994 shall be 1.0722 percent of the loan level for raw cane sugar, but not more than 0.193 cents per pound. For marketings during each of fiscal years 1995 through 1998, the assessment rate per pound of beet sugar shall be 1.1794 percent of the loan level established for raw cane sugar, but not more than 0.2123 cents per pound of beet sugar. (b) The amount of the marketing assessment on raw cane sugar to be remitted to CCC shall be the sum determined by multiplying the number of pounds, raw value, of raw cane sugar marketed, or estimated to be marketed in accordance with §1435.203(c)(1) of this subpart, in a calendar month by the assessment rate. The rate for fiscal years 1992 through 1994 shall be 1.0 percent of the loan level for raw cane sugar, but not more than 0.18 cents per pound. For marketings during each of fiscal years 1995 through 1998, the assessment rate per pound of raw cane sugar shall be 1.1 percent of the loan level established for raw cane sugar but not more than 0.198 cents per pound of raw cane sugar.
