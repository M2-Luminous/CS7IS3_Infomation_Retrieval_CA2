FR941222-0-00087 FR941222-0-00013 Section 6.7␣Mining Wastes This section is intended to clarify the relationship between the regulations governing solid waste disposal and existing regulations at 36 CFR part 9, Minerals Management, that govern mineral operations. Section 6.7 (b) and (c) address solid waste disposal by persons conducting mineral operations on the date these regulations become effective. Section 6.7(b) addresses existing mineral operations within a unit of the National Park System that are not governed by an NPS-approved part 9 plan of operations or terms of a Federal mineral lease. Such an operation may continue to dispose of solid waste at a site within a unit only after following the procedures and conditions prescribed in §6.5, posting financial assurance prescribed by the Regional Director, and obtaining a permit from the Regional Director under §6.9. Section 6.7(c) provides that an existing mineral operation, if governed by a plan of operations approved under 36 CFR part 9 or the terms of a Federal mineral lease, may continue to operate a solid waste disposal site within a unit of the National Park System pursuant to the approved plan of operations or lease. In approving the plan of operations, the Regional Director, under part 9, should have already prescribed conditions to ``*␣*␣* mitigate the adverse effects of solid waste disposal on the property of the United States *␣*␣*'' associated with the operation. Congress prescribed this standard as the basis for regulations that govern all existing solid waste disposal sites. Section 6.7(c) makes clear that where an existing mineral operation is governed by 36 CFR part 9 or the terms of a Federal mineral lease, the Regional Director's approval of the plan of operations constitutes the permit for operation of a solid waste disposal site in connection with the mineral operation. Financial assurance is not required, if a bond has been posted under 36 CFR part 9 or the Bureau of Land Management regulations that govern Federal mineral lessees. The final regulations allow new solid waste disposal sites by mineral operators within a unit only under the conditions that Congress prescribed for solid waste disposal at 16 U.S.C. 460 l &hyph;22. Thus, final §6.7(d) addresses solid waste disposal sites operated by persons proposing mineral operations beginning after the effective date of these regulations. Such an operator is governed by the conditions at §6.4(a) that preclude any new solid waste disposal sites within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System, unless the waste is generated solely by National Park Service activities. Thus, persons who begin mineral operations after the effective date of the regulations, as all other persons, could not operate a new solid waste disposal site within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System. Among the alternatives available to mineral operators are disposing of the solid waste in appropriate facilities outside the unit boundaries, or in an existing solid waste disposal site in a unit, whose continued operation has been approved by the Regional Director under §6.5 and permitted under §6.9. Section 6.7(d) applies to establishment of a solid waste disposal site by a prospective operator, whether the operator is governed by regulations at 36 CFR part 9 or the terms of a Federal mineral lease. Nonetheless, the Regional Director must ensure that all persons, including those beginning mineral operations within a unit, obey the prohibition on establishing a new solid waste disposal site on all lands within a unit's boundaries. This task will be relatively simple where an operator is governed by 36 CFR part 9 or a Federal mineral lease. Where an operator is not so governed, the Regional Director must inform the operator of, and enforce, the conditions that prohibit a new solid waste disposal site. To ease the regulatory burden on a mineral operator, nothing in this part prohibits the temporary storage, or stockpiling for return, or the return of mining overburden to the mine site for reclamation purposes. Such activity does not constitute creation of a solid waste disposal site and will not be governed by the need to request or possess a permit, the conditions at §6.4 and §6.5, or the financial assurance requirements of §6.9. This exception applies only to mining overburden that is not hazardous under EPA regulations at 40 CFR part 261. However, a mineral operator commencing operations after the effective date of this final rule will not be permitted to permanently abandon spoil or overburden on their lands, including on patented claims, or other nonfederal lands in a unit. Such an action constitutes creation of a new ``solid waste disposal site'' which Congress prohibited within the boundaries of a National Park System unit. The Service recognizes that this requirement may increase the costs of conducting mining in parks. However, the cost of conducting mining must also include the cost of reclaiming the solid waste remaining after mining is completed. The NPS cannot reasonably implement congressional intent to prohibit new solid waste disposal sites in National Park System units, and then allow mining operators to establish such sites in parks in connection with mining. Section 6.8␣National Park Service Solid Waste Responsibilities Paragraph (a) prohibits the disposal of solid waste in NPS-operated solid waste disposal sites by persons other than those engaged in National Park Service activities. ``National Park Service activities'' are defined in §6.3 to include NPS contractors, concessionaires or commercial use licensees. In several instances, persons other than contractors, concessionaires, or commercial use licensees now dispose of solid waste in NPS operated solid waste disposal sites on Federal lands. This is an inappropriate use of Federal park lands that the regulations terminate one year after the effective date of these regulations. Paragraph (b) directs the NPS to set up special collection program to remove harmful substances from the household waste stream where appropriate. While wastes generated by households (including hotels and motels) are not hazardous, they may be harmful to NPS resources. Therefore the NPS, under §6.8, will establish a collection program to remove such materials from the waste stream in units where the NPS operates a solid waste disposal site. The proposed rule required that such collections be conducted every six months. The final rule requires it once each year. Each such park has the latitude to establish a collection program that best meets its circumstances, ranging from a one-day collection of certain wastes only (used oil, paints, thinners, etc.) to a continually open collection site for all harmful wastes generated by park residents.
