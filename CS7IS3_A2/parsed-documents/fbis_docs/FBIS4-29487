FBIS4-29487 "dreas118_m_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-118 Daily Report 19 Jun 1994 Thailand Plea To Set Up Fishing Projects Rejected Plea To Set Up Fishing Projects Rejected BK1906135794 Bangkok THE SUNDAY NATION in English 19 Jun 94 p A4 BK1906135794 Bangkok THE SUNDAY NATION English BFN [By Marisa Chimprapha] [Text] Dhaka -- Bangladesh has turned down Thailand's request to increase joint fishing ventures, saying its marine resources were already depleted and it must conserve the remainder as much as possible, a senior Thai Fisheries Department official said yesterday. Fisheries Deputy Director General Somsak Singhonka said there is only one joint venture fishing company. It initially had 10 Thai boats, but had been reduced to seven as three of them sank in a storm. Bangladesh has rejected a Thai request to replace the sunken boats. A request for more joint fishing ventures was also rejected, he said. Somsak was speaking to THE NATION after attending a three-day meeting of the Thai-Bangladeshi Joint Commission in Dhaka which ended yesterday. Leading Thai officials to Bangladesh was Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, who co-chaired the meeting with his Bangladeshi counterpart A.S.M. Mustafizur Rahman. Prasong, meanwhile, said he understood Dhaka may be reluctant to allow more Thai fishing activity in the Bay of Bengal because some Thais were caught illegally fishing in its territorial waters. "Bangladesh has a strong policy to conserve its marine resource. Bangladeshi Prime Minister Khaleda Zia has informed me that her country wants to conserve this marine resource as much as possible. "She said the country is considering the Thai request (for more joint ventures) but feels that the existing number of Thai boats under the concession are enough," Prasong said. A reliable source said yesterday Bangladesh had at the last-minute gone back on an earlier agreement to set up of a joint working group on fisheries, agreed upon during a joint meeting of senior officials. The Thai side had expected the proposed working group to help solve existing and future fisheries problems. It was proposed that senior officials of the Thai and Bangladeshi fisheries departments join the working group so that they could directly talk to each other when problems occur. Somsak confirmed that Bangladesh has changed its mind, but said the fisheries problems between Thailand and Bangladesh are less serious than those Thailand has with Vietnam and Burma and the working group is not necessary for the time being. Prasong yesterday paid a courtesy call on Bangladeshi President Abdur Rahman Biswas and Prime Minister Zia. During the meeting, the two parties agreed to increase bilateral trade which has been in favour of Thailand for many years. Dhaka proposed that Thailand import more tea and jute products but the Thai side said Thailand is already a major producer of tea and jute. The Thai delegation also offered to organize a training programme for Bangladeshi officials, particularly in the field of fisheries and human resource development.
