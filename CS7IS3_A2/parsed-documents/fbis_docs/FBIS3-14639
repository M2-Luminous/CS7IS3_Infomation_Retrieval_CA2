This came in a statement issued by the two fronts' unified command. The unified command said that the massacre of Jabaliya in Gaza once again shows that the occupation does not differentiate among the revolution's strugglers, and that it pursues its terrorism against all the sons of the Palestinian people. For his part, DFLP secretary General Nayif Hawatimah has emphasized the need to immediatley stop wagering on the U.S. Administration. He called for discarding the belief that Washington will bring pressure to bear on Israel, as the Oslo-Cairo agreement proponents claim. Hawatimah called on those who defend this agreement to give up their positions in the PLO.
