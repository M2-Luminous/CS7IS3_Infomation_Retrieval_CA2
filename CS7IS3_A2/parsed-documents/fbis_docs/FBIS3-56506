Its air attack was not directed against military objects but peaceful settlements. This clearly reveals Azerbaijan's real intentions in its war against Nagorno-Karabakh. Despite that, Armenia is not deviating from its policy to strive for the peaceful settlement of the problem. In recent days the press reported on a high-level quadripartite meeting between Azerbaijan, Karabakh, Armenia, and Russia. At present, there is no clear agreement on holding such a meeting, although, in principle Armenia favors the idea. This is the context in which the meeting was held between the Armenian and Azerbaijani defense ministers in Tbilisi on Saturday when they examined the military-technical aspects of a cease-fire. The press secretary noted that no concrete agreement was reached. As already reported, the Armenian president issued a decree on 15 January on the restructuring of the State Directorate for National Security. In referring to that matter, Mr. Abrahamyan said: It is a requirement to revamp our structures to place them at the service of national statehood. One of such state structures is this directorate, whose specific purpose should be exclusively intelligence and counterintelligence work. To successfully fulfill these important functions, the directorate should undergo structural changes. The former structure was set up during the Soviet Union and was serving other purposes, primarily surveillance of dissidents. Naturally, such problems no longer exist in a democratic country. The Armenian citizens can worship and express any opinion freely and without restraint, and join any legal political organization. The press secretary added: I consider it important to note that the president highly appreciates Eduard Simonyants [the former head of the State Directorate for National Security], and the planned restructuring has nothing to do with him. No matter who headed that directorate, its existing structure was beyond reform without any serious structural changes. I can assure that Mr. Simonyants' abilities will be properly used in another state job. The adoption of the privatization bill by the parliament is one of last week's important developments. Mr. Abrahamyan also touched on this matter. The implementation of the plan requires hard work from the government, and he thinks that the government will place that process under its strict control. He said: The state's aim is to harmonize and bring in tandem the privatization process with two other processes: The first is the creation of a system for social protection so that the socially unprotected strata can obtain financial assistance and goods from various sources, and therefore be able to meet their minimum requirements. The second is the creation of the market substructures serving the economy. In this, the banking system plays the leading role. The Armenian Central Bank should act like an orchestra conductor in the system, and here the need was also felt to introduce changes. These changes were made last week with the efforts of the president and the parliament. He drew the reporters' attention to the president's decree on 15 December and on the course of its implementation. As you remember, that decree was designed to create favorable conditions for the import and sale of foodstuff. This decree gave concrete instructions to the Central Bank and government, and some of these instructions have already been implemented. The issue here involved introducing changes in the decisionmaking process inside the government aimed at eliminating bureaucratic infighting and the possibility of corruption. An operational staff has been set up under Shahen Petrosyan to establish law and order at the airports. The president's supervisory service has accomplished enormous work. This service set up an operative alarm team and established round-the-clock posts in Zvartnots, Yerepuni, and Shirak Airports. Despite all these measures, Mr. Abrahamyan said that the president's supervisory service and law enforcement organs revealed a number of cases of pilferage of money and goods and the misuse of official positions. A criminal investigation has been opened. The operative alarm teams of the supervisory service have resumed their work as of 14 January, not only in the airports but also along the highways north and south of Armenia. In case of any violation of the law, our businessmen could immediately inform the employees at the posts set up by the service. Mr. Abrahamyan also replied to reporters' questions.
