A responsible source at the UAE Foreign Ministry held Israel fully responsible for this massacre because it has continued to arm them and overlook their repeated crimes and attacks on the defenseless Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories. In a statement disseminated by the EMIRATES NEWS AGENCY, the source said this massacre, which took place under the eyes of the Israeli occupation forces, proves beyond doubt the Israeli Government's collusion with the criminals. The source called on the international community, headed by the Security Council and the big powers supporting the peace process, to undertake a serious and effective move that goes beyond condemnation and denunciation and to adopt tangible, decisive, and practical steps to protect the Palestinian city [as received].
