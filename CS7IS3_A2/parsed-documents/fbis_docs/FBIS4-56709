Welcome gentlemen. We are witnessing the conclusion of the voting phase of the election process. I understand that only those voters who were in line when the voting process ended and those members of the various boards related to the election process will be allowed to vote from here on. Let us listen to Magistrate Valdes Escoffery comments on the significance of these elections, in which we have been able to witness that the Panamanian people have conducted themselves very peacefully, and that the elections so far have proceeded very normally. [Valdes] Well, first of all, as Panamanians, we are really delighted with the degree of patience, tolerance, aptitude, and ability to fraternize with each other that the political adversaries have demonstrated. We have seen all of them in action. They have all been very cooperative. Men, women, even the children who had their own special elections. Even they had long lines at their respective voting centers. Incredibly, even senior citizens went to vote and where patient enough when their voting tables were not located on a ground floor. Some of these senior citizens even went to vote with their walkers. Practically, no one has complained about the organization. We have received numerous congratulations. The mood has been festive and everyone has shared in this mood. This really has no precedence. We were just commenting that we would be waking up in a different country. I believe that we all feel the same. We must all feel quite delighted. Let us hope that those limited defects that took place in some areas were finally overcome and we will be able to implement whatever corrective measures the law specifies in a civilized manner as occurs in every election process. I have been able to participate in numerous elections during the past year since we are currently undergoing a wave of democratic renovation. Even in Chile, a country with a very long cultural tradition, I was at a voting center where the voting table could open because the party poll representatives had not shown up. In Chile, party poll representatives hold their positions for a fixed period, and they had just had a turnover and the new representatives were not familiar with their responsibilities, and they were just discussing how to operate the voting table. In other words, every election process has some confusion. Let us hope that what we have all seen and shared today can be understood in the tolerant manner we have demonstrated so far. [Cogley] Mr. Juan Francisco de la Guardia, do you agree with the statements by the TE magistrate? Has everything proceeded normally? Have there been any problems? You were responsible for coordinating everything related to the electoral delegates. In addition to that, you were also involved in supervising that the election process would proceed normally. [De la Guardia] Not only has it proceeded normally, it has also been an extraordinary example of civic conscience by the Panamanian people. It was really amazing how the people showed up to vote beginning very early in the morning. The voting centers were crowded beginning at 0630 and 0700. It was incredible how the people went to their respective voting centers and how great was their desire to cast their votes. They were eager to express their opinion through their votes. This is the way we have always wanted it to be in our country. We have had an election festival. [Cogley] Well, Mr. Magistrate President, thank you very much for your comments.
