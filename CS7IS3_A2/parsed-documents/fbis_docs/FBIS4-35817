FBIS4-35817 "drnes108dd_94008" FBIS-NES-94-108 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Abu-Middayn Admits to Info on MIA's Abu-Middayn Admits to Info on MIA's TA0606120194 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 6 Jun 94 p A1 TA0606120194 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] [Text] Speaking at a closed forum in Gaza last weekend, Attorney Furayh Abu-Middayn, who the PLO chairman appointed justice minister in the Palestinian Authority, revealed that the three Israeli MIA's from the battle of al-Sultan Ya'qub -- Zekharya Baumel, Tzvi Feldman, and Yehuda Katz -- were buried by a squad belonging to Abu-Jihad [Khalil al-Wazir]. According to him, today there are five other people who know where the bodies are buried, but he would not name them. This is the first time such a high-ranking Palestinian official has admitted that the PLO has information regarding the three Israeli MIA's from the al-Sultan Ya'aqub battle. Abu-Middayn's remarks were published in the East Jerusalem paper AL-QUDS two days ago. According to the paper, Abu-Middayn said: "Once we find the bodies of the three Israeli soldiers, the problem of the Palestinian prisoners will be solved." Abu-Middayn said Israel is willing to release all the Palestinian prisoners in return for the bodies of the three soldiers who have been missing since 1982 and stressed that the problem of the MIA's is on the verge of solution. Abu-Middayn further said at the Gaza gathering that all the Palestinian prisoners should be released in view of the Oslo agreement, "but Israel has reservations about this. It is no secret that the matter depends on the bodies of the three Israeli soldiers, which are being held by Palestinians." Several months ago, the PLO delivered half of MIA Baumel's dog tag to the defense establishment. A senior IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officer has said that the PLO information on the MIA's is reliable. According to the officer, it is obvious that the PLO has information regarding the three MIA's from the al-Sultan Ya'qub battle, and Israel expects to receive that information. Defense establishment sources have said that Abu-Middayn's remarks are interesting but that Israel continues to seek information about all its MIA's, including those from the al-Sultan Ya'qub battle. The reference is to the bodies of MIA's Yosi Fink and Rahamim Alsheikh as well and to information about captive navigator Ron Arad. Two years ago, Uri Lubrani, who headed the negotiating team on the MIA and POW issue, was relieved of this task, and it was handed over to Major General Yoram Ya'ir, head of the IDF Personnel Branch. At present, 8,000 Palestinian prisoners are being held in IDF detention facilities. So far, some 2,000 prisoners and detainees have been released after pledging in writing not to carry out terror attacks and declaring their support for the peace process. At the Gaza gathering, Abu-Middayn further said that the Palestinian leadership has established a special ministry to deal with casualties and prisoners. According to him, the office will handle the rehabilitation of the casualties and prisoners and take care of their needs. No decision on who will head this ministry has been made yet.
