The armies of the former North and South Yemens have not merged since the two countries unified in May 1990 and there have been frequent clashes between the sides in recent months. The plane was not hit as warning shots were fired as it overflew units from the northern al-'Amaliqah [Giants] brigade based [in] Abyan, in southern Yemen, the sources said. The country's rival leaders have been involved in a long running feud, and tension has risen with the deployment of the rival armies in each other's territory. The shooting happened a few hours before a mutual news blackout on such incidents was imposed by the two sides. President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his ruling General People's Congress from the north have been at loggerheads with Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid's Yemeni Socialist Party from the poorer south for seven months.
