Also in connection with this case, Copenhagen Municipal Court on Wednesday [6 April] sentenced Briton Timothy McCarthy to a prison term of six months. He admitted to having been involved in the smuggling of at least 1.5 tons of hashish and to have earned at least 30 million kroner. His 46-year-old compatriot was earlier given the same sentence for his role in the smuggling incidents. Up to one dozen more persons are still awaiting trial. Among those currently jailed in the case is the chairman of KRIM, a North Zealand county government leader, and a union official. Police think the indicted individuals have altogether smuggled in hashish amounting to a street value of 60 million kroner. The supposed ringleaders can expect to be called before a grand jury in the fall. In addition to the prison sentence, McCarthy's sentence contains a permanent ban on entering Denmark after having served his prison term and a confiscation of an estate of 400,000 kroner, 100 kg of hashish, and various articles of communications equipment.
