A fast-track version of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) agreed upon in Prague on Feb. 4, commits the four countries to achieving free trade by Jan. 1, 1998--three years faster than previously planned. By that date, tariff and non-tariff barriers for manufactured goods are to be lowered or abolished. In just two months, the CEFTA nations are scheduled to decide upon an expanded list of goods that will enjoy completely free trade under the fast-track program. Certain sensitive areas--including agriculture, textiles, metals and automobiles--are not addressed in the current plan. Expert panels are scheduled to begin immediate discussions on how to resolve these issues. Agriculture is expected to present the biggest obstacle. The four countries' trade ministers said they would like to expand the current list of items slated for completely free trade. Czech Minister of Trade and Industry Vladimir Dlouhy said that the group's determination to quickly solve complex agricultural disagreements signals that the countries are "ready to start eating this bitter apple." Keeping in step with the Western nations that recently concluded trade pacts such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the CEFTA countries said they expect the union to improve their economies and to help ease their integration into Europe. Each member country is permitted to sign bilateral agreements with third countries--Romania and Bulgaria are primary candidates. CEFTA was signed in December 1992 by the Czech and Slovak republics, Hungary and Poland with the goal of creating a free trade zone for the region's 65 million people by the year 2001. The agreement began taking effect in March 1993 with the gradual removal of tariffs from 60 percent of listed items traded between Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, and 54 percent of industrial goods from Slovakia. Ironically, trade among the CEFTA countries has shriveled since the agreement was initially signed. Hungary's trade with CEFTA countries, for instance, shrank from 12.5 percent of total trade to just 5 percent. All four countries negotiating CEFTA are also pressing for freer trade with Western Europe, where the threat of anti-dumping proceedings has caused problems in the past. "The European Union is the main market for us," said Miroslav Somol, a deputy minister at the Czech Ministry of Trade and Industry. Somol said the republic is particularly anxious to see changes in the quotas that the Western Europeans have implemented against Czech steel and textiles.
