An End to a Currency Paradox?"] [Text] At yesterday's trading session of the Moscow interbank currency exchange the dollar reached its highest rate against the ruble since 23 September 1993 -- 1,293 rubles [R] per dollar. The September record the dollar hit two days after the parliament was dissolved was R1,299 per dollar. Experts attribute the R19 increase in the currency exchange rate on Tuesday (following Monday's R15 rise) to "uncertainty over the government's economic policy and the possibility of a government reshuffle." What is noteworthy are the pace of the ruble's slide and the Russian Federation Central Bank's line of conduct at the two latest trading sessions. Compared with the first trading session in the new year on 5 January, the ruble dropped 3 percent. The speed of the currency exchange rates' movement was effectively in line with last year's typical inflation rate, which was determined by the scale of the creation of credit and money. Hence, there would have been nothing extraordinary in the dollar's behavior on the Russian currency market after the New Year, had the country's population not become used to the fact that the exchange rate fluctuates regardless of how many rubles are printed. But the situation of the second half of 1993 -- a stable ruble accompanied by a 30-percent semiannual inflation in July-December -- is characteristic only of economies in transition at a time when prices change significantly and currencies' purchasing power parities come closer to their exchange rates. This paradox was bound to end sooner or later, and it cannot be ruled out that the ruble's fall yesterday was a symptom that a normal, quantitative interrelation between inflation and currency exchange rate dynamics was finally being restored. If this is so, the general political and economic background to the events at the Moscow interbank currency exchange ("uncertainty of economic policy" and the possibility of a reshuffle) is merely a pretext for reversing the currency trends. Maybe the Central Bank, too, has a similar view on the situation as it nodded agreement to the dollar's new exchange rate figures (according to some banks, yesterday the Central Bank offered for sale a meager $16.5 million).
