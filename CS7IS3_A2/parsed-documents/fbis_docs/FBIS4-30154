In General Santos City, Police Superintendent Renato Santos met with security agency owners yesterday to draw up plans to protect the city from terrorist raids. Santos said he would tap the vast army of private blue guards in security in securing private businesses in the city. Santos said intelligence reports confirmed that the Abu Sayyaf terrorists plan to carry out new bombings and kidnappings of prominent ethnic businessmen in General Santos City and South Cotabato. He said the fierce fighting between advancing government troops and the extremists left six soldiers dead Tuesday, while 15 others were wounded in the final assault to free a Catholic priest held hostage by the group. The priest, Father Cirilo Nacorda, is being held by the Abu Sayyaf for money. Soriano [name as heard] said the government assault has the tacit approval of Moro National Liberation Front chief Nur Misuari.
