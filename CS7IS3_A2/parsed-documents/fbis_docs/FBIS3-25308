He said at the General De Wet Training Grounds in Bloemfontein that he had not only resigned as chief minister of Venda, but also from the Transitional Executive Council's subcouncil on defense. He was also no longer an ANC [African National Congress] candidate for the coming election. On the alleged poor hygiene at the base, Gen. Ramushwana said the situation had been caused by Transkei sending too many soldiers. Many of them had been sent back.
