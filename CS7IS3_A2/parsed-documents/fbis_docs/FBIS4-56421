Ted Turner, TBS [Turner Broadcasting System] president, invited Robaina to Atlanta to attend the show. Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso, please give us your report on the situation: [Alfonso] As I said earlier, we received the agenda listing those invited on 7 March. The Atlanta conference was supposed to take place 1-5 May in Atlanta. As you know, we must forward a formal note to request a U.S. visa. The Foreign Ministry, on 4 April, 25 days before Robaina's scheduled trip to Atlanta, sent the formal note. As you know, the U.S. Interests Section in Havana has established a certain number of days to submit an application prior to granting such a visa and those 25 days more than covered this restriction. The note containing pertinent information was delivered, and we began waiting to see whether or not the visa would be granted. Cuban authorities learned that TBS and CNN officials had contacted the relevant authorities in the State Department. According to the information we have, TBS officials believed the visa would be granted. Time went by, and, as of 28 April, the day before Robaina was scheduled to leave for Atlanta, we had received no answer from the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, which, as you know, is part of the Swiss Embassy in Cuba. In view of this situation, the Foreign Ministry decided to withdraw the passports from the U.S. Interests Section because it had become impossible to schedule the trip. This is because Robaina was supposed to leave for Atlanta the next day. In short, this is a situation I want you, the media, to examine. The media cannot overlook the fact that it was made impossible for a figure such as Robaina to speak before an important forum and have access to the international media to discuss Cuba's position. Robaina and a number of Cuban authorities have pursued this policy on a regular basis. I repeat, the media cannot ignore the fact that it is hard to believe all of this talk about freedom of thought in light of Robaina's inability to obtain an entry visa to attend an important television forum. As you can see, there is no correlation between all of those ideas espoused by the U.S. Government, which claims to advocate freedom of speech, freedom of opinion, and the free flow of ideas, and this inability of such an important Cuban personality, like the foreign minister, to attend this forum for exchanging ideas because other people in attendance may have opinions that differ from Robaina's. This event was an ideal venue for exchanging ideas because we always believe that by exchanging ideas, we can better understand the opinions of others. This is the statement I have for you. [Bethancourt] Did you receive any reply after you withdrew the passports? [Alfonso] It was very interesting. As I already said, our authorities decided hours before Robaina's departure that there was no chance he would be able to make the trip. Therefore, the passports were withdrawn, and the very next day, 29 April, Secret Service agents from the State Department [as heard] went to our Interests Section in Washington, D.C., to coordinate ways to ensure Minister Robaina's safety during his visit to the United States. This situation indeed deserves to be criticized, because as far as I know, communications between Havana and Washington were not interrupted on 28 April. This visit in Washington by Secret Service agents took place after we withdrew the passports the day before. Again, these agents went there the following day to coordinate ways to secure the personal safety of the Cuban foreign minister. There you have it. This is the only reply we have received. [Bethancourt] Have you received any word from the U.S. Interests Section in Havana? [Alfonso] We have received no reply or explanation whatsoever. The visa was not granted, considering we decided to withdraw the passports from the hands of the U.S. authorities in Havana. [Bethancourt] We just heard Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso explain the reasons why Minister Robaina will not attend a television show he had been invited to in the United States in Atlanta.
