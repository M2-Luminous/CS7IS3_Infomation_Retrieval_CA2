Speaking about his recent trip to Israel, Suphachai said he had met with a water management consultancy which had agreed to dispatch a specialist team to find solutions to the worsening water shortage in Thailand. He said that the company was the same one which came to Thailand 7-8 years ago. But its operations stopped when the World Bank withdrew financial support for the programme. Suphachai said he also asked the Israeli government to help Thailand in agriculture, especially technology on planting crops in salty areas. "I proposed that each project should be separate from others. For example, the Chao Phya River project is one project and the Nan River another," he said. Supachai said the cost of Israel's assistance would be based on a flexible credit system. "It is likely there will be trade between the two countries in the future," he said. Supachai also said he had discussed increasing exports to Israel since "The private sector in Israel is also interested in the proposed cooperation," he said.
