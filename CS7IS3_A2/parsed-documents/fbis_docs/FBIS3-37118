The document describes the state of law and order in the republic as critical. The main reasons for this, as spelled out in the text of the edict, "are the worsening socioeconomic and political situation, a fall in people's living standards, a lowering of public morals, and the legal nihilism that has gripped society and the power structures". The president believes that the problem is so acute that it must be made a priority, a nationwide task upon which the stabilization of the situation and the fate of economic reforms in the country is depending. The edict instructs the government to work out before 1 April a state program on the strengthening of public order. Power ministries must organize the patrolling of urban streets and residential areas. To achieve this, it is being proposed that the general public be drawn into this process and that material incentives for this work be introduced. At the same time, measures are being stepped up in the procedure for checking passports. The document provides the media with the opportunity to inform the population about how the state's anti-crime program is proceeding.
