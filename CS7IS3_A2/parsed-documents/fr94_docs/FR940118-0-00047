FR940118-0-00047 FR940118-0-00013 Section 36.406 of the regulation, ``Standards for new construction and alterations,'' provides that new construction and alterations subject to the regulation shall comply with the standards for accessible design published as appendix A to the regulation. Appendix A contains the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG), which was separately published by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) as a final guideline on July 26, 1991 (56 FR 35408). On April 5, 1993, the Department issued a final rule containing technical amendments to appendix A (58 FR 17521), which incorporated technical corrections to ADAAG made by the Access Board on January 14, 1992 (57 FR 1393). Section 36.406 of the title III regulation implements sections 306(b) and 306(c) of the ADA, which require the Attorney General to promulgate standards for accessible design for buildings and facilities subject to the ADA, and require those standards to be consistent with the supplemental minimum guidelines and requirements for accessible design published by the Access Board pursuant to section 504 of the ADA. Sections 5 through 9 of appendix A are special application sections and contain additional requirements for restaurants and cafeterias, medical care facilities, business and mercantile facilities, libraries, and transient lodging. Section 10 of ADAAG, which was intended to establish special access requirements for transportation facilities, was reserved when the Department's final rule was published because the Access Board had not yet published that section of its minimum guidelines. On September 6, 1991 (56 FR 45500), the Access Board published a final rule amending the guidelines by adding final guidelines for transportation facilities as a new section 10, and on January 14, 1992 (57 FR 1393), the Access Board published a final rule making corrections to that section. On September 8, 1992 (57 FR 41006), the Access Board published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposing to amend the reach range requirements for accessible ATMs under ADAAG based on new information received in connection with a petition for rulemaking. The Access Board's proposed amendment set out the reach ranges for controls when a person using a wheelchair could make a forward approach only, a parallel approach only, or both a forward and parallel approach to an ATM. To address the reach over an obstruction resulting from recessed controls and the installation of fixtures called ``surrounds'' (which contain writing counters and bins for envelopes and waste paper), in front of ATMs, the proposed amendment included a table of reach depths and maximum heights for the placement of the controls where the reach depth to any control is more than 10 inches from a parallel approach. A detailed discussion of the proposed amendment is contained in the Access Board's proposed rule. On November 17, 1992 (57 FR 54210), the Department of Transportation issued an NPRM to amend its ADA regulations in several respects, including conforming the standards for transportation facilities to incorporate the reach range requirements for ATMs. The amendment is relevant to transportation facilities because fare vending machines are required to comply with the same requirements as ATMs. See ADAAG 10.3.1(7). On July 15, 1993 (58 FR 38204), the Access Board and the Department of Transportation published a joint final rule adopting the proposed changes to the reach range requirements for ATMs and fare vending machines. On April 5, 1993 (58 FR 17558), this Department published a proposed rule to amend appendix A to its title III regulation to include section 10 of the Access Board's final guidelines, as amended (transportation facilities), and to adopt the changes relating to the reach range requirements applicable to automated teller machines proposed by the Access Board in its September 8, 1992 (57 FR 41006) proposed rule. In the Department's proposed rule, it sated that ``[a]ll timely comments received by the Board on the proposed transportation rule issued by the Board on March 20, 1991 (56 FR 11874), and on the proposed rule relating to ATM reach ranges issued by the Board on September 8, 1992 (57 FR 41006), will be deemed by the Department to have been submitted in response to this proposed rule and will be thoroughly analyzed and considered by the Department prior to the adoption of any final rule. Therefore, it is not necessary for any timely comments submitted to the Board on those proposed rules to be resubmitted to the Department.'' Any new comments on the Department's proposed rule were due on or before May 5, 1993. Summary of Rule and Comments The Department of Justice is adopting as a final rule the accessibility guidelines for transportation facilities published by the Access Board as a final rule on September 6, 1991, as amended by the Access Board on January 14, 1992, and as further jointly amended on July 15, 1993, by the Access Board and the Department of Transportation, to reflect changes relating to reach range requirements.
