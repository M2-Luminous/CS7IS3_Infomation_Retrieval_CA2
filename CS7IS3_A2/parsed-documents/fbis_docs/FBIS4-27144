In this connection, the government plans to request the United Nations to actively pressure North Korea to change its attitude. A government authority said that the Chinese Government will not be able to oppose the principle that North Korea must reveal the actual condition of the past nuclear developments by accepting the inspection of its fuel rods. He said that since the Chinese Government's position will also be difficult if the North Korean issue is discussed on a full-scale at the United Nations, it is expected that the Chinese Government will play an active role as mediator to induce North Korea to change its attitude. He also said that there is still some room for resolving this issue through dialogue, but warned that if North Korea makes it so that the actual condition of the past nuclear developments cannot be examined because it replaces its fuel rods, discussions will be held for taking sanctions immediately at the UN level.
