Deputy Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said a first informal meeting of the 16 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation would be held on Monday to prepare the Council meeting. France requested the meeting of NATO's governing body to discuss Butrus-Ghali's request that the alliance confirm its readiness to launch air strikes against artillery positions outside Sarajevo in the wake of Saturday's massacre of civilians. Colonna said the convening of the Council would enable NATO to "announce precise, concrete measures" beyond a "simple reiteration" of measures the organisation has already adopted. "France will ask the Atlantic Council to issue a clear ultimatum" on the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo and the "repositioning of Serb and Bosnian heavy artillery" in a radius of 30 kilometres (20 miles). Colonna said the ultimatum should be "brief, precise and expressed in days." Colonna added that Paris expected Monday's meeting in Brussels of the European Community foreign ministers to issue a "strong message" giving its full backing to France's efforts towards a NATO ultimatum.
