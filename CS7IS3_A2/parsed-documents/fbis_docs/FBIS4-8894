FBIS4-8894 "dreeu075_i_94024" FBIS-EEU-94-075 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Serbs Report Attacks by Muslims, Croats Serbs Report Attacks by Muslims, Croats LD1804151894 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1459 GMT 18 Apr 94 LD1804151894 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Zvornik, April 18 (TANJUG) -- The Moslem offensive on Serb positions continued in all fronts in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as did the attacks from Gorazde despite the agreement on the immediate ceasefire in this Moslem enclave which came into force on Sunday at 5:00 P.M. local time. Bosnian Serb military sources said on Monday that the strongest Moslem actions were in the region of Doboj, Teslic, Gradacac and Mts. Trebava and Ozren (northern Bosnia) and in the region of Vlasic, Komar and Srbobran (central Bosnia). Serb-held Doboj is under continual Moslem artillery shelling which wounded three civilians during Sunday night. The continuation of the Moslem offensive on the Bosnian Serb republic (RS) is an attempt to provoke a Serb response, blame them for the attacks and thus cause new NATO air strikes, the Bosnian Serb military sources said. They warned that the Serb troops would use their legitimate right to self-defence and respond to all attacks by using all means. The sources recalled that the Serb side continually urges a ceasefire in the entire Bosnian territory and the application of political means, rather than war, to search for solutions, but that the Moslem leadership persistently refuses this. According to the Bosnian Serb military sources, fresh troops of the regular Croatian Army are massing along the left bank of the Sava river, towards Posavina (northern RS). The Croatian artillery is shelling Serb positions, also under attack by the Moslems from the south, with the aim of severing the corridor through Posavina which links the eastern and western parts of RS. In the region of Sarajevo, the Moslems are continuing provocations and engineering work close to the Serb positions, all before the very eyes of the U.N. troops, the Bosnian Serb military sources said. The sources describe as inadmissible the recent withdrawal of UNPROFOR from their positions in the Bjelasnica and Igman mountains, near Sarajevo, which the Serbs handed over to the peacekeepers last spring. Since the Moslem troops siezed the U.N. positions after their pullout, it has become clear that in question is a joint synchronized action, the Bosnian Serb sources pointed out. They said that the U.N. Protection Force is not stopping the Moslems from using a tunnel beneath the Sarajevo airport to leave the city for Hrasnica and Mt. Igman. The aim of these operations, in which the U.N. troops are taking part, either directly or indirectly, is to try to link the Moslem forces with the Gorazde region via Rogoj, central Bosnia.
