The deputies trying to promote the petition say that the aim is to "support dialogue and national reconciliation." AL-HAYAH has learned that the party most opposed to that petition is the Islamic "Jihad and Unity Front" which is represented in the National Council by Nouari Bousnan (aged 41) and Kerghali Saeed (40). Sources close to that front have told AL-HAYAH that its leader has formed an armed battalion for combating "terrorism" (the word used by the authorities to describe the Salvation Front) in the province of El Bouira (120 km east of the capital), active in Rabta mountains and in Boufadil [as transliterated] in the hills of the Kadiria District. The same sources confirm that the security forces have reinforced that battalion with some soldiers and that the initial results of the combing operations "have been encouraging." According to Algerian observers, this is the first time an Islamic party has participated in military operations alongside the Algerian security forces.
