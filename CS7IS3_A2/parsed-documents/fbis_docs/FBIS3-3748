More than a fifth of the 2,721 delegates voted against or abstained on the new budget law which outlaws deficits at all levels of government. Though no deputies spoke openly about the opposition, analysts said it appeared to represent provincial displeasure at having to reign in finances. The final vote was 2,110 for, 337 against, and 225 abstentions. Forty-nine deputies failed to press the buttons which tally results electronically. The budget law will enable central and local governments to raise funds through domestic and foreign loans, but in doing so some economically more backward areas will be at a disadvantage. As a result of yesterday's voting, Xiamen, one of the country's five special economic zones, has been empowered to enact its own laws and regulations, giving the southeastern coastal city the same legislative powers enjoyed by provincial people's congresses. The law is aimed at facilitating the economic opening up of Xiamen. While 2,307 delegates voted for it, 251 representing nearly 10 per cent of the total voted against, 144 abstained and 19 did not vote. Premier Li Peng's government Work Report, which called for a growth rate of nine per cent this year and an inflation rate of no more than 10 per cent, was overwhelmingly approved with 2,655 for, 23 against, 25 abstentions and 18 people failing to vote. The Budget, which sees a record deficit of almost 67 billion yuan (HK$59.49 billion) [Hong Kong dollars], was passed with 2,403 in favour, 178 against and 129 abstentions. "There's an imbalance of development, so the current Budget may be beneficial to the eastern area and the western area will be affected adversely," said Liu Ronghui, a deputy from Shaanxi province, explaining why there were some negative votes. The Plan for Economic and Social Development which calls for a cooling down of investment, was approved by 2,584 deputies. Opposition to the Supreme Court and Supreme Procuratorate reports was significant, with total votes against and abstentions being 335 and 464 respectively. "Some people may have some opinions about the state of social security," Mr Liu said.
