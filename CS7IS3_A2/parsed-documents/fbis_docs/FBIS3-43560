The ANC candidates -- who are assured of provincial premierships if the ANC wins the April 27 election -- are expected to learn from the experiences of Canadian provincial premiers and US state governors. Skweyiya was outlining the ANC's attempts to train a corps of civil servants to assume key posts in a post-election administration. He said about 100 civil servants had already been trained in the UK, US and Canada, and that the ANC was engaged in several public administration-related training programmes. Potential civil servants were also being hosted in southern African states. The ANC had also begun training a parliamentary unit that would advise Cabinet Ministers and the president. The unit's members would study the functioning of federal parliaments in the US, Canada and Germany. Methods of constitutional arbitration in federal states were also being studied. Skweyiya said the ANC was collating curricula vitae of people it intended sending for specialised training and had thrown its net as wide as possible to include people who did not necessarily support the ANC.
