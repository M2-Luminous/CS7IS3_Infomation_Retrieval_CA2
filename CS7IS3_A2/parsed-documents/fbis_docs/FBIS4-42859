The United States gave it the money and dictated the rules. Then the United States lent the money and took over the game. Finally, Fernando Nogueira is asking for counterpart deals, but the manufacturer is holding all the trump cards. The game is almost over, and the government is losing. The 20 F-16 fighters are vital to the defense and sovereignty of Portugal. As one Portuguese Air Force general lucidly explained, "those aircraft are an attribute of sovereignty in peacetime, in times of crisis, and in wartime. The simple reason is that it is essential that Portugal know who is using its airspace, that it have the means to deny access to that airspace if it wants to, and, mainly, that all countries know that it is capable of denying entry into our airspace." In the name of that attribute of sovereignty, Portugal is standing by with eyes on the ground and letting the United States dictate all the rules of a two-way deal--with immediate financial and industrial harm, elimination of its own will, and abandonment of its original objectives as the result--and now it is doing the same with Lockheed, the firm that manufactures the aircraft. And all because of a powerful lack of political clout, according to what is being whispered in Lisbon and said aloud in Washington, D.C. The deal began in August 1990 with the signing of the contract between Portugal, represented by the Ministry of Defense; the United States, represented by the USAF (U.S. Air Force); and the manufacturer, General Dynamics (which Lockheed bought in 1992). Quantity: 20 aircraft. Type: F-16A, Block 15 (the most advanced version of type A), all brand-new. Price: $400 million (60 million contos). Source of the money: the U.S. Administration. The fact that Portugal does not have 60 million contos with which to buy the F-16's has been a crucial issue throughout the deal. First of all, because the Portuguese Government was required to buy the aircraft from a U.S. manufacturer. Second, because the money was to be delivered over four consecutive fiscal years (1990 to 1994) in exchange for American use of the Lajes Base in the Azores. The only problem is that when it comes to business, the Americans put their own interests in first, second, and third place. The United States regarded the money as foreign aid being granted to Portugal, not as payment for the use of Lajes. In other words, the Portuguese Government did not insist on acceptance of its argument that it was receiving the money in exchange for something of value to the United States. The Americans prevailed with the idea that they were helping Portugal. A lot. The result was that Portugal never even considered demanding counterpart deals from Lockheed totaling the value of the purchase, although that is common practice in deals of this kind. The main argument in defense of that stand by the Portuguese Ministry of Defense is that U.S. law forbids the negotiation of counterpart deals when U.S. money being used for the purchase. But that is not true. Actually, Clinton said--in a statement made in April 1990 under the title "Policy on Counterpart Deals for Exports of Military Materiel"--that "no department of the U.S. Government must be directly involved or involve U.S. firms in counterpart agreements related to the sale of military materiel. The U.S. Administration's money must not be used to finance counterpart deals in transactions involving defense materiel." Fine. The only thing is that in that same statement in which he defends the interests of U.S. firms--as is proper for him to do--President Clinton is clear to the point of saying that "the decision to become involved in counterpart deals and the responsibility for negotiating and implementing counterpart contracts belongs to the companies involved." Because, "recognizing the commercial reality of those contracts in a free market, the President's policy does not restrict the negotiating rights of U.S. industry when it comes to establishing counterpart contracts with foreign purchasers of U.S. goods and services." The only possible conclusion then, and the one painfully drawn by Portuguese officials, "is that Portugal lacks the political clout to impose counterpart deals in the value of $400 million. The United States would not agree, and it would cut off the financing." At the very start of the deal, the Portuguese Government chose to sign a contract with the U.S. Administration rather than sign one with Lockheed directly. That choice has had positive and negative consequences. The department in charge of the sale was the FMS (Foreign Military Sales), an agency of the USAF. The reason for that choice, according to what SEMANARIO was told by a Portuguese officer involved in the acquisition, "is that the FMS handles all sales and hires all the subcontractors under a single contract. If we tried to do that ourselves, we would have to negotiate and sign some 40 contracts, with all the resulting delays and problems." Obviously, the FMS collects a small percentage for its services: in this case, 3 percent of the value of the sale. At the same time, the FMS operates as a system for consolidating orders, meaning that it sends the manufacturer several requisitions under a single "package," a procedure that theoretically results in lower costs. Portugal was included in the same "package" as Pakistan and the U.S. Air Force itself. A few months ago, however, a minor "windstorm" blew that order down. The United States reduced the size of its order, and for political reasons, Congress placed an embargo on the sale of F-16's to Pakistan. Even though it renegotiated and obtained a reduction in the cost of some items such as spare parts, Portugal found the price of its aircraft rising by a hefty 600,000 contos. Best of the Cheapest But on the other hand, choosing the FMS brought Portugal a few advantages, specifically in the type of F-16 chosen. These fighter planes are divided into Type A (up to Block 15) and Type C (up to Block 50). The C's, which are more advanced technologically, came about because of a stated need by the U.S. Air Force to design for itself a fighter with improved ground attack capability. The C's have more powerful engines and more weaponry. Portugal ended up with the most advanced model of the F-16A--the so-called Block 15--because it is cheaper but mainly because Portugal was able to be included in the EPG (European Group, comprising Belgium, Denmark, Norway, and Holland, which have F-16's), which is going to design a Middle-Life Upgrading (MLU) program by 1996. That program will make the F-16A's technologically equal to the F-16C Block 50's (the current state-of-the-art version of the F-16), which Greece and Turkey recently acquired. Procurement through the FMS also had another benefit for Portugal. In an effort to cooperate in keeping the price under $400 million, the Americans made a present of the Pratt & Whitney engines. Those engines had come from secondhand F-16's, but they were overhauled and updated on the USAF's assembly lines along with others for the USAF itself and ended up as top-of-the-line engines: F100-PW-220E's, the jewel in Pratt & Whitney's crown. "The best guarantee of quality that we could have," said someone who has kept tabs on the process. In November 1992, a figurative bomb exploded on the eighth floor of the Ministry of Defense, which is where Fernando Nogueira has his office. Because Congress had reduced the defense budget by $267 billion, the United States was eliminating the military equipment funds being given to Portugal annually. Three months later, an envoy from the Pentagon visited Lisbon with a solution in his briefcase: the United States would lend Portugal the shortfall at 5 percent interest. The alternative for Portugal was to cancel the purchase or find other financing. The Portuguese Government made a halfhearted protest, alleging that the U.S. Administration had not fought hard enough with Congress, but the noise it made was not very loud. And Cavaco Silva and Fernando Nogueira even accepted the loan. The outcome of a vital purchase: $225 million given by the United States and $90 million granted as a loan in 1993 at 5 percent interest. In 1994 there was another surprise. The remaining $81 million would be lent to us, but at 6.17 percent interest. Again, Portugal accepted. However, with $170 million of its own money (40 percent of the total purchase) involved, Portugal finally decided to demand counterpart deals from Lockheed. In the course of 1993, the Secretariat of State for Defense Technologies (SEETD), headed by Eugenio Ramos, sent the manufacturer several letters asking it to negotiate the matter. The only sound heard from Texas, where Lockheed's offices are located, was the wind whistling across the prairie. Until November, that is, when the SEETD--in an action agreed on with Cavaco Silva's office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs--sent a tough letter warning Lockheed that Portugal would cancel the program if negotiations on counterpart deals were not started. Lockheed Offers Very Little It did not take the Americans long to cross the Atlantic, but the first meeting was not held until a week after Eugenio Ramos--who had been directly in charge of the matter--had resigned his post. Obviously aiming low, Lockheed put $18 million on the table. Its proposal was rejected by the Portuguese. First of all because, as is true in any deal of this kind, they were entitled to demand 100 percent of the purchase value in counterpart deals. Second, because a cabinet decision approved in 1987 requires that very thing. Inexplicably, however, Fernando Nogueira went to Texas in February to accept the first two aircraft. As an adviser involved in the deal says, "Portugal weakened its negotiating position by accepting the aircraft. It should not have done so until all the negotiations were concluded." Lockheed had stated at a meeting in January that it would not go beyond $42 million worth of counterpart deals, as SEMANARIO reported exclusively in March. For its part, Portugal wants $90 million. Oddly, the argument used by the Ministry of Defense is that that is the amount being received by Lockheed. But that is not true. What is really happening is that Lockheed has hired a number of subcontractors--several dozen of them--as is usually the case when "complex machines" such as the F-16 are being manufactured. To mention just the main ones, Westinghouse is supplying the radar, McDonnell Douglas the injection system, Linton the laser, General Electric the cannon, and the TEC the video system, while the EPG is supplying 20 components of the aircraft structure itself. However, Lockheed is responsible for hiring those subcontractors and sharing the profits, so Portugal is fully justified in demanding counterpart deals corresponding to the sales amount that will be collected by the prime manufacturer. SEMANARIO has learned exactly how the cake will be divided up: $240 million for Lockheed and $160 million for the FMS. By using Lockheed's isolated share of the profits as its reference point, the Portuguese Government is unquestionably lowering its own stake. In terms of Lockheed's $240 million and in terms of the $171 million that Portugal will have to pay out. And as experts involved in the negotiations unhesitatingly admit, "between the $42 million being offered by Lockheed and the $90 million being demanded by the Portuguese, the negotiations are going to lead to some figure in between, as is natural." The difference adds up to quite a few million dollars that a weak industry cannot afford to throw away. Counterpart Deals Are Essential When complex equipment as marketable as the F-16 is being acquired, counterpart deals are absolutely essential to the purchaser. The main counterpart deals in this case involve technology transfer, future subcontracts for Portuguese firms enabling them to manufacture and repair aircraft components, and the purchase of goods and services in Portugal. A memorandum presented by Lockheed and based on the $42 million being proposed by that firm--it will soon be discussed in Lisbon at the same time that the negotiations are being concluded--names the Portuguese Air Force, the EID [expansion not given], Edisoft, and TAP [Portuguese Airways] as the main beneficiaries of the counterpart deals. There is no doubt that Portugal needs the F-16's. There is no doubt that it ought to have conducted the negotiations differently from the start. A clearheaded Portuguese general puts it all very clearly: "We should have come up with the money ourselves. We could have said what we wanted and gotten all the manufacturers to do what they promised. We could have chosen the best." Exactly.
