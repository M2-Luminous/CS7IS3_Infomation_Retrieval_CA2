FR940804-0-00106 FR940804-0-00024 In formulating this uniform rule, the Department has not disregarded existing state ethics rules, as a number of comments imply. As set forth in section 77.12, this regulation is specifically intended to fit within the structure of DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2, as well as analogous state and local district court disciplinary rules. Both DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 provide that communications that are ``authorized by law'' are exempted from the general prohibition of the rule and, according to the Reporter for the commission that developed the Model Rules, Yale Law School ethics professor Geoffrey Hazard, this exception was drafted with the ``government lawyer'' problem in mind. See Letter of January 19, 1994 from Professor Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. to Chief Justice E. Norman Veasey, at 2 (``I can state from first-hand knowledge that this [authorized by law] qualification was drafted mindful of the government lawyer problem, among others. In my opinion it is within the authority of the federal government, particularly the Justice Department, to promulgate such regulations.'') (This letter and all comments are on file with the Office of the Associate Attorney General, United States Department of Justice). As explained later in this commentary, the Department's position is that communications with represented persons undertaken pursuant to this duly promulgated regulation clearly constitute communications ``authorized by law.'' Therefore, in nearly all jurisdictions, communications approved under the Department's rules will be appropriate under existing ethical rules as well. Furthermore, the content of this rule derives largely from DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 and is wholly consistent with the principles underlying these rules. This regulation grants greater latitude for lawyer communications with a represented ``person'' during the investigative phase of law enforcement than with a represented ``party'' after adversarial proceedings have commenced. This distinction appears in the texts of DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2, which prohibit only communications with ``a party'' the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter. This distinction also accords with the great weight of federal court interpretations of the state ethics rules. See Ryans , 903 F.2d at 739 (``We are not convinced that the language of [the anti-contact rule] calls for its application to the investigative phase of law enforcement'' because ``the rule appears to contemplate an adversarial relationship between litigants, whether in a criminal or a civil setting''); United States v. Sutton , 801 F.2d 1346, 1365&hyph;66 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (anti-contact rule ``was never meant to apply to [pre-indictment, non-custodial] situations such as this one''); United States v. Dobbs, 711 F.2d 84, 86 (8th Cir. 1983) (agent's ``noncustodial interview of [suspect] prior to the initiation of judicial proceedings against the appellant did not constitute an ethical breach''); United States v. Fitterer, 710 F.2d 1328, 1333 (8th Cir.)

Jamil, 707 F.2d 638 (2d Cir. 1983) (prosecutor's use of undercover informant in pre-indictment, non-custodial setting to communicate with represented person does not violate DR 7&hyph;104); United States v.

Weiss, 599 F.2d 730, 739&hyph;40 (5th Cir. 1979) (prosecutor's investigatory communications upheld against challenge under anti-contact rule); United States v. Lemonakis, 485 F.2d 941, 953&hyph;56 (D.C.

Infelise, 773 F. Supp. 93, 95 n.3 (N.D. Ill. 1991) (DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) ``speaks in terms of communications with a `party', suggesting that the rule is to be applied only when adversarial proceedings have been initiated''); United States v. Western Electric Co. , 1990&hyph;2 Trade Cases (CCH) ¶69,148, at 64,314 & n.6 (D.D.C. 1990); United States v. Buda, 718 F. Supp. 1094, 1096 (W.D.N.Y. 1989); United States v. Chestman, 704 F. Supp. 451, 454 (S.D.N.Y. 1989), rev'd on other grounds, 903 F.2d 75 (2d Cir. 1990), aff'd in part, 947 F.2d 551 (2d Cir. 1991) (en banc); United States v. Galanis, 685 F.

Hammad, 858 F.2d 834, 839 (2d Cir. 1988) (pre-indictment communications may be improper if accompanied by ``misconduct'' on the part of the government), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 871 (1990); United States v. Pinto, 850 F.2d 927, 935 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 867 (1988); United States v. Sam Goody, Inc. , 518 F. Supp. 1223, 1224&hyph;25 n.3 (E.D.N.Y. 1981), appeal dismissed, 675 F.2d 17 (2d Cir. 1982); see also Comment to ABA Model Rule 4.2 (notwithstanding use of the term ``party,'' the rule does not require that a person be ``a party to a formal legal proceeding''). The courts have readily recognized that Department attorneys engaged in criminal and civil law enforcement matters perform distinctly different functions from attorneys engaged in the private practice of law. The courts have further recognized that the rules governing communications with represented persons should take account of these differences. To disregard these differences would therefore impose substantial and deleterious restrictions on the legitimate law enforcement duties of Department attorneys that do not presently exist.
