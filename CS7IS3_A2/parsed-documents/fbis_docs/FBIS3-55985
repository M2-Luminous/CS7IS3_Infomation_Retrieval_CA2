The State Court in the ruling says such means of police surveillance and their usage as stipulated by the government regulations may restrict the citizens' constitutional rights and freedoms. The police law amendments allowed for special means, such as phone-tapping and reading of citizens' letters, to be used by the Defense Police in some cases. The amendments law, however, also stipulated that such means could be used only following a respective permission from the head of the State Court or a State Court member to whom the court's head has referred the powers to issue such permission. The amendments, originally meant to remain in effect until the adoption of a separate law, left it largely with security police officials and one State Court member to determine what means of investigation and police surveillance were to be regarded as special measures and in which cases these were to be used. The Estonian parliament passed the police law amendments on April 21, 1993. The chancellor of law, Eerik-Juhan Truuvali, first referred to constitutional stipulations and requested that the parliament annulled the amendments. Truuvali sought a State Court ruling on the issue after the parliament made no move toward bringing the law into accordance with the constitution. Both rulings adopted by the State Court today are effective immediately on adoption, final, and cannot be referred to any other court of appeal. The Defense Police on several occasions recently has obtained from the State Court the right to use extraordinary means of surveillance. For instance, Defense Police tapped the phones of some members of the so-called Pullapaa volunteer infantry company during last summer's crisis, when the unit had announced its independence from the defense forces Main Staff. The prosecution service law, a legislation designed to finally regulate the usage of special means of police surveillance, has by now passed the first reading in the parliament. According to the draft, permission to use phone-tapping in investigation has to be sought from administrative courts.
