Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz had said the negotiations would be held in mid-January in New York. But the UN official said they would now open at the end of the month or in early February. "The two sides are busy compiling the necessary documents before the next round of negotiations," the official told AFP, asking not to be named. "They need two weeks to prepare for the meeting." He also said that long-term monitoring of Iraq's post-war weapons programmes "has in effect started." Aziz informed the United Nations on November 27 that Baghdad accepted long-term monitoring, under the terms of the ceasefire to the 1991 Gulf war which drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. Iraq is expected to argue at the New York talks that it has met the conditions for the lifting of the embargo, which was imposed after its August 1990 invasion of the emirate. But Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN disarmament commission, has proposed a six-month trial period for long-term monitoring before an end to the embargo.
