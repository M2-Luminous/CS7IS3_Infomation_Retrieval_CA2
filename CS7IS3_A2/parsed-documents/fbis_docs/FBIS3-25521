According to unofficial figures, opposition parties had taken 40 of the 81 seats in the National Assembly after Sunday's second round of voting, with only three constituency results still to be decided. However, the National Electoral Commission in the small West African country failed to release any figures early in the day. Twenty-four of the parliamentary seats were at stake in the run- off round of Togo's first multi-party general elections, with the opposition sure of taking 12 seats and well placed in seven other constituencies. Violent incidents occurred in three of the 11 constituencies where opposition candidates were directly up against supporters of General Eyadema, who has ruled Togo for 27 years. In the first round on February 6, Eyadema's backers took 35 seats, against 22 for the opposition. On Sunday, some 30 polling stations in Sokode, 315 kilometres (195 miles) north of Lome, and in Notse, 100 kilometres (60 miles), were closed prematurely after attacks by gangs of armed men. In the evening, a score of polling stations in a Lome constituency were raided as officials counted the votes, but sources close to the president's office played down the violence, declaring that the poll had been largely calm. Both the main opposition leaders, Yao Agboyibo of the Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) and Edem Kodjo of the Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD) protested about the unrest. "The violence gives us the feeling that the authorities are not ready to accept free elections that could lead to an opposition victory," Agboyibo told AFP, while Kodjo complained of "total disorder" in some constituencies. International observers from Burkina Faso, France, Germany, Egypt and the United States acknowledged that the poll had been troubled, but the head of the monitoring team, Burkina Faso's Hermann Yameogo, said the vote had gone "relatively well" with a "good" turnout. In the Haho South constituency in the Notse district, this correspondent on Sunday saw electors waiting to vote being attacked by armed men who injured two women at one site, and fled in a minibus with ballot boxes. Haho South was one of the 11 wards contested as head-to-heads between Eyadema's Togolese People's Party (RPT) and opposition forces led by the CAR. The vote marks the culmination of a troubled transition to democracy set in motion in August 1991, and could spell the end of Eyadema's 27-year-long monopoly on power. The armed men, who travelled between polling booths in a minibus with covered number plates, were wearing T-shirts bearing the insignia of the Union of Forces for Change (UFC), an opposition party in exile which demanded a boycott of the poll. The UFC's Lome representative denied his party had ordered the attacks, which CAR leader Agboyibo blamed on the RPT. The campaign leading up to the run-off round of voting saw two bomb attacks and the deaths in a fire of three opposition activists, among them a deputy elected to parliament in the first round. Under the constitution, the president must designate as prime minister a member of the party in majority in parliament. The results of the second round must be sent to the Supreme Court for official proclamation by midnight Wednesday at the latest, and the new assembly will be officially installed on March 1.
