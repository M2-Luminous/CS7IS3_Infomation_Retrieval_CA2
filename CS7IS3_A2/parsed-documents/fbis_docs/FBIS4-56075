We have a solution and our own state. We are willing to discuss territories but on condition that the sanctions are lifted and a peace established, Karadzic said in an interview to Uzice paper VESTI. He added that these two states should immediately be recognized. Commenting diplomatic moves for speeding up the peace process, Karadzic underscored that the Serb side had told Cyrus Vance, Lord David Owen and Vitaliy Churkin that, if they want to succeed, they should coordinate their efforts with the Serbs' interests. He said that a new peace conference can succeed only if a solution is not imposed on the Serbs. The end of the war is close because our enemies have tried everything and have clearly faced their own powerlessness, Karadzic said and added that this powerlessness clashed with the legitimate and justified will of the Serb people and their centuries-old wish to finally set up their own state. Karadzic believes that the next moves of the Muslim-Croat side will be a new offensive out of one of the `safe areas' -- Tuzla or Bihac. We will defend ourselves for a time, then we will publically warn them, as in the case of Gorazde, and openly say that we will launch a counteroffensive in which case they will start wailing and the entire world will then try to save them and create their state, Karadzic said.
