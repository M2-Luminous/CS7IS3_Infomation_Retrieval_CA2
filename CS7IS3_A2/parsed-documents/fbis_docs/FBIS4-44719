According to the manufacturer, the German DASA group, the 45-minute flight went without hitches. Scheduled for last fall, this first flight had to be delayed due to difficulties encountered in fine tuning the aircraft's electric controls. Seven prototypes will be assembled. Financed by Great Britain (37.5 percent), Germany (30 percent), Italy (19.5 percent) and Spain (13 percent), the Eurofighter program met with significant vexation, and, when set against the originally established goals, it has been delayed two years owing to technical, industrial and political disagreements between the four involved European countries. Series production is slated to begin only in 1996 or 1997. The global cost (development and production) of all the four hundred crafts ordered is evaluated at $47 billion (i.e., 268 billion French francs). At the time of the program's launching, the four countries had announced their intentions to buy more than 760 Eurofighter planes. But the cost of the aircraft had forced Germany to tone down its ambitions, going as far as to quit the program altogether if the price of an aircraft could not be reduced by 30 percent. Italy and Spain are in the same mind frame. Only the United Kingdom, for which this is a unique military aircraft under consideration, let it be known that it could buy more.
