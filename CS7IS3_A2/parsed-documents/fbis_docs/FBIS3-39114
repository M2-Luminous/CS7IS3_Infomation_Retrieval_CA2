And everyone knows that the West now finally has to come to a decision: Does it want to counter the killing with military force after all, or does it capitulate to terror? The West has been shying away from the decision to intervene for 22 months; this is how long Sarajevo has now been besieged. For every day since the beginning of the siege, 15 people have been killed. With bewilderment we watch a European city being strangled, the people being deprived of dignity and life. Week after week the poison of growing accustomed has increasingly paralyzed our thinking. Whoever does not see any practical way out, always finds intellectual excuses for doing nothing. We have shouldered the burden of the unbearable easily; after all, one can live well in the neighborhood, even in times of war. What, however, are we going to answer when our children ask us one day: What did you do when Sarajevo died? The poison of growing accustomed acts slowly, but reliably. Conscience gradually goes to the dogs in the process. After all, it has been expected to tolerate a lot during the Balkan war so far: - "ethnic cleansing," the driving away of millions from their homes in the name of nationalist mania; - concentration camps full of emaciated prisoners, rigid with terror behind the barbed wire; - mass rape as a dirty weapon of war and the most miserable humiliation; - hunger blockades, which are supposed to break the will to survive of the defenseless civilian population and demonstrate the helplessness of the UN helpers; - destroyed mosques, burned out libraries, bombed hospitals and schools, artillery attacks on the old city of Dubrovnik and the bridge of Mostar; - torture and thousands of brutal, vile murders. Horrible pictures; they passed before our, the audience's, eyes. Finally, we resigned ourselves to them. Not without reasons of realpolitik. The arguments were provided by the military: The quicksand of the Balkans will unavoidably devour everyone who is crazy enough to intervene in the war. Thus, hands off. The only thing that could be done was to provide humanitarian aid. Even that cannot be forced. After the massacre of Sarajevo the failure of this realpolitik has finally become obvious. Because the European Union, the United Nations, and NATO have not countered the violence with determination a single time, because every drunk militiaman was able to stop the UN convoys, because the blue helmets were permitted to record only the number of salvos fired while standing beside the guns, because the international community has acted with such terrible helplessness, it has practically supported new violence. The moral defeat is joined by the foreign policy disaster. There have been too many resolutions without consequences, too many broken promises, too many empty threats. If the United Nations and NATO do not act now, either, their credibility and integrity will be lost for a long time. Just a month ago at the summit in Brussels NATO confirmed its readiness to "carry out air strikes in order to prevent the strangling of Sarajevo, the protection zones, and other endangered areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina." On the weekend, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali called on NATO to prepare for air strikes at Serbian positions. Everyone knows that bombing the artillery positions in the mountains around Sarajevo or firing missiles at the besiegers of Tuzla and Srebrenica will not end the war, because military force can never settle this conflict. However, one must finally set a sign against the mass murder in Bosnia -- 200,000 dead in two years. "Words of dismay are no longer sufficient," Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the UN rapporteur for the former Yugoslavia, told the Geneva Human Rights Commission. No sensible person will underestimate the enormous risks that a military intervention entails. The Serbs could retaliate against the lightly armed blue helmets and thus further endanger the deliveries of aid to the starving civilian population. The Muslims could feel encouraged in their resistance against a compromise at the negotiations. The NATO attacks could hit innocent people. The war could escalate further. However, this is not likely. When U.S. President Clinton threatened with attacks last year, the Serbs gave in immediately. When nothing happened, they once again stepped up the pressure on the besieged towns. At the Geneva negotiations their aggression has always been rewarded so far, and the same goes for the aggression of the Croats. The negotiators of the European Union and the United Nations could negotiate in a much tougher way if the diplomatic efforts were backed up by credible military pressure. It is a terribly difficult decision. Everyone who weighs the pros and cons feels torn apart. Are the potential negative consequences of intervention more important than the visible consequences of nonintervention? On the other hand: Could not thousands still be alive if the international community had thought of its responsibility in time? Historical memory might make the decision of one's conscience easier: Shevaq Weiss, the president of the Israeli Knesset, addressed a moving appeal to the five permanent members of the UN Security Council: "The continuing actions of genocide in Bosnia are a sign of shame for human society." And he added: "We, as members of a people that was the victim of such massacres while the world looked on in silence, cannot participate in such a cover-up." If Europe does not want to betray its civilization once again in this blood-soaked century, it must counter the barbarism with military force.
