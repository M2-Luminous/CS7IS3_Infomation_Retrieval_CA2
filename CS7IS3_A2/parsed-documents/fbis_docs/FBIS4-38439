Yeltsin in Moscow 27 May: "Boris Yeltsin: We Have No Surplus Land. Russian Federation President's Speech at Ceremonial Meeting Devoted To Border Guard Day, 27 May 1994"] [Text] Esteemed Border Guards! Dear Veterans! I first want to cordially congratulate all defenders of the border and also your families on your professional holiday -- Border Guard Day. On behalf of the whole Russian people I express my thanks and gratitude to you for your selfless service to the fatherland! There are veterans of the Border Guards in this room. Several generations of Russian citizens have been raised on your exploits. I express sincere gratitude to you for your feats of arms defending the borders of our motherland. I do not doubt that you are still at your posts. Your experience and knowledge are needed even today. Russian border guards worthily preserve and continue the traditions of older generations. On this day I cannot fail to point out that in 1993-1994 alone six servicemen in the Border Guards were awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation [RF]. More than 400 border guards have been awarded Russian orders and medals. Russia's border guards protect the borders of our fatherland sometimes at the cost of their own blood. They sometimes pay with their lives to ensure the security of the state and uphold Russia's interests. We bow our heads to those who have died defending the borders of our fatherland. We will always remember them, their feats in the name of Russia. I ask you to observe a minute's silence in glorious memory of those who died doing their military duty. Esteemed Border Guards! I think that you will understand me if I talk first about the problems facing the border guards today, on the eve of your professional holiday, our common holiday. Our fundamental aim is to build a strong democratic state. One of its main attributes being effective protection of the State Border. In many respects it is here that the fate of Russia's territorial integrity, sovereignty, and security is decided. In two weeks the Federal Border Service [FBS] will celebrate its second anniversary. You are having to work in an extremely complex and in many respects new situation. Tense conditions of service, the lack of amenities for units and subunits on the new borders, and other difficulties have been unable to disrupt your work. The fundamental reorganization of the system of guarding Russia's border is being actively carried out with consideration for the new geopolitical situation. I assess positively the work to systematically withdraw border guard groupings from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Azerbaijan and deploy them on the border with the Baltic countries and in the North Caucasus. The Western Group of Border Guards and the Caucasus Special Border District have been created within a very short period. The Border Guards are taking an active part in maintaining a stable situation on Russia's borders and the external borders of the Commonwealth states. I want to underline the importance of the tasks that you are preforming in the hot spots and particularly in the combat conditions on the Tajik-Afghan border. Far from the motherland our border guards are guarding its national interests. Let me be blunt and say that they are defending Russia from war with might and main. Personnel have remained loyal to their duty, manifesting their best qualities. On all the borders the border guards are largely successful in performing their tasks. The period that has seen the formation of the FBS can be said to be coming to an end. The foundations of qualitatively new troops have been laid. A base for their development exists. The State Border is defended in spite of everything. And I am convinced that the stability of Russia's borders will continue to grow stronger. A conference with the FBS leadership has just come to an end. I can say on the basis of its results that as president I fully support the line being implemented by your Service. The correct course has been taken of organizing a civilized Russian border. It accords with the principles of a democratic, federative, rule-of-law state which are enshrined in the RF Constitution. While there is no concept of national security the FBS shoulders a considerable share of the responsibility for Russia's fate. It cannot be any other way! Adopting a formal approach and waiting for instructions -- in our conditions -- is the best sign that things will go wrong. Now when state mechanisms are being fine-tuned and when the normative base is still only being formed initiative -- responsible initiative, furthermore -- is not just a boon but the most important factor of the viability of the state. I am glad that the FBS is up to the task. You have set a high standard and are actively searching for new and original solutions. I thank you for this, Andrey Ivanovich Nikolayev, I thank you all. Border troops face new and more complex tasks. Previously the State Border was a frontier which divided our country from the world and partitioned off the peoples. Now we have to ensure that the border becomes an impregnable wall only to threats to Russian national interests and the security of the state. The border must be closed to terrorism, drugs trafficking, smuggling, and illegal immigration by foreigners. The most important task facing border troops is to prevent armed provocation. At the same time the State Border must not be an artificial obstacle to the development of cooperation, business contacts, communication between people, and spiritual ties. We will create a firm legal basis for that. Russia needs a long-term state border policy. I can state with full responsibility that we have a clear notion of the borders and zones of protection of Russian interests. We can see clearly the role and place of the FBS in the national security system. It is your service which is called upon to organize the elaboration of border policy and establish stable cooperation with all the interested departments in implmenting it. In this connection I shall express our fundamental position: Russia has no territorial claims on any country. We want the civilized solution of the border demarcation problem. But we will firmly defend the interests of the Russian Federation's territorial integrity. We in Russia have no surplus or unnecessary land! Experience in the adoption of well-balanced state decisions on border questions is now being accumulated. You have an insider's understanding of all these problems. And is it you who must take a clear stand and uphold it more boldly. The protection of the border is not just a matter for the Border Troops. It is a most important task for the whole state, all state structures, components of the federation, and organs of power in the border regions. At the conference with your leadership we discussed the results of Putina-94, the border operations in the South Kurils sector, and Zaslon-4, the border operations in the Pskov sector, and a number of other operations. They are important not just as realistic examples of cooperation among border troops, army men, sailors, intelligence and counterintelligence officers, the customs services, and local organs of power. Such operations produce a tremendous economic effect which can be calculated in billions of rubles. It is hard to overestimate the political significance of these operations. The more actively we conduct them the more Russia will be respected in the international arena. But even that is not the main thing. The first reports on Zaslon and Putina produced a sigh of relief from many people. "At last they have begun to establish order! At last they have dealt a blow to those who are tearing our national assets to shreds." Each of your successes restores people's hope, dignity, and sense of pride in their country. The important thing is that such operations should not be irregular but systematic in character. They must be held in other sectors at land and sea. Act energetically and resolutely in the future, too. Know that the Russian leadership and I will give you support. Russia's interests in all sections of the state border must be reliably protected. Russia's borders are new. A significant part of them adjoin new states. There is much work ahead to ensure their definitive shaping and equipping. What are the approaches to the protection of the border by the Border Troops of the Russian Federation? The issue here must not be solely the use of force to protect our borders. State border policy must be based first and foremost on political and diplomatic approaches. This presumes the peaceful and nonviolent solution of disputes as they arise, the development of cooperation in the protection of the border with neighboring states, and the use of armed forces and methods only in extreme circumstances. It is necessary to involve the inhabitants of border regions, especially the Cossacks, in the protection of the border. Especially since they have expressed a desire to do that. It is important to do this primarily in the new areas of the border where such traditions have not been established yet. The specifics of the political situation demand a differentiated approach to the protection of the borders. I shall dwell on that question in greater detail. With such states as Norway and Finland, for example, Russia has firm relations of partnership. Our borders are equipped and their protection must be carried out on principles of good-neighborliness and cooperation. As for the Baltic countries, Russia advocates the development of good-neighborliness with Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia and the expansion of cooperation with them. But these states do not belong to the CIS and therefore the border regime there must be a full-fledged one [polnotsennyy]. Its protection must be organized correspondingly. Russia's border with Belarus is transparent. The external border is protected here by Belarus. We have assumed commitments to participate in shared financing of its border structures. The question of protecting the Russian-Belarusian border does not figure on the agenda. The protection of the border with Ukraine will be structured in keeping with the measures taken by the Ukrainian side. We have discussed this today at the conference. But, given the common history of our peoples, we would like to resolve this task through joint efforts. I endorse the Federal Border Service's efforts in organizing the protection of the border in the Caucasus along two lines -- on the external borders of the states of Georgia and Armenia and on Russia's state border. At the same time, it is essential to step up the work of preparing the Memorandum on Joint Protection of the Borders in this area. Everyone knows that there are outstanding issues here. These relate to questions of our security -- not just the security of the state but the security of actual citizens and their families. They must be resolved as quickly as possible. A good basis for developing the cooperation of Commonwealth border structures has been created in the Central Asian region, namely the Memorandum on the Joint Protection of External Borders. Collaboration on this basis should be increased and consolidated. Attention must also be paid to strengthening the protection of the border with Mongolia. Given the dynamics of our relations with China, I also regard it as feasible to carry out the protection of the state border here on the principles of cooperation. It is essential to improve the protection of the border in the Arctic and Pacific regions and to take measures to defend Russia's economic interests. Interstate cooperation in border protection is an important function of the border service. Such cooperation has already become a reality in a number of sections of the state border. And we maintain that line. It is important to apply this experience not just to the border structures of Commonwealth states but to those of other neighboring countries too. This is a real mechanism for guaranteeing collective security. This is the way toward consolidating stability. And not just on the border but in the states themselves. The border troops's participation in active peacemaking activity is equally important. This is a new task for border troops. You are successfully tackling it in the North Caucasus and the Central Asian regions. It is difficult to overestimate its significance! I will say frankly that you have saved thousands of lives of citizens of not just Russia but certain other Commonwealth states too. Participation in maintaining political stability in the Russian border zone is an important area of activity for border troops. The border troops have always been active exponents of state policy in the border regions, and people have understood you. Given the special nature of this moment, I regard this task as a priority. It is essential to develop small-scale diplomacy -- the work of border missions and other forms of cooperation among border structures -- everywhere. You will thereby help to the maximum extent the conduct of the Russian Federation's foreign policy course. I want to draw special attention to the need to tighten up military discipline without fail. I am convinced that the task of reliably protecting the border cannot be resolved unless the task of strengthening law and order within the troops is resolved. Esteemed border troops, You are faced with large-scale and difficult tasks. Their successful fulfilment will depend on the sense of responsibility, initiative, and effectiveness of the command and staffs and the coordinated work of all organs of command and control. It is essential to bring the Law "On the Russian Federation State Border" and other state and then departmental statutory instruments into line with the Constitution as rapidly as possible. I keep a constant watch on the preparation of laws, the absence of which creates a vacuum in the defense of Russia's political and economic interests on its state boreder. I know that the border troops are beset by quite a few acute and painful problems. They are basically down to the pretty difficult socioeconomic situation that obtains in the country. We will help you solve them primarily by provision of finance, facilities, and accommodations. We will take measures to enhance the social and legal protection afforded servicemen, members of their families, and veterans. I stress that this will be done by enhancing, not reducing, protection. Various rumors circulate in places on this question. Therefore I confirm my position of principle: I will not -- as president -- allow any restriction on the social and legal benefits enjoyed by servicemen. From time immemorial the Russian people have regarded the border troops with love and respect. I am sure that we will remain true to that glorious tradition. You protect the borders of the fatherland. The border troops are supported in this by the huge might of Russia. Russia knows and believes that you protect its peace and security, whatever this may cost you. Once again I congratulate the generals, admirals, officers, warrant officers, petty officers, sergeants, soldiers, and sailors of the Border Troops, workers and employees, and members of the families of border troops on your upcoming professional holiday. I wish you, esteemed border troops, success in the difficult service you perform on behalf of the Russian state! I would ask you to convey my sincere congratulations on your holiday to all those who perform border service on the borders of the motherland and to your nearest and dearest!
