FR940603-0-00056 FR940603-0-00025 The GSC becomes thermally stratified during the spring and summer months. Surface waters typically range from 3 to 17 â—‹C between winter and summer. Salinity is stable throughout the year at approximately 32&hyph;33 parts per thousand (Hopkins and Garfield, 1979). Much of the bottom is comprised of silty, sandy sediments, with finer sediments occurring in the deeper waters. The late-winter/early spring mixing of warmer shelf waters with the cold Gulf of Maine water funneled through the channel causes a dramatic increase in faunal productivity in the area. The zooplankton fauna found in these waters are typically dominated by copepods, specifically C. finmarchicus, P. minutus, C. typicus, C. hamatus, and Metridia lucens. From the middle of winter to early summer, C. finmarchicus and P. minutus are the dominant species, which together made up between 60 and 90 percent of the samples described by Sherman et al. (1987). In late spring, C. finmarchicus alone makes up 60 to 70 percent of the copepod community. In the second half of the year, both species of Centropages dominate the waters, accounting for about 75 percent of all copepod species sampled. The GSC right whale distribution was described by Kenney, Winn and Macaulay (1994), and the following, unless otherwise cited, is taken from that manuscript. Right whales occur in the GSC on a strictly seasonal basis_in the spring, with a peak in May. Only in 1986 and 1987 were a small number of right whales present throughout most or all of the summer. This corresponds to the atypical copepod density maxima in the GSC and southern Gulf of Maine described by Wishner et al. (1988) and Payne et al. (1990). The main area of GSC right whale distribution has been in the central basin, generally in waters deeper than 100 m. There is a persistent thermal front, which roughly parallels the V-shaped 100-m isobath typically slightly south of that isobath in 60&hyph;70 m of water. The front divides stratified waters with warmer surface temperatures to the north of the front from tidally mixed water with cooler surface temperatures over the shallower area south of the front (Wishner et al., 1988; Brown and Winn, 1989). Right whales occur in the stratified waters north of the front, and Brown and Winn (1989) showed that right whale sightings were non-randomly distributed relative to the front, but were at a median distance from it of about 11 km. Although there are variations between years, the ``typical'' pattern is for the primary right whale aggregation to occur in the central to western portion of the basin. Within any one year, the general area of major aggregation is remarkably stable. A gradual southward shift in the center of distribution occurs as the season progresses. Single-day abundance estimates for the GSC, uncorrected for animals missed while submerged, ranged up to 179 individuals (Kenney, Winn and Macauley, 1994). The total number of photographically identified northern right whales is now 319, eliminating those known to have died, but including some that have not been sighted for several years and that may be dead (Kraus et al., 1993). Therefore, it is likely that a significant proportion of the western North Atlantic right whale population uses the GSC as a feeding area each spring, aggregating to exploit exceptionally dense copepod patches. Given that not all of the 300&hyph;350 right whales are seen in U.S. shelf waters each season, it is very likely that most, if not all, of the northern right whale population use the GSC within any given season, and that every 2&hyph;3 years, the entire population of 300&hyph;350 northern right whales in the northwest Atlantic may pass through the GSC. Cape Cod Bay: The CCB is a large embayment on the U.S. Atlantic Ocean off of the State of Massachusetts that is bounded on three sides by Cape Cod and the Massachusetts coastline from Plymouth, MA, south. To the north, CCB opens to Massachusetts Bay and the Gulf of Maine. CCB has an average depth of about 25 m, and a maximum depth of about 65 m. The deepest area of CCB is in the northern section, bordering Massachusetts Bay.
