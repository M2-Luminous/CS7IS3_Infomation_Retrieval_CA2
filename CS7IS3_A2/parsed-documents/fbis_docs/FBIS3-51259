The 109th military judge found the aircraft's black box recently. The aircraft, a Russian MI-17 helicopter imported to Colombia by the Heli-Taxi Company, was rented to the Colombian Air Force, which, in turn, turned it over to the Army. [Begin recording] [First unidentified speaker remarks in Russian] [Second unidentified speaker] He says it is film like photographic camera film, meaning it melts at high temperatures. [Unidentified female judge] Correct. In my opinion, this is decided by a technician, an expert on the matter. [First unidentified speaker] Obviously. [Second unidentified] Obviously. [Unidentified female judge] Therefore, no one knows the truth for sure right now. [end recording] The helicopter was carrying a prosecutor and a military judge who were in charge of the investigation in connection with the assassination of 14 military members in (Huican), Boyaca Department, by guerrilla forces. The 11 occupants were only part of the cargo. Most of the weight was in supplies and provisions that were being carried to the counterguerrilla battalions camped in the flatlands of (Huican), particularly explosives, grenades, and ammunition, which exploded in the crash. One of the survivors, Sergeant Martin Francisco Alvarez, who is now at the San Jose Hospital in Tunja, has told his wife what happened during the last seconds of the fateful flight. [Begin recording] [Esperanza Clarson] The helicopter did not crash. It lost altitude and then--I do not know--I believe it crashed; that is why he was saved. There was a second door, and he escaped through there. He crawled out. [Uribe] What did he do then? [Clarson] He hit the ground, and that was when the helicopter exploded. [Unidentified speaker] No, the helicopter did not explode. It looked kind of lopsided, like when there are too many passengers, meaning excess weight, and it crashed against this house. [end recording] The aircraft pilot was retired Air Force Major Jorge Hernan Lopera, and Juan Castillo Flores, a Nicaraguan technician, acted as copilot. They also managed to survive and are being questioned since yesterday in connection with the accident. The two pilots, both the Colombian and the Nicaraguan, are employees of the company that owns the aircraft, and they have no ties with the Colombian Armed Forces.
