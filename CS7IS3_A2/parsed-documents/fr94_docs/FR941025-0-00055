FR941025-0-00055 FR941025-0-00018 One comment requested that the regulations clarify the use of the term ``highest adjacent grade'' compared to the term ``existing grade'' that is used in the statute. The term ``highest adjacent grade'' is used in the interim final rule at paragraph 60.3(f)(3)(i). This paragraph establishes the elevation that must be used for applying the floodplain management requirements in areas within Zone AR designated as a ``developed area'' for new construction and in other areas in Zone AR where the AR flood depth is five feet or less. In these areas, the requirement is to apply the lower of either the AR base flood elevation or the elevation that is three feet above highest adjacent grade. FEMA used the term ``highest adjacent grade'' since it is already defined in the regulations. ``Highest adjacent grade'' in the NFIP regulations is defined as ``the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure''. The definition in the regulations provides guidance on the reference point from which to measure the elevation of three feet when a proposed site is sloped. Also, by applying a single reference point, communities can consistently apply the elevation requirements to structures. Therefore, FEMA does not believe the term ``highest adjacent grade'' is inconsistent with the Act. National Environmental Policy Act FEMA has determined, based upon an environmental assessment, that this interim final rule will not have a significant impact upon the quality of the human environment. As a result, an Environmental Impact Statement will not be prepared. A finding of no significant impact is included in the formal docket file and is available for public inspection and copying at the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street, SW., Washington, DC 20472. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Director certifies that this interim final rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because the proposed flood control restoration zone is required by statute, 42 U.S.C. 4014(f), and is required to enhance and maintain community eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program during the period needed to restore flood protection systems to provide a minimum 100-year level of protection required for accreditation on National Flood Insurance Program maps. A regulatory flexibility analysis has not been prepared. Paperwork Reduction Act This interim final rule contains collections of information as described the Paperwork Reduction Act that are covered by the following OMB Control Numbers: 3067&hyph;0020; 3067&hyph;0022; 3067&hyph;0127; and 3067&hyph;0147. Executive Order 12612, Federalism This interim final rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism, dated October 26, 1987. Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform This interim final rule meets the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review Promulgation of this interim final rule is required by statute, 42 U.S.C. 4014(f), which also specifies the regulatory approach taken in the proposed rule. To the extent possible under the statutory requirements of 42 U.S.C. 4014(f), this proposed rule adheres to the principles of regulation as set forth in Executive Order 12866.
