Addressing today's meeting of representatives of Armenian political forces, focused on relations between the two countries, leader of the Ramkavar-Azatakan Party Ruben Mirzakhanyan called upon all political forces to join efforts in pressing for ratification of the treaty. This is much more important than to come up with declarations about friendship with Russia, he stressed. Mirzakhanyan recalled that his party had recently suggested putting the ratification issue on the agenda of the Armenian parliament's session, but this proposal failed to win support from lawmakers. The opposition leader labelled as "outrageous" the fact that Armenia does not yet have its embassy in Moscow and is represented just by a permanent mission. The Armenian Embassy is to become the most important political institution, which will immediately engage in promotion and coordination of bilateral relations between Russia and Armenia, above all in the sphere of inter-state relations, Mirzakhanyan pointed out.
