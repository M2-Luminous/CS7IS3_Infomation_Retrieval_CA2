Such meetings provide good opportunities to conduct discussions, exchange views and conclusions, and debate any issue that is in our mutual interest. I would like to take this opportunity to express my recognition of the activity of the U.S.-Poland Action Commission, which has done so much for the sake of developing Polish-American cooperation in the political, economic, and scientific areas. My speech today will be devoted to Poland's policy toward Western political, military, and economic institutions. Establishing closer ties to these institutions--and membership in them in the near future, if possible--is a crucial issue for our security. That issue should be approached against the background of new challenges that Poland (and all of Central Europe) has been confronting in recent times. Currently, we are going through a period of instability with regard to the European security situation. There are few stable elements in the situation, with positive phenomena and trends being continuously intertwined with negative ones. The situation has led to another reshaping of the European "security map." A diversification of interests and positions taken by different countries soon became clear, depending on the economic and security standard enjoyed by each of them. It is particularly important to be aware of that fact because it is beyond doubt the most important change in European relations since a "new Europe" was declared in 1990. That does not mean that "classic" dangers have emerged--for instance, with regard to the territorial integrity of Central European states. Our assessment is that there is no such danger--at least speaking of the short and medium term. Dangers that could occur today would rather take the form of political and economic pressure, a weakening of perceptions and of the "psychological" component of security. The likelihood of sustaining barriers in economic and civil development and of a deterioration in Poland's international position--this is another problem that causes concern. We must counteract these challenges. It is a supreme obligation of any state to secure its independence and proper conditions for development. Generally speaking, we perceive a permanent anchoring of Poland in the system of connections created by the Western world as the most secure guarantee for protecting the country's interests. So our membership in West European and transatlantic institutions remains a strategic goal for us. But, at a time when the issue of that membership is made difficult--which, by the way, is not because of us--we must demonstrate innovative thinking in the process of looking for transitional solutions. Our own effort--a Polish, Central European effort--will be the determining factor. Ladies and Gentlemen: Transforming Central and East Europe into any kind of "gray area" would become a cause of instability in this strategic part of the continent. It would also be dangerous when it comes to peace and stability throughout Europe. Our efforts to participate in Western structures are not targeted against any country. On the contrary, these efforts are supposed to serve to widen the area of stability and European cooperation, and also, as a result of that, they are to strengthen the entire continent's security. We are convinced that extending Western institutions to cover the East will constitute a center around which the framework of the future architecture of European security will be built. The future shape of that center will be determined by today's courage displayed by Western countries in making their decisions. Failure to use the historic opportunity being created by the possibility of gradual extension of a stabilizing influence of the Western democratic sphere, a sphere of peace and prosperity, could have a detrimental impact on the future development of European relations, particularly in the continent's eastern part. The first step toward stabilizing the situation, preventing a disadvantageous development of the situation, should be by way of an opening up of Western structures as soon as possible to those Central European countries that are ready to take the step, and with a simultaneous establishment of partnershiplike relations between the "widened" Western structures and the continent's remaining countries. We perceive the "Partnership for Peace" initiative, proposed by the NATO "summit," as a first step, which makes the future prospect of Polish membership in NATO more and more realistic. The initiative also assures us of possibilities for wider cooperation with NATO member states than up to now, and it also improves the level of our security. While declaring a readiness for close cooperation with Western countries in the area of security, we expect the West to come up with concrete cooperation in the technical and technological areas--the kind of cooperation that would allow us to rationally use our scientific and industrial potential. The prospect of a future, stable, and safe Europe requires supplementing the idea of "Partnership for Peace" with an economic aspect of cooperation--that is to say, a "partnership for development." I do not mean here establishing new bureaucratic structures or introducing new and special mechanisms of cooperation. But what I would like to point out is a necessity of making permanent a set of indispensable principles in international economic cooperation. Such a specific code of behavior for countries and economic organizations could include the task of counteracting the trends of isolationism; it could also cover eliminating obstacles, shaping a cooperative approach, understanding the partner's needs and, in justified cases, it could also cover a readiness to provide aid. Such a "partnership for development," broadly speaking, will contribute to increased mutual confidence and will also constitute a permanent basis for cooperation in the area of security. Ladies and Gentlemen: Apart from NATO, the other institution of the Western world that plays an important role from the standpoint of Poland's security is the Western European Union [WEU]. We see our future membership in the WEU as a logical addition to our links to the European Union [EU]. Leading to a situation of the same legal status of Poland in both organizations is an urgent issue. We are prepared for serious dialogue within the framework of the WEU. Ladies and Gentlemen: A speeding up of Poland's integration into the EU is an important and urgent task for Poland. Apart from its economic and civil-related dimensions, the issue is important from the standpoint of my country's security. That is because the most secure path toward permanent security is by way of the inclusion of Poland and other Central European states in the Western system of associations and institutions. The EU has a determinant role to play in that context. It constitutes the most dynamically developing area in our neighborhood. The shape of the EU as an organization with a political dimension, one with a common foreign policy with regard to security as well as sophisticated systems of cooperation within the area of domestic and justice-systems policies--all of these justify our efforts to join the EU for political reasons, as well. We regard integration as an instrument of implementing Polish interests, particularly in the new era of relations initiated by Poland's association with the EC, which became effective yesterday. In our relations with the EU, we will defend our interests no less vigorously than the current EU members are defending theirs. Routine discrimination against our exports and an erosion of concessions that had been granted to us with regard to EU markets are cause for concern. The civil dimension of our relations with the EU is about keeping Poland in the Western sphere of free exchange of thoughts, ideas, and information. It is natural behavior for a nation that derives from the same civilization roots and that constitutes an integral ingredient of European culture. Making contemporary scientific achievements, technical progress, and modern management popular in Poland is one of the aspects of this issue. Ladies and Gentlemen: To reduce the issue of Poland's security to mere efforts aimed at membership in Western institutions would be a major oversimplification. We perceive security issues in a wider context. We are aware of a fundamental role played by Poland's internal stability: A persistence in building and strengthening democratic institutions, an effective market economy, and scientific and cultural achievements. With regard to Poland, one can say that parliamentary democracy and a system based on rule of law not only established its firm roots, which go all the way back to the 3 May Constitution, which was close in spirit and in time to the U.S. Constitution, but also in the day-to-day political life of my country; the most recent parliamentary elections in Poland are proof of that. We observe human rights fully. In Poland there are no nationalistic or ethnic disputes. Poland's borders are not put into question by anybody, and they are defined by international treaties. All of the above makes us a factor for stability throughout the region. Poland's economic situation makes it possible to be optimistic about the prospect of the growth rate; according to many forecasts, the growth rate may become one of the most dynamic in Europe. The Polish economy, while going through a process of deep transformations, is already based on its own, new, market logic, and one can count on permanent and positive results if one continues on the path. An increase in industrial output has been holding for more than 10 months now. The private sector is already producing over 60 percent of the gross domestic product [GDP]. During the past three years, about 1.7 million new, private companies have been established. Over 80 percent of trade and automobile transportation is in private hands. Private companies are providing half of all new jobs. At the same time, inflation is under control. We expect Polish GDP to increase by 4.5 percent and exports to increase by 6 percent in 1994; investments should increase by 6 percent in the same period. The assumption is that inflation will continue to fall and that it will be about 25 percent. The achievement of such a magnitude of economic transformations means a lot of sacrifices, but it is also a unique achievement in European terms. These results of ours are being perceived and appreciated by international financial institutions, among them the IMF, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. My government is continuing with the process of reforms based on a market economy, the principle of economic freedom, and a demonopolization of economic relations with foreign countries. The government will also continue the process of ownership transformations, but we want privatization to be understandable to the people and to be approved of by society; we also want the state's interest to be efficiently protected. In Poland, legal foundations for a market economic system were established. Institutions of fundamental importance for a market economy were created, even if some of them are still at the initial stages of development. The role of market mechanisms has increased, and also of such economic parameters as money, profit, demand, competition, capital market, and entrepreneurship. Along with that, Poland's economic system is already characterized by a majority of typical traits that developed market economies have, even if the process of transformations has not yet been finalized. Opening up the Polish economy to the world is an integral part of our reforms. We are interested in establishing the right conditions for an unrestricted flow of goods, services, capital, and labor--naturally based on principles of mutuality. We see in that possibilities for further activation of the economy and a revival of competition. We see in that a chance for further strengthening the economy with foreign capital and new technologies and the organization of labor.
