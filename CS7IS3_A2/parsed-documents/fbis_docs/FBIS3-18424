"The downing of the four Serbian aircraft happened after a clear breach of the no-fly zone over Bosnia set up by the United Nations. All the sides know the consequences of breaking this no-fly ban. The aircraft refused to comply with warnings from the U.S. NATO aircraft before they were shot down," a statement from Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal said. The foreign minister pointed out that there have been a growing number of violations of the flight ban over Bosnia. The action was carried out on the basis of a resolution by the UN Security Council on 31 March 1993, and NATO was asked to implement the resolution on behalf of the United Nations. "It is important that the ban on flights be upheld, if UN resolutions are to be credible," Godal said.
