The Chief Expert--The Commander Analysis of the combat losses of aviation by opposing sides in armed conflicts that differ in scale makes it possible, in my opinion, to uncover more fully the nature and determine the priority ranking of errors that are made by pilots in the air when performing missions. If we trace how fighter aviation was used in World War II, we can reveal the following causes of such errors: insufficient circumspection in battle, numerical supremacy of the enemy, disruption of the interaction between crews in a group, the use of ineffective maneuvers in a dogfight and the lack of suitable command and control of the battle... We will consider the last cause in more detail. The foundation of the command and control of subordinates in the course of combat operations, as is well known, is the plan of the air commander, which he makes on the basis of a clarification of the combat mission, conclusions from an evaluation of the situation and calculations performed. We would note that all of this takes place on the ground. But what about in the air, with an unexpected change in the situation, when the commander has turned over virtually all of the functions of getting information about the enemy to the hardware entrusted to him, and most often receiving just meager information from it? Only a wealth of combat experience, to all appearances, could help him to grasp the developing situation and predict its continuation. But unfortunately far from all have enough experience, and the training process will moreover not be able to make up for these gaps in training. So then who today receives the right to make the decision to enter into battle? If we are talking about a rank-and-file pilot, then he rarely enjoys that right, as before--only in the course of an intercept of a solitary airborne target. It is appropriate here to recall the experience of the recent war in the Persian Gulf, where solo sorties were not recorded at all, even though the aviation was operating primarily at night. The flight (four aircraft in tactical aviation and three in strategic) was the tactical entity entrusted with the fulfillment of independent missions. Group battles and strikes constituted the foundation for the employment of aviation, while organizing the interaction among crews remained the primary concern of the flight commander. Specialists have noted that even the crews of the AWACS and EW aircraft coordinated operations not only among themselves, but also with a detail for their direct coverage--a pair or a flight of fighters. A Hawkeye airborne command post, an EC-130 EW aircraft and four F-15C aircraft as an aggregate, for example, represented a dynamic system with controlling and controlled objects and uniform channels for communications and information exchange among them, with an informative nature "upward" and a command nature "downward." The effectiveness of the functioning of the system with feedback was evaluated depending on the duration of the command-and-control cycle. Foreign specialists also include the flight of fighters, "encircled by an external environment with various threats," among similar dynamic systems, based on the experience of local wars. The crews experienced particular stress in combat operations when protecting the aircraft of strike groups, and concretely in those situations where the enemy, making use of camouflage and military cunning, selected the most favorable moment for attack. The proposal to utilize the variation of first takeoff, and then the posing of the concrete task, was adopted as the standard one, taking this circumstance into account. The commander was forced to perform such labor-intensive processes as evaluating the situation, analyzing the possible options for action and planning the battle right in the course of the flight, simultaneously devoting the lion's share of his attention to piloting the aircraft. The scarcity of time for the mental work of the pilot, as has already been emphasized, brought about the necessity of creating on-board expert systems. It was, however, not difficult to assume that the "electronic assistant" should function in different ways in those cases where a dialogue is conducted with it by, for example, a rank-and-file pilot or the leader of a flight: the former, after all, is controlling just an aircraft and its weapons, while the latter, aside from that, is also controlling subordinate crews. The latter is moreover also obliged--and this is one of his chief tasks--to turn the four fighters into a powerful combat entity able to win a victory in group battle. Specialists have determined that the commander, in order to achieve that aim, should make a so-called organizational decision, after assessing the situation, based on the competent disposition of forces before battle and the efficient distribution of functions among the crews. What do those functions consist of apropos of the actual conditions of the group combat flight? The aircraft flight formation, to the extent of the development of aircraft technology and armaments along with the growth in the combat potential of fighters, was opened up to such intervals and distances that at first provided for the preservation of visual contact among the crews, and then became commensurate with the distance for launching air-to-air guided missiles with semi-active radar homing heads. Visual contact among pilots was broken off as a result. The command and control of subordinates that you cannot see is a difficulty that was experienced to the full by the pilots who took part in the armed conflicts in the Near East at the end of the 1960s and beginning of the 1970s. The enemy, along with everything else, was constantly jamming the sole channel for information exchange among the crews--radio communications. Under such a variation, at the threshold of the development of fighter aviation called "go out separately, but fight together," the functioning of a dynamic system with a large number of objects under command and control became simply ineffective. One aircraft was then dropped from the flight of four fighters. The three-element structure proved to be more suited to waging all-aspect battle, the "crux" of which was considered to be a missile attack on straight-on headings. This step led to an appreciable change in the redistribution of functions among the crews in the course of aerial battle. The departure from the principle of "shield and sword" (one covers and the other attacks) entailed the rejection of mutual coverage of fighters. Completely new tasks--decoy operations, the performance of break-off, back-up or free maneuvers (augmentation of efforts)--were designated at the same time. It was only necessary to distribute them correctly among the controlling and controlled objects (the function of "sword"--the "strike aircraft"--was preserved). The commander of the threesome automatically became the "strike" aircraft while supervising the two subordinate crews, which were delegated other functions than his. When a flight used to go up in full complement (four) in a single tactical entity with its own definite mission, a pair of aircraft was formed. The crews, having received a specific combat assignment, operated not spontaneously but rather in accordance with a plan developed earlier. A strike against the enemy, which was then augmented, was made according to the rules that were discussed earlier (AVIATSIYA I KOSMONAVTIKA, 1993, No. 1) after the decoy operations. The "free-maneuver" group (or aircraft) operated at that moment "according to the situation," ready at any moment to assist a crew that got into a difficult situation. Some fighter pilots have in recent years unfortunately begun to forget such a crucial stage of the preparation for flight as the development of a plan for the impending battle. The reason for this is the widespread opinion that only improvisation is characteristic of the true master. The experience of both the recent and the now-distant past forces us to approach an evaluation of the professionalism of the pilot today, and especially the leader of a group, with different standards. Today he should be not only an excellent pilot and shooter able to lead a four-aircraft element, but also be recognized as a leader able to evaluate and predict a complex situation, plan group battle, organize interaction in the air and independently make comprehensively well-founded decisions on the application of the forces subordinate to him. It would not be superfluous in this regard to refer to the Manual of Combat Operations of U.S. Tactical Aviation, which says that "Leadership in battle is a talent that should be recognized at all levels. Individuals able to lead subordinates in the air must be noticed in timely fashion and promoted. The talent of the commander is usually manifested in the course of warfare, but the ability to think and reason intelligently is acquired beforehand." The crisis in the sphere of the mental activity of the pilot has forced the aviation command in the United States to take the path of training pilots in the skills of "intelligent reasoning" in duels with an active "enemy." Each tactical-aviation squadron, as is well known, takes part every year and a half in the Red Flag exercises at the Nellis test range, specially equipped for the purpose. More than a hundred simulated PVO [air-defense] assets and an "aggressor" squadron operate in complete accordance with the tactics of a likely adversary, not "playing along" with the trainees. The pilots can receive a "homework assignment"--refine poorly mastered elements of weapons delivery--after the completion of the exercises and analysis of the results (chiefly the "losses"). The white heat of training of the mind weakens appreciably at "home," however, since the principal impetus to pose tactical riddles to the pilot--the "enemy"--is lacking. The standard-issue simulator equipment available at each air base is little help in the development of tactical thinking among the pilots, since it by and large facilitates only their acquisition of motor skills in operations in a concrete situation. American specialists feel that it is essential, first and foremost, to fill in the vacuum between the expense and complexity of the training process, on the one hand, and its simplicity, on the other, in order to achieve even an inconsiderable rise in the intellectual level of the pilot. They feel it mandatory in this regard to put the trainee into an operating mock-up of the cockpit of a combat aircraft--it would suffice to put the moving situation being evaluated by the pilot onto a special desktop screen that is analogous to the display inside the cockpit. Several "desks" with such screens have been installed in an already operating system for training flight personnel in the evaluation of a situation and making tactical decisions. The aerial situation is simulated on the screen in the form of aircraft blips ("own" and "enemy") by the supervisor of the classes, who can where necessary break off a flight and even "take a step backward" for the extemporaneous investigation of erroneous decisions. The important conclusion was drawn, according to the results of the first simulations, that they were none other than a continuation of the training process of the likely adversary and the concluding stage of the mathematical modeling in the course of which the logical framework of the battle is formulated. The exercise using full-scale modeling is in turn defined in the course of the flight experiment, and only after its completion are recommendations issued for the practical assimilation of tactical innovations by flight personnel. A study of the experience of fighter operations in real battles and semi-full and full-scale modeling has made it possible for me to develop a very simple algorithm of the resolution of a task according to an analysis of the situation by a flight commander (see diagram). This process, in my opinion, should begin from the moment when the group target has been detected, and its azimuth, range, speed, altitude and direction of flight, as well as the numerical composition, determined. Algorithm of Situation Assessment Block one--"correlation." It is felt that the flight should enter battle with forces equal to the enemy. A numerical inequality of forces could be established after identification of the specific situation, however. Then the model of battle "in the majority" or "in the minority" takes effect. Block two--"weaponry." The fighters could prove to be in a situation where they have a "surplus" or "shortfall" of firepower; that is, there are greater or lesser areas of effective engagement for the on-board weaponry than the enemy. An advantage in firepower makes it possible to compensate for shortfalls in "quantity." Block three--"points." The point of engagement at which the fighters should arrive strictly on time is designated when performing the task of covering strike groups. This cannot always be accomplished, however, under the rapidly changing conditions of contemporary battle. Any skirting maneuvers, most naturally, are ruled out in the event of lateness, for instance, and there remains just one chance for victory--a frontal strike (head-on battle). The "weaponry" moves to the forefront in such a situation--greater permitted launch ranges of missiles should compensate in full for lateness and have an effect on the configuration of the disposition of forces before the start of an attack. The precise or early arrival at an assigned point brings about the necessity of employing some tactical maneuvers ("claw" or "dragon"). Block four--"position." After reaching the point of engagement, the flight could prove to be at too small or too large a heading angle in relation to the enemy for a reliable attack, and higher or lower than the target. The flight commander, proceeding from tactical considerations and with a regard for the maneuverability of the aircraft as well as the destructive capabilities of his weaponry, should determine the most advantageous position for the performance of a standard method of attack by the flight. It should be emphasized that "one's own" methods and combat formations correspond to each position. It is not difficult to note that the proposed algorithm is nothing more than the simplest model for the resolution of a tactical task. It could be made more detailed and supplemented with blocks at that or a lower level. It is proposed that readers, and especially flight commanders, do so.
