FBIS3-1332 "drafr058_c_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-058 Document Type:Daily Report 23 Mar 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Government, TEC, SACP, IFP Representatives Interviewed MB2403170394 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network in Afrikaans 1830 GMT 23 Mar 94 MB2403170394 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network Language: Afrikaans Article Type:BFN [Interview with TEC representative Mac Maharaj, SACP National Chairman Joe Slovo, and IFP representative Dr. Ziba Jiyane in the Durban studio and Foreign Minister Pik Botha via telephone by announcer Freek Robinson on the "Agenda" program -- live, in English; italicized passages in Afrikaans] [Text] [Robinson] Good evening. The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] is increasingly in the news following its action in Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, and now also in kwaZulu. Questions are also being asked about the council's accountability concerning its relations with government and how it makes its decisions. Well, to comment on this issue I have with me in the studio Mr. Mac Maharaj from the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] and also Mr. Joe Slovo of the SACP [South African Communist Party], whom we will be talking to a little later, and then Dr. Ziba Jiyane of the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] in our Durban studio. We are also linked by telephone with Minister Pik Botha. I would like to begin with Minister Pik Botha. Can you hear me Minister Botha? [Botha] Yes, Freek, I hear you clearly. [Robinson] Minister Botha, let us first refer to today's developments. What is the latest information you have concerning developments in Ciskei? [Botha] It was a very tense day, and I was continually in contact with President de Klerk and President Mandela to try and defuse the tense situation today, where people gathered at the stadium. At one stage we were concerned for Brigadier Gqozo's life. It seems that at the end of the day things improved. Mr. Mandela gave me the assurance this morning that he would contact the ANC [African National Congress] official in the Ciskei to ask the people to leave the stadium and to conduct themselves in an orderly manner, so actually today was an example of what can be achieved if the ANC and the government work together. [Robinson] We heard tonight on the news that you expressed concern at the general spirit of uprising and violence in the country. What do you mean by this? [Botha] Well, everywhere...[pauses] Yesterday in Mabopane, the Bophuthatswana police handed out title deeds typed on ordinary paper, not worth anything, and the black civilians thought that these were their title deeds -- developments in Ciskei, developments in Bophuthatswana, the developments in kwaZulu -- and kwaZulu is not Bophuthatswana or Ciskei. KwaZulu is something big, monumental, and serious and cannot be pushed over. This is not a picnic. This is a huge, serious situation, and throughout the country, in all communities, people are buying canned foods, paraffin, candles. They are scared of the future. This is worrying. I must be honest with you. This is worrying -- the fear in the hearts of our people. I feel that there should be a plan of action through which political differences should be of lesser importance in South Africa's interest. If we do not grow economically then it does not matter which political party wins. [Robinson] Minister Botha, would you say that this fear and the recent developments are spontaneous, or not? [Botha] The problem is that people are faced with uncertainty and political parties are making statements of a wild and aggressive nature, and the people hearing this do not know, they do not know what type of decisions to make, how to vote. They do not know in what direction we are moving. They do not know where we are heading, and this is a shame, and I foresee problems because the outside world will come here. Heads of state -- after election day -- they will come here for the inauguration. After that they will depart and leave us alone, and we must decide now what is most important for us. I am really concerned. Tonight, I must tell you honestly, I am concerned about the spirit of uncertainty throughout South Africa. [Robinson] Mr. Botha, thank you. I would like you to stay linked to us by telephone and for you to listen to our discussion so that you can also participate. Could I go to you, Dr. Jiyane, in Durban? [Jiyane] Yes, sir. [Robinson] I have spoken to Minister Botha. I don't know how much of that you could hear or understand, but basically he said that he was very worried about the general spirit of violence in the country. I asked him the question, whether he thought that it was spontaneous and with due respect to the minister we didn't get a very clear answer on that. What is your assessment? [Jiyane] Well, my assessment is clear in that you are seeing here the fifth column in action, that is in communist lingo, that means the destabilization efforts that are orchestrated by the South African Communist Party-ANC alliance. [Robinson] How do you know that? [Jiyane] Well, we know because, here in kwaZulu, we have clear evidence that they are planning the same thing. [Robinson] Who? [Jiyane] The ANC and the South African Communist Party. [Robinson] What evidence do you have? [Jiyane] Well, you are going to hear from the Goldstone Commission. We have evidence of documents that have been written by the Communist Party in which they outline exactly what they are doing now, which of course, true to their, what you call, character, they will deny publicly but you will see they will do exactly that which is in that document because it is orchestrated by them. [Robinson] Well, Mr. Slovo, according to Dr. Jiyane, true to your character you will deny that? [Slovo] Well, I do deny it, not because it's true to my character, but because the document is a fraud. And anyone reading that document carefully would conclude that. I could give a few examples. [Robinson] Please do? [Slovo] For example, the document talks about reincorporating kwaZulu into South Africa. I think even a member of ours who has been a member for a week will know that kwaZulu is in South Africa. It also talks about chiefs being reactionary institutions which we must take under our wing, and that goes completely contrary to everything we've done in the negotiating process, to the provisions of the interim constitution. We've recognized chieftainship, something which both the ANC and the South African Communist Party have supported and will continue to support. [Robinson] Mr. Slovo, the reason why you are here tonight, obviously is as the result of this document, and then also Mr. Maharaj, to talks to us about the powers of the TEC and how we can resolve these issues, to have free and fair elections which is after all the task of the TEC. Now can I refer you to the statement made tonight by the ANC, and you are in alliance with the ANC, and whatever you might deny about this document, the fact of the matter is that the tension in the country is rising and one might say that having mass action at this time is just going to add to the tension? [Slovo] Well, you know this cliche of mass action and rolling mass action must be examined. Because the dividing line between what people call mass action, and the right of people to assert their democratic right to march, to have meetings, to protest, that line is very thin indeed, and if we take this concept of stopping mass action completely, what we are really saying, or what some people are saying, is that political activity must stop. [Robinson] Mr. Slovo: But Mr. Radebe, who is one of the most prominent leaders of the ANC in Natal, himself talked about mass action, and he is launching a campaign? [Slovo] Well, there is nothing wrong with mass action. It was mass action by the Bophuthatswana Defense Force and Police and civil servants which corrected the historic injustice of Bophuthatswana. It doesn't have to be accompanied by violence, unfortunately in that case violence asserted itself in the initial stages. Now it's mass action today in the Ciskei by the civil servants and so on, which resulted in Gqozo stepping down and handing over to the TEC. Now, all that is mass action. There is nothing wrong with mass action as long as it is not accompanied by violence and is in accordance with the democratic norms of political activity and protests. [Robinson] Would you say that mass action in itself does not in any way add to the tension? [Slovo] It can. It obviously can. It depends what kind of mass action. If you want to know the kind of mass action that adds to tension, it's when Mandela wants to go and visit the king and you see IFP organizing 10,000 people, many of them armed with bazookas and AKs, that kind of mass action obviously adds to the tension. [Robinson] But no mass action by the ANC, that could not add to tension? [Slovo] Well, obviously there have been occasions when, during the course of mass action, all kinds of events have occurred which one does not approve of. There is a danger, but it's the duty of organizations to ensure that it doesn't spill over into illegalities and violence. [Robinson] Dr. Jiyane in Durban, do you accept the right of people, spontaneously or otherwise to go into the streets and to voice their feelings? [Jiyane] Yes, as long as they know that all rights go with responsibility or duty. Duty to keep the peace, and not be violent. [Slovo, interrupting] And to let the other organizations have their meetings in the stadium and not occupy them before their speakers arrive. [Robinson] Mr. Maharaj, you want to come in? [Maharaj] I was going to say, Freek, one of the critical problems facing the country is the question of free political activity. We are 35 days from the elections. The right of people to vote or not vote is one that is fundamental. The problems that are arising, are for example, we need all administrations, all government departments to make available schools, police stations etc, available to the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] for the conduct of the elections. We have a problem, the kwaZulu administration so far refused, now if Dr. Jiyane could make that commitment tonight, I'd be happy to hear it. In keeping with the agreement his leader made with Mr. Mandela that there will be free political activity, those who want to vote will be allowed to vote, those who don't want to vote need not vote. Will the schools, buildings, resources available to the kwaZulu administration be available to the IEC for polling purposes? [Robinson] Let's hear your response to that, Dr. Jiyane. [Jiyane] Well, if you listened the news tonight, you would have heard that our leadership in Ulundi told Judge Kriegler about the fact that we are open, we voted for this in parliament, we are open to that, but he pointed out that schools here that are still left, that were saved from the UDF [United Democratic Front] onslaught when they burned schools because they thought in the ashes of bourgeois society they will build a new society. Now those schools that are still remaining are run by parents here who pay their own money. The fact that the leadership has agreed does not mean that on the ground the parents will necessarily agree. [Robinson] I think Dr. Jiyane, the specific question is: Will you be willing to put to the control of the IEC all of those officials buildings that are in kwaZulu-Natal? [Jiyane] That's what our leadership said tonight. [Maharaj] Can I ask you the same question connected with free political activity. The kwaZulu administration has sent out a circular to all civil servants to report to Ulundi on the 27th and 28th of April. Those are election dates. Surely, if you are committed to allowing people to exercise the vote, you should not be calling civil servants to such a meeting on those two days because you are directly challenging their right to exercise the vote on that day. Will you withdraw that circular and instructions? [Jiyane] Well, no, that circular is neither here nor there. That circular I'm not aware of it, nor other authorities that I work with are aware of it. It's just a figment of imagination by some people. Why would we do such a thing? And in any case of course, the kwaZulu government as long as it is in authority, it has the right to talk to its civil servants, but I don't think what is being said here is true in specific terms. [Robinson] Since you do not know, let's leave that for a moment. Mr. Botha, do you want to comment on the issue of mass action? [Botha] Yes, I think that there are entirely wrong impressions created tonight. The people in Bophuthatswana and Ciskei and elsewhere want their pensions because they do not trust a new government. It is no consolation for Mr. Joe Slovo or Mac Maharaj. It actually means a lack of trust in them, and the sooner they realize that, the better. There is uncertainty in the minds of the people, and the whole program here tonight is once again occupied with touchy, petty issues while the basic facts of the country are that Inkatha and the ANC are engaged in a war against each other. These are the simple facts. And unless these two leaders and these two parties reach an agreement to create peace, South Africa on the whole will pay the price. We have to stop now with these touchy and petty debates and nonsense. These are the facts of the matter. Inkatha is in war with the ANC. These are the facts. This is how the world sees it. This is what every international visitor has told me. Mr. Maharaj talks a lot about free political activity, but Holomisa says the National Party may not hold a gathering in the Transkei. What is he doing about that? Why does the TEC not step in and say give all parties in the Transkei the right to conduct free, active politics? They are too scared to intervene. [Maharaj] I think Mr. Botha could control his language. I was speaking in a very controlled way. I'd like to remind him that he and I went to Bophuthatswana, and we went there precisely because by working together, we present the most credible face to control the situation. Insofar as he alleges the matter to the ANC, let me ask him: His deputy minister has condemned the IEC, the Independent Election Commission, drawing inferences of betraying credibility in them. This is from a government minister. I did not want to raise this but in the tone that he raises it, is he prepared to repudiate today his own deputy minister who has been on record, Deputy Minister Fick from regional government. Secondly... [Robinson] Can we have a response from Mr. Botha, then I would like to follow up on questions also raised. [Botha] I do not know what my deputy minister said. I am saying what the government's standpoint is. [Maharaj] A deputy minister is a member of the government. [Botha] No, it is not so. He is not a member of the cabinet. And I think it is unfair because he is not here with me to say exactly what he said. [Robinson] Let us skip that matter, Mr. Botha. I just want to follow up on some of the things that you said. And Mr. Maharaj will remember that at the beginning of this program I referred specifically to the TEC and the powers that you do have. Now it seems to me with all great respect that the perception is rife that you are trying to assert your powers in Bophuthatswana, that you are doing so in Ciskei, that you are in the process of trying to do so in kwaZulu, but that we do not see the evidence that you are trying to do so in Transkei, to see to it that there is free and fair political activity in that country. [Maharaj] The TEC so far has addressed the question of Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, kwaZulu, and the general question of free political activity, and that is with the participation of Minister Botha's government, with their agreement, and we are addressing that question in terms that are extremely serious. Now Minister Botha knows that. He knows also that the NP complaint on the question of Transkei is under discussion and is being dealt with. [Robinson] By whom? [Maharaj] By the TEC, as well as the IEC, as well as the response. In particular the Transkei has responded to the complaint and said one of the problems they have is security. This is a reason that Minister Botha will understand, that when the question of security arises as it has arisen in Bophuthatswana, it had to be dealt with. And in particular they are saying there are specific problems, and they accept the right of the NP. What we have to do is to facilitate.... [Robinson, interrupting] What can you do? What are you going to do? [Maharaj] In particular, we have brought the Transkei into discussion with the South African Government. We have encouraged them to resolve this matter peacefully. In the case of Bophuthatswana, we sought to resolve it peacefully, and in the end it became necessary when the Mangope government lost control to remove him from power and put an administration in place. In the case of the Ciskei, it is Brig. Gqozo who appealed to the TEC, including Minister Botha, and Minister Botha referred it to the TEC to say he cannot control the situation. And then we stepped in. We never tried to step in as the TEC, steamrollering the process and disrespecting the institutions that exist. [Robinson] Mr. Botha, do you want to respond? [Botha] Yes. Where I agree with Mr. Maharaj: Within five weeks from now we must form a government of national unity in any case. So I do not want to be technical. I think it is better that the TEC and we should work very closely, and on some important matters there has been that cooperation which I appreciate, but the one point which I want to mention here: It is not acceptable to me that the Transkei does not allow us -- and it is not acceptable to me that Mr. Maharaj is putting the blame on security reasons, which means that we may not campaign in Transkei because our people are going to be shot. But at the same time they are demanding action in kwaZulu -- it is just not acceptable. [Robinson] What would you suggest the TEC do specifically to ensure that you have the freedom that you would like to have? [Botha] The TEC must take a decision to inform the Transkei government they must fall in line with the norms and standards and the TEC's objective aims -- namely, that all parties have the right to campaign there freely. [Robinson] Would you say there is a difference in approach with the TEC regarding Transkei, vis-a-vis the others where they have already acted? [Botha] No, because my own colleagues are sitting in the TEC, and I know that they are fighting for this. All that I am asking is: Please treat Transkei exactly the same as Bophuthatswana and Ciskei. [Slovo] I presume Minister Botha doesn't mean by that that we should take over the Transkei with administrators. What he means is that we should be egalitarian in our approach. And I agree with that, but if I could come back to something else that he said about the war between the ANC and the IFP. What he has omitted to mention is that that war has also a third factor in it, and that has come out clearly in the recent Goldstone report, and Minister Botha didn't refer to that even though the evidence is prima face at the moment. We've been saying it for years that this violence is very much instigated by elements within the security forces. The train violence, the murders that are taking place, the instigation on the ground between the various forces. I'd like Minister Botha to say something about that because he has completely omitted that and like Minister Kriel, all he does is talk about the war between the ANC and the IFP. The people who pull the trigger on the ground might be black, but behind it there are many other hands coming from the security services. [Robinson] Could you react to that? And then I would like to have the comments of Dr. Jiyane, as well. [Botha] But of course, Mr. Mandela phoned me this morning and briefed me about attacks on ANC institutions and people who fled to the sugarcane fields. I agreed with him and I said to him we have to end this violence. What I want to say frankly here is: Those generals in the police are entitled -- and I hope Mr. Slovo and Mr. Maharaj will agree with me -- they are entitled to a public hearing of their side of the story. I am sorry to say tonight that I do not agree with a procedure where people who have been charged cannot seek legal representatives. Where a case is conducted behind the scenes.... [Robinson, interrupting] You are referring to Mr. Goldstone? [Botha] Of course. I want to be very frank with you. Let these things be exposed -- Mr. Slovo is right there. Let it be opened up so that the people involved can get a fair chance to state his case in the presence of all South Africa's media, with legal representatives, because that is freedom. [Robinson] I do not think anyone will argue about that particular point. But Mr. Botha, the point made here by Mr. Slovo is the specific allegations which have been made about the government's involvement in destabilization, and with great respect, I must also tell you tonight that we really tried in this program to get a view from the government for the last few days and nobody has as yet given it to us. [Botha] But I will state the view. No entity in South Africa has worked so hard -- and I sit in the cabinet and I know President de Klerk, and I know what goes on -- to get down to the truth. I promise you this and I promise South Africa here tonight, to us it is a case of extreme seriousness. What can we gain as a party or government from such acts? We condemn it. And all that I am asking is: Let it be tried according to the legal system of a civilized country. [Robinson] Dr. Jiyane, could you come in specifically on the question of complicity by Inkatha and the kwaZulu government in so-called third force activities? [Jiyane] Yes, this is yet another example of the hypocrisy and double standards that the TEC is all about. It was originally intended to level the playing fields, but it is clearly there now to serve the African National Congress and the government. Take for example, you know that the IFP has lost about 400 leaders and thousands of its members, and we don't know who are the hit squads that are killing these people. Not a word has been said about that. Now, you also know that there are things called defense units which the late Comrade Chris Hani already pointed out that many of them were being used by police, and those have killed hundreds of IFP people, and even ANC Youth League leaders have been killed by the SDU's [self-defense units], given guns by the police some of them. Now because the whole aim of this so-called transition and TEC is to favor the ANC against others, we are hearing all these things from the Goldstone Commission that is such a willing partner to this communist plot. [Robinson] Dr. Jiyane, I have listened to you, and it's clear to me, with all due respect to all of you, that you are just going to accuse each other here tonight. Neither of you is going to admit to anything. [Jiyane] If it is true that there are hit squads or even suspected hit squads in kwaZulu, but don't you at least take it as fair to ask who are killing IFP leaders -- 200 of them -- if there aren't hit squads of the MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] and the SDU's and reports have revealed this, but that is beyond any examination because those are immune.... [Robinson, interrupting] Dr. Jiyane, could I say, as a South African myself, that I'm deeply concerned about the violence, in particular as you will know also today that a peace monitor has been shot down, and that was an Inkatha man, now obviously that must be condemned. Could I just ask you that it is clear to me that I have been through many of these debates that nobody admits to anything, and we have just accusations. Can I ask you Mr. Maharaj what the TEC can do to try to bring some order now, free and fair elections, and whether you will be fair in your own conduct. [Maharaj] Freek, I think that the situation in Natal is one of the sharpest ones in the country. The violence is escalating at an unacceptable rate, and there is no free political activity. The TEC in addressing this question has put two proposals that can solve the problem peacefully and in the interest of the people and the country. One, it has called open the kwaZulu government and the Natal Provincial Administration, and all other administrations to cooperate with the IEC, the TEC, and the South African Government in realizing free political activity. Secondly, it has called on all government departments, civil servants components to participate in the rationalization process, and to cooperate as a means to ensuring their own futures through the implementation of the new constitution. These are two issues that could bring about stability in the current disquiet and the current violence. [Robinson] Dr. Jiyane, what can you do as some high-ranking official of Inkatha to try to ensure peace. [Jiyane] We can only repeat that which was repeated before. All people of South Africa have the right to have an input in an inclusive constitution that must bring peace in this country. As long as the TEC and the IEC, which are clearly favoring the ANC, which are very shy to investigate the ANC's intimidation of the National party, DP [Democratic Party], and everybody else, with such alarming alacrity they jump to investigate the IFP because that's the whole aim. As long as such double standards exist and persist, there is not a hope for any free and fair elections. [Robinson] But will you yourself promote it? [Jiyane] We ourselves have promoted that for all our history. We still do now, but we have said we will not be held responsible when the anger of the people at the grassroots level -- here in particular in kwaZulu/Natal -- is such that nobody can control it, because they know that they have a king whom they love, and he's been disregarded, ignored. In fact, the TEC thinks that it has more claim over this land than even the king. The anger of the people of this region will show the people who are so stupidly disregarding us that that which was done in the 19th century, and the Zulus stood up, will be repeated now. You will never destroy the spirit of the people to resist. [Robinson] Thank you Dr. Jiyane. Those are very grave words. Mr. Slovo, if you can do so, please refrain from reacting and making counter accusations. What can we do to resolve this situation and have peace? [Slovo] The key situation at the moment is the situation in kwaZulu. And in order to have peace, it is necessary to ensure that the people of kwaZulu, who, according to the latest poll -- even the IFP supporters--the majority of them want to participate in the election, have a free and fair right to take part in that election. Mr. Jiyane has said that they want a certain kind of constitution, and people have a right to a certain constitution. Yes, but basically at the moment in the coming 35 days, the basic rights that people must have is a right to vote without intimidation, and without threats of violence. Mr. Jiyane has repeated some of the statements of his chief minister which amount to thinly-veiled threats of drowning the process in blood, and that must stop. [Robinson] Our time has run out, but I must give Minister Botha an opportunity. Mr. Botha, it seems to me like a considerably bad situation. What can you and the government do to ensure that peace will be restored? [Botha] We appeal to all parties: Please come to your senses. The future of this country depends on economic development, to give people jobs, to open new factories, to get the international community to come and invest. I am appealing to all, please settle your differences. My appeal is, people of South Africa -- black, white, Indian, colored -- let us join hands and create a new South Africa. Let us stop with these disturbing debates on differences and hatred and envy and killings, and look past the election to a new South Africa. I blame no one, not Inkatha, not the ANC. I am appealing to the ANC and Inkatha, please throw your weapons in the ocean as Mr. Mandela once said. Let us build this new South Africa. [Robinson] Thank you Mr. Botha, our time is up. I thank you for the sober words. Thank you very much to all of you for your participation tonight. Thank you Dr. Jiyane in Durban. I hope from the bottom of my heart that all of you who are in power at the moment, in a position of influence can make some contribution. Thank you very much, we'll see you next time. Goodbye.
