[Shaposhnikov] The Russian Army absorbed the major part of the Soviet Armed Forces and naturally, at that time it was, and still is, of great interest to me. I cannot remain indifferent to the issue of what is going on in the army with regard to reforms. I have several views, or rather, thoughts on the subject and I would like to share them. The army has lost the simple and clear reference point that the concept of the enemy used to provide. When the civil war ended, our leaders, the leaders of the young Soviet Republic, began a tenfold reduction of the armed forces despite being surrounded by the enemy. Today, the opportunity exists and such conditions have been created that I am actually convinced that no one will attack us if we have reliable strategic forces and border troops. I am not revealing any secrets by telling you that within the Defense Ministry, like in any other ministry, there is definite lobbying. Speaking unconditionally, or rather conditionally so as not to correlate it with anyone or anything, as an example let us assume that the General Staff, or the defense minister, gets an idea to abolish the Air Defense High Command. How will the Air Defense High Command react? He will make the rounds of all the directorates, all the services; he will load the problem onto all the scientific research establishments, the Academy of Sciences, and so on; and then he will come back to the minister and report that it is impossible to implement. This would be the same with the Air Force and so on. I will represent all these problems as a thick copse of trees. [Shaposhnikov begins to demonstrate with a pen on the table] Let us suppose that the trees are standing here and it is decided to thin some of the them out, remove and forget about them. Then, when the minister or someone else grabs hold of the trunk, he finds that all the roots are intertwined below the surface and when he tries to pull the problem [trunk] out, this single trunk begins to rock all the rest of the trees. Consequently, the minister will find it very difficult to solve the problem in this way. Therefore, there should be some kind of a state structure or committee, be it under the president or the government, that would concern itself with these reforms and the resolution of all the problems in the system without advocating their own various mercenary interests. As you know, after the August events, we began with a Military Reform Committee headed by General of the Army Kobets. The committee did not develop for many reasons, such as the Union's disintegration and so on. However, if there were such a body composed of former military people, military scientists, civilian military experts, representatives of the military industrial complex, outstanding politicians, and various other specialists, then we could have done it impartially. [Correspondent] Three years have passed and we still do not have that kind of a body. Why? How can we explain this? [Shaposhnikov] That is not a question you should be directing to me. [passage omitted] The army should be apolitical, outside of the political stream. It has a more important and more serious course than adhering to the various political flows, movements, structures, leaders, and so on. Naturally, for me, these issues are also unpleasant, and now even incomprehensible, as they are for you. For instance, let us take the latest event in Crimea where the situation is becoming supercharged. While the two presidents, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin and Leonid Makarovich Kravchuk are talking to each other about it and are working out some kind of a formula to prevent the conflict's settlement through force, suddenly we have Mr. Radetskyy, Ukrainian defense minister, coming out with the statement and virtually thumping the table with his iron fist saying: We will not be stopped by anything, let everyone remember that, we will take any, and even extreme, decisive measures. I think that as a military man he should be silent in these situations. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Has our officer, soldier, [pauses] the serviceman become the central figure in the armed forces? Has he, in fact, become the figure on whom our whole military policy is principally focused? [Shaposhnikov] I would like to believe and think that. However, I am convinced that at present we are still far from that. Especially if there are some advances in this respect then, as we know, there is no limit to perfection in any situation.
