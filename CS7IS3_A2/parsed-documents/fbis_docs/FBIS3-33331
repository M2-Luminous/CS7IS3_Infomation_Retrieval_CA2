According to Cristiani, there is no room in the country for electoral fraud, which is why he is questioning the FMLN's [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] complaints of irregularities and delays in the electoral phases. [Begin Cristiani recording] Actually, there is an Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] contingent here that is already observing the electoral process, not just election day. It seems ridiculous to us that anyone should raise accusations of fraud at this time. It seems that they are already predicting the results. [end recording] Representatives of the former guerrillas met with the UN secretary general to voice their discontent over the delay in delivering voter identification cards to the former areas of conflict, where the FMLN claims most of its supporters live. Cristiani has a very personal interpretation, which is similar to the interpretation of the party that took him to power. [Begin Cristiani recording] The TSE's work is open to the public, and there are UN observers. Could it be that they want to justify what they are already predicting will take place; that is, that they will not win the elections? [end recording]
