Everybody knows that, as an action of distribution by the government, finance itself is an activity of resource allocation as well as a means of macroeconomic regulation and control. Under the planned economic structure in the past, allocation of resources was realized by taking planning as a foundation and the activities of departments including finance, material supplies, and others. How then under the conditions of a market economy following the gradual change from the planned economy to the socialist market economy, will finance play its role in the allocation of resources and how will finance exercise regulation and control at the macro level of the state? This is an important theoretical and practical issue at present. The decisions adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee pointed out that "there must be a sound macroeconomic regulation and control system for the socialist market economy," proposed that "a coordinating and restraining mechanism between planning and monetary and financial policy should be established and comprehensive coordination in economic operations enhanced," and stated that "finance should use the instruments of budget and taxation to concentrate on regulating the economic structure and social distribution, use monetary and financial policies to regulate the basic equilibrium of total social demand and supply, and, in coordination with industrial policies, bring about a coordinated national economic and social development." The above expression is very clear, that is, finance shoulders the task of regulating the economic structure and social distribution and of regulating and controlling total demand and supply. Taken from the formation of money, the allocation of market resources is, in essence, a kind of distribution and circulation of financial resources. Markets play a basic role in the allocation of resources, but they cannot cover everything. The problems that markets are unable to or cannot very well resolve in the allocation of resources must be settled through financial distribution and other economic means to ensure coordinated social development. For instance, the resources allocated to satisfy public requirements, including the portion of resources necessary for government organs to maintain normal operations and institutions to provide public services, can only be allocated through government financial distribution rather than through markets. This is not substitutable. However, economic development is always a fundamental mission of a socialist state. Although the allocation of resources under the conditions of a market economy takes markets as a foundation, because there are weaknesses in markets themselves, not only must investment in the construction of infrastructural facilities and social welfare be made by state finance through overall planning, but the economic structure and social distribution must also be regulated through the financial means of budget and taxation. Therefore, how to adjust the structure of financial revenue and expenditure and the policy of financial distribution to suit the needs of market economic development is a subject that we should study with concentrated efforts. For example--how should we rationally regulate the structure of distributing financial resources, and properly handle and regulate in a timely manner the extent of concentrating and distributing financial resources as well as the departmental and regional structures of distributing financial resources, according to the requirement that markets should play a basic role in the allocation of resources? Again, there are other examples--in the areas of financial taxation structure and distribution policies, how should we ensure the ability of the central authorities to appropriately concentrate financial resources and enhance its ability in macroeconomic regulation and control under the conditions of the market economy; and how should we correctly handle the distribution relationships between the state, enterprises, and individuals according to the principle of giving priority to efficiency while taking account of fairness? All these should be studied in theory, and experience pertinent to them should be repeatedly summarized in practice. Certainly, the position and task of finance in the establishment of a socialist market economic structure are not limited to the above content. The five major links in the basic framework of the socialist market economic structure sketched in the "Decisions" are an organically integrated entirety, which has set new tasks and demands for financial work. Other parts of the "Decisions," including in-depth structural reforms in the rural economy, foreign economic relations, science, technology, and education, the intensified building of the legal system, and so on, have set new tasks and demands for financial work as well. All these also call for us to conduct studies in theory and practice. Great and spectacular achievements have been scored in China's reform and opening up. In the entire historical development process, financial taxation reform is always placed in an important position. It not only facilitates the development of the reform and opening up undertaking with financial and material capabilities, but also coordinates and promotes other economic structural reforms on its own. The reform of financial taxation before the 14th National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee was chiefly aimed at eliminating the malpractices of the old structure and at changing the conditions of highly concentrated financial resources and financial powers. Now, the aim is to readjust the distribution structure of financial resources, provide necessary financial resources and powers to enterprises for becoming the main body of the market economy, and provide financial resources to localities for accelerating economic development and the rapid growth of the economy as a whole, in accordance with the development track from the planned economy to the planned commodity economy and finally to the market economy. In short, it aims at realizing the objective of laying a foundation of financial resources for markets to play the basic role in the allocation of resources and at correspondingly carrying out reforms of some financial management systems that do not suit the requirements of reform and opening up, through the readjustment of the distribution structure of financial resources. At present, in line with the decisions of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, positively accelerating reform in financial taxation has been taken as a major aim in the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, and the introduction of three reform programs on financial taxation in 1994 has been planned. Today, China's reform of financial taxation has entered a new stage. The characteristics of this stage are to straighten out the relationship of financial taxation, standardize its conduct, and establish a financial taxation structure and operational mechanism that are suited to the socialist market economy. This is a significant change calling for us to transform our concept on financial resource management, improve our management modes and methods, and gradually form a set of financial taxation and policy theoretical systems suitable to the socialist market economic structure. This is a mission entrusted by the times to our financial theoretical and practical workers. In order to be suited to the requirements of this development, it is necessary to once again stress the importance of financial theoretical study. Just as Engels put it: Only when people stand on the theoretical height can they take a broad and long-term view to charter the right course and take the initiative in work. It can be said that leadership work cannot be well performed if serious attention is not paid to theoretical study and scientific research, and that one-sidedness and blindness in work is unavoidable and opportunities are apt to be bungled if theory and scientific research are ignored. Hence, we must take theoretical study of finance very seriously, consider some strategic, overall, and long-term issues earnestly, and give impetus to initiating a new situation in financial work with infiltrating studies of scientific theories and policies. Reform of financial taxation will enter a crucial year in 1994. Although the reform plan has been set, there are still many problems to be solved and many new conditions to be studied in practical work. This calls for comrades in business and scientific research departments to coordinate with one another and strive to enhance the theoretical level of the entire rank of cadres on the financial taxation front and their ability to solve practical problems, through intensified investigation and research and the conscientious study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
