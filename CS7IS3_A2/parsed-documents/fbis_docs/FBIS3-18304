In contrast to his predecessors Bush and Reagan, who were influenced by experiences gained during the war and the post-war period, the younger Clinton has a different image of the world. Even though in security issues he firmly supports the Transatlantic Alliance with NATO as the core and framework, his latest trip to Europe cannot hide the fact that the interest in the Old World has weakened, while attention to Asia has increased. Some traditional allies, who -- like Margaret Thatcher's Great Britain -- had a "special relationship" with the White House, feel the atmospheric changes. Prime Minister Major, who is expected to visit Washington at the end of February, must accept that shortly before his visit, Clinton granted a visa to IRA-friendly Irishman Gerry Adams -- disregarding his advisers' recommendations and protests from London. However, the fact that Clinton dedicates only a limited amount of time to foreign affairs and has a weak team, which lacks both Shultz's moral authority as well as Baker's diplomatic skills, does not mean that he does not have any foreign policy. Its focus is foreign trade. As the U.S. foreign trade policy president, Clinton has placed greater emphasis on his interest in a "fair share" for his country and has prepared old friends and new partners for greater egotism. Thus, he did not shy away from open discussions with Prime Minister Hosokawa and frankly stated that he prefers no agreement over an "empty agreement." The Japanese, who have promised to open their markets for decades, but have instead busily increased their enormous trade surplus with the United States, now have to expect sanctions, regardless of free trade. Almost all of the six foreign policy priorities, which Secretary of State Christopher formulated at Clinton's order -- economic security, reform in Russia, new shaping of NATO, trade with the Far East, peace in the Middle East, and nuclear nonproliferation -- are directly or indirectly connected with the economy. Clinton himself thinks that the conclusion of the GATT talks, the ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the attempts at rapprochement at the American-Pacific economic conference (APEC) are among his most important successes so far. Lifting the longstanding trade embargo against Vietnam also fits his political geography, which is linked more strongly with interests. In addition to the desire to strengthen Hanoi's readiness to cooperate in the search for missing U.S. soldiers, the complaint of U.S. businessmen that they would lose a potentially lucrative market in Indochina also played an essential role. The smoldering quarrel about an extension of the most-favored-nation clause for the PRC -- Clinton must decide on an extension by summer -- also has two facets: human rights and the determination to use this means of pressure to urge for a balance of the trade balance, which shows an extreme surplus (similar to Japan) for China. The exception from the economically motivated exercises in loosening up is right on the U.S. door step: Cuba. So far, Clinton has not shown any inclination to lift the 30-year blockade of the Castro regime or even just the restrictions on travel. The sugar island, which is no longer a military threat to Washington because it has lost its godfather in Moscow, would certainly be a market. However, in this case, other considerations are important, apart from the historical and political ones. In contrast to the 10 million Cubans who have become poor in communism, there are 1 million refugees who are living and prospering in Florida. They have influence, votes, and the means to fill the election campaign coffers of candidates for president and Congress. As long as Castro clings to power, Cuba is, therefore, primarily part of U.S. domestic policy. Because of his increasingly criticized "fixation" on Russia, Clinton announced that he will put his ostpolitik on a slightly broader basis and include the other states of the former Soviet Union more. This was done in the interest of denuclearizing Ukraine. Ukrainian President Kravchuk can now go on his longed-for trip to the United States. Something similar was done this week during the visit by Kazakh President Nazarbayev. Clinton praised him twice: for economic reforms and for the confirmed desire for disarmament. Thanks to its enormous oil and natural gas reserves, which are developed mainly with the participation of U.S. companies, Kazakhstan is an attractive partner. On this occasion, Clinton advised Nazarbayev, who still seems to be unsure regarding his tactics, to lay his export pipelines rather through Russia than through the territory of America's archenemy Iran. The trade relations between Iran and the FRG, which are uncannily intensive from Washington's point of view, are still a factor of irritation in the U.S.-German relationship, even though they are essentially based on an attitude, which is orientated toward Germany's own economic prosperity -- an attitude that is not alien to Clinton's pragmatic administration in other fields.
