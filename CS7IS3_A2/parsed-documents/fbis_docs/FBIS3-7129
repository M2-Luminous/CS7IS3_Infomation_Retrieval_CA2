Link-ups between the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), NAFTA and other countries such as Australia were the sort of inter-regional ties which could ensure that economic groupings in the Asia-Pacific region remained part of an open global trading system, he said. He was speaking on the opening day of the 10th general meeting of the Pacific Economic Co-operation Council (PECC) on "Open Regionalism: The Way Forward". Under AFTA, the six ASEAN countries will reduce their taxes and tariffs on trade between them to 5 per cent or less by 2008. NAFTA is a comprehensive free trade area comprising the United States,Canada, and Mexico. Mr. Yeo told reporters yesterday that Singapore hoped an AFTA-NAFTA link could be developed along the lines of ASEAN's "6 minus X" formula. Under this formula, those which are ready to proceed do so, while the others can join when they are ready. He was elaborating on his comment during the Pacific leaders forum on open regionalism that while an AFTA-NAFTA linkage would take time to develop, "we are prepared to take smaller steps first". He proposed in his speech that "concentric and overlapping circles of linkages" could reconcile regionalism with multilateralism and prevent the danger of trade blocs developing. Singapore's concentric circles range from its Growth Triangle with immediate neighbours, Indonesia and Malaysia, through AFTA to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) grouping, he said. While all this collaboration was of mutual benefit to those involved, "economic relations cannot be conducted on the basis of strict geometry". "These concentric circles of linkages have to be complemented by linkages that overlap or stretch across circles," he said. [passage omitted on Thai deputy prime minister's speech] PECC's member committees come from the ASEAN countries, Australia, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Russia, Taiwan, the United States, and the Pacific island nations.
