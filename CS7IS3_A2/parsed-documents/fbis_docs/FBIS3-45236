According to local foreign trade officials, in 1993 the province clinched 101.74 million U.S. dollars in exports, fulfilling the state-set export quota for the province and also representing an increase of 12.51 percent over the previous year. The officials attributed the initial success chiefly to the fact that relevant local departments helped export-oriented enterprises solve difficulties and some practical problems. Foreign trade departments also strived to make a success of the export of the province's traditional products, such as carpets and ferrosilicon, while endeavoring to develop new commodities in greater varieties for export. So far, the province has 30 specialized foreign trade, economic and technical cooperation companies, and has established stable trade relations with more than 40 countries and regions in the world. The variety of commodities for export has increased from only nine kinds in 1980 to the present 120 kinds in 12 categories.
