The criticism by Kanshi Ram and Mayavati of the SP-BSP [Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party] coalition government in Uttar Pradesh hints toward the future strategy of the BSP. The BSP does not appear to be willing to play the political game with the SP in Uttar Pradesh for long. Kanshi Ram and Mayavati appear to have already started to write an introduction to their separate political existence. However, Kanshi Ram is not ready to uproot the present U.P. government yet. He did make a public announcement to this affect. It is assumed that the BSP will continue to support the government because it has its own vested interests there along with Mulayam Singh. It is important for this party to remain in the government in order to establish a basic structure for ruling the state. Kanshi Ram is well aware of this practical fact. Kanshi Ram is already rallying popular support by his and his supporters' sharp criticism [of the government]. He will announce his separate political stand at the right time while all this is going on. He wants to stay in the government and create an atmosphere in which he can point to his criticism as a proof that he had given enough time to Mulayam Singh to improve. Mulayam Singh having failed to meet the criteria, however, he (Kanshi Ram) was forced to make this decision. Kanshi Ram's whole political strategy is based on this kind of politics now. He is preparing for the future. Under this plan, some times he talks about evaluating Mulayam Singh's government in about six months and other times he talks about dislodging it. During this period, Kanshi Ram wants to establish his new image. This image will portray him as not willing to compromise when the interests of the Dalits are at stake. So much so that he would not compromise even with the government in which he is a partner. Mayavati's criticism of Gandhi is the climactic point of this effort. The BSP wants to demonstrate that it does not think much of Gandhi as compared to Ambedekar. The BSP has assumed that if it succeeds in keeping the sword of its politics sharp, it will be able to establish its government in Uttar Pradesh by itself whenever the next vidhan sabha elections are held. Kanshi Ram and his supporters are working based on this assumption. Keeping this in mind, he is more or less acting like the opposition leader even though he is in the government. Kanshi Ram has another target. He is hoping that if the Congress Party, which has supported the state government, is forced to take back its support because of the BSP criticism, then it would prove to be politically beneficial to the BSP. However, the Congress Party has also started its preparations perceiving the imminent political changes. It has started a regular campaign against the BSP so that it does not face problems in the future.
