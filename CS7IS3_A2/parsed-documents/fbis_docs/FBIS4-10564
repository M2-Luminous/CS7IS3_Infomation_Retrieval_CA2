FBIS4-10564 "drlat072_n_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-072 Daily Report 27 Feb 1994 Chile First Official Report on Codelco Losses Outlined First Official Report on Codelco Losses Outlined 94SM0296A Santiago LA NACION in Spanish 27 Feb 94 p 5 94SM0296A Santiago LA NACION Spanish CSO [Article by Monica Gonzalez] [Text] Last Wednesday, President Patricio Aylwin finally received the Treasury Inspector's Office's first report on the huge losses amassed by Codelco [Copper Corporation]. And the chief executive must have breathed a sigh of relief upon being informed that--as found by the country's principal auditing body--the responsibility for those losses stops at the level of Codelco's former chief executive officer, Alejandro Noemi. At this point in time, after an exhaustive examination of the proceedings of Codelco's Board of Directors, after taking the depositions, not once but several times, of its former executives and of others who are still with the Copper Corporation, after a thorough analysis of a large number of operations with brokers, and after having heard the testimony of Juan Pablo Davila at least twice (the last was on 14 February), the Treasury Inspector's Office has concluded that there was a flagrant breakdown of the control systems in place for supervision of the operations conducted by the Department of Futures Markets. In a separate paragraph of the report, Treasury Inspection officials Raul Ailtken, Marcelino Pineda, and Martin Garrido conclude that: "The spirit and regulation relative to metals market operations were systematically violated by the Department of Futures Markets, without any supervisory monitoring of the situation having been exercised by the committee created for this purpose, the management, or the deputy manager for sales." The cited committee consisted of Gonzalo Trivelli, vice president of marketing; Ignacio Guerrero, vice president of finance and treasury inspection; Owen Guerrini, sales manager; Carlos Derpsch, deputy sales manager; and Davila himself. The report finds that the committee, created on 24 September 1990 to evaluate periodically and oversee the operations managed by Juan Pablo Davila, ceased functioning on 13 August 1992, the date of record of the minutes of its final meeting. The Treasury Inspector's Office is delving, furthermore, into several of the contradictions incurred by Davila since the irruption of the case. For example, Codelco's former operator has insisted that the computerized monitoring systems that it had been decided to use in futures operations were not used because they were inoperative. After a diligent on-site investigation at Codelco's head office, however, the Treasury Inspector's Office found that, two years ago, the company decided to purchase this monitoring equipment. In December 1991, the necessary hardware--an A.S.400 computer--was purchased, and simultaneously, a contract was signed for procurement of the software. The contract bore a German signature. The investigation revealed that since April of last year the complete system has been in operating condition, and that it was not put into operation not because of any technical fault or lack of any element in the system, but simply because the data that Davila was to provide was never inputted. November: Key Month But there is more. The Treasury Inspection experts also discovered a situation that goes back to a date in November of last year and that has become a key piece in the investigation. On that date, two of Juan Pablo Davila's management superiors, Carlos Derpsch and Gonzalo Trivelli, were informed that as of that moment Codelco had open positions into 1994 involving losses on the order of $10 million. That is, the margin of exposure expressly set by Noemi when he authorized operations of that type had been exceeded by a factor of 10. The information concerning these losses did not emanate from Juan Pablo Davila on that occasion, but from one of his subordinates, operator Gonzalo Sanchez, who for that reason had to testify more than once before Minister Benquis. That seems to have been the starting point of all the confusion as to whether Davila actually realized gains of more than $30 million in 1992. Be that as it may, it turns out that, instead of immediately ordering the placement of stop-loss orders, as they should have, Trivelli and Derpsch allegedly instructed the "star" operator to transfer the loss to 1993. Moreover, the Treasury Inspector's Office report cites another fact that can hardly pour oil on the government's troubled waters. According to the above-named experts, losses could exceed the $206 million figure by an amount close to $40 million. The definitive figure will have to be determined month by month, step by step, given the high degree of fluctuation of copper prices on the international market, and the impact they will have on the still open operations effected by Juan Pablo Davila.
