This is the first foreign reaction in support of Yemen's dismemberment, because even though the southern leaders of Yemen announced their independence at the start of the civil war, no foreign country has yet recognized Yemen's dismemberment or questioned its unity. The stand taken by the GCC foreign ministers in the implicit recognition of Yemen's dismemberment is dangerous, the continuation of which could have disastrous consequences for Yemen as well for as the Arab and Islamic worlds. Among the six Arab countries on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf, only Qatar voted against this decision, and took a unity-seeking stand on the developments in Yemen. In their two days of talks the GCC foreign ministers not only failed to take a step toward solving the crisis of civil war in Yemen but worked toward continuing it. Political experts believe that the stand does not reflect the policies of the GCC countries than but rather the dangerous game that [Saudi] Arabia is pursuing under cover of the GCC. Over and above the negative stand taken on the domestic crisis in Yemen, the rulers of Riyadh seek to push Yemen into an endless crisis and thus forever forget the issue of the three oil-rich provinces that have been occupied by [Saudi] Arabia for decades. The three provinces were occupied by Saudi Arabia in the 1930's and were supposed to be returned to Yemen after 30 years, in the 1960's. But due to the civil war at that time in Yemen, Saudi Arabia managed to delay the deadline for another 30 years. Recently, with Yemen's insistence on the return of the three provinces, Riyadh again sought to intensify civil war and to delay the deadline for the return of Yemen's occupied territories. Political experts therefore believe that the result of the GCC foreign ministers meeting in Saudi Arabia was merely a political pretext for Saudi Arabian diplomacy. Riyadh's policy of causing civil war in Yemen follows the failure of repeated attempts by Saudi Arabian leaders to weaken united Yemen through transferring political, economic, and security crises into that country. Parallel to Riyadh's efforts to perpetuate Yemen's domestic crisis by recognizing the Aden government in the south, Saudi Arabia also seeks to create and magnify a pseudo-crisis in the region, hoping thus to divert public opinion in the region's nations from their own policies of discord. The plan, or to be more precise, the creation of a so-called issue of the three islands and efforts to create differences between Iran and the United Arab Emirates is also within this context. But this weapon is now increasingly losing its effectiveness with the gradual publication of legal and historic documents by official international sources regarding the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran over the islands.
