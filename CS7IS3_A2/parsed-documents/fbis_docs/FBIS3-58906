The more stability-oriented their attitude, "the more scope the Bundesbank has for interest rate reductions," Edgar Meister, member of the Bundesbank Directorate, said in Cologne today. He attributed a "decisive role" to the forthcoming wage negotiations in the public service sector and the metalworking industry. "It must be hoped that the wage negotiating partners will meet their special responsibility for the overall economy and won't send any wrong signals." The Bundesbank Council decision last week to reduce the minimum reserve ratio for banks' sight deposits with the Bundesbank from 1 March, according to Meister, will bring the banking system additional net liquidity of nearly 18 billion German marks [DM]. "This is accompanied by a corresponding reduction in costs which should generally open up scope for a further reduction in bank interest rates," Meister said. Meister again rejected all demands for the Bundesbank to pursue an accelerated policy of reducing interest rates to revive the economy. That is not its task. Moreover, the experience of many countries has shown that active use of monetary policy to stimulate the economy has led "in the end to higher inflation rates with by no means higher employment levels." Accelerated interest rate reductions will also "have a counterproductive effect" on the exchange rate and capital market interest rates. Last year, for example, about two-thirds of issues by public authorities were underwritten by foreign participants. Meister described the cuts in expenditure adopted to consolidate public budgets as "the first important steps in the right direction." In the future, however, a greater concentration on "investment spending at the expense of consumption expenditure" is unavoidable and will continue to "require utmost efforts." With public debts at present standing at nearly DM2 trillion, the state's room for maneuver is already severely reduced. Interest payments are "now the second largest item after social welfare expenditure" in the federal budget. Meister said the demands on the national product must "be more modest in the foreseeable future." Meister assessed current economic developments in cautiously optimistic terms. If oil prices continue to remain low and exchange rates do not have any pronounced inflationary impact, Meister believes that an inflation rate of around 2 percent "in individual months" of the current year is "quite realistic."
