We are against such actions because these are attempts to decide on Crimea's future without taking into account the will of the indigenous population of the peninsula, the Crimean Tatars. Therefore, any intentions by influential forces to do this by purely arithmetical voting will never satisfy the Tatars. [Marynenko] During the telephone conversation with the deputy chairman of the Majlis I also recalled the following: When they asked Meshkov about his relations with the Crimean Tatars in general and the Majlis in particular, he answered that he had good contacts with the Crimean Tatars. Many of them supported him at the presidential election. As far as the Majlis is concerned, in Meshkov's opinion, there is some misunderstanding with its leaders only. I asked Mr. Chubarov to comment on these facts. [Chubarov] This statement is on president Meshkov's conscience because it does not correspond to reality, at least judging by the results of the voting of the Crimean Tatars. In particular, during the first round we analyzed the voting at those polling stations where half or even more electors were Crimean Tatars. At these polling stations Bahrov, as a rule, was running first, other deputies lagging behind. So, I do not trust Yuriy Meshkov's statements of such kind. As far as the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people is concerned, president Meshkov has a good idea of the status of the Majlis. He has more than once declared that the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people is a real force. The majority of the Crimean Tatars support the Majlis and one cannot ignore this fact. [Marynenko] My last question to Refat Chubarov dealt with the March election in the autonomy both to the parliament of Ukraine and to the Supreme Council of the autonomous Crimea Republic. I asked him what was the attitude of the Majlis toward these elections and the participation of the Crimean Tatars in them. Here is the reply by the deputy chairman of the Majlis, Mr. Chubarov. [Chubarov] By the way, unlike... [pauses] This is probably the only advantage of the Crimean election law. The only difference between our law on the election to the Crimean parliament and the law of Ukraine on the election to the Supreme Council of Ukraine lies in the fact that here in Crimea a mixed election system was adopted. We have 66 one-seat constituencies. We have 14 deputy seats in a multi-seat party constituency and 14 deputy seats in a multi-seat Crimean-Tatar constituency. The Crimean Tatars will take part in these elections. The Kurultay [congress] of the Crimean Tatar people approved a list of 25 candidates for deputies in a multi-seat Crimean-Tatar constituency. Altogether four such lists were approved. These are the lists of the Kurultay of the Crimean Tatar people, the Crimean- Tatar Culture Fund, the National Movement of the Crimean Tatars, and the lists of the Culture Center. It is noteworthy that the list of the Kurultay and the list of the Crimean-Tatar Culture Fund include like-minded people. The National Movement of the Crimean Tatars and the Crimean Tatar Culture Center also nominated like-minded people, but on the other side. That is to say, a polarization of forces is under way and the results of the election will, probably, round off all the talk on how many Crimean Tatars support the Majlis or, for example, the National Movement of the Crimean Tatars.
