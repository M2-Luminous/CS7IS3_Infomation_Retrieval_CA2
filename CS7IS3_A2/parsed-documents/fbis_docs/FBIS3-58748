The offer came from the Secretary General of the Commonwealth Secretariat, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, when he spoke at London's South Africa Club. He said: "The Commonwealth's 50 member countries drawn from all the continents and regions of the world will provide the new South Africa with a ready gateway to the wider world." Chief Anyaoku said that central to the resolution of South Africa's accumulated problems will be its ability to reintegrate fully into the world community of nations. He invited South Africa to heal the "family rift" now that it was becoming a non-racial democracy. South Africa will hold its first democratic elections on April 27 with all races able to vote after its Parliament approved an interim constitution leading to black majority rule. Chief Anyaoku said: "By normalising its relations with the Commonwealth, South Africa will at a stroke be consolidating its relations with 50 other countries with influence and a network of relations in their respective regions." He added: "A post apartheid South Africa, reconciled and at peace with itself and its neighbours, will, as far as the Commonwealth is concerned, be sufficient reward in itself. It will be a triumph for the most cherished of all Commonwealth principles, namely, the equality of all human beings irrespective of colour, religious belief, culture or any other adventitious criteria," he said.
