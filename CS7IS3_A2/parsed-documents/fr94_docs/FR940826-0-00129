FR940826-0-00129 FR940826-0-00020 53. Situations may arise in which an applicant has some common ownership interest with another bidder. We wish to clarify that, unless that other entity is expressly identified as an entity with whom the applicant has an agreement concerning bidding, we will prohibit communication concerning bidding with that bidder, as described in the Second Report and Order, even if the other bidder is identified on the applicant's short form application as having some common ownership interest with the applicant. We will retain the anticollusion rule as set forth in the Second Report and Order, with these clarifications. K. Information Disclosure by Applicants and Licensees 54. Petitions. Two petitions deal with the amount of information auction participants are required to disclose. GTE requests that the Commission require applicants to provide full ownership disclosure in their short form applications. 89 GTE asserts that by enabling the Commission and competing applicants to assess the legitimacy of auction applicants, full disclosure facilitates the award of licenses to qualified and eligible service providers. According to GTE, full disclosure also promotes open and informed bidding decision. 89 GTE Petition at 2&hyph;4. 55. SBC asks that the Commission minimize requirements for disclosure of information upon transfer of licenses. 90 SBC states that the point of transfer disclosures is to ``prevent unjust enrichment as a result of the methods employed to issue licenses and permits.'' 91 SBC assserts that rules designed to prevent unjust enrichment should be solely applicable, if at all, to designated entities that receive special accommodations, since the risk of unjust enrichment is high only in auctions where such special accommodations are provided. SBC asserts that the formation of reasonable and efficient alliances would be discouraged by the mandate to expose the details of the alliance to competitors. SBC particularly objects to the requirement that any management agreements or consulting contracts be filed. SBC seeks clarification that the disclosure requirements will apply only to the licensees which either have not begun to offer service or have only offered service for some minimal period of time. 90 SBC Petition at 6&hyph;8. 91 Id. at 6 ( citing 47 U.S.C. §309(j)(4)(E)). 56. Discussion. With respect to ownership disclosure in short-form applications, in the Second Report and Order we decided to require applicants to furnish only minimal information in short-form applications and bidder certifications prior to auctions in order to reduce administrative burdens and minimize the potential for delay. 92 Further ownership disclosure requirements, however, were adopted on a service specific basis in later Reports and Orders. 93 We believe that GTE's concerns are fully met by these requirements. 92 Second Report and Order at ¶165. 93 See Third Report and Order, Appendix at 13; Fifth Report and Order at ¶62. 57. As for transfer disclosure requirements, Congress in the Budget Act required us to develop and test alternative auction designs. 94 We noted in the Second Report and Order that in addition to allowing detection of unjust enrichment, transfer disclosure requirements would provide data necessary for evaluation on our auction designs. 95 We noted that the reporting requirements would allow us to monitor our compliance with the Congressional directive in Section 309(j)(3)(B) to ensure that ``new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive concentration of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants. * ␣9* ␣9*.'' 96 The information will be useful in meeting our statutory obligation to report to Congress on the outcome of the auctions. 97 The information we acquire from transfer disclosures, including purchase price and other aspects of the sale contracts and management agreements, will enable us to determine the ultimate distribution of licenses and the value of the spectrum for particular uses, and will permit comparisons between licenses awarded with and without designated entity provisions. Such analyses require collection of data from all licensees, not just from designated entities or those who have not begun to offer service or have only offered service for a short period of time. As we stated in the Second Report and Order, we do not expect the transfer disclosure requirements to be burdensome to licensees because the documents to be submitted will have been prepared for other purposes in any event. Moreover, parties may request confidential treatment of competitively sensitive information pursuant to §§0.457 and 0.459 of our Rules. 98 Consequently we will retain transfer disclosure requirements for all transfers of licenses obtained by competitive bidding. 94 47 U.S.C. 309(j)(3). 95 Second Report and Order at ¶214. 96 Id. at ¶215. 97 See Budget Act, 47 U.S.C. §309(j)(2). 98 Second Report and Order at ¶215, citing 47 CFR 0.457, 0.459. L. Application-Processing Rules 58. In the NPRM in this proceeding the Commission stated: In order to avoid needless duplication, we propose that the following general filing and processing rules apply to all PCS: Sections 22.3&hyph;22.45 and 22.917(f), and 22.918&hyph;22.945, 47 CFR 22.3&hyph;22.45, 22.917(f), and 22.918&hyph;22.945. For those PCS applicants who file on Form 574, we believe that §§90.113&hyph;90.159 of our rules, 47 CFR 90.113&hyph;90.159, could be used to process those applications with appropriate modifications. 99 99 NPRM at ¶128. 59. Petition. AIDE asserts that the Commission acted improperly in proposing substantive PCS application-processing rules in the NPRM because, it argues, such rules are outside the scope of this rulemaking, which is limited to implementation of the competitive bidding requirements of §390(j) of the Communications Act. 100 AIDE argues that the Commission's proposal of application-processing rules is legally insufficient to constitute a valid notice of proposed rules, and that some of the rules cited have no immediate applicability to PCS service. AIDE asserts that in the Second Report and Order the Commission failed to respond to the merits of the arguments concerning filing and processing rules in AIDE's comments on the NPRM. AIDE concludes that the Commission needs to issue a supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to adopt license-processing rules for PCS. 100 AIDE Petition at 20&hyph;21. 60. Discussion. The competitive bidding process is a means of assigning licenses, and rules and procedures for processing of license application are an integral and necessary part of that process. The Commission adopted few filing or processing rules in the Second Report and Order. Those rules that the Commission did adopt pertaining to the filing and processing of applications and certifications were clearly proposed in the NPRM. 101 The rules to which AIDE refers were adopted not in the Second Report and Order but in subsequent Orders establishing auction rules for specific services. 102 We address AIDE's petition relating to those rules either in the Orders in which they were adopted or in reconsiderations of those Orders. 103 101 See Second Report and Order at ¶¶164&hyph;168, NPRM at ¶¶96&hyph;101. 102 See Third Report and Order at ¶41, n. 18; Fifth Report and Order at ¶83. 103 See Fifth Report and Order at ¶83.
