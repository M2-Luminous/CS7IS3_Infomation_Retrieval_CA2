These questions are not, of course, anything recent, but the general development of the situation indicates that advocates of an ethnically pure (Serbian-Montenegrin) army, in view of recent tragic events, are gaining more and more adherents. The problem, however, is by no means a simple one: The FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Constitution establishes this as a civil state. And what is called "depoliticization and deideologization" of the Army is taking place, but what is happening is that one "belief" (brotherhood and unity) is being replaced by another (the ethnic belief). It seems that the new Army also has problems in its inability to replenish its ranks solidly with military conscripts, which detracts essentially from combat capability. Speaking recently in VOJSKA about the "intolerably undermanned peacetime units," General Jevrem Cokic, commander of the 1st Army, says that the reasons are these: "The lack of veneration for the military calling, the poor functioning of the law-governed state, and the failure to take appropriate steps against those who have not discharged their civic duty, the departure of inductees abroad without the knowledge or approval of the competent regional military commands, evasion of the serving of the summons for induction, dishonest work by the PTT [postal, telegraph, and telephone service] as the entity responsible for delivering induction notices, uneven performance of the requests of regional military commands to apprehend draft dodgers by certain components of the MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs], and draft-dodging by Skipetars and some Muslims and Hungarians. Estimates of how many young men have evaded the draft by going abroad from Serbia and Montenegro go as high as 300,000 "deserters." For a time, there was talk in "patriotic circles" about prohibiting these people from returning to the country. The situation, however, is no better here either: In the same statement, Gen. Cokic complained of the insufficient reporting of conscripts for military exercises, which in the 1st Army (Sumadija and Vojvodina) averages 36 percent; the general referred to Belgrade as "the weakest" within the territory under his jurisdiction--at a disastrous 17 percent! Belgrade It seems that an attempt was made to resolve the issue of the draft by recruitment under contract, but there are many indications that this is going badly. In late 1993, they did a two-day analysis of annual operation in the command of the Podgorica Corps in which that corps' chief of staff, Colonel Momcilo Damjanovic, was to say: "There is an appreciable lack of interest on the part of some of the soldiers under contract, and 256 such soldiers have been discharged in the past year on those grounds." According to what many have said, this "lack of interest" consists of more frequent fights and drinking bouts, i.e., a considerable loss of discipline when soldiers under contract arrive. This makes it more difficult to maintain the already shaky authority of the officers. One of the problems, it seems, is the food. Mento Mentovic, M.A., chief of the Food Service Department of the VJ, said recently in VOJSKA: "If regular inflow of budget funds is not furnished to feed the fighting men, there will be a further drop in the quality of the food.... Today, the energy value and biological value of the soldier's meal is on the lower limit of tolerance, and any further drop would adversely affect the health of the soldiers. Bosnia But what perhaps disturbs the families of VJ recruits the most are the increasingly frequent stories about VJ forces crossing the Drina and taking part in the war in Bosnia. There is mention of death notices in the daily press, nighttime transports of bodies in metal caskets, overflowing hospitals in towns along the Bosnian border, and other details. There have been no official confirmations that such activities are taking place. It is thought, however, that the balance between the Serbian and Croatian "regular" participation in the Bosnian war certainly exists, and that there is a certain "threshold of tolerance" on the part of the western governments. At least three questions arise with the most recent crisis around the northern corridor: Will the FRY enter the Bosnian war even officially, who would issue the order for such a move, and what would be the objectives of waging war in such an operation? Absolute chaos prevails here: The federal and Serbian Constitutions are at variance with respect to decisions on war and peace. Affairs of defense and warfare are the concern of the Serbian and federal presidents, the Defense Ministry, the Supreme Military Council, the federal government, and the parliament. In addition, of course, to the General Staff. Additional confusion has come from the statement of Mr. Radmilo Bogdanovic, vice president of the Chamber of Republics and Provinces of the FRY Assembly, who many consider the unofficial chief of the Serbian police--who said that "a possible attack on Brcko would be proclaimed aggression, because that is a free Serbian city." But he did not go so far as to say whether the response would be the entry of Serbia and Montenegro into the war. A possible mobilization in that connection, of course, would from the outset be deprived of the participation of the Muslims from the FRY and probably that of members of other ethnic minorities as well. On the other side, the response of the "Orthodox" population is also under a big question mark. The experiences of the war in Slovenia, and even more in Croatia, provide best evidence of that. The uncertainty is great and the "manning of peacetime units" would perhaps be better if those who were suspicious saw that the wartime tasks of the VJ, that is, defensive tasks, end on the right bank of the Drina. The prospects of that are not great so long as there is shooting on the other side of the Drina.
