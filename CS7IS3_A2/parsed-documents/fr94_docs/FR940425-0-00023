Section 21.120 is amended by revising paragraph (e) to read as follows: §21.120 Authorization of transmitters. * * * * * (e) After July 15, 1996, the manufacture (except for export) or importation of equipment employing digital modulation techniques in the 3700&hyph;4200, 5925&hyph;6425, 6525&hyph;6875, 10,550&hyph;10,680, and 10,700&hyph;11,700 MHz bands must meet the minimum payload capacity requirements of §21.122(a)(3). 4. Section 21.701 is amended by revising paragraph (d) and adding paragraph (m) to read as follows: §21.701 Frequencies. * * * * * (d) 3,700 to 4,200 MHz. 20 MHz maximum authorized bandwidth. 20 MHz bandwidth channels: ␣ 1Transmit (receive) (MHz) 1Receive (transmit) (MHz) 3710 3750 3730 3770 3790 3830 3810 3850 3870 3910 3890 3930 3950 3990 3970 4010 4030 4070 4050 4090 4110 4150 4130 4170 n/a 14190 1This frequency may be assigned for unpaired use. * * * * * (m) In the 3700&hyph;4200, 5925&hyph;6425, 6525&hyph;6875, 10,550&hyph;10,680, and 10,700&hyph;11,700 MHz bands point-to-point operations on other than the listed frequencies may be authorized where it is shown that the objectives or requirements of the interference criteria prescribed in §94.63 of this chapter could not otherwise be met to resolve the interference problems. PART 22_PUBLIC MOBILE SERVICE 1. The authority citation for part 22 continues to read as follows: Authority: 47 U.S.C. 154,, 303, unless otherwise noted and 307, unless otherwise noted. 2. Section 22.50 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b) to read as follows: §22.50 Transition of the 2.11&hyph;2.13 and 2.16&hyph;2.18 GHz bands from Public Mobil Service to emerging technologies. (a) Licensees proposing to implement services using emerging technologies (ET Licensees) may negotiate with Public Mobile Service licensees (Existing Licensees) in these bands for the purpose of agreeing to terms under which the Existing Licensees would relocate their operations to other fixed microwave bands or to other media, or alternatively, would accept a sharing arrangement with the ET Licensee that may result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to the existing licensee's operations. ET Licensees may also negotiate agreements for relocation of the Existing Licensees' facilities within the 2 GHz band in which all interested parties agree to the relocation of the Existing Licensee's facilities elsewhere within these bands. ``All interested parties'' includes the incumbent licensee, the emerging technology provider or representative requesting and paying for the relocation, and any emerging technology licensee of the spectrum to which the incumbent's facilities are to be relocated. (b) Public Mobile Service licensees in bands allocated for licensed emerging technology services will maintain primary status in these bands until two years after the Commission commences acceptance of applications for an emerging technology service, and until one year after an emerging technology service licensee initiates negotiations for relocation of the fixed microwave licensee's operations or, in bands allocated for unlicensed emerging technology services, until one year after an emerging technology unlicensed equipment supplier or representative initiates negotiations for relocation of the fixed microwave licensee's operations. When it is necessary for an emerging technology provider or representative of unlicensed device manufacturers to negotiate with a fixed microwave licensee with operations in spectrum adjacent to that of the emerging technology provider, the transition schedule of the entity requesting the move will apply. * * * * *
