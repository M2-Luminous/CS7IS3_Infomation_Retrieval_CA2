Speaking at a dinner hosted by President Yeltsin, Kim Yong-sam noted that "we will surely share a great future together if the advanced technology and vast natural resources of the Russian Federation are combined with the industrial development and business management expertise of Korea." Kim Yong-sam expressed confidence that "great friendship and trust" shared by the two presidents, despite their relatively brief association, will "serve as a strong catalyst for further developing relations between our two nations." The president said he hopes that "the Russian Federation will actively participate in the Asia-Pacific economic cooperation forum." According to him, documents concerning the Korean war of 1950- 1953 which were handed today to the Korean president by Boris Yeltsin "will stand as a symbol of our firm determination to make a fresh start in our relations, putting behind us our unfortunate past relations during the era of Cold War." Kim Yong-sam expressed gratitude to the Government of the Russian Federation for "its positive participation in the international movement to block the development of nuclear arms by North Korea."
