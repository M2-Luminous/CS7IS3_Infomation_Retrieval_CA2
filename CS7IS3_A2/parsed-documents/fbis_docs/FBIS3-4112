This is part of the industry's plan for 1994 released recently by the Ministry of Chemical Industry. The ministry also predicted that the industry's annual output value this year will reach 190 billion yuan ($21.9 billion), up 8 percent over the previous year, and its export value will climb 15 per cent from 1993. The annual output of major chemical products such as fertilizer, pesticides, sulphuric acid, caustic soda, soda ash and tyres will exceed State targets, the ministry said. And the industry will speed up restructuring its products to meet demand. In 1993, the output value of radial tyres, which are needed in large numbers by the automobile industry, accounted for 10.7 percent of the overall total, considerably above the 7.5 per cent of 1992. More than 70 kinds of boll-weevil pesticide were used to ensure a stable and high production of cotton in l993. The figure is 1.3 times that of 1992. The chemical industry's output value last year hit 178.79 billion yuan ($20.55 billion), 7.2 per cent more than in 1992. Shanghai and the provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu, Liaoning and Guangdong reported total chemical industrial output worth 10 billion yuan ($1.15 billion). In the first 11 months of 1993, the value of China's chemical exports reached $9.97 billion, up 27.3 per cent from the same period in 1992. Of the exports, the value of fine chemicals and finished products rose sharply and surpassed that of materials and unfinished products. During the same period, China imported 11.02 billion yuan ($1.27 billion) in chemical products, 1.6 percent more than the corresponding period in 1992. Chemical sales in 1993 jumped 19.3 percent over the previous year. And more than 98 percent of the goods manufactured last year were actually sold, up 2.16 percent over 1992. During the year, safety was improved with the renovation of equipment. The number of accidents reported declined by 10 per cent. At the same time, the ministry pointed out that falling profits as well as the rising number of debt plagued enterprises hindered the industry's development last year. In 1993, the country sold 82.73 million tons of fertilizer, 18.2 percent less than the previous year. Output fell 6 percent to 91 million tons. Last year's declining profits are mainly the result of huge increases in the prices of chemical materials, according to the ministry. Because of inflation, the cost of materials used to make fertilizer rose by 3 billion yuan ($345 million) or 1.36 times the industry's total pre-tax profits in 1992.
