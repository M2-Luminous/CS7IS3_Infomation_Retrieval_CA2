The television report blamed these attacks "on Etienne Tshisekedi's extremist supporters." Tshisekedi was prime minister until dismissed from office by President Mobutu in February 1993, however, he remains a candidate for the post. The report's accusation was criticized in this morning's issue of the opposition daily REFERENCE-PLUS, which condemns "this gruesome storyteller's rubbish, which is not based on any inquiry." The two personalities targeted by the attacks belong to Rally of Forces of Democratic Change [RFCD], a member of the radical opposition's "Allies" coalition, which did not back Mr. Tshisekedi's candidacy for the premiership. The RFCD endorsed the candidacy of Mulumba Lukoji, who held the post in 1991.
