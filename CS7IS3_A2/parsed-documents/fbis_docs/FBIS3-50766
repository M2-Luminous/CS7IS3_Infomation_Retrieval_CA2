On the contrary, there is a continuous increase in the number of public employees while corruption and smuggling have not been correctly controlled through strong and persistent measures, so they prevail freely and stronger than ever." Avalos delivered his year-end message to almost 100 businessmen. He said that since 1989, following the coup d'etat, the country has been living an eminently political environment with an almost total absence of an economic policy to guide the nation. "It seems as if the natural agents -- the politicians -- were dazed, insensible to the citizens' demands," he said. Avalos stated, however, that the government cannot be asked for immediate solutions to all problems affecting the country because many are subject to factors that are not under its control. "We believe the government can achieve many immediate solutions through simple political decisions that are being unjustifiably postponed, like the privatization of state companies, the ban on smuggling, and the eradication of corruption in public businesses," he said. He added that state expenditures must be rationalized, that private economic activity must be deregulated, and that the government must establish an honest and upright Judicial Branch. He called for adequate legislation for employer-labor relations, the eradication of criminal violence so as to allow investments, a climate of security and the promotion of industrial, agricultural, and livestock development. Avalos said: "We must also mention the seriousness of certain events which are taking place in the countryside and in the cities with increasingly frequency, which tend to aggravate and which require the urgent attention of the national authorities." He added: "I am talking about criminal and vandalistic actions in addition to cattle stealing, the clandestine occupation of land, and recently to robberies from commercial establishments and from people." The trade representative added that in addition to surreptitious and covert actions, "people are being openly incited to violence by leaders of union organizations which should operate moderately and with the required prudence to contribute to our social peace; not with the arrogance and impudence to weaken it." He added that facing this situation, Feprinco publicly assumes the commitment of adjusting its objectives, actions, and doctrine on norms and procedures that seek to facilitate a peaceful coexistence among all Paraguayans in the quest for a more just and worthy society which is more sensible to its needs. He said he expects this attitude will be endorsed by the national government. Another issue that worries Feprinco and which was reflected in the year-end message is unemployment which at this moment reaches approximately 12 percent of the economically active population (those older than 10 years of age who participate in the labor market or seek employment). He added that some 300,000 people are underemployed. This is reflected in the landless peasants, the increase in the number of poor people, and the massive exodus of workers to neighboring countries. One of the aspects considered worrisome is the continuous increase in the economically active population. Some 50,000 new workers annually seek work but are not absorbed by the labor market. Feprinco also criticized the current labor code, which in the opinion if its leaders, is inflexible, excessively regulatory, and contains rigid dispositions regarding the minimum salary, job security, compensations, and a variety of social contributions that are "almost alien" to the country's reality. It warned that small- and medium-sized companies, which make up 90 percent of the productive apparatus, will be the hardest hit and, as a result, will be adversely affected. This situation will ultimately harm any possibility of modernizing and restructuring local industries. Feprinco President Cesar Avalos said: "We once again call on legislators to consider these aspects objectively and rationally, and urge them to design a labor code that will encourage social and economic development instead of slowing it down." The Feprinco president stressed that the rate of economic growth has decreased; during 1992 it only was 1.7 percent. He stated that the slowdown is not purely accidental -- prompted by adverse international prices or climatic circumstances -- but that it is also due to structural difficulties. He said that prospects for next year, however, look brighter because of the recovery -- in volume and quality -- of our most important agricultural products, which alone will not be enough to totally alleviate the country's great needs. He estimated that next year the GDP will grow by 3.7 percent. The report stresses that agriculture, in spite of the low productivity, continues to be the basic pillar of the country's economy and is possibly the single element that might encourage growth. The Feprinco president believes the increase in the minimum salary that follows a cost of living increase will not solve the problem of the purchasing power of the workers. According to yesterday's Feprinco year-end message: "An increase based on that variable alone merely increases the inflationary process, which has an immediate impact on workers' interests." The report adds that minimum economic stability is absolutely necessary to inject dynamism to the productive apparatus and to improve productivity. "Only then we will stop salary increases from being incorporated into consumer prices and we will increase the purchasing power of the workers, which is also in the best interest of the business community" the report adds. Feprinco recognizes that the economic situation is not good at this time and that this can be clearly seen in the strong deterioration of our balance of trade which this year ended with a deficit of $500 million. The document says that the deficit is caused by the quantity, volume, and value of our exports and the increased volume of imported goods. The report stresses: "Within this social and economic picture, entrepreneurs warn of the dangers of not defining a firm and adequate government economic policy." In another part of the long message, the Feprinco president warns against revoking the successful anti-inflationary government policy. The document adds that inflation is resurging and it is presently estimated at around 20 percent because of the fiscal deficit. The indications that inflation might increase in 1994 -- as a consequence of Central Bank short-term loans to the Finance Ministry to cover for delays in collecting Itaipu royalties and tax collections deficits -- is seen as quite worrisome. The report mentions that the dollar exchange rate has passed 1,800 guaranies per dollar and continues to rise. The report says that the reimplementation of the policy of bank discounts to finance agriculture exports; increases in utility rates, public transport fares, and salaries; and the imminent increase in oil-derived gasoline prices will negatively affect the national economic picture. The report states that tax revenue will not cover expenditures and so the budget includes, among its revenues, resources from abroad in the form of loans and royalties. The document stresses that the problem with that situation is that such resources are reportedly earmarked to finance "very expensive" current expenditures instead of being used to finance capital expenditures, when the advisable thing would be to use that money to finance infrastructure or to promote production. The report warns that if the Finance Ministry uses Central Bank short-term financial credits to compensate for the shortfall arising from uncollected and overdue Itaipu royalties and did not repay them on time, it could create an inflationary process. At one point in the year-end message, the Feprinco president stated that in spite of all its good intentions, the current administration is discharging its duties erratically. He said he believes the appropriate conditions for solving the problems confronting the country go beyond achieving a mere macroeconomic balance. He said they should seek to modernize the agroindustrial sector and thus increase the competitiveness of our products on the international market. The Feprinco president contended that agricultural producers must step up production, but to do so they need to be motivated by good returns and receive economic and technological support. He said: "Industrialists need government support to defend domestic production -- not by raising protectionist barriers that favor costly or inefficient industries, but by strengthening nascent industries." The Feprinco president pointed out that businessmen should end the preferential tax treatment they receive and reduce costs by updating their productive techniques. With regard to the industrial fund, the Feprinco report states that this is a long-standing demand of the sector made through the UIP [Paraguayan Industrial Union] and Feprinco. This project is in the initial stages and $300 million will reportedly be received in foreign aid to fund investments and to enlarge, complement, and streamline manufacturing industries. The Feprinco president stated that the peasants' fund seeks, among other things, to reduce the cost of credit intermediation for agricultural producers who currently pay up to 90 percent in interest rates, to organize producers into cooperatives, and to create and strengthen intermediate rural organizations. The Feprinco report states that although there are tax incentives for foreign investors, risk factors cancel the financial advantages. These risks include the lack of macroeconomic credibility and the lack of security with regard to respect for private property, the eradication of crime, and an independent and efficient judicial system.
