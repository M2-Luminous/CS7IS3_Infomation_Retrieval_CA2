According to reports, the puppet Labor Ministry set labor- management stability as the prime goal for this year's labor policy and growled that it would take stern legal measures on illegal labor disputes, and invoke the right for emergency mediation on strikes in key industries even if they are legal. It also said that it would use the full extent of the law in force concerning the ban on the intervention of a third party to prevent the intervention of outside forces. This shows that the fascist clique's suppression maneuvers to the workers' just demand and struggle will be further intensified. It is not a coincidence that South Korea's main radio station reported that government measures on labor-management dispute were expected to become harder. As in any society, those who create material wealth are workers, and therefore, those who enjoy the wealth should also be the workers. However, South Korean workers are driven to long hours of hard labor in adverse conditions where there is no basic protection facilities for workers. They are only targets for exploitation and suppression. It is inevitable for them to struggle for their right for existence and democracy. Nevertheless, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique brands their just struggle illegal and intends to brutally suppress them. The one who pretended to support the workers' struggle during his days with the opposition party, is betraying the workers and suppressing them now that the sword is in his hands. Traitor Kim Yong-sam, who said in the commitment of his election campaign that he would make a society where workers are honored, once advertised as if he would do something for workers putting out the signboards of civilian government after he seized power. However, his nature is not the one that can side with working people. Suppression of people is a way to survive for the puppet clique. That the puppet clique intensified suppression of the people in the very beginning of the new year by throwing away the nominal labor- management data which it once showed around, and invoking the emergency mediation right that even the preceding military dictator regimes, which were notorious for suppression, could not have dared to attempt to use, proves that it has undisguisedly drawn the sword of suppression completely casting off its civilian skin. Could there be any fascist more brutal than this? The Kim Yong- sam traitor clique is a rare fascist tyrant more brutal than its predecessors. The reason that Kim Yong-sam's clique ran amuck to brutal suppression in the beginning of the new year is not elsewhere. As it has been exposed, during his junket to the United States in November last year, traitor Kim Yong-sam promised to open the South Korean rice market to his master backing down on his commitment that he would keep the rice market with his presidential post. Subsequently, he formally accepted the demand to open the rice market in the Uruguay Round negotiations. It is not simply to ruin the South Korean agriculture and drive the six million farmers to death. As described by the South Korean publications that the Uruguay Round storm was coming, South Korea has no choice but to open not only the agricultural products market but also the South Korean economy's overall market including clothes and industrial products. Therefore, this year in South Korea, it is inevitable for not only farmers but also many people from all walks of life to come out to an antigovernment struggle against Kim Yong-sam clique's treachery and traitorous acts. Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's uncovering of its suppression attempt from the beginning of this year is a precaution for fear of the people's struggle that is expected to explode like a volcano in the future. However, it is merely the last rave of those who have no future. The more brutal the suppression, the stronger will be the people's struggle against it. South Korean people will never cease before the end of the struggle against the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique that sold out the dignity and interest of the nation and country to a foreign force for its own comfort and good and ran amok to fascist suppression. The day the people's fascist will stand on his trial by the people and be thrown to history's night soil bin is not far away.
