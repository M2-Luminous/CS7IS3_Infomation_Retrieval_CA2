The information provided by Octavio Castilla, vice minister for foreign investments and economic cooperation, indicated the Cuban Government has been invited to present its proposals for foreign investment and trade at this conference, which will be held at the Nacional Hotel on 20 to 22 June. The participants include Former Spanish Economics Minister Carlos Solchaga; Cristine Stewart, Canadian minister of state for Latin America and Africa; and six executives from the Canadian Sherrit Company, which is cosponsoring the meeting. The Canadian company is also an important investor in Cuba's petroleum sector. The organizers' original list of approximately 60 people has doubled. They indicated that the reason for the event is the dramatic changes in the Cuban economy, especially Cuba's policy of opening up to foreign investment and its efforts to diversify its foreign markets. The introductory program distributed by THE ECONOMIST stated that Cuba's current severe difficulties present enormous challenges to the companies interested in the small Caribbean nation. But far from detracting interest, this situation seems to add incentives, judging from the participation in the conference for which THE ECONOMIST set a registration fee of $1,500. Great Britain heads the list of participants with 29 businessmen, Canada follows with 28, Spain with 16, Germany with 13, Italy with seven, the Netherlands with five, and the United States with 10, including two Cuban-Americans. Latin America will participate with, among others, four delegates from Colombia, three from Mexico, and three from Venezuela. The program calls for an analysis of Cuba's current economic situation and its outlook, international relations and regional integration, monetary policy and banking system, trade policy, industrialization strategy, incentives for foreign investment, and testimony by investors in Cuba. According to the organizers, the meeting, which is called "Second Round Table With the Cuban Government," will enable international investors and corporate executives to familiarize themselves with and debate the aspects of Cuba that are of most interest to them. The meeting will also include panels of businessmen who are experienced in business dealings with Cuba. These include Bert Denkers, general manager of the ING bank of the Netherlands, and Michihiro Sindo, president of Daisin International of Japan. As part of the round table, there will also be workshops on key sectors of the Cuban economy, such as the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, tourism, and energy and mines. Castilla said the participants include seven mining firms, five tourism companies, five automobile industry representatives, five consultants, and a similar number from the academic sphere -- university researchers on Cuba. The Cuban vice minister indicated that similar events were held in 1992 and 1993. They were organized by the British Euromoney publishing house and successfully made known business and investment opportunities in Cuba. On this occasion, the meeting is enhanced by the promising discovery of petroleum on the island -- precisely with the participation of Sherritt from Canada -- and the profitable operation of other firms involved in the tourism sector and nickel mining, as well as the process of economic reforms whose most recent chapter involved financial reorganization measures. Official Cuban sources commented that an additional draw for the participants is the on-site analysis of the limitations and the cracks in the U.S. blockade against Cuba.
