As State Department Deputy Spokesman Christine Shelly said on Monday [24 January], the talks on the level of heads of delegations will continue over the next few days. Reached by telephone in Washington, Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, Jordanian ambassador to the United States and head of the Jordanian delegation to the bilateral talks, told AL-RA'Y: Yesterday's talks were held separately with the head of each delegation. My meeting with chief Israeli delegate Elyaqim Rubenstein lasted only 15 minutes. It was a preparation for what we may discuss in the coming days. Dr. al-Tarawinah stressed that on the second day of talks with the Israeli side, which will be held at the U.S. Department of State, the Jordanian side will concentrate on the clauses of the joint Jordanian-Israeli agenda, which was signed on 14 September 1993. He said: As heads of delegations, we cannot discuss the details. Therefore, talks will be confined to the agenda and to the way we can proceed along the track in the same past order, that is, in the presence of the three working groups--the water, environment, and energy group; the refugees and economy group; and the security and border group. Dr. al-Tarawinah added: When the Arabs collectively decide to begin the next round of talks, these groups will discuss topics on the Jordanian-Israeli agenda all at once and in a manner that will cover all topics. Asked if Jordan will prioritize its talks with the Israelis by beginning with the simple issues and avoiding the controversial ones, he said: We try to avoid prioritization. The three joint working groups will discuss all issues pertaining to each committee. All in all, these issues cover all topics of the agenda. These discussions will take place at the same time because all the agenda topics are important for Jordan. He stressed that the date of the next round has not yet been discussed between the heads of delegations and the U.S. Administration, which is sponsoring the talks. The State Department deputy spokesman had earlier said talks between the heads of the Arab and Israeli delegations are informal, but more feasible as the parties can probe each other's ideas away from pressure.
