According to Silajdzic, "reassuring trends" emerged lately in many directions of a settlement in Bosnia. He said he hopes that the Russian peace-keeping forces stationed in the area of Bosnia's capital will continue to play a positive role and "help Sarajevo become a symbol of peaceful coexistence between the various ethnic groups on Bosnian territory". The prime minister also noted "the extremely constructive role played by the Russian government, particularly by Foreign Minister Kozyrev and the special envoy of the Russian president, Vitaliy Churkin, in the efforts to reach a settlement in Bosnia." "I hope that in the future they will take an even better-balanced stand. This will only help the process of settlement." The head of Russian diplomacy described his talks with Silajdzic as a "detailed and open exchange of views concerning the basic aspects of a settlement in Bosnia." All the parties involved in the conflict are equally close to Russia, he stressed. "Russia is not only a Slavic nation, but also one of the world's biggest Muslim countries. We strongly oppose discriminatory approach to any of the conflicting sides," Kozyrev said.
