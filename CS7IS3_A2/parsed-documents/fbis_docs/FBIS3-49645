They spoke about Slovene demands that Croatia settles its debt to the nuclear power plant in Krsko. Minister Tajnikar pointed out that the demand for settlement of debts due is a business problem that means that the buyer must pay for the goods purchased. The problem has not been solved and the two ministers will probably meet again soon, after the Croatian minister holds consultations in Zagreb about the Slovene demands.
