The Rwandan presidential guard did not want planes to land in Kigali airport. An agreement with the authorities was finally reached. A first aircraft belonging to the Belgian Army landed in Kigali this afternoon. However, resentment against the Belgians is still very strong within the Rwandan Army. We know that 14 Belgians, including 10 UN soldiers, were killed. Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes condemns this attitude: [Begin Claes recording] Of course, I regret it bitterly because the one country that has been making significant efforts for the benefit of Rwanda for years is Belgium. One cannot forget that we used to be at the top of the charts of countries cooperating with Rwanda. This is really a punishment we do not deserve at all. This applies to the Hutu extremists. Apparently, we have never been forgiven for withdrawing our troops after four weeks (?when there were) irregularities, and -- this is probably more significant -- we have never been forgiven for playing a relatively important role in the peace process where we always took a very objective, a very neutral attitude. We told those political parties that were part of the government and the so-called Patriotic Front rebels that there was only one solution -- namely respect of the agreements, of human rights, and giving priority to the socio-economic situation of the population. Apparently, this was not to everybody's taste. [end recording]
