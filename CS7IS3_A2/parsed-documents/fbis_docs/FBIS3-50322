Ukraine is the Slovakia's only neighbor possessing strategic nuclear weapons. Slovakia considers documents on removing nuclear weapons from Ukrainian territory signed by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton to be an important step on the road towards complete nuclear disarmament, the statement said. Under the Moscow agreement, Ukraine is to rid itself of all 176 nuclear missiles and of almost 1,600 nuclear warheads in exchange for aid amounting to one billion U.S. dollars. "We consider this fact proof that even in complicated social and economic conditions, it is possible to find compromise solutions in the interests of stability and security in Europe. Such an approach could serve as example for other states in solving other important problems," the statement said. It voiced the conviction that all the countries concerned will create the conditions necessary for practical realization of the documents signed and for fulfilling obligations ensuing from the Strategic Arms Treaty (START-1) and the Lisbon protocol.
