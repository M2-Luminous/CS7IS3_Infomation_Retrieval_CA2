The first was a complete absence of private capital at the initial point of the economic reform started in 1992. From this standpoint the 1990's may be called the era of post-Soviet initial accumulation of capital. The second characteristic trait of the economic and political system of the country was an extremely weak state, completely destroyed during the post-communist period. The combination of these two features created in Russia an extremely peculiar economic environment that did not exist in any country implementing reforms. Other former socialist countries also encountered the absence of private ownership, but in none of them was the deterioration of state ties so all-encompassing. Therefore in Russia, despite the attempts to apply canonical and overall correct methods for creating a market, the result was the emergence of a unique economy. In general terms it may be characterized as liberalism pushed to the extreme and made possible by the powerlessness of the state, or superliberalism. In whichever economic sphere the state attempted to operate (prices, money, the budget system, privatization, foreign trade, and so on), at best it was able to set general directions for development, but all attempts at purposeful regulation were unsuccessful. This happened because the old mechanism of macroeconomic management, which went under the name of "bargaining over a plan" or "bureaucratic capitalism," did not disappear as the old state disintegrated; it only transformed itself. Some state bureaucrats, who retained control over production links, budget means, and the ability to distribute (not goods, as before, but this time subsidies) began to swell the ranks of the fast-growing entrepreneurial class. Others, who stayed in the service of the government and local authorities, for all practical purposes commercialized the state mechanism, for their interaction with business predominantly occurred in the form of remunerative relations. The state apparatus turned into one gigantic commercial company or, to be precise, a whole system of companies linked together by complex interconnected interests and mutual obligations. The all-out commercialization is that superliberalism by whose laws Russia lived and which immediately scared the foreigners terribly. The subjects of developed Western countries were used to competing within the framework of rules established from above, in which whoever finds the best combination of utilizing these rules, wins. In the Russia of the beginning 1990's, the winners were those who could maneuver the state into rigging the rules in their favor. Russia also began to scare the West by its new penetration of world markets since, having gotten used to the conditional nature of any imperative, Russian businessmen began to break the established rules of the game in this area as well (first and foremost by engaging in massive dumping). Today the situation is beginning to change. The era of initial accumulation of capital has practically come to an end; a class of proprietors has formed who are becoming increasingly unhappy about the commercial nature of relations with the state. They are sick and tired of engaging in unlawful contact with all bureaucrats, from tax inspector and Central Bank teller to prime minister. A powerful social force has emerged--class solidarity of the new bourgeoisie in their struggle against a specific government business. On the other hand, after the "great reshuffling" of property had been completed, the state lost the underpinning of its commercialization. Bureaucrats' opportunities for business activities declined sharply. The state is beginning to increasingly engage in what should be its principal business: setting the rules of the game in the market. This arbiter, however, still does not shy away from a bribe and whenever possible will not miss the opportunity to profit from the problems of others. It is quite risky to engage in it now, however, since most businessmen believe that it is more expedient to complain about a bureaucrat than to bribe him. The New Economy At first glance the current sectoral structure of the Russian economy is less progressive than 10 years ago. The share of the primary sector has increased (mainly due to the growth in the mining industry while the proportional share of agriculture remained unchanged); the share of the processing industry has declined, among other things at the expense of complex, science-intensive production sectors. This, by the way, has been taken up by the political opposition, which maintains that the fathers of the economic reform are leading the country into deindustrialization. Upon closer inspection, however, it turns out that the situation with respect to the economic structure is not that bad, to say the least. True, the primary sector's share has increased, but is it bad for the country to expand production of oil and gas, which until now had produced the bulk of our hard currency earnings? Moreover, market reform made it possible to attract gigantic foreign investment into the mineral deposits so difficult to develop that it is unlikely they would have been utilized under the old system. Besides, expansion of the primary sector is a temporary phenomenon; it is just that initially for both domestic and foreign capital it was the most attractive sphere of investment. The proportional share of the processing industry has declined, but not because the country took the road of technical regression. The reason is that in the former USSR between 70 and 80 percent of this segment one way or the other was linked to the military-industrial complex. And it is quite natural that sharp cutbacks in military orders could not help but result in closings of gigantic plants producing all sorts of armaments. And, finally, the most convincing argument against all talk about "moving backwards" is the fast-growing tertiary sector--first and foremost the banking and finance segment, and information and transportation sectors. The real problem, however, is that now, after the initial structural shifts, which have led to a normal sectoral equilibrium, economic development faces two alternatives. Russia will either begin pulling itself up toward the models of developed countries of the West (reduction of the primary and secondary sectors as a result of the fast growth of productivity in them, the growth of the tertiary sector due to general computerization, a growing service industry, etc.), or the current, not the most advanced economic structure, will be preserved and Russia will land for a long time in the category of medium-developed states of the "Third World." This is where the new Russian state should say its word in the environment of rejecting that very "superliberalism"--state mechanisms should facilitate fast technological development. We should count among the obvious achievements of the reform radical changes in the monetary sphere. They may be briefly characterized as follows: "Russia now has real money." Of course, in the past, too, the Central Bank issued national currency, but its periodic and unpredictable devaluation by tens of percentage points a month caused people to mistrust it. Let us recall 1995 [as published], when dollarization of the country and the flight of capital abroad have reached an apogee, foreign assets of Russian commercial banks exceeded by a factor of two all exports from Russia, and the total volume of hard currency in the hands of the population exceeded by the same factor the ruble aggregate M0 [cash money in circulation]. Today the inflation figures are quite presentable--a modest 15 percent a year. One does not have to explain how it has affected the entire economy. On the other hand, strange as it may be, a stable ruble and the success in combating inflation aggravated the Ministry of Finance's problems. While in the past a budget deficit could be covered by excessive monetary emission, now the Ministry of Finance is experiencing great difficulties, since the Russian "middle class," not used to honestly paying taxes, is trying to evade this unpleasant procedure by all possible means. As a result, tax evasion reaches 60 percent. The minister of finance said angrily that if his compatriots "do not like paying taxes," perhaps they will consider deductions into the budget as charitable contributions to the treasury. Tax evasion also is linked with the shadow economy, which has remained in place to a great extent. A considerable number of small- and medium-size businesses still combine legal and semi-legal forms of business activities. And only major industrial giants such as Gazprom, YuKOS, LUKoil, and old foreign trade companies (Moskva-Nafta, Uraneksportprom, and others) attempt to work Western-style, which, by the way, is what attracts Western investors to them. At the same time, the confidence of partners and consumers is beginning to be seen increasingly as a serious intangible asset of a company, which creates certain preconditions for the decline of shadow business. The unemployment picture presents a paradox. Contrary to expectations, its perceptible growth fell not in the years of greatest structural shifts, when armaments production was being cut at a fast rate and previously subsidized enterprises were closing (1994-1996) [as published] but in later years, by the end of the century, when, it would seem, the main structural problems had been resolved. Unemployment "arrived late" due to an initial extremely low level of the national wage. In 1993-1996 [as published] the average wage was no more than $50 a month: at this kind of wage one does not need to invoke the Phillips curve to explain low unemployment rates. Extremely cheap labor made it possible for the authorities to forget about employment problems in those years. Then the situation changed, however. A fast rising standard of living in the society plus hired labor's awareness that wages should include all social costs--in the past borne by the state (housing, education, child rearing, health care)--caused an unprecedented rise in the national level of income. Today the average wage is $450 a month, and the young people's expectations are much higher. Simultaneously with the growth of income, unemployment began to rise. From the initial 1.2 percent (the lowest in the world) it rose to 5.7 percent--not too high to speak of a catastrophe, but not too low to ignore it. It is unlikely that local methods (paying allowances, retraining, public works) will help in combating this social ill. A more effective method is increased investment and better competitive standing of the Russian economy, which actually coincides with the general goals of future economic development.
