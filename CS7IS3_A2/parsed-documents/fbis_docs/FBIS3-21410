Attached to the pamphlet was another page with a standing order to the bank, on the other side of which was written: "Contribute by a standing order a daily shekel to the settlements, and the medallion will be sent to you. A daily shekel: a bronze medallion, 2 shekels a day: a silver-plated medallion, 5 shekels a day: a numbered silver-plated medallion, by an annual standing order or by credit card." All this appears in the framework of a campaign by that council that is called "Yesha' Is Here," a campaign during which young settlers are covering most of the road signs in the country with the same caption, in an attempt to persuade the satiated Israelis that Yesha' will pursue them everywhere, even in their quiet neighborhoods in the coastal plain, because there is no difference, in their opinion, between Nablus and Tel Aviv. Not a little has already been written about the change of terminology from "settlement" [a heritary portion] and "settlement" [a place to live] by the settlers in the territories. When their campaigns of pushing into centers of Arab population in the West Bank began, it seemed to them that they were continuing on the path of Joshua Bin-Nun, the great settler [on a hereditary portion] (and, by the way, that is also the biblical figure most admired by the former prime minister, Yitzhaq Shamir--not King David, not Jeremiah and Isaiah, not Moses our Teacher, but precisely the one-dimensional, combative, and strong-man figure, a grey and boring man like Shamir himself). Therefore, they chose with great pride the words "settlement" [on a hereditary portion]. After they learned that the word itself was in the eyes of many Israelis a synonym for a messianic minority group that seeks quarrel and strife, whose entire goal is daily friction with the Palestinians, they changed the concept to "settlement" and to "settler," to say: we are the torchbearers and following in the steps of the first, second, and third aliyahs, we are the true descendants of the pioneers and founders of this country. This Is the Time To Settle On the second page of the small, colorful pamphlet of the 'Aly settlement located between Ramallah and Nabulus, in the heart of the territories of the autonomy that is intended for the Palestinians, is written, "Now is the time to settle in the heart of...," states the upper caption, and farther below is stated: "I went up and I fell in love...how could it not be?" And in smaller letters: "You have a wonderful dream. You want quality of life, good company, a single home, a well-tended garden, a breathtaking view. You want the best for the family. You want to participate and be a partner in the upbuilding of the land. Call us. We also want to do that. 'Aly's absorption team will be glad to host you. You will suddenly discover that you, too--in an accelerated process and on excellent purchase terms--can realize your dream. 'Aly--a settlement in the heart of the country and in the heart of the people. A 40-45 minute drive from Jerusalem and Gush Dan. A heterogeneous settlement, absorbing families and young couples. Employment opportunities and studies at a reasonable distance. Good air and wonderful scenery from every window. Houses at surprising prices! Possibilities for purchase and rental." Everything is asked here, except for some most important matters: Do you want to endanger the members of your family? Your small children are endangered every day by an ambush at night and stone throwing by day. Have you lost your mind, precisely now, to move to this dangerous place, precisely in the middle of the negotiations with the Palestinians? Did you know that 'Aly is located in the heart of the Palestinian autonomy? It is difficult not to be impressed, for example, by the sentences: "A breathtaking view...good air and a wonderful view from every window." And what is the landscape seen from every window in 'Aly? A landscape of Palestinian villages on every side. A 45-minute drive from Jerusalem or Gush Dan, but what a route! A friend who is a resident of 'Ofra, which is nearer to Jerusalem than the settlement of 'Aly, and who works in Jerusalem, told me of her daily fears on the way to work and on the way back. That delicate woman, armed with a pistol in the glove compartment, and twice a day she is overwhelmed by fear, especially when she transports her small children. This is an arrogant notice, which intentionally ignores the difficult reality, with the aim of trying to tempt whoever is still unaware of the new facts of life in the field. After a difficult intifadah of six years, it recommends moving to a godforsaken settlement in Samaria, in the heart of the danger, and to move from his home within the Green Line for the sake of "good company, a single home, a well-tended garden." Who are they trying to persuade, when every day we see on television reports about serious concerns on the part of the settlers, who are seeking to abandon their homes and return immediately, almost in flight, to their former places? Had they only mentioned in one or two words the serious and complicated problems that confront anyone who decides now to bring his family to a settlement in Samaria, it would be possible to relate to this announcement properly. But only a fool or someone who has become mentally disturbed would believe the settlement announcement of 'Aly, which says that: "You want what is best for your family." The Nation Is Behind Us But the height of arrogance is the notice on the following page, the third page of the pamphlet, which cites several sentences from the appeal, "The Union of Rabbis," in the name of a conference of 1,200 rabbis that was held in Jerusalem. The notice states: "The decision to give up parts of Eretz-Yisra'el that we hold lacks authority, contradicts Jewish faith and tradition from generation to generation, was not taken by the nation, and action must be taken to abrogate it as if it never were. The agreement involves a real mortal danger to many in Israel." What does it mean, "was not taken by the nation"? The nation accepted it a long time ago, and the proof is that after a policy of massive encouragement by the various governments (including those of the Alignment, but primarily of the Likud) for 26 years, generous loans, almost free gifts of houses and land (usurped), the number of settlers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip comes to 110,000; 2.5 percent of the Jewish residents of the state. That is all. An negligible minority, indeed problematic, but not significant. The people voted with their feet even before they voted at the ballot box, they decided to stay at home and not to be tempted to messianic adventures. The same appeal by the rabbis talks about the agreement involving "a real mortal danger to many in Israel." As if the current presence of the settlers throughout the West Bank and Gaza does not constitute a real mortal danger for every settler and the members of his family. It is precisely their current presence there that brings upon each and every settler the immediate danger, and every unnecessary presence there only increases the dangers. But just as a not inconsiderable portion of the settlers already know that their struggle is almost lost, and that it will be necessary, at the end of the process, to withdraw from most of the area of the West Bank and the Strip, they also know that they cannot struggle within their own camp with the extreme standard bearers, who march with eyes almost shut to a struggle that is already lost, which will only increase division and strife in Israel. So we can expect in the coming year and the one afterwards to be witnesses to an attempt, which already appears pathetic and desperate, to hold on to the settlers' past achievements, while consciously ignoring and attempting to blur the severe dangers and the reality that is crystallizing in the territories. And all because they adhere to the anachronistic formula that also is written in the pamphlet that is signed by the heads of Yesha', according to which, "It again becomes clear that it is the settlements that will determine the borders of Jewish sovereignty and the future of the state and its security." A sign, which was written by the Yesha' Council on the main Jerusalem-Tel Aviv road in the area of Latrun, says "Yesha' is here." An anonymous hand added below: "Wrong, it is not here." Correct, a bad mistake, a mistake that is costing us a lot of blood.
