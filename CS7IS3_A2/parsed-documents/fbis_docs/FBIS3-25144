FBIS3-25144 "drafr027_e_94002" FBIS-AFR-94-027 Document Type:Daily Report 9 Feb 1994 WEST AFRICA Cote d'Ivoire Funeral Service Held for President Houphouet-Boigny AB0802204594 AB0802204594 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Abidjan La Chaine Nationale Une Television Network in French on 7 February carries in its regular 2000 GMT newscast a report on the final obsequies of the Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny at the Our Lady of Peace Basilica in Yamoussoukro. The announcer says the ceremony "started this morning at the Felix Houphouet-Boigny Foundation for the Promotion of Peace, where the wake continued throughout the night Saturday, 5 February, until this morning. The remains were then transferred to the Our Lady of Peace Basilica for the requiem mass." The video shows Houphouet-Boigny's coffin, which is draped in the national colors, being carried by military officers in ceremonial dress to the basilica. A long procession of about 15 Catholic bishops from Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Togo, and Senegal and a representative of the pope, as well as priests and mass servers, precede the coffin, which was immediately followed by the widowed first lady, Marie-Therese Houphouet-Boigny, who is flanked by President Henri Konan Bedie and his wife. The announcer says that "many foreign heads of state came to join us in our pain to participate in this requiem mass. They include Togolese President Gnassignbe Eyadema, Cameroonian President Paul Biya, Congolese President Pascal Lissouba, Guinean President Lansana Conte, Niger President Mahamane Ousmane, Gabonese President Omar Bongo, Cape Verdean President Antonio Monteiro, Chadian President Idriss Deby, Namibian President Sam Nujoma, Guinea-Bissau President Bernardo Vieira, Gambian President Sir Dawda Jawara, Burkinabe President Blaise Compaore, Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, and French President Francois Mitterrand." He continues: "Also to be noted is the attendance of Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi, Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, Malian President Alpha Oumar Konare, Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings, and other high-ranking political personalities," adding that the presence of all these foreign dignitaries shows "how much President Houphouet-Boigny was held in high esteem outside our country." In his homily, Monsignor Bernard Aggrey, bishop of the Yamoussoukro Diocese, who co-celebrated the mass with Cardinal Bernardin Gantin, special representative of Pope John-Paul II, said: "That President Houphouet-Boigny was a prestigious traditional and modern chief, acclaimed worldwide, testifies to this rainbow of personalities who have come from all over the world to pay their last tribute. Houphouet-Boigny, who, in his lifetime, was overwhelmed with honor, loaded with glory, and covered with praises from everywhere, breathed his last during the early morning of 7 December 1993 and then joined God the Father, who created him, like other men, in his image and likeness." After the mass, the long procession of clergy left the basilica, followed by the immediate family of the deceased, who then lined up in front of the building to receive the condolences of all the heads of state and the delegations who attended the mass. The coffin was then carried out of the basilica by the same group of military officers and handed over to the family. The cloth of national colors in which the coffin was draped was neatly folded and handed to Marie-Therese Houphouet-Boigny, according to the announcer. The coffin was then placed on an Army vehicle and driven to the gates of the president's personal residence, where the coffin was formally handed over to the family. The video shows a large crowd watching the coffin as it is taken into the compound of the residence. The announcer says the burial will be restricted to family members.
