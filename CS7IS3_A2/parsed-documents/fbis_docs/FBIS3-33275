FBIS3-33275 "drlat035_n_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-035 Document Type:Daily Report 22 Feb 1994 Chile Ambassador Linked to Italian Bribery Scandal PY1802201394 PY1802201394 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish, in its 11 February issue, carries on page C3 a 900-word unattributed article about alleged links between Chilean Ambassador to Switzerland Alejandro Montesino and former Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi in a bribery scandal in Italy. According to Peruvian congressman Fernando Olivera -- who was interviewed in Lima by EL MERCURIO correspondent Anibal Alvarado -- Montesino lived in Italy from 1974 to 1988 after the 1973 military coup in Chile. There he worked for the Italian Socialist Party and became "Craxi's man of trust" for international cooperation programs with Latin America. Olivera accuses Montesino of being involved in the bribes charged by several former Italian government officials to construction companies that carried out works in Latin America through the international cooperation program. "Olivera maintains that Montesino allegedly attended a meeting between Craxi and former Peruvian President Alan Garcia in September 1989 in the Excelsior Hotel." According to some former Peruvian government officials, Olivera said, "Montesino `had authority delegated directly from Craxi.'" The article also reports that Montesino, who is currently in Santiago recovering from a car accident while on vacation in southern Chile, categorically denied to EL MERCURIO the statements made by Olivera about his alleged involvement in the Italian bribery scandal on account of his relation with Craxi. Olivera made the accusation for publicity so "`I deny his charges categorically,'" Montesino says in the article.
