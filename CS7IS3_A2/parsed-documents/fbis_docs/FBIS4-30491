This will reduce transportation cost to a level similar to airplanes, and will make many new projects, such as lunar exploration and solar power generation satellites, possible. This was the first time a concrete program, including cost estimates, of reusable space systems has been made public in Japan. As the enormous cost of massive space development programs in the 21st century is becoming a problem, NASDA's estimate will certainly animate the debate on this issue. This estimate is contained in a NASDA report: "A Study on the Repercussion Effect of Space Infrastructure." The report recommends replacing the present transportation system using disposable rockets with a "new space infrastructure" based on the concept of repeated use. It proposes a "space shuttle system" going back and forth between the earth and outer space like airliners. Under this scheme, "orbit operations spacecraft" responsible for maintenance work of satellites, "fuel stations," and "inter-orbit transport spacecraft" moving between different orbits will be launched in space. All these spacecraft are to be reusable. According to the estimate, a shuttle spacecraft (development and operation cost estimated at $25 billion) and six inter-orbit transport spacecraft (development and operation cost $7.6 billion) will be developed in 10 years from 1995, and these will be in service for 20 to 30 years. As a result, while accumulated cost for the reusable space system, including development cost, will be overwhelmingly higher than the original disposable system at the beginning, by the year 2020, or the 15th year after going into service, cost for the two types will be almost the same, after which the reusable system will be more cost-efficient. Compared to the annual operating cost of $7.5 billion for the current disposable system, cost for the reusable system will be around $2 billion, or about 25 percent. With further efforts to improve efficiency, it will be possible to reduce cost to 10 percent. With the new "space infrastructure," it will be possible, for instance, to extend the endurance of artificial satellites dramatically by replacing batteries or refuelling. Furthermore, since repairs will be possible on the orbit, the extremely high level of reliability required at present will not be necessary. This will make lower development and manufacturing cost possible. The study foresees a project of transporting several hundred tons of helium 3, a nuclear fusion fuel which is abundantly available on the lunar surface, to the earth. While the transportation cost under the old disposable system makes up as much as one-fourth of the entire world space budget (around $70 billion), under the reusable system, cost will be merely one-tenth. Therefore, the project "is possible even without obtaining new appropriations."
