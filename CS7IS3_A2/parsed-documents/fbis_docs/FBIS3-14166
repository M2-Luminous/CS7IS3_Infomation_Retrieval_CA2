In a statement to QUDS PRESS, al-Zir said: Our job is not to approve such things. He noted that "the municipality has specific tasks which do not include supervising a police force." Al-Zir said, however, that "the setting up of a police force in Hebron should be carried out in coordination with the PLO and Arab states that have ties with the city, such as Jordan and Egypt." He stressed that "the Palestinians are demanding the establishment of a strong, armed, and independent police force in Hebron." Al-Zir added: We do not accept this force being subordinate to any Israeli authority no matter what shape this link might have. [passage omitted]
