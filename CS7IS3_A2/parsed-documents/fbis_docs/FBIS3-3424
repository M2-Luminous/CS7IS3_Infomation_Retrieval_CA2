The ministers hope the discussions will help address some of the challenges facing the region, including ensuring non-inflationary regional growth and financing investment and infrastructure development. The meeting is held in accordance with the vision statement issued on November 20, 1993, in Seattle, when the APEC leadership conference was held. In an opening statement to the meeting today, U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen said that the meeting represents "the first opportunity for regional discussions about basic issues like economic growth and financial challenges." "It would be hard to imagine a group of finance ministers with more of a reason to consult. The region includes the world's fastest-growing economies. We account for half the world's output, half the world's foreign exchange reserves, and nearly half the world's population. "And trade within our region has reached 1 trillion dollars a year," he said. Bentsen said, "All this growth brings with it a need for a broadened perspective. In today's interdependent world, this kind of economic performance cannot be sustained in a vacuum. We all share an interest in economic strength for the region as a whole." He said that uneven and divergent economic performance in the region "creates uncertainty, uncertainty retards investment, and investment is essential to sustained growth." "That is why we need to consult and to cooperate in identifying successful economic strategies for the future," Bentsen said. Attending the meeting are finance ministers and their deputies from APEC nations of Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and the United States. Hong Kong and Chinese Taipei are also participating in the meeting as regional economies while Chile, which has applied for APEC membership, is attending as an observer. No specific agreement was expected at today's meeting. A draft summary of the meeting has been handed out to the delegates. But changes are expected during discussions among the ministers. Also speaking at today's meeting, Indonesian Finance Minister Mari'e Muhammad said that "foreign capital can play a significant role in promoting the efficiency of domestic resources." He said Indonesia recognizes that its resources cannot meet all of its financial needs, particularly in the area of infrastructure development. Analysts say that over the next decade, Asia will need investments totaling some one trillion U.S. dollars to develop highways, airports, telephone lines, ports and power plants.
