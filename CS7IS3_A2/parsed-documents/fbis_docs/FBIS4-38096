"These countries through extensive financial, propaganda and political backing support a grouplet which is involved in the bomb blast at the holy shrine of Imam Reza (as) [peace be upon him]," the president said addressing the inaugural session of the nationwide seminar on "judicairy week." "Such countries provide the MKO with money, radio station, office and diplomatic passports and support the manifestation of terrorism and also open their gates to them," noted Hojjat ol-Eslam Rafsanjani. The seminar is held annually to commemorate martyr Beheshti, the first chief justice in the post-revolution, who was assassinated by the MKO terrorists. The president stressed: "We attach no importance to those countries and place no hope in them. However, we can offer the world the best type of human rights based on Islam and Islamic laws." Referring to the progress made in the country, the president stressed that the enemies are not totally disappointed and would resort to vicious acts such as bomb blast at the holy shrine which could please no obstinate individual. "We know our enemies and understand that the hostility and grudge they have harbored against the revolution is not because of individuals. They are scared of the Islamic movement and of the final triumph of Islam," he noted. He called on all people to preserve their vigilance in all dimensions, adding that they should also be prepared to face more vicious propaganda because the enemies increase their brutal acts as the country progresses. Praising the martyrs of the Islamic republic, especially martyr Beheshti, the president said that some 13 years ago when masterminds behind the bombing of the Islamic republic party's headquarters were hatching the plot, they were vainly thinking that through the bombing the Islamic republic would collapse and the way would be paved for the establishment of the type of government they were seeking for. The president pointed to the achievements of the country in many fields and said that the Islamic system, by passing through "arduous defiles" has now reached a path rather easier to pass. Chief justice Mohammad Yazdi, Justice Minister Hojjat ol-Eslam Shushtari and judges from throughout the country were present at the gathering.
