Here is our radio's opinions: The newspaper CAMBODIA LIFE on 19 January quoted sources as saying that Khmer Rouge General Chhit Choeun or Mok has ordered the Khmer Rouge's 998th Division to step up its operations around the Tonle Sap lake area to kill fishermen of Vietnamese origin. The newspaper commented that the 998th Division comprises of young soldiers who are notorious for their barbarous acts. This is not the first time the Khmer Rouge conducted terrorist acts against people of Vietnamese origin in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge have never renounced their attempts to massacre these people, especially since 1993. On 10 March last year, the Khmer Rouge killed 46 people of Vietnamese origin in Chong Khneas village, Siem Reap provincial capital, near Tonle Sap lake. During the massacre, the Khmer Rouge resorted to barbarism in their killing of women, children, and old people. Vietnamese residents living in Cambodia are under the threat every day and every hour. The Vietnamese Government and the world public have many times condemned the Khmer Rouge for such barbarous acts and called for appropriate measures to protect these people. However, until now, there have never been positive actions taken. The newspaper CAMBODIA LIFE said the Khmer Rouge continue the policy of discrimination against Vietnamese nationals and the world community should take appropriate measures to check the barbarous hands of the Khmer Rouge.
