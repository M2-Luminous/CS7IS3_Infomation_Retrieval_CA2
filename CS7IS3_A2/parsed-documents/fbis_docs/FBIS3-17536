In his words, the Russian possible signing of a corresponding framework agreement will not infringe Russian interests but help to enhance Russian influence on many foreign political processes in Europe and throughout the world. The deputy foreign minister stressed that Russian-NATO contacts within the Partnership for Peace framework will not hamper comprehensive cooperation with Commonwealth states, which are of special interest for Russia. Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council Valeriy Manilov said that the Russian adoption of the Partnership for Peace program has not been "directly" discussed at the Security Council, but will be considered as part of Russian foreign political activities at the next council meeting. He said that Russian participation in the program is a "compromise between supporters and opponents of NATO expansion". A refusal from this partnership may result in Russian political isolation on the European continent. Manilov described the program as a "door to European collective security". First Deputy Defence Minister Andrey Kokoshin told the Duma meeting that the NATO program carries no threat to Russian interests. He stressed that Russia, being a great power, carries a special responsibility and special obligations on the upkeep of universal peace and stability. The State Duma will return to the discussion of Russian participation in the Partnership for Peace program at the next stage of parliamentary hearings on the issue.
