FR941007-1-00007 FR941007-1-00001 The relationship between externality adders and environmental regulation has been extensively studied. One key finding is that proper use of externality adders does not turn on whether there is ``overcontrol'' or ``undercontrol'' in existing environmental regulation. Rather, taking the environmental control regime as given, the use of externality adders can improve net national welfare by moving ``private'' decisionmaking within the existing regulatory regime closer to ``social'' decisionmaking. For example, even if there is ``overcontrol'', it is still desirable that the external impacts of differences in residual damage resulting from differing emissions levels associated with alternative energy supply and end-use efficiency options be reflected in private decision-making. Based on its current understanding, the Department also believes that existing uses of externality values in the resource planning process do not present a barrier to the use of externality values in setting appliance standards. The former are largely focused on bringing social costing considerations into capacity planning decisions, while the latter is focused on reducing marginal electricity demand. The Department also notes that the use of externality values in the capacity planning process is far from universal. According to a recent report of the Consumer Energy Council of America Research Foundation (July 1993) only seven States and the Bonneville Power Administration use quantitative externality values. Issue 2: The impact if any, of existing environmental regulations on the determination of externality values for use in the appliance standards analysis. Based on its current understanding, the Department believes that the emission-reducing effects of existing programs will affect externality values in two distinct ways. First, the form of current environmental regulations can influence the net emissions impact of changes in energy use associated with alternative appliance standards. This net emissions impact reflects both the direct impact of changes in energy use_emissions associated with changes in primary energy either directly or to generate additional electricity_and indirect impacts that may arise due to emission caps, offset requirements, non-attainment rules, or other features of existing regulations. For example, if regulation takes a form that fully ``internalizes'' environmental externalities on all of the relevant margins, including, in the case of electricity, not only utility decisions related to capacity, but those related to dispatch and additions to capacity, as well as consumer demand decisions, the role for a supplemental externality value is difficult to identify. An emission tax equal to marginal damage that was reflected in the market price is one example of a policy instrument (albeit not one in widespread use) that would align private and social decision-making on all three margins.
