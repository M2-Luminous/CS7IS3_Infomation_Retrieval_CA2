FR940318-0-00246 FR940318-0-00024 6. Failing the RMP Individual Proficiency and RCP Exams Applicants to the RCP program and/or the individual proficiency component of the RMP program may take the written examinations as often as they wish. However, each request for a re-test must include a $50.00 processing fee. This processing fee reimburses EPA for the data-entry of the re-test request and for scheduling a new examination date for the applicant. As with the RMP program, EPA notifies participants in writing of their results. If an individual decides not to take the individual proficiency exam or the RCP exam within the fiscal year the application and appropriate fee were submitted, a new application must be submitted with the appropriate fee. Fees will not be refunded in the event an applicant fails the exam and/or chooses not to re-take the exam. 7. Implementation Guidance EPA will make available detailed implementation guidance prior to effective date of this rule. Copies of this document can be obtained by contacting the RIS at (205) 272&hyph;2797 or by FAX at (205) 260&hyph;9051. 8. Adjustment of fees EPA shall collect 100 percent of its operating costs associated with its radon proficiency programs within five years of the effective date of this rule. In order to do this, EPA shall adjust the initial fees established by this rule each year over the next five years to collect the following percentages of program costs: ␣ 1Initial Fees 2Year 1 2Year 2 2Year 3 2Year 4 2Year 5 30% 47.5% 65% 82.5% 100% Assuming that the Agency's cost of running the proficiency programs remains unchanged over the next five years and assuming that the level of participation in the proficiency programs remains constant, the fee schedule for the next five years would be as follows: ␣ 1Program element 1Fee year 2 1Fee year 3 1Fee year 4 1Fee year 5 RMP program: Primary $875 $1,200 $1,500 $1,825 Secondary 125 175 200 250 RMP individual proficiency: 150 200 250 300 RCP program 375 525 650 800 The actual fees for each fiscal year will be calculated based on program costs and participation rates. New fee schedules will be published in the Federal Register by January 1 of each year as a technical amendment final rule to become effective 30 days or more after publication. EPA will use a three-step process to adjust fees annually. First, EPA will estimate the costs of providing each of the proficiency programs for the upcoming year. EPA will account for future additional fixed costs (e.g., updating examinations) and increases/decreases in variable costs due to inflation and other factors. In order to calculate increases/decreases in cost due to inflation, EPA may use one of the three following indices: The Federal General Schedule (GS) pay scale, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and/or a component of the CPI, such as services. Second, EPA will estimate the number of participants for each program. At a minimum, these participation rates will be based on past and current program participation rates. Third, EPA shall calculate the per capita costs that individuals or organizations should pay to enable it to recover its fixed and variable costs each year for each program. EPA shall also consider potential industry impacts as it adjusts to levels to ultimately achieve full cost recovery over the period of five years.
