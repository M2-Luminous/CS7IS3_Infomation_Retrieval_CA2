FR940922-1-00039 FR940922-1-00008 •Control Measures Explicitly Mandated Under the Act The Act includes a broad array of measures applicable to stationary as well as mobile sources. As discussed above, EPA calculated emission reduction estimates from these controls and input them into ROM to study the impacts for particular meteorological episodes. 36 The modeling incorporated the following measures that, for technical reasons, may differ slightly from those mandated in the Act. 36 EPA used an 80% Rule Effectiveness value in calculating the overall effectiveness of control measures. Rule effectiveness was applied to all controls that were not an irreversible process change (for which 100% effectiveness was assumed). Thus, for the controls that consider Rule Effectiveness the emission reduction due to a particular control device was calculated as the product of the control efficiency and the Rule Effectiveness value. For example, a device that controls at a level of 75% would produce an emissions reduction of only 60% (i.e. 0.75 × 0.80). Rule effectiveness is explained in detail in this section, below. 1. Reasonably available control technology (RACT) on ``major'' point sources of NO X and VOC; 2. Federal emissions standards in place for off-highway vehicles; 3. Federal reformulated gasoline requirements in all OTR nonattainment areas (including Phase II standards); 4. Enhanced Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) programs for all metropolitan areas with populations above 100,000; 5. Emissions cap on large point sources (above 100 tons per year 37) after 1996 to reflect offset requirements for new and modified major sources (i.e., equivalent to new source review requirements and 1:1 offsets); 37 The model assumed the 100 tons per year cutoff for reasons related to the construction of the air quality model. EPA recognizes that smaller sources are also subject to new source review requirements. These are treated in the model as stationary area sources. The model cannot readily separate those individual smaller sources subject to new source review from other smaller sources. 6. Emissions cap on area sources in each nonattainment area beginning on the attainment deadlines for those areas to reflect maintenance requirements; 7. ``Stage II'' vapor recovery controls on gasoline pumps in all metropolitan areas with populations above 100,000; 8. Application of RACT controls specified in EPA's Control Technique Guidelines (CTG's) for eleven source categories; 38 38 These CTG's include reductions from area sources as well as point sources, and therefore go beyond the RACT controls identified in 1. 9. Federal controls on emissions from commercial solvents, marine vessel loading, municipal landfills and hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDF's); 39 39 One commenter asked that EPA, in assessing the need for the OTC LEV program, consider the potential for emissions reductions from landfills. EPA has proposed a new source performance standard (NSPS) for landfills and proposed guidelines for existing landfill sources. See 56 FR 24468 (May 30, 1991). EPA expects to take final action on the NSPS and the guidance by December 1994. EPA has taken the resulting emissions reductions into account among the Clean Air Act mandatory measures. 10. Federal ``Tier I'' tailpipe emission standards for new vehicles; 11. Federal evaporative emissions controls for new vehicles; 12. Federal ``Phase 2'' controls on gasoline volatility; 13. Federal Maximum Available Control Technology (MACT) controls for hazardous air pollutants (which include VOCs) for approximately forty source categories; 14. Federal controls on NO X emissions from coal-fired utility boilers under the Acid Rain program. EPA calculated that application of these controls mandated in the Act would achieve emissions reductions by 2005 in the OTR of 20% for NO X and 37% for VOC from the 1990 baseline. As discussed above in sections IV.A.2.(a) and (b), EPA believes this level of reductions will not be sufficient to attain the ozone NAAQS throughout the OTR. Confirming this conclusion, ROM studies of four episodes applying these measures in 2005 for all days being modeled in the four UAM domains in the OTR yield predictions of ozone levels above the 120 ppb NAAQS in five OTR subregions. These subregions include the UAM domains for Baltimore/Washington, Philadelphia, New York City and New England, and west/central Pennsylvania. Further, the model predicts ozone levels would exceed 160 ppb in at least one subregion for each of the episodes. •Region-wide 0.15 NO X Standard Beyond the measures explicitly mandated in the Act, the OTC also asked EPA to analyze the impact of an additional region-wide limit on NO X emissions of 0.15 lbs/MMBtu (the ``0.15 NO X standard'') for boilers, gas turbines, and internal combustion engines with a capacity of at least 250 MMBtu/hr. EPA evaluated the 0.15 NO X standard to represent the maximum emissions reduction from large stationary sources from measures that are not clearly unreasonable or impracticable. EPA developed emissions estimates associated with this additional control and modeled the impact on regional NO X emissions. EPA's modeling conclusion is that a 0.15 NO X standard would achieve a 15% reduction in inventory-wide NO X emissions from a 2005 projected baseline, after application of other controls mandated in the Act. 40 Together with the mandatory measures, this additional measure would therefore achieve a total NO X emissions reduction in the OTR of 32% from 1990 baseline levels. Thus, even a strategy including the additional 0.15 NO X standard region-wide in addition to all mandated Clean Air Act measures would achieve only 32% reductions in NO X and 37% reductions in VOC from 1990 baseline levels. 40 EPA notes that these percentage reductions are from a 2005 projected baseline. EPA's conclusion that a 50%&hyph;75% reduction in emissions is from a 1990 inventory baseline. It is important to bear in mind throughout this analysis that the 1990 baseline inventory is substantially larger than the projected 2005 baseline, which presumes application of mandatory Clean Air Act controls. Therefore, percentage reductions that particular measures achieve from the 2005 are larger than the percentage reductions those same measures would achieve if calculated from the 1990 baseline. After application of the mandated Clean Air Act measures together with the O.15 NO X standard, highway vehicle emissions still represent a substantial component of the emissions inventory. Table 3, below, reflects these calculations.
