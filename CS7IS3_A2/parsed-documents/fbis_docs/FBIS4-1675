From the streets to garment shops, in the post offices and on goods trains, blue jeans dot the landscape all year round in the Xiamen-Quanzhou-Hangzhou delta. The industry took off after blue jeans gained instant popularity when they were introduced to the area from Hong Kong and Taiwan in the 1980s. The past decade witnessed garment factories "spring up like bamboo shoots after spring rain". No-one can tell the exact number of these factories and the amount of their production except that truck-load upon truck-load of the clothes are being transported to other parts of China daily. Many big producers have set up special counters in department stores in large cities. Some have even made inroads in other countries' markets. In the midst of tough competition, manufacturers are upgrading equipment and turning out new designs at an increasingly faster rate. As a local factory director puts it: "Only when you lead the trend can you survive."
