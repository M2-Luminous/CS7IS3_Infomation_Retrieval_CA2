Bernard Sansaricq, who proclaimed himself president of the Haitian Senate on 4 February, led the operation to prevent Senate leaders who oppose the military government from taking their seats. According to Radio Metropole, military men occupied the Senate and shots were heard in the area surrounding the legislative building in Port-au-Prince. Armed civilians surrounded the building and were arresting people who opposed pro-coupist parliamentarians. No information on the number of people detained or their whereabouts is available. Political observers think the coupists found a way to "close off" the Senate, an objective which has been announced many times by those who oppose President Jean Bertrand Aristide's return. Senate President Farmin Jean Louis, who was elected in the negotiations supervised by the international community in August 1993, was in Washington on a State Department invitation for a new round of talks when he was deposed. Jean Louis and the other senators who rejected the views of Sansaricq and his followers, left the parliament because of death threats against them. This Monday, Jean Louis and Senator Julio Larosilliere, who was in Washington also, arrived at the Senate for the first time since their return and announced their determination to reoccupy their seats. Diplomats in Port-au-Prince have said that the international community does not know who the senators led by Sansaricq are, considering that Jean Louis' mandate is still effective. Several Haitian women's organizations took advantage of the commemoration of International Women's Day on Tuesday to express their dissatisfaction with UNICEF, an organization that, they say, has remained silent on the abuses perpetrated against them by the coupist military.
