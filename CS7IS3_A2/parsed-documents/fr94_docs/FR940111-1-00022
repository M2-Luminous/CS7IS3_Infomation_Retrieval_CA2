FR940111-1-00022 FR940111-1-00006 There are approximately 67 GE CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50 series turbofan engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA has been advised by the manufacturer that there are no engines on U.S. registered aircraft that would be affected by this AD. However, should an affected engine be imported on an aircraft and placed on the U.S. registry in the future, it would take approximately 48 work hours to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $9,360 per engine. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD is estimated to be $12,000 per engine. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12886; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: General Electric Company: Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;04. Applicability: General Electric Company (GE) CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50 series turbofan engines installed on, but not limited to, Airbus A300 series, Boeing 747 series, and McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 series aircraft. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent an uncontained stage one fan blade failure, which can result in inflight engine shutdown, and damage to the aircraft, accomplish the following: (a) For engines that have not been modified in accordance with any revision level of GE CF6&hyph;50 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72&hyph;573, prior to the effective date of this AD, install a fan stator case stiffening ring assembly and stage one fan shroud, in accordance with GE CF6&hyph;50 SB No. 72&hyph;573, Revision 5, dated September 15, 1981, by August 31, 1995. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Engine Certification Office. The request should be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Engine Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this airworthiness directive, if any, may be obtained from the Engine Certification Office. (c) Special flight permits may be issued, in accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21.199, to operate the aircraft to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Burlington, Massachusetts, on December 21, 1993. Jay J. Pardee, Acting Manager, Engine and Propeller Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
