FBIS4-60120 "drnes099dd_94014" FBIS-NES-94-099 Daily Report 22 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Authority Member Notes `Obstacles' for Security Authority Member Notes `Obstacles' for Security JN2205170894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Arabic 1430 GMT 22 May 94 JN2205170894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Arabic BFN [Interview with Furayh Abu-Middayn, member of the Palestinian National Authority, by As'ad 'Attar in Gaza; date not given -- recorded] [Text] [Abu-Middayn] There is an agreement in place. We are not negotiating new terms. We are implementing the Cairo agreement. However, the Palestinian police are coming up against obstacles not of their own making, but that originate in the donor nations that made decisions and signed pacts with the Palestinians calling for the police force to be outfitted with all the necessary materiel -- cars, communications equipment, and transport. We have yet to take delivery of all the promised cars. Some of the cars that have to be sent to certain locations have no radios. We cannot send a soldier on an assignment without communications. We cannot send a civilian instead of a military vehicle. The donor nations have yet to honor the commitments they have given to the Palestinians. It is the major stumbling block to the Palestinian movement and deployment in the Gaza strip. We are not negotiating new terms. We will implement the agreement in place. ['Attar] But the police have already started their duties. [Abu-Middayn] Today, joint patrols were in action. The Palestinians maintain a presence in all designated road junctions, where the settlers are allowed to travel under Israeli military escort. The Palestinians are present in all the localities indicated on the maps that were signed in Cairo. ['Attar] Have security checkpoints been set up close to the Erez roadblock? [Abu-Middayn] There is a Palestinian security checkpoint there. There is one in the Military Police area and on the Gaza coast near Netzarim. The checkpoints shown on the map are now all in place. ['Attar] And what about disarming civilians who still possess firearms? [Abu-Middayn] It would be more to the point to talk about controlling the use of weapons rather than disarming civilians. Civilians need to apply for a license before they can carry firearms. The acquisition of weapons should be barred if no reasonable, plausible grounds can be advanced by applicants, especially since a considerable number of weapons have found their way into the hands of criminals, who used them in hold-ups and robberies. We are addressing this issue, which we do not take lightly. It is an issue that must be controlled. We will institute a ban on firing in the air as is customary on happy and festive occasions. The security authorities will take care of that. This issue figures high on the list of our priorities. This is because weapons have been alarmingly readily available in the past year. ['Attar] The Israeli-Palestinian committees convened today. Have new security arrangements been worked out? [Abu-Middayn] Every day brings new developments. But I have not left my office today. God willing, I will have the details this afternoon. ['Attar] Thank you, Attorney Furayh Abu-Middayn. [Abu-Middayn] Thank you.
