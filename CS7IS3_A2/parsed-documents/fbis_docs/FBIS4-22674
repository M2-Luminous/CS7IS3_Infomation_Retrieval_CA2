The authors of the document call for unification in order to save the self-respect of Russia and Russians, in order to prove that the ideas of patriotism and democracy are inseparable, in order through common efforts to prevent the final collapse of the state, the degradation of the economy, and the return to authoritarianism. "We consider it a primary task to form a policy and strategy of national reconciliation...we are convinced that the key to national reconciliation could be the idea of citizenship, the idea of the good of our common and unified state. The time has come to swallow our pride and our claims to the only and always correct truth." The majority of the initiators of the creation of the new social movement are members of parliament of the preceding and present convocations and are, as they say, politicians of the "third wave." For them, who already have post-perestroyka political experience, the primacy of the law over personal and group ambitions is the basic moral principle for their activity. The authors of the statement have appealed to their allies and sympathizers in the capital and in the regions, where they are now forming local People's Alliance structures: "We are asking everyone who cares about the fate of Russia to support our initiative." The statement was signed by the following: S. Glazyev, A. Golovin, V. Yermakov, A. Krasnov, V. Menshov, V. Mironenko, I. Muravyev, D. Olyshanskiy, S. Polozkov, O. Rumyantsev, V. Sokolov, A. Fedorov, A. Tsipko, A. Chilingarov, and others. One of the document's authors is the chairman of the Committee on Economic Policy of the State Duma, S.Yu. Glazyev. He is 33 years old, he was born in Zaporozhye, he graduated from Moscow State University in economics and then worked at the Central Economics and Mathematical Institute of the Academy of Science, he is a doctor of economic sciences, beginning in 1991 he worked in the government structures of Russia, and in 1992-1993 he was the minister of foreign economic relations. Today S.Yu. Glazyev responds to questions from DELOVOY MIR correspondent Timur Grigoryanets. [Grigoryanets] Sergey Yuryevich, among the recent political documents public attention has been drawn to the message from the president to the Federal Assembly. I would like to know your opinion of this document first of all. [Glazyev] This message contains a description of the main points of the state's economic and social policy for this year. The Duma has attentively discussed the message and responded positively to its main ideas. This pertains above all to the idea of conducting a more balanced and reasonable economic policy and the point that the reforms must not be conducted to the detriment of the people or be accompanied by their impoverishment. It is important that we first formulate a provision on the social cost of the reforms and devote a great deal of attention to questions of structural policy and the need to retain our scientific-industrial potential. That is, the Duma was pleasantly surprised by how balanced, reasonable, and constructive the message was. [Grigoryanets] Does this assessment apply also to the draft budget submitted by the government recently for consideration in the State Duma? [Glazyev] Unfortunately, no. In general one gets the impression that the people who prepared the budget did not read the president's message. The budget is practically in no way linked to the basic directions of the economic policy formulated in the presidential document. After discussion in a work group of the Committee on Economic Policy we came to the conclusion that, in the first place, the macroeconomic prognosis on which the construction of the budget is based is unreliable and, in the second place, the goal of the economic policy contained in the draft budget does not correspond to the goals formulated in the president's message, with the exception, perhaps, of the goal of reducing inflation to 7-8 percent by the end of the year. But even today it is obvious that events in the economy will not develop the way predicted in the budget, and if we execute it we risk hyperinflation by the end of the year. This will be a result of the sharp decline of production which, according to our estimates, could reach 25-30 percent, and the figures for the first quarter confirm this. This means that the revenue part of the budget will not be fulfilled and there will be more manipulations with sequestering of budget expenditures, which will introduce even more chaos into the economy. As a result, we will inevitably end up in a situation with a very large budget deficit and, as a result, extremely high inflation growing into hyperinflation. Nor does the budget fully correspond to the program of the government itself. That is, the president's message is like a thing unto itself, the government program is a thing unto itself, and the budget message is some kind of third reality which is poorly linked to the first two. And that is not even to mention the fact that in reality everything proceeds according to some fourth scenario. If we turn to the structural part of the budget and analyze the priorities found in it, we discover that of the several key branches to be supported in the government program, namely food, the fuel and energy complex, conversion, transportation, and the social sphere, in reality it is proposed that real resources be provided only for the agro-industrial and fuel-energy complexes. Actually science-intensive industry, which is the basis and the main reserve for reconstruction and economic growth throughout the world, and in our country as well, could simply cease to exist this year. We have already started to lose certain promising technologies; as we were able to determine from the results of parliamentary hearings two weeks ago, the list of them amounts to several dozen. These are irreversible losses, and yet many of these technologies could compose a basis for our economic advancement. We must not console ourselves with illusions--no boom in the raw materials sector of the economy can bring the entire country out of the crisis. We need modernization, renewal of fixed capital, we must realize the great potential that is concentrated in science-intensive industry. Unfortunately, the priorities designated by the president in his message and the priorities actually reflected in the structure of the budget do not correspond to one another. To continue to follow this same track is not simply imprudent, it would be insane. [Grigoryanets] And what is your committee's verdict? [Glazyev] The work group of the Committee on Economic Policy is inclined to suggest that the government join forces in order to develop a new budget that corresponds to the president's message and reasonable economic policy aimed at solving the real problems of overcoming the economic crisis. [Grigoryanets] You and the experts have done a large amount of work during the course of studying the government draft of the budget. And what are your proposals in this connection? [Glazyev] I think that today we have no other way out than to begin to develop a realistic economic program for this year and future years. I would like to emphasize that it must be based on a reliable economic prognosis. The estimate of the threat to our economy, which has already entered into a process of catastrophic destruction, must be realistic as well. We also need a prognosis of structural changes and any valuation of the reserves we have at our disposal. On this basis it would be possible to clearly formulate realistic goals and means of achieving them, to prepare the corresponding system of measures, and to build the budget on this. I think that this work could be done in a month. If we concentrate forces and work together--both the Federal Assembly and the government. This is our common cause, we together are responsible for the quality of the policy that is conducted and for the results that are achieved. [Grigoryanets] What will it take to do this well-arranged work quickly? After all, it is already April.... [Glazyev] Perhaps we do not have the political will to recognize that the economic policy being conducted today is not adequate to the real interests of the country in overcoming the crisis and resuming the growth of national well-being. For our part, we have already begun this work; the first meetings of the group of experts took place last week. [Grigoryanets] In what ways are you close and attracted to the people with whom you presented the initiative to create a new social movement? [Glazyev] I have known them for a long time as responsible, honest, and purposeful politicians for whom the good of the country and national interests are the real meaning of political work. I think that the initiators of this movement could create the concentration of creative efforts, the impulse in the organs of power and among influential sociopolitical movements, especially in the regions, which could finally help society move in the direction of emerging from the crisis. The group of people who initiated the creation of People's Alliance includes specialists in the area of social policy, in the area of regional policy, local self-government, and many other key areas. My role is to coordinate and organize the work on the economic program questions, and we have already begun to do this. [Grigoryanets] That is, you have decided to create your own economic program? [Glazyev] In our country we have now entered a situation where it is time to ask ourselves the question: "If not we, then who?" For three months we have been waiting for the program for the government, we have been waiting for certain realistic measures from the structures of executive power, we have given suggestions, we have sent proposals, but no reasonable actions are taking place, and we are rolling toward an abyss like lunatics. In spite of the fact that we do not yet have sufficient possibilities of forming a realistic policy, we think that we must exert all efforts to introduce reasonable and constructive principles into all spheres of life. And I think we have sufficient intellectual resources and skilled personnel for such an initiative to work. [Grigoryanets] Do you think that we still have a chance of bringing our economy and our country out of the process of disintegration in a civilized way? [Glazyev] I think we have that chance right now. For perhaps the only positive result of recent months was that the majority of our politicians and organizations represented in parliament and the structures of executive power have recognized that we are indeed entering a process of uncontrollable catastrophic destruction of our economy and our society. And a reflection of this understanding was the adoption of the Duma of the "memorandum on accord" and then the president's initiative on the preparation of the Agreement on the Achievement of Civil Peace in Russia. Today we see a sincere desire on the part of practically all factions in the State Duma and many workers of systems of executive power to develop a policy that would be acceptable to the people and would be realized to the good of the country from the standpoint of overcoming the crisis, restoring industrial growth, and restoring Russia's position as a great scientific and industrial power. The process of consultations, roundtables, exchange of opinions, and search for agreement on the main directions of our socioeconomic policy that has begun gives us a real chance of developing a program that would receive broad support and around which all constructive forces of society could rally. Today only the government has in no way indicated its attitude toward initiatives on agreement from the Federal Assembly and the president, but I hope that our criticism of the budget message and our proposals for improving it will evoke such an action. Because we cannot but see that behind the wasteful consumption and the flourishing of a limited number of firms and individual branches, behind all this we cannot but see the colossal impoverishment of the entire country.
