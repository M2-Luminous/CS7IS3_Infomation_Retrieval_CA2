IT IS BASED ON FOREIGN MEDIA CONTENT AND BEHAVIOR AND IS M ISSUED WITHOUT COORDINATION WITH OTHER U.S. GOVERNMENT COMPONENTS) FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-068 IRAQ: 'Udayy Saddam Husayn's Youth Television IRAQ: 'Udayy Saddam Husayn's Youth Television Summary--Despite closure for nearly one month last December- January, the Iraqi Youth Television (IYTV) station has become another arm of media influence for Saddam Husayn's son, 'Udayy Saddam Husayn. Indeed, IYTV's resumption of broadcasting following strong support from leading Baghdad dailies appears to have solidified the station's status as an alternative to state-run Iraqi Television (ITV). The hardcopy version of this Foreign Media Note contains a picture and name. Like his radio station and the daily BABIL, flagship of his media empire, IYTV has become a prominent part of 'Udayy's expanding commercial, political, and cultural empire and a vehicle for promoting his own interests. 'Udayy's adventure with electronic media began on 28 April 1993, President Saddam Husayn's 56th birthday, when he launched the radio station known as "Voice of Youth from Dar al-Salam." London's AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT noted on 12 May that the station quickly became known for "stinging criticism" aimed at ministers and senior officials and their performances. Meanwhile, 'Udayy began preparations, according to Paris' AL- WATAN AL-'ARABI on 30 July, for starting a television station also targeted at Iraqi youth, which together with the radio station, were called by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI as signs of 'Udayy's "rising star" in Iraq. The first report of broadcasting by IYTV was monitored on 31 July on Iraqi radio. Within a few months after IYTV began broadcasting, AL-THAWRAH, a powerful Baghdad daily, praised 'Udayy in its 12 September issue for "establishing a sound and healthy democratic atmosphere, an atmosphere ... through which the citizen smells the fresh air, vents his anguish, submits his complaints, and exposes the corruption of those who exploit their position to harass, exhaust the people, lie to and unjustly treat them." It continued: "'Udayy in his relations with citizens adopts the style of the son who emulates his father, a style based on facts and love for Iraqis." It characterized IYTV, in the same rave review, as representing "a course of action that restores hope to those who lost it, and fulfills the dreams of those who stopped dreaming a long time ago .... a course that will be a haven for those unjustly treated by officials, who only care for themselves." Despite the apparent success of this high profile media empire, both of 'Udayy's radio and television stations were abruptly shutdown in mid-December. Iraqi officials and media sources gave no reason for this sudden move, which amounted to a public thrashing for 'Udayy, but it may have been caused by IYTV's penchant for sharp criticism directed against high officials in Saddam's regime. For example, on 4 August, the day a bomb exploded in Baghdad, IYTV interviewed some Interior Ministry officials and aired what Interior Minister Watban Ibrahim called, in an article published in BABIL on 10 August, an attempt "to belittle the efficiency of our Ministry's officials." Watban Ibrahim, a maternal half-brother of Saddam Husayn, criticized IYTV, in the same article, for breaking "all security restraints applied to cases concerning the security of the State and society." He said that IYTV "pretends" that it is interested in truth, but in reality, it is engaged in an "irresponsible" act "disguised as democracy." He called IYTV's conduct "arbitrary, moody, and undisciplined" and charged that IYTV is "destructive" and provides a "weapon in the hands of our enemies."--charges obviously directed against 'Udayy. However, a few weeks after the shutdown of IYTV, two major dailies came to 'Udayy's help and strongly appealed for the resumption of IYTV broadcasts. An article in AL-THAWRAH on 8 January called the interruption "an irreplaceable loss" and expressed hopes that transmission would resume, because the programming had been "well received by the various sectors of the people." AL-THAWRAH showed even greater solidarity with IYTV by ceasing to publish ITV program schedules around the same time. AL- JUMHURIYAH, another Baghdad daily, also wrote on 8 January: "This honest voice should resume transmission as soon as possible." Two days later, on 10 January, the Radio Baghdad announced the resumption of IYTV broadcasting. As BABIL now resumed publishing IYTV's daily schedule, the station became the only television channel with program schedules published in the Iraqi press. AL-THAWRAH continued to defend IYTV and attack its enemies, saying on 19 January: "One cannot ask the Youth Television to please everyone .... it should not appease the public by appealing to its whims, shallow feelings, and low instincts because it will then turn into an instrument for destruction and corruption .... Youth Television is loved by the viewers, who have given it the right to represent them. It is now unacceptable to violate such a right." PROGRAMMING The following analysis is done based on published program schedules for the two stations rather than actual programs, which are not available to FBIS at this time. Comparison of IYTV and ITV program schedules reveals that IYTV is more interactive with its viewers, as it has a viewers' requests segment. IYTV may also appeal to a younger audience through programs like fashion shows and sports segments. Furthermore, it broadcasts commercial advertisements, which identifies IYTV as a private rather than a government station. In contrast, ITV clearly presents the government's official line and has programs like provincial reports, presentations by government officials, and government educational programs. ITV broadcasts Friday prayer sermons and has more than an hour of religious programming every day (2 hours on Fridays), while IYTV has less than 10 minutes of religious programming each day. IYTV begins broadcasting each day at 1445 local time. Programs generally begin with the national anthem and a Koranic reading, although at times commercial advertisements will open programming. Among the programs, it has a political report segment, which may be intended for presentation of independent news and analysis reports. It gives weather reports, something that ITV has never done, possibly because it is considered not important by ITV or because of security reasons. The last feature of the day is always the national anthem, which is preceded by a serial or a movie that begins any time between 2300 to 0200. Following is a typical example of IYTV programs: IYTV: Monday, 16 April 1994 14:45--Advertisements 15:00--National anthem & Koranic reading 15:10--Pictures from the battle 15:15--Iraq: The Cradle of Civilization 15: 25--Cartoons 15:45--Variety cartoons 16:00--Sports section 17:00--News 17:10--Fashion show 17:25--New songs 17:45--Variety news report 18:00--News 18:10--Viewers' requests 18:55--Advertisements 19:00--Hourly news & review of programs 19:10--Foreign serial "Manuela" 19:45--Variety songs 19:55--Advertisements 20:00--News 20:05--Charity program Weather Report 20:15--Aspiring to the summit 20:55--Advertisements 21:00--Political reports 21:10--Sports section 21:30--Unforgettable songs 21:55--Advertisements 22:00--News & Leader's speech 22:10--Arabic serial "The Man in Our Home" 23:00--News 23:15--Arabic movie "All of Them in Hell" National anthem A review of ITV program schedules when they were published by AL- THAWRAH, shows that they consist of religious and Koranic lessons, children's programs, TV magazine reports, provincial reports, both Western and native serials, programs on farming, news in both Arabic and English, musical, educational programs, presentations by government officials, and foreign and Arabic movies. Programming begins every day, 1400 to 1500, local time and continue after midnight. ITV also carries Friday prayer sermons on Fridays. Friday program begins at 1000 local time. Following are two typical examples of ITV program days.
