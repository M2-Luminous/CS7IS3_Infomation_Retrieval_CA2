FR941213-0-00006 FR941213-0-00003 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Federal Highway Administration 23 CFR Part 1205 [NHTSA Docket No. 93&hyph;20; Notice 2] RIN 2127&hyph;AE89 Highway Safety Programs; Determination of Effectiveness AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Department of Transportation (DOT). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: Section 2002(a) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) required that the Secretary of Transportation either designate six key areas as priority highway safety programs or submit a report to Congress describing the reasons for not establishing these programs as priorities. Four of the six program areas had already been designated as priority programs by the Secretary. This final rule adds Speed Control, but not School Bus Safety, to the list of priority programs. EFFECTIVE DATE: The amendments made by this final rule are effective January 12, 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The State and Community Highway Safety Grant Program (section 402 program) was established under the Highway Safety Act of 1966, 23 U.S.C. 402. The Act required the establishment of Uniform Standards for State Highway Safety Programs to assist the States and local communities in organizing their highway safety programs. Eighteen such standards were established and have been administered at the Federal level by FHWA and NHTSA. NHTSA is responsible for developing and implementing highway safety programs relating to the vehicle and driver; FHWA has similar responsibilities in program areas involving the roadway. The FHWA is also responsible for implementing programs relating to commercial motor vehicle safety. These programs include measures related to speed control. Until 1976, the 402 program was principally directed towards achieving State and local compliance with the 18 Highway Safety Program Standards, which were considered mandatory requirements with financial sanctions for non-compliance. Under the Highway Safety Act of 1976, Congress provided for a more flexible implementation of the program so the Secretary would not have to require State compliance with every uniform standard or with each element of every uniform standard. As a result, the standards became more like guidelines for use by the States, and management of the program shifted from enforcing standards to one of problem identification and countermeasure development and evaluation, using the standards as a framework for the State programs. In 1981, Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Pub. L. 97&hyph;35, revising the section 402 program. The Act directed the agencies to conduct rulemaking to determine those State and local highway safety programs most effective in reducing accidents, injuries, and fatalities. On April 1, 1982, NHTSA and FHWA issued a joint final rule (47 FR 15116) identifying six National Priority program areas which the agencies then considered to be the most effective highway safety programs. The six program areas included one FHWA program area, Safety Construction and Operational Improvements, and the following NHTSA Program Areas: Occupant Protection, Alcohol Countermeasures, Police Traffic Services, Emergency Medical Services, and Traffic Records. The April 1982 final rule provided that these National Priority program areas would be eligible for Federal funding using an expedited procedure under the 402 program. 23 CFR 1205.4. It also established a mechanism by which other, nonpriority programs identified by a State may be eligible for Federal funding. 23 CFR 1205.5(a) and (b). Periodic Review and Determination of Priority Programs On April 2, 1987, the enactment of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (Public Law 100&hyph;17) revised 23 U.S.C. 402. The changes provided for a periodic review of the effectiveness of the various programs eligible for funding under section 402 in reducing crashes, injuries and fatalities. The periodic review procedure was enacted to ensure the continued relevance of the section 402 program to changing circumstances and traffic safety needs and to ensure that Federal funds continue to be used for the most effective programs. The legislation also provided that the standards promulgated under section 402 and codified in 23 CFR Part 1204 be changed to guidelines. The purpose of this amendment was to conform the language of section 402 and Part 1204 to the current implementation of the programs. Pursuant to these amendments, NHTSA and FHWA conducted a rulemaking action to review those programs most effective in reducing crashes, injuries and fatalities. In a final rule issued on April 6, 1988 (53 FR 1255), the agencies determined that the National Priority program areas should continue to include the one FHWA program area, Roadway Safety (formerly, Safety Construction and Operational Improvements), and the five NHTSA program areas that had been identified in 1982. In addition, the agencies determined that a sixth NHTSA area, Motorcycle Safety, should be added. On May 3, 1991, NHTSA and FHWA published a joint NPRM (56 FR 20387) proposing to add Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety as one of the National Priority program areas. The public comments supported that proposal and the area of Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety was added to the list of National Priority program areas eligible for the expedited funding process on October 4, 1991 (56 FR 50250). As a result of these rulemaking actions, the National Priority program areas included the following: 1. Alcohol and Other Drug Countermeasures 2. Police Traffic Services 3. Occupant Protection 4. Traffic Records 5. Emergency Medical Services 6. Motorcycle Safety 7. Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety 8. Roadway Safety ISTEA Requirements On December 18, 1991, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) was signed into law. Section 2002(a) of ISTEA required that the Secretary of Transportation either designate six key areas as priority highway safety programs or submit a report to Congress describing the reasons for not establishing these programs as priorities. The six program areas listed in ISTEA included programs:
