"Wang Juntao was allowed to go abroad to receive medical treatment," a foreign ministry spokesman said by phone. "We are against anyone making use of Wang Juntao in any form to carry out political activities against the Chinese government." Wang, 35, had been sentenced to 13 years in jail for his role in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, but was released last month on medical grounds and put aboard a plane for the United States. He made a private trip to France to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the June 4 crackdown in Tiananmen Square, and met Mitterrand -- the wife of French President Francois Mitterrand -- who chairs a human rights group known as France-Liberte. Wang met Kinkel in Bonn on Tuesday before heading back to the United States.
