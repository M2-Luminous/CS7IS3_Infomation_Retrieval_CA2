The rules include restrictions on the movement of boats and other cargo ships inside the territorial waters and at the Gulf country's ports, inspection of vessels and limiting the periods of stay at port, Interior Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Badi, told Friday's edition of UAE weekly AL-SHURUQ. "These instructions have been conveyed to the Foreign Ministry which will circulate them through diplomatic channels to embassies of other countries," he said. "The new rules will be strictly observed." Al-Badi, former chief of the UAE armed forces, said inadequate surveillance on shipping and ports in the UAE was posing a security threat as most of the drug smuggling and illegal immigration take place by sea. He gave no figures on such activities but police records show more than 25,000 people from Iran, Pakistan, India and other Asian countries have been arrested in the past two decades as they tried to enter the UAE illegally. Most of them came for jobs in the oil-rich country, tempted by its lax penalties, proximity to their homelands and lack of security along the coastline. This has prompted the UAE to install more radars and step up coast guard patrols but the problem has persisted. The problem has also spurred calls for harsher punishment against illegal entrants and shipowners who transport them. The police records showed that the bulk of those immigrants arrived by small boats, concealed under cargo. "These people are only aggravating the country's security, economic and social problems," a police official told AFP. "Many of them can not find jobs and this prompts them to indulge in crime. All those people are exacerbating the unemployment problem since thousands succeed in sneaking in." UAE authorities refuse to admit unemployment but according to government sources, more than 300,000 people are either jobless or work illegally. The figure accounts for more than 40 percent of the 700,000-strong workforce. Inadequate surveillance of the 700-kilometre (437-mile) shore has also given rise to drug smuggling, reportedly originating mostly from Iran and Pakistan. As a result, the UAE has become the most vulnerable Gulf country to international narcotic gangs, who are also tempted by its lax laws. In 1992, around four tonnes of heroin, cocaine, hashish and other kinds of drugs were seized in the UAE, accounting for half the quantity busted in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The biggest drug haul in the region involved three tonnes of hashish seized with 13 Pakistani smugglers in the UAE port of Khawr Fakkan in 1991. According to the new shipping rules, cargo vessels will not be allowed to enter UAE territorial waters unless they produce registration certificates, shipping permits, manifestos and names of crew and passengers, al-Badi said. Powerboats are not allowed to stay at port more than 72 hours while dhows, the traditional Arabian wooden boats, can not stay more than 21 days. They also must not move to another port unless they have a shipment there. "Crewmen will not be allowed in if they do not have naval cards issued by their communication ministry," al-Badi said. "We have also formed a committee which is now considering setting up special centres at ports to receive users of our ports to upgrade efficiency and boost security measures."
