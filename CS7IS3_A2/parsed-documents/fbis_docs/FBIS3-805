FBIS3-805 "drafr049_c_94065" FBIS-AFR-94-049 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Mar 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 12-13 Mar MB1303131294 MB1303131294 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] WEEKEND STAR Right-Wing Intervention in Bophuthatswana -- "Not one of the images coming out of Bophuthatswana in this week of mayhem has been pretty," begins the Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English in its 12-13 March edition in a page-10 editorial. "One element of the drama which stands out as particularly odious, alongside the looting and anarchy, is the involvement of the armed right wing....which took it upon itself to descend, bristling with weaponry, on Mmabatho and Mafikeng when the Bophuthatswana crisis was at its height." "Men with rights and duties no greater than ordinary civilians acted as an arrogant and dangerous vigilante gang -- a pack of Boere Bronsons," who have "delusions of military grandeur quite out of kilter with the realities of South Africa's power balances. There is no moral basis for their perception of themselves as gun-toting guardians of a higher cause." SUNDAY TIMES Bophuthatswana Crisis, Election -- "South Africa has emerged from a nerve-stretching week somewhat shaken, but in better shape to conduct elections," claims the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 13 March in a page-28 editorial. "The way has been cleared, apart from some mopping up, for the elections to be extended into Mr Mangope's erstwhile fiefdom." The South African Defense Force restored Mangope to power once before and will not do it again. The SUNDAY TIMES is thankful that "fortunately, the registration of political parties has closed, and that ends the negotiation phase of the transition. There is no longer any need to woo intransigent, tinpot dictators." "As for the much-touted right-wing threat, it has been halved by the sorry performance of the white irregular forces, and halved again by the resignation of Gen Viljoen from the Volksfront [National Front]." SUNDAY NATION `Lesson' From Bophuthatswana -- Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 13 March in a page-6 editorial states that "first, shall we pass our condolences to ALL families and the business community who lost their beloved ones and property, during the Bophuthatswana debacle. But we would be failing in our duties if we did not indicate who is to blame for this saga. It is the Bophuthatswana Christian Democratic Party (CDP) leader Lucas Mangope, Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweeging's [Resistance Movement] (AWB) Eugene Terreblanche, Afrikaner Volksfront's [National Front] (AVF) General Constand Viljoen and Inkatha Freedom Party's (IFP) Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi." RAPPORT Death of AWB Members in Bophuthatswana -- Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 13 March in a page-20 editorial condemns the Afrikaner Resistance Movement's senseless action in Mmabatho, Bophuthatswana, in which three of its members were killed recently. The editorial says the AWB action did not only do that organization harm, but also those whose case it pretends to be serving. "The corpses in the street were not yet cold when President Lucas Mangope announced that he had all along been planning to participate in the elections. The AWB men had been sent to help in upholding his government." "Have the three in Mmabatho died in vain? Perhaps not, provided their death has brought far right factions and their supporters to their senses." However, "the accusing finger for the Bophuthatswana debacle also points at the ANC [African National Congress], its leaders, and its unchecked supporters." In Cape Town, General Bantu Holomisa enthusiastically announced that Bophuthatswana has been given a stiff dose of "vitamin ANC," with kwaZulu's turn next. "Concerned South Africans now have reason to believe that dishing out `vitamins' is part and parcel of the ANC's election strategy for the rest of the country." "In such a climate, if calmness is not restored soon, another din -- a catastrophe perhaps -- is waiting in every street at any place." If the AWB is guilty of "hotheaded stupidity," the ANC's "plundering hordes" are just as guilty. "May all political parties read the writing of the warning finger of Mmabatho and take heed."
