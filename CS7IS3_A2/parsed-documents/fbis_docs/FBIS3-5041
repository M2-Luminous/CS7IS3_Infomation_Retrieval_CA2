This shows that Japan is finding itself attacked on all sides, put in the dock, for its nuclear activities. NODONG SINMUN says this in a commentary today. The analyst points out: In an effort to get out of the tight corner, the Japanese authorities are using the anti-nuke sentiments of the Japanese people as a veil for Japan's nuclear armament. The first nuclear victims in the world during the second world war, the Japanese people do not want the repetition of that holocaust and are opposed to Japan's nuclear armament. Turning a deaf ear to their voice, the Japanese Government is claiming that the possession of nuclear weapons is an indispensable requisite to the conversion of the country into a military power and a political power and hastening nuclear armament to gratify its wild dominationist desire. Japan has stockpiled a huge amount of plutonium and technologically prepared to manufacture nuclear weapons. The world thinks that it is a matter of time for Japan to manufacture nuclear weapons. Japan's launching the nuclear-capable space rocket H-2 shows that if Japan possesses nuclear weapons, all the regions of the world shall come within Japan's nuclear range. The Japanese Government authorities are peddling "particular sentiments of the people of the A-bomb victim nation" in a bid to lull the apprehensions of the world for Japan's nuclear armament. This is an insult to the A-bomb victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and other Japanese people and a mockery of the world people. Unless it shows its will not to seek nuclear armament in deeds, Japan will invite a bitter condemnation and accuses worldwide, isolating itself.
