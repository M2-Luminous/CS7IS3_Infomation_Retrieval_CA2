Ryurikov by unidentified correspondent; place and date not given -- from the "Novosti" newscast] [Text] Judging by U.S. President Clinton's statement, the United States is insisting on a wider use of diplomatic force to make good use of the precedent in Sarajevo. U.S. diplomats are already pressing for peace initiatives to be extended to other regions of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Today, the aide to the Russian president on external issues told our correspondent in some detail about Russia's stance on this question. [Correspondent] Dmitriy Borisovich, how will Russia further develop its diplomatic initiative in this area? [Ryurikov] Well, Russia has not stopped its initiatives, and it will continue to develop them very actively. They will concern the creation of a stable and peaceful situation in Sarajevo -- that is, lifting the blockade of this region and possibly placing it under UN administration -- and then reaching agreement on roughly the same actions in other security zones on Bosnian territory. Of course these must be peaceful, diplomatic, political solutions, and the process of seeking a political settlement of the problems of Bosnia as a whole must be sharply stepped up. This must be based on the EC plan, possibly with certain changes, trying to achieve a settlement as soon as possible in order to stop all hostilities.
