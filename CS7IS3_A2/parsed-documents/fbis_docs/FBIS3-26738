A batch of townships, towns, and farms achieving rapid economic development, that are making hundreds of millions and even billions of yuan per year, has appeared. These advanced models have written magnificent praise of the reform and opening up policies of the party, and set new examples for the further development of rural China. China is an ancient country with a long history of civilization. The formation and development of villages, townships, towns, and farms in China went through a long process. According to relevant historical material, villages formed during the Paleolithic period at the beginning of primitive society. The original meaning was "several families facing the water naturally forming a village." In order to hunt animals and prevent invasion from outside, primitive groups settled around forest streams, and that formed the prototype of villages. After man turned from hunting to animal husbandry, farming, and a settled life, numerous villages appeared. Townships and towns are the result of village development. With the development of productive forces, a surplus was produced and slave society farms appeared. The location of some large slave owners became the political, economic, and cultural center of surrounding villages, i.e., the township. As the grass-roots administrative institution, the township can be traced back to the pre-Qin ancient book Zhouli [a Confucian classic]. But as real grass-roots administrative institutions, townships germinated during the Spring and Autumn Period, took shape during the Warring States Period, and reached their final form during the Qin Dynasty. The town is the result of the division of labor between villages and the development of a market economy, and appeared much later than the township. As a state administrative unit, towns first started during the reign of Northern Wei Emperor Xiao Wen Di. But what can really be called the prototype of the town did not appear until the Tang to Ming and Qing period. Agricultural, forestry, and animal farms germinated during the early years of the Republic of China, and large numbers of farms were set up after liberation. China currently has 804,153 administrative villages and 58,185 township and towns. Among these, 43,660 are townships, 2,421 are national minority townships, 11,882 are towns, and 222 are national minority towns. There are 2,149 state-owned farms, 4,212 forestry farms, and 8,200 state-owned and collectively owned animal farms. With reform and opening up, a batch of star villages, townships, towns, and farms appeared. According to 1992 statistics, the number of villages with total industrial and agricultural output value exceeding 100 million yuan reached 430. Among them, the output of 10 villages exceeded 500 million yuan, and that of 70 exceeded 200 million yuan. There were 4,255 townships and towns whose total industrial and agricultural output value exceeded 100 million yuan. Among them, 55 exceeded 1 billion yuan and 10 exceeded 2 billion yuan. There were 125 agricultural farms with total output exceeding 100 million yuan, among which 9 exceeded 500 million yuan. There was one forestry farm whose total output exceeded 100 million yuan. Although these star villages, townships, towns, and farms are still a minority among all the villages, townships, and towns, and their proportion greatly differs in different places--among villages they only occupy 0.00053, among township and towns they occupy 0.073, among agricultural farms they occupy 0.049, among forestry farms they occupy 0.024, and among animal farms they occupy 0.018-- however, they are like glistening pearls distributed all over China, shining on the extensive land, attracting and encouraging the hearts of 800 million farmers, and making 300 million city dwellers look at them in a new light. The reform and opening up of more than a decade is but a moment in the long river of time. What has enabled these star villages, townships, towns, and farms to take an early start, to cross over the stage of having enough to eat and wear and advance toward the well-off stage, and to climb into the international economic arena? What characteristics and secrets do they have? The book Shining Stars has selected over 500 villages, townships, and towns, and over 200 farms. The book has approximately 2.7 million characters (with over 1,500 photographs). All those selected are the best in current reform, opening up, and the construction of two civilizations. Their practice answers the questions people are concerned about. These star villages, townships, towns, and farms basically have the following characteristics: 1) They grasp opportunities with an emancipated mind, and create miracles in pioneering and advancing; 2) they rely on their own resources for survival, and work hard to seek development; 3) they begin from reality and come up with their own road for developing the local economy; 4) they respect knowledge and talent, and become rich by relying on science and technology; 5) they take the market as their orientation, adjust the structure of their industries and products in a timely manner, and take the road of industrializing the countryside. Another characteristic of these star villages, townships, towns, and farms is that they do not blindly seek output value and speed. This point is very important. To develop township enterprises one must forcefully push forward technological reform and scientific management and develop brand-name good-quality products and products with high added-value and high-technology content--products that can yield high foreign exchange earnings. One must pay attention to product quality and strictly ban fake and shoddy goods. On no account must one seek product value and speed blindly. On the contrary, one must actually raise economic efficiency. These they have all done well. They have also strengthened the building of the party, and given full play to the function of grass-roots party organizations as a fighting force and the exemplary vanguard function of party members. The key to the success of star villages, townships, towns, and farms is in having a good leading body, especially a good leader. It is because they have a large number of hardworking, self-sacrificing socialist grass-roots leaders that these formerly poverty-stricken villages, townships, towns, and farms are able to emerge in intensive market competition, under the heavy onslaught of the commodity economy, and first realize "well-off" standards and get rich, becoming brilliant stars in the land of China. Sparks of fire can spread all over a grassland. We wish for the old star villages, townships, towns, and farms to continue to progress, and we hope more new stars will appear!
