Akhmedov report: "Factor of Development--the Market: Word of the Organizers of a New Party"] [Text] Fuad Asadov, president of the Union of Leaseholders and Entrepreneurs, delivered a statement at a news conference. He announced that a congress of members of his union had been held at the end of May. It had decided on the creation of a new political organization--the Azerbaijan Republic Reform Party (ARRP). The action committee formed an organizing committee, which commissioned Fuad Asadov to hold a news conference and describe the business and tasks of the party that is being formed. Journalists of republic newspapers and agencies--BAKINSKIY RABOCHIY, VYSHKA, RESPUBLIKA, MILLYAT, ADALYAT, EKHO SUMGAITA, ASSA-IRADA, ANS-PRESS, and others--displayed great interest. The party is being formed on the basis of the Union of Leaseholders and Entrepreneurs. Several years ago its members were the first to embark on the transformation of Azerbaijan's industry and agriculture on a market basis--to create leased and small enterprises, cooperatives, stock companies, and private farms. Of course, things were difficult for them, and some of them had their fill of hard times. Had it not been for the decisive actions of the leaders of the union, who vigorously defended the rights of the leased collectives in the court of arbitration, and their protests in the press and on radio and television, it would hardly have been possible to preserve their market structure status. For example, Edison Akhundov, director of the Remdetal small enterprise, went to law six times with the leadership of the Automotive Trust of the Ministry of Agriculture, and justice was ultimately restored. And the leadership of the State Committee for Sport attempted with a squad of police officers to induce Maya Ismaylova, general director of the Ilman leased production association, to hand over her files. The workforce stood solidly behind her and the Supreme Court of Arbitration rejected the plaintiff's unlawful importunings. The Union of Leaseholders and Entrepreneurs in fact became the public defender of all who aspired to switch to market relations. Together with the News Media Workers Union Republic Committee it conducted a competition under the motto "For the economic revival of Azerbaijan." Many newspaper, journalist, economist, and scientist winners were awarded valuable gifts and cash prizes. The union is participating actively in law-making activity of the republic Supreme Council. Its leaders have now embarked a new difficult venture--the organization of a party. According to Fuad Asadov's statement, the main factor of Azerbaijan's development and its emergence from the crisis is the market economy. But the brakes have been applied to the switch of the national economy to the tracks of the latter, and it is proceeding only middling well, as they say. This situation can no longer be tolerated. The main reason for the running in place is the absence of a set of laws on the market economy. The entrepreneurs are bound hand and foot because of this, which is preventing them from investing their forces, knowledge, and talent in production in full. To achieve their goals, the entrepreneurs are forced today to bow to government, ministerial, and customs officials, yet what is necessary is that all be subordinate to and depend only on laws regulating economic and social life. The current chaos and turmoil and the absence of prescriptive documents are creating conditions for endless and prejudiced inspections by representatives of the prosecutor's office, the police, financial and tax authorities.... A principal task, whose accomplishment the new party will tackle first and foremost, is an acceleration of the adoption of laws regulating and organizing the economy in a new way, remembering here the classical expression: policy is the concentrated expression of the economy. Of course, the ARRP will fight also for people's social rights, and it has other goals also. To journalists' questions as to whether the party would aspire to seize power, it was stated that such was not its mission. Any citizen of Azerbaijan may, without distinction as to national origin or religious belief, become a member of the party. Group membership of enterprise and organization workers also is permitted. The ARRP urges Azerbaijan's development along the path of democracy, civilization, independence, and liberty. It rejects extremism and violence aimed at the overthrow of the current system and supports the efforts of the president of the republic for a political solution of the Karabakh conflict and his efforts to stabilize society. The ARRP Organizing Committee points to the danger of inaction and indifference and calls on the citizens for unity, active struggle against internal discord and the dirty games of various political forces, and unification for the sake of the prosperity of their native Azerbaijan.
