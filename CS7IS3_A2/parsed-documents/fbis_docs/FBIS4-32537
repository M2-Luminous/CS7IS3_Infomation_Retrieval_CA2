"We have tried using all peaceful means to reduce tension on the border with the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. However, the latest incident on the strategically important point 1703, Straza, where Yugoslav soldiers have taken position -- which indicates that they intend to stay on our territory for some time -- calls for the use of all available means to force the Yugoslav Army to withdraw to its own territory," the FYROM foreign minister says in his letter to Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Crvenkovski also says that the FYROM, "if these incidents continue, will demand that the United Nations take the most energetic measures to protect our territorial integrity."
