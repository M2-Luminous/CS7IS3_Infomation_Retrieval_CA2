FR941103-0-00049 FR941103-0-00007 B. Loop Flows Few comments on this issue were received from Muni/Coops, NUGs/IPPs, Regulatory/Government entities and Others. There did not appear to be any consensus among the IOUs on the best method to address loop flow problems. Southern Companies indicates that loop flows were often short-lived and were viewed as part of the normal interconnected operations among utilities. It was once commonly viewed that loop flows on one utility's system would most likely be offset by loop flows on its neighboring systems. In instances where the flows were a problem, negotiated solutions were reached. LG&E notes that bulk power transactions were once predominantly multi-directional and covered shorter distances so that transactions evened out over time. However, in today's marketplace transactions are more numerous, over longer distances, and unidirectional. As a result, loop flows do not even out over time. In the new competitive environment, Southern Companies, AEP and Northern States claim the situation has changed. In the emerging bulk power market, many more long term firm transactions in a single direction are contemplated which will more adversely impact flows over interconnected systems. These commenters state that it also may be more difficult in a competitive environment to negotiate solutions to parallel flow problems. Consumers believes that uncertainty about loop-flow compensation may be a significant potential barrier to the more rapid development of competition among new generators. C. Losses Many commenters (some IOUs, most Muni/Coops, some Others) argue that losses vary in proportion to the distance over which the energy is moved, and accordingly, contend that incremental losses send a more appropriate price signal to the customer (by more closely linking cost causation and cost recovery). Tabors claims that efficiency requires pricing losses at the margin, which can be accomplished using load flow calculations and Optimal Power Flow modeling techniques. On the other hand, many commenters recommend average system line losses. Several of these commenters insist that they should be charged for line losses on the same cost basis that the transmitting owners use for their own dispatch and charge their native load customers. 7. Non-Firm Transmission Pricing A fundamental issue of non-firm transmission service pricing is whether or not a contribution to capital costs over and above the variable cost of transmission (losses and opportunity costs) should be made for non-firm service. One view is that users of non-firm service should not pay for capacity costs since capacity is not built for them and their service can always be interrupted. On the other end of the spectrum are those that advocate a contribution of up to 100 percent of fixed costs, since firm customers need to be compensated for the use of the transmission system that they support in its entirety. Most IOUs indicate that non-firm users of the transmission system should contribute to the capital costs of the system. They believe the Commission should rely on its historical precedent, which allows a contribution of up to 100 percent of fixed costs for non-firm service with the revenues being credited to native load customers. Some believe the shareholders should receive some of the revenues from non-firm transactions. Other commenters suggest minimal regulation of non-firm transactions as long as the price does not exceed a cap equal to its fully allocated transmission costs. Many of the Muni/Coops commenters state that there are no fixed costs associated with providing non-firm transmission services and note that groups in different parts of the country ( e.g., PJM, NEPOOL, MAPP and ERCOT) do not include contributions to fixed costs in non-firm transmission pricing. Many commenters believe that no demand charges for non-firm transmission are necessary and argue that such demand charges may have a negative impact on the efficiencies of the economy energy market for short term transactions. For example, Consumer Working Group recommends: Limiting non-firm rates to real costs ( i.e. losses) would eliminate the artificial dead zone created by the incentive transmission rates now allowed. By granting all market participants (and not just transmission owners) access at cost to non-firm transactions, all consumers would benefit from increased coordination. Such nondiscriminatory, cost-based pricing of non-firm transmission would serve the EPAct's purpose of stimulating competition in bulk power markets and would promote economically efficient generation of electricity as expressly mandated by Section 212(a).

Many commenters believe that RTGs represent the best method available to deal with the difficult transmission pricing issues presented in Staff's Discussion Paper. Some commenters cautioned that to be successful, RTGs must be certified by the Commission to ensure proper representation of all groups within the electric utility industry. Many commenters anticipate RTGs will facilitate coordinated regional planning, regional measurement of power flows and regional methodologies to determine the price of any firm wheeling transaction within the region. The information available on a regional basis will allow planning to alleviate current and future transmission constraints within the region as well as send a clear price signal to third party customers requesting service. RTG's will also provide information as to what transmission capacity is available and the need for any transmission enhancements within the region to accommodate the requested transaction.
