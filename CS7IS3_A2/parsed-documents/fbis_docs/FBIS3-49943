Speaking after a meeting with Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus today, Meciar said, however, he believed that in fact this equality did not exist since individual countries differ in their geopolitical situation, the extent of their economic development and the structure of their armed forces. Partnership For Peace could start a certain process which could also be developed individually. That is why the results could also be different, he said. Regarding cooperation between the Visegrad Four countries (Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland) Klaus said that the Czech Republic was currently seeking to find a "common denominator" for cooperation with all its partners in the group. He admitted that not everything in this cooperation was a success but that this "was not caused by individual people on this or that side, but rather by the real interests of these countries." At the same time Klaus admitted that a "common denominator" for cooperation between the Czech and Slovak Republic could be higher than between the Czech Republic and other Visegrad countries. Meciar said that all the steps undertaken by the Czech Republic to protect its political and security interests were considered by the Slovak Government fully legitimate. He said it was his reaction to some "critical voices which have recently come from Poland especially." Meciar said this criticism was one-sided, simplified and that the Slovak Government did not identify itself with it. Klaus said the difference in the Czech and Polish approach towards the Visegrad Four questions and the organization of U.S. President Bill Clinton's Visit to Prague was not as big as it could appear judging from "some statements of some Polish representatives." The two premiers confirmed that their views on the American Project Partnership For Peace and on cooperation between the Visegrad countries were "close or similar." Meciar expressed satisfaction over the fulfillment of mutual agreements between the Czech and Slovak Republics. Klaus said he shared this view and especially appreciated the fact that the Slovak deficit on the joint clearing account "has been repaid promptly." Klaus said he did not see any reason why some problems which had appeared in Czech-Slovak relations lately could not be solved.
