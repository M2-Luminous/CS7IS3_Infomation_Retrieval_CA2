"As we've consolidated ourselves in the united German market, we are expanding quickly to foreign countries, with the primary focus on China where demand for infrastructure is large," said Lothar Mayer chairman of the board of Holzmann. The company has invested heavily in highrises, industrial construction, hotels, highways, railways and environmental protection projects in Berlin and other areas of the former East Germany since the unification of Germany in 1989. "Infrastructure and highrises are our priorities in China," said Gerhard Logters, member of the board. Mayer, Logters and other senior executives were in Beijing last week to boost Holzmann's image and consolidate its business in China. China accounts for half of the firm's business in the Asia- Pacific region. With millions of dollars of contracts in hand, Holzmann is targeting several urban construction and infrastructure projects in China including highways and harbours. It is one of the foreign companies competing for tunnelling work in the proposed 18.1-kilometre Guangzhou subway. The subway is expected to cost 6 billion yuan ($689 million). Foreign firms will be allowed to dig two tunnels for the subway. Bidding on the tunnelling portion of the contract are companies from Japan, South Korea and Europe. Jurgen Lindemann, director of Holzmann's Overseas Department, claims that his company has a good chance of winning the contract because of the company's technology, its experience in other parts of the world, its 15 years experience in working with Chinese partners and its overall knowledge of the market. In another development, it is announced that Holzmann will develop an office and apartment centre in Beijing. It has already signed a letter of intent with the Beijing government. Located in the eastern suburb of the city, the site will occupy 53,000 square metres. Logters estimates that the project could cost 300 million German marks ($187.5 million) and take three years to build. The project, which is being undertaken with the Beijing Agriculture, Industry and Commerce Corporation, will be the second development Holzmann has been awarded in the capital city. The first one was the Beijing Lufthansa Centre, which is a complex including a hotel, office building, apartments and major shopping centre. At present, Holzmann is building two power plants: One is in Ertan, Sichuan Province; the other in Xiaolangdi, Henan Province. Both projects are funded by World Bank loans. It is also constructing an elevated highway in downtown Shanghai. Apart from infrastructure, Holzmann and its subsidiaries are seeking investment in China in building materials, environmental protection and industrial sectors.
