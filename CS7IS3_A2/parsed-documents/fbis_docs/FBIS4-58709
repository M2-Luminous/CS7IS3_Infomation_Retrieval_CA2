A statement sent by the movement to Quds Press says the signing of the agreement "shows how lightly our people's appeals have been taken." The movement, which takes a negative view of the peace negotiations with Israel, said "the agreement amounts to capitulation and will not bring peace." "The causes that triggered the intifadah are still there," it emphasized. The agreement 'Arafat and Rabin signed in Cairo yesterday skirts the substance of occupation, the Islamic Jihad said. This shoddy agreement, the movement's statement warned, lays the groundwork for other wars in the region in that it represents complete acquiescence in Zionist dictates and terms.
