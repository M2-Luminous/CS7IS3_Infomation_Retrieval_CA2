State enterprises whose accounts balance have been declared unsatisfactory and an enterprise that has been declared insolvent (this is known henceforth as the debtor enterprise), in accordance with Resolution No. 498 of the Government of the Russian Federation of 20 May 1994 "On Measures to Implement Legislative Acts on Insolvency (Bankruptcy)", should be sold in accordance with this decree. 2. The accompanying provision on the procedure for selling state debtor enterprises should be approved. The provision on the procedure for selling state debtor enterprises should be applied to: state-owned debtor enterprises for which a privatization plan has not been approved according to established procedures by the time the decision is adopted on their accounts balance being unsatisfactory and the enterprises being insolvent; and, to the packages of the debtor enterprises' shares that belong to the state. 3. The sale of state debtor enterprises that are declared bankrupt should be accomplished in the following ways: --by sale through competitive bidding, on a commercial or investment basis, of debtor enterprises that will maintain their status as legal entities; --by the liquidation of debtor enterprises with the subsequent sale of their property (assets) at auctions or through competitive bidding, on a commercial or investment basis; --by selling at auction the state-owned portions of the stock (shares) of debtor enterprises. 4. If insolvency of state-owned enterprises is caused by circumstances that are not immediately connected with a delayed payment of a state order from the federal budget or from the budget of a member of the Russian Federation, the head of the enterprise who, being considered unfit for his position, should be deemed responsible for the insolvency of the enterprise. As soon as an enterprise is declared insolvent and having an unsatisfactory accounts balance, the rights to sign and cancel contracts with the head of the debtor enterprise are transferred to the Federal Department for Insolvency (bankruptcy) under the State Committee of the Russian Federation for Management of State Property or to an appropriate executive body of a member of the Russian Federation. The question of relieving the head of the debtor enterprise of his duties, as unfit for his position, will be considered simultaneously with making the decision to declare a state-owned enterprise insolvent and as having an unsatisfactory accounts balance. In the event that the head of a debtor enterprise is relieved from his duties, there will be no new appointment, but the Federal Department for Insolvency (bankruptcy) under the State Committee of the Russian Federation for Management of State Property or an appropriate executive body of a member of the Russian Federation will conclude an agreement with an individual (the manager), subcontracting the management of the debtor enterprise until it has been sold to a new owner. 5. When preparing plans for the privatization of enterprises, the Russian Federation State Committee for the Management of State Property and property management committees in components [subyekty] of the Russian Federation should analyze the financial condition of enterprises in accordance with the criteria approved by the Russian Federation Government for determining an unsatisfactory balance structure. 6. The sale of debtor enterprises around which new towns have been created should be carried out in accordance with the special rules set by the Russian Federation Government. The Russian Federation Government is to approve within two months a provision on the procedure for classifying enterprises as enterprises around which new towns have been created and the special rules for the sale of debtor enterprises around which new towns have been created. 7. The Russian Federation government should: --speed up the preparation of a draft law establishing the criminal and administrative responsibility of the management of an enterprise for actions causing the enterprise to go bankrupt; --approve within one month the norms for the distribution of resources obtained from the sale of debtor enterprises and of their property (assets) and stock (shares), in accordance with the ways in which they are used, which have been defined by the provision on the procedure for the sale of state-owned debtor enterprises. 8.
