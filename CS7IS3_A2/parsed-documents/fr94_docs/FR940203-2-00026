FR940203-2-00026 FR940203-2-00017 2. Background: (a) The Department of the Army Regulatory Program must operate in an efficient manner in order to protect the aquatic environment and provide fair, equitable, and timely decisions to the regulated public. Clear leadership and a predictable decision-making framework will enhance the public acceptance of the program and allow the program to meet the important objective of effectively protecting the Nation's valuable aquatic resources. (b) On August 9, 1991, the President announced a comprehensive plan for improving the protection of the Nation's wetlands. The plan seeks to balance two important objectives_the protection, restoration, and creation of wetlands and the need for sustained economic growth and development. The plan, which is designed to slow and eventually stop the net loss of wetlands, includes measures that will improve and streamline the current wetlands regulatory system. This Regulatory Guidance Letter is issued in accordance with the President's plan for protecting wetlands. (c) The intent of this guidance is to express clearly that the Corps is the decision-maker and project manager for the Department of Army's Regulatory Program. The Corps will consider, to the maximum extent possible, all timely, project-related comments from other Federal agencies when making regulatory decisions. Furthermore, the Corps and relevant Federal agencies will maintain and improve as necessary their working relationships. (d) The Federal resource agencies have reviewed and concurred with this guidance and have agreed to act in accordance with these provisions. While this guidance does not restrict or impair the exercise of legal authorities vested in the Federal resource agencies or States under the CWA or other statutes and regulations (e.g., EPA's authority under section 404(c), section 404(f), and CWA geographic jurisdiction and FWS/NMFS authorities under the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act and the Endangered Species Act (ESA)), agency comments on Department of the Army permit applications must be consistent with the provisions contained in this regulatory guidance letter. 3. The Corps Project Management/Decision Making Role: (a) The Corps is solely responsible for making final permit decisions pursuant to section 10 and section 404(a), including final determinations of compliance with the Corps permit regulations, the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines, and section 7(a)(2) of the ESA. As such, the Corps will act as the project manager for the evaluation of all permit applications. The Corps will advise potential applicants of its role as the project manager and decision-maker. This guidance does not restrict EPA's authority to make determinations of compliance with the Guidelines in carrying out its responsibilities under sections 309 and 404(c) of the Clean Water Act. (b) As the project manager, the Corps is responsible for requesting and evaluating information concerning all permit applications. The Corps will obtain and utilize this information in a manner that moves, as rapidly as practical, the regulatory process towards a final permit decision. The Corps will not evaluate applications as a project opponent or advocate_but instead will maintain an objective evaluation, fully considering all relevant factors. (c) The Corps will fully consider other Federal agencies' project-related comments when determining compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines, the ESA, the National Historic Preservation Act, and other relevant statutes, regulations, and policies. The Corps will also fully consider the agencies' views when determining whether to issue the permit, to issue the permit with conditions and/or mitigation, or to deny the permit. 4. The Federal Resource Agencies' Role: (a) It is recognized that the Federal resource agencies have an important role in the Department of the Army Regulatory Program under the CWA, NEPA, ESA, Magnuson Fisheries Conservation and Management Act, and other relevant statutes. (b) When providing comments, Federal resource agencies will submit to the Corps only substantive, project-related information on the impacts of activities being evaluated by the Corps and appropriate and practicable measures to mitigate adverse impacts. The comments will be submitted within the time frames established in interagency agreements and regulations. Federal resource agencies will limit their comments to their respective areas of expertise and authority to avoid duplication with the Corps and other agencies and to provide the Corps with a sound basis for making permit decisions. The Federal resource agencies should not submit comments that attempt to interpret the Corps regulations or for the purposes of section 404(a) make determinations concerning compliance with the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines. Pursuant to its authority under section 404(b)(1) of the CWA, the EPA may provide comments to the Corps identifying its views regarding compliance with the Guidelines. While the Corps will fully consider and utilize agency comments, the final decision regarding the permit application, including a determination of compliance with the Guidelines, rests solely with the Corps.
