Beninger in Tunis on 16 January: "I Wish Kreisky Were Still Alive"] [Text] [Beninger] What is the present state of the negotiations with Israel, above all on the following main topics: -- The dimension of the Jericho area, which Israel only defines as the town of Jericho covering 27 square kilometers, whereas the PLO defines it as the old Jordanian administrative district covering more than 350 square kilometers; -- The issue of control of the borders between Gaza and Egypt, and Jericho and Jordan; -- The problem of the Jewish settlers and their security? ['Arafat] Regrettably, I must say that the Israelis are still not negotiating honestly and are not really ready to keep to the accords of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. The crucial date is 13 April (according to the agreement of 13 September 1993, the Israeli soldiers must have left the autonomy areas by that date -- editorial board). This is where it all starts, the points of the agreement are not being observed. Israel continues to insist on having control of the border crossings. This means that the Israelis do not withdraw, but want to maintain the present status. They insist on making Gaza a Palestinian ghetto. The same holds true for Jericho. Who could accept their intention to stay? Who would be ready to invest money in an Israeli annex or a ghetto? Who would be ready to do so? These are the maneuvers that the Israelis are now trying to carry out. [Beninger] What specifically does this mean for the continuation of the negotiations, for the peace process in the Middle East? ['Arafat] Take the Jericho area as an example, against the background of what we discussed. The province of Jericho is 712 square kilometers large -- according to a definition of the Israeli administration. Then they offered us 27 square kilometers, which they increased to 50 square kilometers in their latest proposal. What is this supposed to be? A ghetto, a new enclave? The Israelis speak about so very small areas, even though under the agreement signed, they must pull out of all these areas within four months. What does it mean? It means that it is their intention not to pull out. [Beninger] In view of these facts, is it realistic at all to believe that the time schedule under which the Israeli withdrawal is to be completed by 13 April can be met at all? One is already in default now. ['Arafat] Rabin has said repeatedly that not even 13 April is a fixed date. What does that mean? [Beninger] But if the time schedule cannot be fulfilled, do you see any possibility at all of keeping under control the disappointment and bitterness of the people who live in the occupied territories? ['Arafat] That depends on those who signed the agreement together with us. We will then also have to see how the international community will react. After all, this agreement was not only signed by the Israelis. In the final analysis, it is an international agreement. Then it will depend on how the Europeans, how Clinton and the Americans react. [Beninger] Does the PLO have specific options to stop violence in the occupied territories? ['Arafat] This is not the only issue. There is also continuing oppression and the provocation of violence. Why are they continuing to confiscate new land and to build new settlements, specifically near Jerusalem? The isolation of Jerusalem is being increased. Then there is the additional scandal that happened only last Christmas when they granted Christians special status in the holy places. [Beninger] Accordingly, the Gaza-Jericho agreement so far has changed nothing at all for the people in the occupied territories. It is true that the refugees who left Palestine after 1967 have been guaranteed the right to return, but in fact, they are not admitted into the country. No more than 650 of more than 10,000 Palestinians in Israeli prisons have been released, and the oppressive measures of the occupation authorities has not declined, as you said. ['Arafat] What we agreed upon must finally be respected. This means that the most important points now are the withdrawal and independence. At the beginning of the third year -- not in the course of, but at the beginning! -- we must discuss the other problems. [Beninger] But is it not true that fewer Palestinians have been released than expected? ['Arafat] Not only that. The oppressive measures against our women and our people are continuing to escalate. The continuation of these activities certainly shows what game the Israelis are continuing to play. [Beninger] But there are also efforts to split the Palestinian people. For instance, following secret talks with the radical Hamas people, to which Rabin had sent him, General Doran reported recently that Hamas would prefer Israeli occupation to autonomy -- for fear of a regime by 'Arafat and his people. ['Arafat] That is a wrong story that the Israelis keep repeating. They are trying to play us off against one another. We are sure, however, that our unity is strong, much too strong to be jeopardized by such efforts. [Beninger] Nonetheless, how about your relations with Hamas? Do you believe their assertions that they want to prevent civil war? ['Arafat] Why civil war? Who is talking about civil war? This is something the Israelis talk about. Their military officers sell weapons, guns, because they hope the Palestinians could then start waging war against one another, they hope they will be split. The Israelis must withdraw. Please tell every Israeli, every Israeli official, that I am sure that such actions will not influence our free men, our free people in any way. They will have no influence on a democracy and a society in which human rights are respected. You should remember, for instance, that many Palestinian organizations were represented in Beirut that had all types of weapons -- guns, rifles, and even tanks. Nothing happened among them. Rather there was unity and stability among the Palestinians. We are certain that the Palestinians will demonstrate responsibility. Granted, there will be opposition, but this is part of our democracy. [Beninger] Against this background, how about your relations with Syria? Will you meet with President al-Asad in the next few weeks? ['Arafat] If there is an opportunity, why not? But we should not forget that there was a meeting in Damascus recently between Syria, Egypt, and other states, and these states expressly support the declaration that we signed with Israel. [Beninger] You will need huge sums to reconstruct Gaza and Jericho.... ['Arafat] ... and the West Bank. [Beninger] How about the financial situation of the PLO? ['Arafat] You know that several countries promised us help. We have pledges from the World Bank and the EC. We have a number of bilateral pledges, and U.S. President Clinton promised us $2.2 billion at short notice. [Beninger] There has been vehement criticism from your own ranks in recent weeks about yourself and your leadership style. ['Arafat] Are you against democracy? Isn't this so in Austria, too? Why do you speak about democracy in your country, whereas in the case of the Palestinians, you do not consider criticism a sign of democracy? If there is no opposition, something is wrong. [Beninger] Do you have concrete plans to bind the people who are opposed to you into the work? ['Arafat] Of course, they will also help reconstruct their country. [Beninger] Some Palestinian experts and even the World Bank and the European Community have criticized the fact that you brought PEDRA (Palestine Economic Development and Reconstruction Authority, which is to take over management of the entire aid funds -- editorial board) under your personal control, and the two vice presidents of PEDRA (Faruq Qaddumi and Mohammed Zahdi -- editorial board), who are politicians and no economic experts .... ['Arafat] Who says that? These are rumors. [Beninger] So there was criticism? ['Arafat] Some, but no official criticism, just one of those obstructive maneuvers and rumors. We are talking about facts. A counter example is the way the World Bank is dealing with our economic facilities. The same holds true for Europe, the European Community. [Beninger] How do you assess Austria's role in the Middle East process? During the Bruno Kreisky era, Austria played a decisive role in the region. This is not nearly the case any more to the former extent. ['Arafat] We should not forget what they are doing now. What the Austrians are doing is very important. They are doing their best. [Beninger] Does this also include their material aid, which, compared with comparable countries, appears to be a bit small, doesn't it? ['Arafat] We are satisfied with what the kindly people in Austria are doing for us. But we should never forget what a significant role my friend, Bruno Kreisky, played for us. I wish he could be here. I wish he were still alive.
