They discussed the government alliance and its prospects for the presidential elections. PA members said their hopes to head the presidential ticket has strengthened. The issue of the alliance was discussed during a meeting held this afternoon at the Palace of the Herons between President Guillermo Endara Galimany and Mireya Moscoso de Gruber. [Begin recording] [Moscoso de Gruber] We obviously talked about the government alliance. I told the president that the PA wants to maintain this alliance. I informed him we will soon talk to Molirena [Liberal Nationalist Republican Movement] so they decide whether they want to remain in this alliance with the PA or wish to abandon the alliance. [Ortega] Would any other political group, such as Solidarity, join this alliance? [Moscoso de Gruber] We have been talking to some parties. We have also spoken to Solidarity representatives, but I think they are waiting to see what will happen with the government alliance. So far we have only talked without reaching any special commitments. [Ortega] It should be pointed out that [former Comptroller General] Ruben Dario Carles' presidential candidacy has been endorsed by Morena [National Renewal Movement]. To what degree does this pose an obstacle to your aspirations to be top leaders of the PA? [Moscoso de Gruber] No, Morena has every right to nominate Mr. Carles for the presidency. We, the Arnulfists, are going to nominate our candidate on 23 January. It is no obstacle for us that Morena nominated Carles. [Ortega] Finally, it has been learned some political parties have hidden weapons. How do Arnulfists view this? Do they feel threatened by this irregular situation? [Moscoso de Gruber] It is regrettable that at this point it is said some political parties maintain weapons, which they will definitely use in the upcoming elections. It is regrettable they would try to disrupt peace in the next elections. We want the upcoming elections to be peaceful, although from what we said in April in the city of Boquete, I thought at that time that the next elections would not be peaceful. We believe Panamanians want peace, free elections, and to live in a democratic country. [end recording] Mireya Moscoso de Gruber highlighted once more that she will not give up leading the presidential ticket. She also noted that once the campaign begins, her popularity and that of the PA will increase and the results of polls will change completely.
