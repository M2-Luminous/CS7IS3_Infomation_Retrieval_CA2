[passage omitted] No one knows the precise number of substance abusers in Denmark, but from many sources it seems there are around 10,000 people who regularly use hard drugs such as heroin, amphetamines, and cocaine. Some 4,000 of these reside in Copenhagen. But the narcotics problem is no longer only a big-city phenomenon. Drugs are appearing in even the smallest villages. Most substance abusers make their living from trafficking profits. According to Jorgen Green, director of the Storstrom County Youth Center, abusers cost society 400 million kroner annually for this activity. [passage omitted] The narcotics trade is a billion [kroner] business. A cautious estimate assumes an annual street sale of hard drugs amounting to at least 1.5 billion kroner. In 1992, the police and customs seized 38.5 kg of heroin, 21.5 kg of cocaine, and 73.6 kg of amphetamines. Around 150 million kroner is used for fighting narcotics violations. In Copenhagen alone there are 170 police officers who are exclusively engaged with narcotics and narcotics-related crime. Ninety percent of all telephone taps deal with narcotics. Drug abusers are connected with 25-50 percent of all break-ins. Their damages cost insurance companies at least 450 million kroner yearly. [passage omitted] One-fourth of judges' time is devoted to trying people charged with drug violations. Around 40 percent of the places in Danish prisons are occupied by drug abusers and drug dealers. They cost society annually around 350 million kroner. Only a very small percentage of those charged are convicted pursuant to the drug-kingpin paragraph [in the law code]. By far the most have been put behind bars for small-scale pushing, or because they have had small amounts of substances in their possession. [passage omitted] No one has a purview of the the total amount spent on treatment and prevention. But a rough estimate would be around at least 350 million kroner for the entire country. In the municipality of Copenhagen, which houses approximately half the country's treatment places, 64 million kroner have been appropriated for counternarcotics efforts in 1994. In addition, funds are being spent on ambulatory treatment in physician offices and hospital inpatient treatment, and money for this purpose is also being provided to privately operated care homes and shelters.
