With it, the Beijing regime sharply defies American pressure to improve its human rights record. It also graphically demonstrates its lack of confidence about its control in China. The rearrest of China's most prominent political dissidents appears to set the United States and China on a collision course over human rights. But more obviously, the Communist Party leaders are hoping that the U.S. will pursue its economic interests in maintaining trade with China rather than press its human rights concerns. The commonly held belief among Chinese officials is that the U.S., fearful of being shut out of the world's biggest emerging market, will find a way to renew China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) trading status. Beijing has every reason to support this assumption as it has gained more and more sympathy inside and outside America towards unconditional renewal of the trade privilege. The Clinton administration has been under increasingly heavy pressure from the most influential business community to promote closer trade ties with China. Japan, Germany, Italy and France have defied the U.S. stance on human rights with leaders flooding into the middle kingdom to scramble for a bigger slice of the world's most lucrative and last untapped market. Last weekend, the visiting French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur even gave China clear assurances his government would not "interfere" in China's human rights issue. Earlier, other Western leaders including German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and resigned Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa made similar pledges to China in their recent visits. Meanwhile, Beijing has strengthened its bargaining position in dealing with the Americans. The rift between the U.S. and Japan and other Southeast Asian nations over trade issues has weakened the U.S.'s status in pressing China for more compromises both in trade and politics. China's role in maintaining regional order has been measurably enhanced following the North Korea nuclear crisis, in which Beijing's attitude has been crucial. The communist leadership has obviously became more confident than ever in obtaining unconditional MFN this June. In many ways, however, Wei's fate and the course of the Sino-American struggle over the profitable trade status now seem inextricably bound. He may end up hostage to the dispute. The high risk Beijing is taking by threatening to jail Wei again and rearresting a few other dissidents gives a strong indication how much it fears just one man or a few. But the larger background to this singular fear is the high level of public discontent in China in recent months over its runaway economy, price hikes, rampant corruption and other economic imbalances -- much the same sort of mass discontent that set the stage for the nationwide pro-democracy protests five years ago. For the Chinese government, a free and outspoken Wei and a handful of other dissidents pose a major threat. More than anyone else, Wei has become the focal point for many pro-democracy activists. The Chinese government is especially worried about the potential for turmoil this spring, the fifth anniversary of the 1989 democracy movement. Given widespread discontent among masses, maintaining social stability has become a catchword of Chinese politics these days and has been given top priority in recent speeches by senior leaders. China's season of silence is in full swing. Every spring, Beijing's security apparatus, its relatively few dissidents and its foreign press corps gear up for the anniversary of the 4 June event. The fragility of the Communist Party's grip on power is shown by the silence it tries to enforce on many matters. This year, the crackdown on dissidents and foreign reporters has come earlier than usual and tensions are greater than any time since 1989. It thus may seem unfathomable that China would make the mistake of handing a few dissidents out of 1.2 billion people so much power by repeatedly harassing them under the spotlight of the international news media. The explanation to this is largely due to an increasingly fragile constitution for 89-year-old senior leader Deng Xiaoping. Party leaders appear to agree with their critics that conditions now are ripe for a huge social explosion. The contradiction here is that while China is doing better than ever, at the same time it appears set for another huge spasm.
