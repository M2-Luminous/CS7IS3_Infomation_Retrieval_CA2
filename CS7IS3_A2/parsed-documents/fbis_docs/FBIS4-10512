It is the result of the so-called Uruguay Round of talks held within GATT. What enthusiasm should Brazilian farmers have about the new agreement? The way in which the agreement was negotiated cannot be ignored. Negotiations violated a basic principle, that of multilateral action. The position of weak countries was for the most part ignored. Stronger countries made it clear that orders come from those who have power. Orders are obeyed by common-sense countries. The authoritarianism adopted by the United States and the EU jeopardized the principle of negotiation that should be observed by all commercial rules. It is not a matter of claiming that we can have the same weight. But it is necessary to clearly admit that most countries had limited participation. We are actually in a submissive position, and recognition of this situation will make it possible for the Brazilian economy to find its appropriate place in international commerce. The Uruguay Round began with the revolutionary proposal to eliminate subsidies for agriculture. The challenge represented by the destruction of this economic "barrier" was exciting. Time showed the change in the U.S. position against subsidies and for free trade. For their part, weak countries lacked cohesion for eliminating the "barrier." In the end it was clear that the "barrier" is not a priority. The EU is facing problems in its own structure. It has very close neighbors that might cause more serious problems in the future. The United States is concerned about building a "dike," not about eliminating the "barrier." Agricultural subsidies were postponed for another occasion. It would be very difficult to hail the 21 percent reduction of subsidies on farm exports over the next six years. Subsidies on exports have nothing to do with food insurance [seguranca alimentar]. Nor do they have anything to do with the well-being of U.S. or European farmers. They do not protect less competitive farm sectors. They represent a simple and cheap way of making internal adjustments -- unfortunately -- at the expense of others. Food support and food insurance policies generate a production surplus. This surplus, however, can be managed internally. The complexity of stronger countries' farm policy is such that it allows for adjusting production without a noticeable drop in farmers' income and without subsidizing exports. Doing it on the international market, however, is simpler and easier. This way, internal policy affairs are adjusted by throwing out the economic waste of the production surplus. They destroy international market prices by adjusting their internal policy. What is simple and cheap for the strong harms the agriculture of the weak. Subsidies on exports cannot be justified. It is actually a 79 percent injustice. It means that because of a solution that is simpler and more economic for the strong, a vast part of the world will still have to wait perhaps six years to grow. We obtained very little, if anything at all. We can resign ourselves to the room we have. We should sign the agreement because not doing so might be even worse. But hailing this would be too much.
