But while EU members, on the initiative of France, are ready to help sort out the country's problems in order to prevent Islamists from achieving their aims, they expect authorities in Algiers to implement both financial and political reforms. The events in Algeria will be discussed today in Brussels at the meeting of the 12 European foreign ministers. A few days before an Algerian delegation is due to fly to Washington to negotiate the rescheduling of the country's external debt (some $26 billion) with the IMF, the Europeans are expected to reaffirm their opposition to terrorism, to condemn human rights abuse, and to insist on the need for democratic dialogue and the urgent implementation of economic reforms that include solving the debt problem with the IMF. If such conditions are met, the EU is expected to confirm its commitment to assisting the Algerians in their national rescue operation. There is still some way to go before reaching that stage, however. And European diplomatic circles -- including French ones -- can barely conceal a measure of embarrassment. "We are not breathing down the neck of Algiers authorities. However, the way the government is working there must be reformed," says a diplomat. In the meantime, the French Government seems ready to renew in 1994 a financial protocol at least equal to that of 1993, which was worth Fr6.35 billion, 90 percent of which was effectively used by Algerians. There also is hope that if an agreement with the IMF is reached, Algeria may benefit from $4 to $5 billion in immediate aid. EU circles in Brussels also indicate that, since 1978, Europeans have continually offered Algeria a project-related financial assistance whose ceiling was gradually increased through the years, but which was used...less and less by the Algerian authorities. To such an extent that only 12 percent of the ECU239 million granted for the 1987-1991 period was actually drawn on. As for the ECU350 million allocated for 1992-1996, it has not yet been touched. Emergency This is the proof of the Algerian Government's impotence and the gradual decay of the country's economy, whose imports have been halved since 1986. Today, the noose is getting dangerously tight around Algeria's neck due to the country's political inability to acknowledge the need to reschedule its external debt. Today, taking action has become more urgent than ever. Oil prices have dropped by about 25 percent since last summer. For 1994, debt service will total $9 billion while export revenues (derived mostly from oil and gas) are not expected to exceed this same figure. "Failure to reach an agreement with the IMF would mean a total collapse of the economy," stated Algerian Economy Minister Mourad Benachenhou recently. The IMF requirements for a structural adjustment program have long been known: devaluation of the dinar by at leat 30 percent, or even 50 percent; drastic reduction of the budget deficit; and a wider opening of the Algerian market to foreign competition. The latter requirement may increase the difficulties of the uncompetitive local industry, whose industrial output is less than 50 percent of production capacity, and inflate the jobless rate in a country which already has more than 2 million unemployed. A particularly bitter, albeit an inevitable, pill that already has the UGTA (General Union of Algerian Workers) howling; Abdelbak Benhamuda, its general secretary, has condemned "the groveling before the IMF" and threatened a "general uprising" that would stem from the soaring price of basic food products, of which there is already a near shortage. Shortly after taking office, Algeria's President General Zeroual is already caught between undeterred Islamic terrorists and the danger of a social explosion comparable to the tragic one Algeria experienced in 1988.
