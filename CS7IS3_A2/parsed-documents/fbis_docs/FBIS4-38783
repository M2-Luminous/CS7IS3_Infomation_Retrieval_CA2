We need new technologies and not shovels. [Mykhaylenko] What role in this process do you assign to Russia? [Kuchma] Given that Japan, for instance, is trying to initiate close ties with Russia why should Ukraine disrupt them? Ukraine entirely depends on Russian raw materials. In light of this, we should proceed from existing realities. Ukraine sells 80 percent of its products to Russia. If we lose this market we will never be able to reclaim it. Our economy must not be closed to the outside world. I am ready to personally greet large Japanese firms thath will arrive in Ukraine with their investments and new technologies. Everything that will be manufactured on Ukraine's territory will remain there. [Mykhaylenko] How do you treat the idea voiced by both Crimean President Meshkov and Ostankino, who maintain that the aggravation of the situation in Crimea is used to postpone presidential elections in Ukraine? [Kuchma] I would not like to be so blunt, but certain nuances of this kind seem conceivable. It is possible to annul presidential elections under the current circumstances. Who is interested in annulling them? The president. Thus both you and I have grounds to ask this kind of question. [Mykhaylenko] Are you going to visit Crimea? [Kuchma] My visit to Crimea would be inexpedient. We have the president, while I am often depicted as the pro-Russian enemy No. 1. The president should proceed from the belief that future generations will not forgive us faulty steps. Once we gave Crimea autonomy why raise a turmoil? [Mykhaylenko] Crimean Supreme Soviet Chairman Tsekov suggests that Ukraine join Russia along with Crimea. [Kuchma] However I have never said this. Is it not clear that those are just political games and a fight for power? [Mykhaylenko] In light of current relations between Ukraine and Crimea, what compromises can the Ukrainian and Crimean legislatures reach? [Kuchma] Legislative speaker Moroz should go to Crimea and start negotiating. There is only one way to improve the situation, namely by creating conditions for the economic development in the Crimea. Perhaps form a free economic zone. China does not want to take Hong Kong back, because the latter is profitable for China. [Mykhaylenko] What concessions should Crimea make? [Kuchma] Crimea should acknowledge that it is and will remain a part of Ukraine.
