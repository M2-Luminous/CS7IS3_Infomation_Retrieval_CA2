The Foreign Ministry has made this decision in consideration of Japan's relations with the United States, which is strongly opposed to the establishment of the EAEC. Circumstances are such that even if debates on this issue are resumed in the future, it cannot be predicted whether Japan will decide to participate in the organization. Thus, Japan's currently strained relations with the United States are affecting its Asian policy, too. The EAEC plan is aimed at unifying nations in the East Asian region. It has its origins in the East Asia Economic Group (EAEG) plan proposed by Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed Mahathir. The United States is strongly opposed to the plan because it excludes such nations as the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
