Distrust in Motorola The mobile phone issue was not on the agenda of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks which ended in breakdown. The U.S. trade representative has asserted that the "mobile phone issue had nothing to do with the breakdown of the latest Japan-U.S. summit talks," but the mobile phone issue has emerged as a "major item" subject to U.S. sanctions on Japan. The Japan Mobile Communications Company [JMCC] is being criticized as responsible for Japan-U.S. friction over the mobile phone issue. JMCC President Kenyu Tsukada, however, says, "The demand by the U.S. trade representative and Motorola is impossible for us to meet." In this way, the JMCC maintains its confrontational posture. The JMCC has already made a compromise proposal to Motorola that it would spend 30 billion yen over the next two or three years to expand the Motorola mobile phone service in Japan. The JMCC says, "We can no longer make concessions for Motorola," and nongovernmental negotiations remain deadlocked. On 16 February, the Telecommunications Equipment Industry Association (headed by Yoshi Sekizawa) issued an unusual statement saying, "If the United States imposes sanctions against Japan, Japan needs to argue with the United States in multilateral trade organizations like the GATT." The telecommunications equipment industry is increasingly expressing its distrust in Motorola, saying, "Motorola's demand for setting numerical targets for Japan's purchase of U.S.-made mobile phones is clearly a steamroller, and the U.S. company has made the demand with the idea of sanctions on Japan from the beginning." In mid-February, when the United States strongly hinted at taking moves to enforce sanctions on Japan, JMCC President Sekizawa told Toyota Motor Corporation, a major shareholder of the JMCC, that "sparks of fire may fall upon us." Electric tools surfaced as items targeted by U.S. sanctions on Japan in connection with friction over the semiconductor issue. Japan is in the grip of U.S. suspicion. Regarding sanctions on Japan under consideration by the United States, Ryoichi Sugioka, managing director of Fujitsu Ltd, ostensibly projects a calm attitude, saying, "I cannot comment on them before the specific contents of the sanctions come to light." Since the latest Japan-U.S. friction has arisen over the mobile phone issue, there is growing apprehension that "automobiles and mobile phones are most likely to be targeted by U.S. sanctions on Japan." Overwhelming Export Surplus Japanese makers of mobile phones produce about 4.2 million sets every year, and of these, about 1.9 million sets are sold in the U.S. market. An official familiar with the telecommunications equipment industry says, "Japanese mobile phone makers produce 70 percent of the mobile phones sold on the U.S. market in the United States, and any increase in U.S. duties on them will have little impact." In 1992, Japan exported $2.407 billion in telecommunications equipment to the United States and imported $556 million, an overwhelming net export surplus in favor of Japan. Speculation is rampant that if the United States imposes sanctions on Japan, the sanctions would target "telecommunications equipment generally," not only mobile phones, and overseas procurement by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) would be embroiled in the sanctions." A top executive of Oki Electric Industry Ltd has said, "The exports of facsimile machines would be hit the hardest by U.S. sanctions." Japan's exports of facsimile machines to the United States account for about 60 percent of its total exports of communications-terminal products to that country. If U.S. sanctions target facsimile machines, it would become a matter of life or death for Japanese producers of the machines. Japan, U.S. Feud Over NTT Procurement The NTT, too, is worried about being targeted by U.S. sanctions. The United States has demanded that the NTT's procurement be incorporated into the framework of the government procurement. In response, Japan has rebutted the U.S. demand, saying, "The NTT has already been privatized so it is impossible to meet the U.S. demand." As a result, negotiations between the two countries have yielded no agreement. The International Procurement Office of the NTT says: "We have procured many goods through joint-development arrangement. Our procurement formula is different from conventional procurement. If our procurement is incorporated into the framework of government procurement, this would not be an advantage for the United States." In this way, the NTT appears to have no room to accept the U.S. demand. The trade structure between the two countries of network products such as switchboards is totally opposite the trade structure of such communications terminals as facsimile machines and telephones. Japan exports $199 million worth of network products to the United States while importing $257 million worth of network products from that country. The United States has a net surplus in the trade of these items. Most of Japan's imports of network products are due to the NTT's procurement activities abroad. The International Procurement Office of the NTT says: "The NTT has increased its amount of overseas procurement to $784 million (including the amount for the procurement of computers), an increase of 23 percent over the amount of such procurement in 1992. We have procured 95 percent of our goods from U.S. producers. There is no reason for the United States to criticize the NTT for being responsible for the current trade imbalance between the two countries." Behind the Japan-U.S. friction over the mobile phone issue is Motorola, a company which has scored great achievements by taking a tough stand on Japan whenever trade friction has occurred between the two countries. It is unpredictable how the Japan-U.S. friction over the mobile phone issue will develop in the future. The Japanese telecommunication industry is likely to be pushed around by the friction for the time being.
