Speaking after the talks he held with President Rauf Denktas today, Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative, said that an agreement has not been reached and no progress has been made on the problem. President Denktas said later that the talks ended at an impasse and broke off as a result of the Greek Cypriot side's irreconcilable approach and the holes that have been drilled in the confidence-building measures package. [Begin Denktas recording] The only reason for the conclusion of the exercise in this way is the move they [UN officials] made to include a road in the package, which the two sides agreed to at the beginning on the condition that a change would not be made in it. They asked that our troops be withdrawn from that road. They abandoned their request for the withdrawal of our troops today. Instead, they said that the troops must not be visible from that road. How will they not be visible? We said that that is not the only problem. We have another pending problem, which is related to their map. We said: The process will collapse if you insist on that map because we do not accept it. You have given two maps to us. The first map was given to us in New York on 1 May 1993. It was a realistic map, which depicted the fenced area. We began the process of the talks on the basis of that map. However, you submitted a new map one and a half months ago. It took a piece of land from our military area, a piece of land that has no connection with the fenced area. Therefore, we cannot accept that map. He [Joe Clark] said that the map was placed on the negotiation table and that the talks would collapse if we did not accept it. Well, why have you forced us to hold talks on the question of access to Maras [Varosha] since the talks will collapse because of that map? We cannot agree to that map. Furthermore, we said that you have mentioned the question of the use of the Nicosia Airport by Greek Cypriot passenger aircraft. That matter was not included in the package. Obviously, that is an addition to the package. Glavkos Kliridhis put forward the condition that the airline companies based in Cyprus would not use the airport. He also said that that applied to the Cyprus Airways company. That is how we agreed to the package. However, we were informed later that the Cyprus Airways company would use the airport. Kliridhis further said that the Turkish Cypriot Airlines company could use the airport on the condition that its aircraft had no inscription or logos on them. That meant that the Turkish Cypriot passenger aircraft would take off and land like pirate aircraft. Well, the concept of equality is a basic principle. We have asked whether or not the same conditions would apply to the Greek Cypriot passenger aircraft if we agreed to allow them to use the Nicosia Airport. Will the inscriptions and logos on the Greek Cypriot aircraft be erased? Will the Greek Cypriot aircraft be under the UN administrator's control, as is the case with the Turkish Cypriot aircraft? Will the Greek Cypriot aircraft be registered in Athens? If not, then will the Greek Cypriot side agree to the registration of our passenger aircraft in Nicosia? Does the Greek Cypriot side agree to all that? He said that the Greek Cypriots will not agree to all that. The Greek Cypriot passenger aircraft will use Nicosia Airport under their company name but will comply with the UN administrator's conditions. Considering our demand for equality, we asked whether the Turkish Cypriot aircraft would be allowed only one flight if the Greek Cypriots ask for the right to fly once a day? All that has not been clarified. We have been informed that a fair and just system will be established. However, the additions that have been made are such that they will cause the package to collapse. The recognition of that right for the Cyprus Airways Company will be tantamount to recognizing the most fundamental political right for the Greek Cypriot side at our expense. However, they do not wish to realize that state of affairs. As far as they are concerned, that right is very natural and the Cyprus Airways Company can benefit from it. As far as we are concerned, we cannot move any further in light of such an approach. Meanwhile, a tangible form has not yet been given to the rights they have promised to give to us. We have been talking on the package. However, he informed us today that we should take up the issues one by one, starting with the question of access [to Varosa]. Why should we discuss the question of access? It is related to your map, which I do not accept. First, you should correct that map. We can hold talks on it later. Considering the rights you have given to the Greek Cypriots, let us use the northern part of Dhimokratias Avenue. However, they have not even bothered to discuss the matter. In view of all that, I believe that they will probably consider the matter once again. A new UN report may be drawn up, in which we may be reprimanded. Nevertheless, considering the promise we have made to our Republican Assembly, we have acted with goodwill and moderation and maintained the talks until now by agreeing to many points. Otherwise, the talks would have ended a long time ago. Mr. Clark is well aware of the fact that the UN officials placed two maps on the negotiation table and that we have agreed to the concept of holding talks on the fenced part of Maras. Nevertheless, he disregarded that and said that is the map which has been placed on the negotiation table, you have to accept it, and it cannot be changed. That approach has undermined everything.
