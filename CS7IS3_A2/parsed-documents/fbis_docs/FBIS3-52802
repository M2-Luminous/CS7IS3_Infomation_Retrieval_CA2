The talks will be held in a special wing [of the Taba Hilton Hotel] which will be closed to the media. Political sources said this evening that if the PLO brings up for the discussion the issue of border crossings, Israel will be willing to deal with only cosmetic matters, and not with Israel's responsibility in principle over the crossings. The prime minister's bureau this evening made haste to deny the remarks of Tzomet Knesset Member Eli'ezer Zandberg that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from the Gaza Strip will begin on 22 February.
