They had handed in their notice after the management moved to prevent the previously unreleased footage of the crackdown being screened late on Saturday night, almost five years to the hour since troops began moving against the pro-democracy movement. After a meeting with senior management yesterday, the six members of the News and Public Affairs Department said they would stick to their decision to resign. They agreed to stay on until their replacements have been hired. The 40-minute documentary, which features seven minutes of film taken by a Spanish news team from the Monument to the People's Heroes in the early hours of June 4, 1989, will go to air as they had planned. The ATV management originally ordered the suspension of the film last week, but later suggested that it could be screened at another time slot. On Tuesday [31 May], it backed down amid a public outcry over apparent self-censorship. The company management yesterday rejected suggestions that it had decided to ban the film. Chief executive officer Mark Lee Po-on and deputy chief executive Clarence Chang Ching-po, who flew from Taiwan to attend the meeting, said that no final decision on how the documentary should be handled was ever made before late on Tuesday. Mr Lee said the final decision then was that the news division could decide where to place the documentary. He said ATV chairman Lim Poy-yen was in support of the management's decision and was well-informed of the incident since it began. The Governor, Chris Patten, said it was "very sad" for six senior journalists to resign from ATV. Noting the importance of a free exchange of ideas, Mr Patten said it was also important to keep management and editorial functions in any media organisation separate. The Hong Kong Journalists' Association also expressed sorrow at the resignations, saying that they were a result of the lack of sincerity on the side of the management. The journalists, all in top positions, said the conflict between their and management's versions of the incident had made it difficult for them to stay with the company, "It has destroyed the basis of mutual trust and cooperation," said acting news controller Poon Fu-yim. "We can see we have no mutual trust, they are saying one thing and we are saying another thing. They say their version is correct but we don't agree," said Poon. Also resigning were assistant news controller Selina Li Yuk-lin, executive editor Lo Wing-hung, managing editor Lui Wan-sang, assignment editor Choy Pui-ying and city editor Lau Kok-wa. "We feel our independence, our editorial policy, has been tampered with that's why we are leaving," Poon said. He said although a few more staff members might follow suit, most people in the news division were watching developments calmly. Speaking at a press conference, Mr Lee rejected any claims that the management had ever come to a decision that the film should not be screened. Mr Lee said the journalists had submitted their resignation on a premature decision that the film would be screened on One Day programme instead of the current affairs programme News Magazine. "We tried to put our suggestion to our colleagues in the news division that it would not be appropriate for the film to be shown in News Magazine, which is a current affairs programme to update the audience with the latest development of events," Mr Lee said. "If the film is about events happening in 1989, it is a documentary," he added. Mr Lee denied the incident had anything to do with the independence of ATV's news division. "We place full trust on our colleagues in the news division. This is just a very, very unique case." He said it was because of the very "suspenseful" nature of the film that special attention had been paid to it by the management. "We are all curious about it. It presents a theory different from what we were told," Mr Lee said. He denied that Chinese authorities had been informed of the purchase of the documentary, which tends to support the Chinese Government's insistence that no one was killed in Tiananmen Square. Mr Chang would not explain his views on the documentary. "News judgment is a very subjective thing," he said. He rejected a claim that he had stated there was no way the company would change its mind regardless of any resignations.
