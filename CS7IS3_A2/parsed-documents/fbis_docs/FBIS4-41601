Deputy Premier Enver Kapba, the chief Abkhazian negotiator at the current talks with Georgia, told ITAR-TASS that all repair works at the motor bridge will start only after Russian peacekeepers are deployed to separate the conflicting parties. "As far as the railway bridge is concerned, (Abkhazia) will start repair works only when the problem of its political status is settled," Kapba stressed. The deputy premier told TASS that Abkhazia had handed over to the Georgian side a list of valuables removed from the Abkhazian territory during the war. The list included aircraft, sea vessels, motor vehicles, factory equipment and museum rarities among other things. "To continue our dialogue, it is essential that the Georgian side reimburse at least a part of that damage," Kapba said.
