Accordingly, 7 CFR part 273 is proposed to be amended as follows: 1. The authority citation for part 273 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 2011&hyph;2032. PART 273_CERTIFICATION OF ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS 2. In §273.7, paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) is revised to read as follows: §273.7 Work requirements. * * * * * (d) Federal financial participation. (1) Employment and training grants. (i) *␣*␣* (B) In Fiscal Year 1993, the Secretary shall allocate $15 million of the Federal funds available for unmatched employment and training grants based on the ratio of the number of E&T mandatory participants placed (as defined under paragraph (o) in this section) in a food stamp E&T program in an eligible State to the number of E&T mandatory participants placed in all eligible States in Calendar Year 1991. Beginning in Fiscal Year 1994, and each subsequent fiscal year until two years after the promulgation of this rule in final, the Secretary shall allocate $15 million of Federal funds on the basis of the amount of performance-based funding each State agency received in Fiscal Year 1993, provided the State agency has met the performance standard as specified under paragraph (o) of this section for the second preceding fiscal year. For example, to receive performance-based funding in Fiscal Year 1994, the State agency must have met its performance standard in Fiscal Year 1992. Corrections to reports required to be submitted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section must be received by FNS, and State agency good cause appeals must be resolved no later than March 1, to be used in determining whether a State agency is eligible for performance-based funding for the fiscal year beginning the following October. In Fiscal Year 1994 and each subsequent fiscal year until two years after the promulgation of this rule in final form, if the data on the reports show that a State agency did not meet its performance standard or a good cause determination was not made by FNS by March 1, the State agency shall not be eligible for performance-based funding. In this instance, the Secretary shall redistribute the $15 million Federal funds to eligible State agencies on the basis of Calendar Year 1991 data as prescribed under this paragraph, excluding the noncompliant States. * * * * * Dated: January 10, 1994. Ellen Haas, Assistant Secretary for Food and Consumer Services. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1261 Filed 1&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;30&hyph;U
