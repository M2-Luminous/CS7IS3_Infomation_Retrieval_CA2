The regions are not making ends meet. Arrears in the payment of wages, especially to employees of social, cultural, and consumer service facilities, come to several months. Social tensions are rising, and confidence in the power structures is dwindling. Under the circumstances, the regional authorities are more often than not acting in the traditional manner: They send envoys to the Ministry of Finance, and the envoys try to "lobby" for yet another billion for their oblast, kray, or republic. However, carving up the budgetary pie is becoming increasingly difficult. There is no money. Less frequently, the oblast authorities try to find a way out on their own, without assistance from the center. After all, it is no secret that tremendous amounts are left uncollected at the regional level. The Voronezh Oblast administration has resolved to get at least some of them. Deputy head of the Voronezh Oblast Administration Igor Neznamov said: "For us to live like we did in 1993 the oblast needs 240 billion rubles [R] in the first quarter. However, in reality a budget of R124 billion has been put together. The deficit comes to R116 billion. All these numbers are based on prices of the fourth quarter of last year. Meanwhile, prices for gasoline, electricity, raw and other materials, and medicines increased sharply in January. Prices have gone up, but no recalculation has been done so far. As a result, in January alone we needed to allocate R80 to the sector financed from the budget. However, we were able to fund only R33 billion. As is known, Voronezh Oblast is primarily an agrarian region. Enterprises of the defense industry account for the bulk of the industrial potential, but these enterprises are in need of assistance themselves. For example, the neighboring Lipetsk is one-half the size of Voronezh in terms of population, but the volume of industrial production is two times greater there. In a word, the consolidated budget situation in Voronezh is extreme. Suffice it to mention that, if funding for preschool facilities is cut off, employment will fall sharply because of nonworking mothers, and the volume of industrial production in the oblast will decline another 70 percent. Under the circumstances, emergency financing procedures were temporarily introduced in Voronezh Oblast in March. Governor A. Kovalev signed a package of 17 decrees. The task is to regain control of the economic situation in the oblast. First of all, measures are envisioned that will bring about a reduction in the expenditures of the oblast budget. Only the "protected" items of expenditure of organizations financed from the budget are funded on a priority basis: wages, electricity, municipal services. For example, the Decree "On Streamlining Funding for Health Care in the Oblast" introduced strict item-specific financing in health care facilities of the oblast. It is forbidden for hospitals, polyclinics, and medical services departments to purchase drugs at prices exceeding the wholesale-factory prices of the Farmatsiya state enterprise, or to purchase expensive equipment, except for that directly supporting the provision of medical care to the population. Monitoring of transfers of funds to the fund of compulsory medical insurance will be reinforced. Negotiated prices in construction are also becoming a matter of the past. Firm cost estimates for construction products are being introduced which proceed from the 1991 base price multiplied by a uniform sectoral index. The latter will now be determined by an oblast center for price setting in the construction sector. At the same time, tax relief is envisioned for private enterprises building facilities that are included on the list of state needs of the oblast. Measures to raise the rate of the profit tax taken in by the local budget to 25 percent for enterprises and organizations and 30 percent for insurance organizations, i.e. 3 and 8 percent more, respectively, are aimed at boosting the revenue side of the budget. A fee of R2 million a month will be assessed on all commercial stands. Mutual offsetting of the debts of enterprises in Voronezh Oblast will soon be performed. The plan is to subsequently expand it to all oblasts of the Central Chernozem area. In the opinion of Igor Neznamov, carrying out these decisions will yield about R20 billion per month to the oblast budget. This does not solve all the problems, but will be a substantial help to the organs of executive power in funding organizations financed from the budget.
