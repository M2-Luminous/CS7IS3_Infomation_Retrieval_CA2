The system, under which members of provincial and city councils and heads of autonomous governing bodies will be elected, will be introduced in the first half of 1995. Both the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) and the main opposition Democratic Party (DP) regard the local elections as a "prelude" to parliamentary elections in 1996 and the presidential poll in 1997. Consequently, sources expect the parties to come out with strategies to win the local elections following their national conventions in mid-1994. The DLP, especially, believes that the local elections will be a referendum on President Kim Yong-sam's administration. DLP insiders said Tuesday that senior party officials have already decided to solidify the leadership and select candidates for local elections without fanfare while trying to prevent overheating of the election atmosphere. Prior to its national convention in May, the DLP will undertake the reorganization of 95 local party chapters, replacing some chairmen and strengthening organizational works. In addition, the government and ruling party plan to replace city mayors and county chiefs with "reform-minded" officials in a large- scale reshuffle so that some of them can be DLP candidates in the local elections. The opposition party, meanwhile, plans to form an election planning board this month to undertake a study, and to select and educate possible candidates for the elections. The DP will launch a committee to strengthen party organizations by replacing the chairmen of its local branches and taking other measures. The DP is slated to convene a national convention in May 1995, but there is a possibility that it could be called sooner as a result of competition for the national leadership prior to the convention. In this connection, Chairman Yi Ki-taek's private political group plans to complete a nationwide organization by the end of next month before beginning active recruitment for support of the leader. Among Yi's challengers are Rep. Kim Won-ki, a member of the party's Supreme Council, and Rep. Chong Tae-chol. both plan to campaign for support regardless of when the national convention is held, according to DP sources. But the DP believes that it is undesirable to enter the preparatory stage for local elections at this time as it is trying to force the National Assembly to convene an extraordinary session in January. Nevertheless, the party is quietly proceeding with plans to select candidates for local elections and educate them while developing party strategies, the sources said.
