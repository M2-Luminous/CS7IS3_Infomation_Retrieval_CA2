The facility consists of two combustion turbine generators, two supplementary-fired heat recovery boilers, and an extraction/condensing steam turbine generator (STG). Steam recovered from the STG is used in the heating of hydrocarbons and the evaporation of liquid hydrocarbons for distillation and refining. The primary energy source is natural gas. The maximum net electric power production capacity of the facility is 245 MW. The certification of the facility was originally issued to Tenaska on June 3, 1992, (59 FERC ¶62,235 (1992)), and the recertification issued on November 23, 1993, (65 FERC ¶62,171 (1993)). The instant recertification is requested by the applicant to reflect a recent restructuring of the ownership of the partnership. All other facility characteristics remain unchanged as described in the previous certification and recertification.
