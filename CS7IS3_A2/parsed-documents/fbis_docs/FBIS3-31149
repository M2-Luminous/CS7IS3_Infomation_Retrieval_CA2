Mr. Arbnori is leading an Albanian parliamentary delegation which has arrived on a three-day visit here. According to the Press Centre of the Bulgarian Parliament, Mr. Arbnori told Mr. Yordanov about the structure of the Albanian Parliament and its work. It is full of bitter political struggle, but it is much better to have it inside the parliament than out in the street, he reportedly said. Mr. Yordanov elaborated on Bulgaria's efforts to attract more foreign investment. He pointed out that the political forces in Bulgaria are unanimous in their attitude to the rights and freedoms issue and explained that both Christians and Muslims have their representatives in parliament and take part in lawmaking. Mr. Arbnori expressed concern over the situation in the Balkans and the possible expansion of the conflict in former Yugoslavia to Kosovo and Macedonia. He pointed out that Albania is facing serious problems owing to the fact that only half of its population lives within the country's borders and the remaining part lives outside them. Mr. Yordanov said that the problems can only be solved on the basis of the assumption that there cannot be an ethnically clean state in the Balkans. He added that Bulgaria is willing to help maintain stability in this region. The Albanian delegation met with representatives of the four parliamentary forces: the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS, representing the ethnic Turks), and the New Union for Democracy (NSD, consisting of former members of the parliamentary SDS), to discuss home policy issues. The MP's discussed the developments of the past few years and the specifics of the transition period. Interesting coincidence was discovered in the ineptness of the shock therapy as a transition model, BSP deputy floor leader Aleksandur Marinov said after the meeting. "The Albanian delegation was interested in our stand on the land reform and particularly on the problem of production recovery, so that our country is not reduced to merely a market for imported goods," he explained. Another issue which is to be discussed in the European Parliament as well is the detention of Albanian Socialist Party leader Fatos Nano, who will probably be stripped of his parliamentary immunity. "We believe that such repressive acts, regardless of their motives, are harmful to the democratic process," Mr. Marinov pointed out. The Albanian delegation answered that the detention of Fatos Nano has nothing to do with political motives, as he is facing criminal charges. "We discussed the situation in the Balkans and shared the stand that all Balkan states should stick to the principle of non-intervention in the Yugo-conflict," Mr. Marinov added. "Naturally, we could not discuss the problem about Kosovo," he concluded. SDS floor leader Stefan Savov told the Albanian delegation about the political realignment in Bulgaria's parliament and voiced his concern about the recommunization trends (passage of reform-blocking acts and political dismissals of SDS members), the Parliamentary Press Centre reported after the meeting. Mr. Savov suggested that the regional problems could be solved by erasing borders in the Balkans rather than by redrawing them. Mr. Arbnori approved of this stand but he pointed out that until that happens, Albania will protect the rights of Albanian minorities abroad. Later today the Albanian delegation met with representatives of the parliamentary Movement for Rights and Freedoms. "We discussed the situation in the Balkans in the context of this region's role in Europe, the world and particularly Western Europe should stop regarding the Balkans as a powder keg," DPS deputy floor leader Yunal Lyutfi said after the meeting. It was pointed out that the Balkans should become a zone of peace and good-neighbourly relations. "In both countries the process of transition is remarkably peaceful, which is a guarantee for stability in the Balkans," Mr. Lyutfi explained. "We discussed common problems concerning the legal framework of the democratic form of government and the problems of Albanians in former Yugoslavia," Professor Petur Markov said after the parliamentary New Union for Democracy met with the Albanian delegation.
