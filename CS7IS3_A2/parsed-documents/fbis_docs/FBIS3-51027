These individuals arrived yesterday [as heard] from that area, after they were released; in addition, 60 others who were held hostage at the Social Security Hospital in that area were also released. They all said they were held against their will. Relatives of the doctors and nurses who could not leave the town since 30 December were also accompanying them. Apparently, that area is still under rebel control. It is expected that the situation here will be normalized very soon, within a few hours or days, as the rebels will withdraw to the highlands in Chiapas.
