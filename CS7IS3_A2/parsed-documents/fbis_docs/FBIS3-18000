Estonian authorities in Paldiski registered 4,576 people by March 26. Civilians, with the exclusion of minors, numbered 3,684; the remaining 892 were servicemen. Tikk claimed the majority of the town's residents turned up for registration. Population Minister Peeter Olesk voiced the opinion that the greater part of the people who failed to register themselves were those who were absent from the town during the registration. Tikk said Estonian authorities received on Tuesday the data about the Russian military who live in Paldiski but serve at the Tallinn base of the Baltic Fleet. The list comprised 69 names, he said. "We still haven't got a list of Russian servicemen who serve in the Tallinn-based 144th motorized rifle division but live in Paldiski," the government representative noted. The registration of Paldiski's residents passed without any particular incidents, Tikk said. It will be followed up by analysis of the forms the residents filled in. The authorities also intend to find out the origin of forged documents that the registration brought to light. [passage omitted]
