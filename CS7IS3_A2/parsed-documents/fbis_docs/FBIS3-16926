This was said by a Federation Council deputy, a leader of the Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc, Yuriy Boldyrev, at a press conference in St. Petersburg on Friday. The Federation Council did not raise the issue on violation of the Constitution by the president since 54 percent of the Federation Council's deputies are also employees of other legislative bodies, Deputy Boldyrev suggested. According to Deputy Boldyrev, the freeing of Former Vice President Rutskoy and Former Parliament's Speaker Khasbulatov from the Lefortovo prison was in the interests of the president's team. Boldyrev suggested that while in prison they had been regarded as victims and that it would be much more difficult for them to maintain their authority when free. Deputy Boldyrev condemned the State Duma's resolution on economic amnesty. He said no amnesty was needed to free people whose actions were today not considered criminal. The appropriate provision in the Criminal Code would be sufficient for this, he added. "Those who abused their powers are now also freed due to the economic amnesty," Deputy Boldyrev said. He stressed that the amnesty would not lay the foundation for civil accord.
