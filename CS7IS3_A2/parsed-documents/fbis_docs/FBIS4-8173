The capital investment projects required for their modernization will amount to $3-3.5 million. If we fail to find enough money to finance these, it is possible that the entire petroleum refining industry will have to be liquidated. The refineries themselves should be able to produce a significant share of the funds. Modernization is a much more urgent priority for this sector of the economy than ownership transformations. This view is shared by the leadership teams heading our industry sectors. An intersectoral group set up by the prime minister will elaborate a project of restructuring the petroleum-extracting and -refining industry, which is expected to require about 100 trillion zlotys [Z]. Experts believe that the banks, together with petroleum refineries, which at present make profits on the order of 15 percent, will be able to produce this sum over the next few years. There is no shortage of opinions claiming that, if the petroleum sector were to be privatized, the budget's losses would overtake the revenues from the sale of selected elements of this industry to foreign concerns. Only partial privatization would be considered. The state does not intend to willingly relinquish control over the fuels market and its development strategy. Foreign concerns are not particularly interested in participating in the modernization of Polish petroleum refineries. They find the prospect of taking over our fuel market a much more attractive proposition. The Central Agency for Petroleum Products remains the largest purveyor of fuels in Poland, selling them at 1,370 gas stations throughout the country. Private distributors sell much less gas, despite the fact that they have as many as 2,500 gas stations. Foreign petroleum concerns invest increasingly large sums of money in the development of the retail distribution network. Recently, 16 large fuel stations were built by foreign petroleum companies, including three by Esso and six by the Neste concern. The U.S. petroleum concern Conoco is very active in Poland. To date, it has built four fuel stations in Poland. A fifth station is currently being built in Radom, and the construction of another three--in Czechowice-Dziedzice, Tychy, and Lublin--is to be launched in the next few weeks. The Conoco concern has already invested some $7 million in the expansion of its retail distribution network in Poland.
