Although every event has its own specific backdrop and the causes for it cannot be lumped together, just as an insider said: Apart from their specific backdrops, these tightening-up phenomena are inseparable from the macroclimate of China's current political environment. Historical experiences have proven that tightening up of the overall climate is enough to make things that could have been handled in a relaxed manner rigid. How the higher echelons of the CPC leadership judge changes in the situation is an important factor in whether the macroclimate is tightened up or relaxed. So, what made the higher echelons of the CPC leadership think that the recent situation was worsening and regard it as necessary to tighten up? According to the insider's analysis, a single factor was not enough to worry the higher echelons of the CPC leadership. What made them nervous was the multiplying of factors they deemed anything but reassuring and the simultaneous existence or worsening of those factors. It is revealed that the factors include the following: Intellectuals' Free Discussion Becomes a Focus of Attention 1. The political factor: --Deng Xiaoping's health is a cause for the concern of all sides in society. --The fifth anniversary of the 4 June incident is approaching. People attach special attention to every "five-year" or "10-year" date. It is learned that in February this year, a number of persons regarded as sensitive gathered in an open place near the Beijing Nationality Hotel, chatting about recent developments and current affairs. The authorities became nervous because they regarded the meeting, which was originally an idle-talk gathering, as being the same in nature as the "Beijing Hotel conference" in which the intellectuals rose in revolt in 1989. Moreover, word circulated from the authorities' inner circles that the information they had gathered revealed that some people were planning "some action" during the fifth anniversary of the 4 June incident. This made them feel more disturbed. --As Deng Xiaoping's health is declining, all forces are racing against time to consolidate themselves. Therefore, they all need "stability" both internationally and domestically and thus agree to tighten up. 2. The economic factor. 3. The social factor: --What most worries the CPC is that the workers' and peasants' sentiments are unsecured. There are indications that some workers' movements have been integrated with the intellectuals. Last year the government discovered for the first time that when studying the reasons for the failure of the pro-democracy movement of 1989, some people concluded that it "failed to integrate with the workers and peasants." This year, this momentum has become increasingly clear and underground trade unions have become more and more active, thus making the authorities become more nervous. --The public security situation and corruption have drastically deteriorated, becoming a hidden crisis for social unrest. The most cohesive and appealing call during the pro-democracy movement of 1989 was to "struggle against corruption." Recently, the higher echelons of the CPC leadership have been studying four or five corruption cases of cadres at the vice-ministerial level, one of which involved a vice minister of power industry. When announcing such cases, the CPC confined itself just to the case of Li Xiaoshi, vice minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, and kept the others secret. The Chinese authorities have set up an "Anticorruption Bureau" under the procuratorate with additional manpower and necessary facilities to replace the former "Economic Supervision Department." Nevertheless, in the last six months, the higher echelons of the CPC leadership unexpectedly discovered that the procuratorates and the courts also "competed with each other for business." The procuratorates held up and reached conclusions on 40 percent of the cases which ought to be handled by the courts, because they could proportionately retain "case-handling fees" by so doing and the litigants had to pay "business-trip allowances." In this way, the impartiality of the law is bound to be reduced significantly and popular discontent can be found almost everywhere. --Social unrest generated by a fall in the standard of living is a time bomb which the CPC carefully guards against. An Additional 130,000 Personnel Are Employed To Carry Out the "Severe Crackdown" Drive The insider stated that the abovementioned factors played a certain role in the efforts of the CPC to tighten up recently. Political and economic factors are, more often than not, a latent crisis, while social factors are an "igniter." This being the case, the CPC will not make any concessions on political and human rights issues. Otherwise, domestic and overseas forces will form a united front against it. It has to adopt a "severe crackdown" stand on the public security issue. (Of the serious cases which constituted 25 percent of the national total in the first quarter of this year, quite a lot were cases "cracked" by the authorities so as to reduce others to submission.) If no "severe crackdown" is carried out, there will be instability in the grass-roots units. On the issue of integration of the workers movement and the pro-democracy movement, tremendous forces should be employed against it even more. Otherwise, the ruling foundations will be shaken. Therefore, in February this year, the higher echelons of the CPC leadership dispatched personnel to conduct a social investigation to discover the possibility and degree of "popular disorder." Later, they conducted similar investigations on a greater scale in March in northeast China, northwest China, Hunan and Hubei, and Shanghai, with a view to conducting such activities in selected localities with different setups. The investigation results showed: "Destabilizing factors are numerous." Then they urgently worked on countermeasures. At the meeting of the Political Bureau in early March, they unanimously agreed "to try every possible means to keep the situation stable and under control." Things that could have been handled in a relaxed manner should now be handled carefully and tight restrictions should be imposed if necessary. The higher echelons of the CPC leadership have thus decided to provide an additional 130,000 personnel to local public security organs, procuratorial organs, and courts so as to strengthen their work. (When launching the "severe crackdown" drive in 1984, the public security organs, procuratorial organs, and courts received a boost of 200,000 personnel. The current one is the second-largest one-time boost in personnel ever seen.) Zhu Rongji ordered the allocation of 500 million yuan as a relief fund for "those in exceptionally great difficulties." On 5 April (the commemoration day for the Tiananmen incident), Jiang Zemin called together military leaders in Beijing and urged them to make preparations to avoid popular disorder. He said: "Public security organs, procuratorial organs, and courts have coordinated their activities."
