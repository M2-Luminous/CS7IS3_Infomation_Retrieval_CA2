The bulk of the emigrants are bound for Israel, Germany, and the United States. However, whereas in 1990 the bulk of migrants went to Israel, at present Germany is the leading recipient of emigrants from Russia. There has been a large-scale exodus of Germans, Jews, Meskhetian Turks, and Greeks in evidence for a number of years now, but the increase in the proportion of Russians among the emigrants is quite a new phenomenon. The migration of families is the dominant form of emigration and the demographic composition is close to that of the population of Russia: The proportions of pensioners and dependents in the population and among emigrants are approximately equal. The proportion of white-collar workers stands out significantly in the social composition of people leaving Russia -- they constitute more than one-third of the total number of emigrants. This alarming figure reflects the process of the "brain drain" from fundamental science and the defense complex in Russia. However, it must be noted that the level of migration from Russia is lower than from the neighboring foreign countries. For example, although the population of the Russian Federation constitutes a little over one-half of the population of the former USSR, the proportion of emigrants from Russia represents little more than one-fourth of the total emigration figure. The tide of refugees, enforced migrants, and economic migrants from the former union republics into Russia could soon reach 6 million people. If the processes of destabilization in the former union republics ease, the number of potential migrants could be expected to be in the 2-3 million range. However, if there is a further worsening of the sociopolitical situation and the economic crisis and a broadening of the geographical spread of interethnic conflicts and discrimination against nonindigenous peoples, specialists of the Federal Migration Service believe that the potential tide of migrants could at least double and reach 4-6 million. According to Tatyana Regent, leader of the Federal Migration Service, "the Russian migration service has the capacity to receive, place, and accommodate even such a significant influx of refugees." But for that it is necessary to resolve some financial problems: Given the acute shortage of state funds for the implementation of a large-scale program for the reception of migrants from the former union republics, it is necessary to attract resources from extrabudgetary sources.
