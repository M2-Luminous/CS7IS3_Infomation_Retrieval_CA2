A spokesman of the Chinese delegation urged the congress to withdraw the motion on the Tibet issue. The spokesman pointed out: The motion put forward by Australia's Champaign Institute is a purely political one, which describes Tibet as "a country" and also incites Tibetan independence. This constitutes open interference and infringement of China's sovereignty and a violation of international law. As everyone knows, Tibet is an inalienable part of the sacred territory of China. The formulation of "rapid damage to the natural ecology in Tibet" is contrary to fact. A host of facts illustrate that Tibet achieves success in preserving forest and wildlife. The demand of the Chinese delegation was supported by some countries.
