FR940621-1-00025 FR940621-1-00007 The public hearing on the Service's proposal to list the Alabama sturgeon as an endangered species with critical habitat was scheduled for August 31, 1993, in Mobile, Alabama. The comment period remained open until October 13, 1993. A notice of the hearing was published in the Federal Register on July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40109), and a legal notice was published in the Birmingham News on August 1, 1993. This public hearing was subsequently canceled at the request of some members of the Alabama Congressional delegation. A cancellation notice was published in the Federal Register on August 24, 1993 (58 FR 44643), and legal notices were published in the Birmingham News on August 29, 1993; the Montgomery Advertiser on August 29, 1993; and the Clarion Ledger on August 27, 1993. The public hearing on this proposal was rescheduled for October 4, 1993, at the William K. Weaver Hall Auditorium on the campus of Mobile College, Mobile, Alabama. The comment period remained open until October 13, 1993. A notice of the hearing and extension of the comment period was published in the Federal Register on September 13, 1993 (58 FR 47851). Due to the tremendous interest in this issue, a large number of people who came to the October 4, 1993, hearing had to be turned away due to space constraints. Although neither the Act nor the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) required that a second hearing be held, the Service decided that it was in the best interest of all concerned parties that they have an opportunity to comment on issues raised by the Alabama sturgeon proposed rule. Therefore, an additional public hearing was scheduled in Montgomery, Alabama, on November 15, 1993, to allow for additional comments from the interested public. A notice of the second hearing, reopening of the comment period (from October 25, 1993, to December 8, 1993), and notice of availability of a scientific panel report was published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 55036). Legal notices for this second hearing appeared in the Birmingham News on October 26, 1993; the Mobile Press-Register on October 24, 1993; the Montgomery Advertiser on October 29, 1993; and the Clarion Ledger on October 29, 1993. The scientific panel report was prepared by ichthyologists to specifically review three issues: (1) Examine the taxonomy of the sturgeon, (2) comment on the likely existence of the fish based on available data, and (3) make suggestions as to what information would be necessary to conclude that the taxon is likely extinct. The November 15, 1993, hearing was canceled in response to a preliminary injunction issued on November 9, 1993. The timing of the injunction gave the Service insufficient time to publish public hearing notices of cancellation in either the Federal Register or area newspapers. A second public hearing notice appeared in the Federal Register (59 FR 289) dated January 4, 1994. The hearing was scheduled for January 13, 1994, and the comment period was extended through January 31, 1994. Legal notices for this rescheduled hearing were published in the Birmingham News on December 26, 1993; the Mobile Press-Register on December 26, 1993; the Montgomery Advertiser on December 27, 1993; and the Clarion Ledger on December 28, 1993. As outlined in the January 4, 1994, Federal Register notice, the preliminary injunction restrained the Service and others from: (1) Disseminating the scientific panel report to the public and (2) utilizing or relying upon the scientific panel report or any product of the experts' deliberations in connection with the decision-making process on the proposal to list the Alabama sturgeon and designate its critical habitat. The January 4, 1994, notice also referred to another court order issued December 22, providing, in most relevant part, as follows: Federal defendants and defendant-intervener, and those acting in active concert with them, are hereby permanently enjoined from publishing, employing and relying upon the advisory Committee report .␣.␣. for any purpose whatsoever, directly or indirectly, in the process of determining whether to list the Alabama sturgeon as an endangered species. In a notice appearing in the Federal Register (59 FR 997) on January 7, 1994, the January 13, 1994, public hearing was canceled and rescheduled for January 31, 1994, at South Hall # 1. Montgomery Civic Center, Montgomery, Alabama. The comment period was extended to February 15, 1994. Cancellation of the second public hearing was made to provide more notice of the hearing to the public. Legal notices for the rescheduled public hearing appeared on January 19, 1994, in four area newspapers: the Birmingham News, Mobile Press-Register, Montgomery Advertiser, and Clarion Ledger. Mention was also made in this notice that, in keeping with the court restrictions issued in Alabama-Tombigbee River Development Coalition (Coalition) v. Fish and Wildlife Service, Civ. No. 93&hyph;AR&hyph;2322&hyph;S, the Service considered itself compelled to enforce the following constraints on the submission of oral and written comments while the court restrictions remained in effect: (1) Individuals or organizations could not refer to the scientific report or to any drafts or other products derived from the preparation of that report in presenting any oral statement or written comment and (2) individuals or organizations could not attempt to bolster their oral or written comments or opinions by referring to the scientific report as authority. Therefore, the Departmental hearing officer at the next hearing was authorized to terminate the opportunity to speak of any person making a statement if, in the judgment of the hearing officer, that person disregarded the instructions not to address the scientific report or its contents. Written comments or materials which contained information that violated the above restrictions would be marked and thereafter excluded from the administrative record while the court restrictions remained in effect.
