Analysis of the Reasons for Inaccuracy in Population Statistics and Regularity of Family Planning Statistics There are many reasons for the inaccuracy in population statistics and in the regularity of family planning statistics. Some are due to the statistics themselves, but others are due to non-statistical aspects. For a clear analysis of the reasons for the inaccuracy of population statistics in relation to the regularity of family planning statistics, we shall here distinguish, according to whether the errors are man-made and intentional, between unintentional and intentional errors. A. Unintentional Errors Unintentional errors are then those that are not man-made and not intentionally caused by human action. This kind of error may be due to statistical or also due to non-statistical causes. The following are some circumstances that generally cause such errors: 1. One of the major reasons for statistical omissions and reporting errors are the disfunctional conditions of basic statistical recording and in card management. Some regions have not yet set up basic statistical records and cards. Others, that have already set up statistical records and cards, are disorderly in keeping these records, or, having set them up once, neglect keeping them up-to-date. These records will then be as at a standstill and useless. In some cases they are also not kept properly classified by items. 2. Inappropriate statistics organization, incompetent statistics personnel. Statistical work requires a statistical organization and statistical personnel at six levels, namely at the state, provincial, prefectural, county, town, and village levels. At present, many localities do not fulfill these basic requirements. Below the town level there is on the whole no full time statistical personnel, and statistical affairs are taken care of concurrently by cadres in charge of family planning, or by people who are not released from production or other duties. Most of these people are poorly educated, they have also generally not received the necessary training and are hardly fit for what is a fairly complicated job. 3. Lack of a scientific and rational system of population and family planning indices. Certain indices which should not be included within the scope of family planning, are listed as important indices in some localities. For instance, it is for the civil administration or the public security agencies to register divorces, deaths of spouses, and remarriages, while family planning work is mainly to guide people to reproduce according to plan. Besides, there are large differences between different localities in some indices concerning the same matter. For instance, for the index to show multiple births, what are actually used are indices called rate of multiple children, extra-plan multiple children, number of extra-plan pregnancies, number of multiple children, etc. Furthermore, the rate of plan-conforming childbirths are given different meanings. Some places take as plan-conforming childbirths those that have been arranged for according to the present year's plan and for which childbirth certificates have been issued, while others take as plan-conforming births those that conform with the state and local family planning plans. Others again consider the first childbirth at mature age and the second childbirth permitted by state policy, that conform to the plan, as plan-conforming childbirths. These differences make comparisons between districts very difficult and at the same time hinder examination and checking of indices at the various localities. 4. Statistical methods and methods of checking the quality of statistics are comparatively backward. Registration of original data and much of the summarizing of statistical data from all levels below the provinces (municipalities), prefectures, and counties are carried out by hand, and the original records at many places are not taken down whenever events happen, but are done in a rush at the end of the month. It is very easy for mistakes in recording and summarizing to occur in this manner. There is also no efficient method for an effective check of the quality of the statistical data, and any examination and supervision of the quality of the statistical data will therefore hardly help control statistical errors. 5. Leading cadres in charge of family planning at all levels and personnel engaged in family planning work are still not yet fully aware of the important meaning of population statistics as related to the regularity of family planning statistics, and they do not attach sufficient importance to the quality of regularity statistics. These too are important reasons for the untruthfulness of statistics. There is also the fact that the "Law Governing Statistics" has not been seriously implemented. There is a law, but it is being disregarded, and as a result the law concerning population regularity statistics cannot fully exert its efficacy. B. Intentional Errors Intentional errors are man-made and purposely created errors. They have to do with the ideological and moral qualities of persons, and are not due to the statistics in themselves. They generally comprise the following kinds: 1. Due to the comparatively serious social, economic, and educational backwardness in China's rural areas, the desires of many peasants with regard to childbirths are not in conformity with what government policy demands. As a consequence, an excessive population is being created in violation of government policy on planned childbirths. To evade punishment, the peasants will conceal facts by every possible means. Personnel in charge of family planning work will thus be left ignorant of the true situation and will submit incomplete reports. 2. Family planning statistics at the basic level in the rural areas are in general prepared concurrently by cadres in charge of family planning. In order to ensure fulfillment of the plan handed down by higher authority, and in order to get credited with good achievements, these cadres will conceal some facts and omit them from their reports. In actual work situations, there are in general two circumstances that will have basic level personnel in charge of statistics intentionally submit incomplete reports. One is that work at the basic level is of poor quality, that great difficulties are encountered, and that it is impossible to fulfill the plan, or that some higher ranking family planning department, to retain some extra margin within the plan norms at its own level, when distributing population plan norms, will retain a margin for itself at every level, thus making basic plan norms excessively high and tight, to satisfy the plan, and will then intentionally compile incomplete reports to evade responsibility. The other kind is the effect of unhealthy tendencies in society and consists of the intentional omission of registrations in order to be credited with better achievements. 3. Some cadres in charge of implementing government policy or some leading cadres, especially those at the village level, are affected by unhealthy tendencies and submit false reports of achievements. It was particularly after it was pointed out in the "Resolution on Strengthening Family Planning Work and on Strict Control of Population Growth," passed May 1991 by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council: "We shall make effective family planning work and fulfillment of population plans important indices in the assessment of official achievements of party committees and governments at all levels," that family planning work could be "one count against" in the assessment of an agency's achievements. Thus, population as related with family planning became of crucial importance in the assessment of governments and of the achievements in the official careers of major leading cadres at all levels, which would then also be critical for their promotions or demotions. Some leading cadres of less than perfect character would then resort to deception and falsify or forge statistical data. This is the main reason for intentional false reports. The above-mentioned three kinds of intentional false reports are usually interrelated and made use of together. Because incomplete and false reports occur at the three levels, namely with individuals among the general public, with statistics personnel, and with leading cadres, taking all these together, the intentional false reports have become the primary cause for the inaccuracy of population statistics as related to family planning statistics. At the same time, their joint occurrence has the effect of increasing the obstruction against the elimination of false reports and of increasing the difficulties of such efforts. [passage omitted]
