We also wish to warn certain elements, which are exacerbating this situation by attacking members of opposition parties or Tutsis. By this we mean that at this moment, Rwandans are being persecuted, or perhaps even killed, because of their political or ethnic affiliations. These acts of violence are mainly attributed to sections of the Presidential Guard, who are backed by government soldiers. To safeguard the peace process initiated in our country, all these acts of violence must cease immediately. This is the only effective means of resolving Rwanda's problems. Every kidnapped individual and his family must be released immediately. If these demands are not met, or if the relevant authorities fail to get the situation under control, the RPF and its army will be compelled to take all necessary steps to carry out a sacred duty -- that of protecting the country's innocent citizens. We hope that reason will prevail over passion and that everyone will realize that neither violence nor war can help us solve Rwanda's problems.
