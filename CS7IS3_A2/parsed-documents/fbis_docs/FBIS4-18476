Lord Owen of the European Union and Thorvald Stoltenberg of the United Nations will axe the posts of two Swedish military advisers. It is also unlikely that spokesman John Mills will still be in his job after the end of the month. Diplomats said two United Nations Protection Force [UNPROFOR] liaison officers may soon be recalled from Geneva. A decision will ultimately have to be made by French General Bertrand de Lapresle, UNPROFOR chief commander in Croatia. "There is no political determination to do away with the conference," said a European diplomat who declined to be identified, but peace mediators are aware of the fact that the Geneva talks are suspended for the time being. Parties to the conference -- Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Moslem government officials -- last broke up on February 12 after no progress was made in three days of talks on the makeup of three ethnic states in Bosnia-Herzegovina. But since that date negotiations held under the auspices of the United States and Russia have ended Serb shelling of Sarajevo, settled the territorial dispute between Bosnian Croats and Moslems, and yielded a ceasefire accord between Croatia and Croat Serb separatists. Geneva conference working groups on ethnic minorities and on economic issues have not met for some time.
