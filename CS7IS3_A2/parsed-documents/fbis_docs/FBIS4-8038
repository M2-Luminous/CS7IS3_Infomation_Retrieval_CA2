They decided that decisions concerning wages would be made by company directors, employees' councils, and trade unions. Thus, we partially returned to socialism. The prime minister must again appeal to work forces and to the responsibility of managers. I believe that there are two solutions to this problem: first, returning to a new popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] as soon as possible, and second, changing the system of most state-run enterprises, establishing a one-person Treasury partnership, and privatization. The first method has proved itself. However, the fear of a new popiwek law may result in wage panic today, not to mention high inflation. The other method calls for some time. It may also encounter political resistance because not everyone in Poland supports privatization and modernization of oversized economic companies. Each of these scenarios is to a certain extent risky. It seems, however, that safer is the "escape forward"--that is, acceleration of the pace of economic reforms. This calls for specific decisions already today. Also, the work forces of state-owned companies should be told what they will go through soon--for example, that there will be no popiwek, but there will be bankruptcies. Or that not only the rights of various sectors of our economy will be equalized, but also their duties toward the Treasury.
