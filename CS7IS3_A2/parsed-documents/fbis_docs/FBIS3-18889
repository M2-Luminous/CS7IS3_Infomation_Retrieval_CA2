The report showed how of the 15,309 ships identified in the operation, most in the Otranto Channel or off the coast of Montenegro, 1,237 were bordered and inspected while 314 were re-routed to Italian ports in the Puglia region for a more in-depth inspection. The Operation Sharp Guard report was given here by the deputy commander of the operation, Italian Admiral Gianfranco Coviello, and the commander of WEU naval forces, Rear-Admiral Elio Bolongaro, onboard the frigate "Zeffiro." In their report, the commanders underscored how the patrolling has interrupted all sea commerce for Montenegro, although, Coviello admitted, "we missed a few speedboats which could only carry small cargo." Each day an average of 60 ships, excluding ferries, are identified by the nine NATO-WEU ships assigned on patrol, out of a total fleet of 21 ships. The operation also employs a significant number of aircraft in its operations. Once the ships have been identified and, if necessary, inspected, as is the case for ships en route to Slovenia or Croatia, they are then monitored by radar to verify that they arrive at their declared port of destination as stated in the ship's manifest. In the event that the final port not be clear or control of the cargo difficult, such as with seal containers, then the ship is diverted to an Italian port for inspection. It was recalled during today's review how Operation Sharp Guard was the consequence of United Nations sanctions with the aim of coordinating, under a single command, the parallel operation of NATO and the WEU for a better rationalization of forces. Of the 21 ships taking part in the operation five are from the WEU: the Italian ships "Zeffiro", to be now replaced with the frigate "Lupo", and the "Alpino", the "Cataluna" of Spain and the French vessels "Cassard" and "D'Estienne D'Orves."
