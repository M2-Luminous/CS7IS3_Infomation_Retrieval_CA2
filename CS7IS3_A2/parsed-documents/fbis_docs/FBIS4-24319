A series of [word indistinct] activities, with the backing of the local BBC correspondent -- who is an ECOMOG paid agent in Monrovia -- sent panicky waves of fear in Monrovia and elsewhere of an imminent war, despite calls for the cessation of all hostilities in the country. The exposure of the Nigerian complicity in aiding and abetting splinter armed groups in Liberia, particularly, the Liberian Peace Council and one of ULIMO's [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] factions, has led to harsh international criticisms and demands by local interest and pressure groups for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG from Liberia.
