According to Bambis Papapanayiotis in the 25-26 December center-left Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA, newly elected ND leader Miltiadhis Evert is presently faced with "pressure groups" within his party, each "pushing in a different direction." Background maneuvering focuses on Evert's dilemma of either practicing a low-key, constructive opposition vis-a-vis the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government, or following a hardline policy that may lead to serious confrontation. At this time, Papapanayiotis contends, Evert is trying to maintain an "acrobatic" equilibrium between the two versions, and is called upon to deal with: -- Pressure from the group still faithful to former Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis--now in difficult straits because of the wiretapping affair during his watch. The group knows that the more conflicting the relationship with the government, the more protection will be accorded to Mitsotakis in case of legal entanglements, Papapanayiotis contends. Members of this group include ND luminaries such as Sotiris Kouvelas, Stefanos Manos, Vasilis Manginas, Dora Bakoyianni, Nikolaos Gelestathis, and Y. Dhimitrokallis. -- Pressure from the "modernizers," who are Evert's "natural allies" but insist on an immediate break with the ND's "Mitsotakian past" to regain the party's lost traditional adherents. The group includes ND officials such as Yeoryios Souflias, Stavros Dhimas, S. Khatzigakis, and Athanasios Kanellopoulos, who, according to Papapanayiotis, "agonize" over losing "precious" time in the modernization effort. -- Pressure from the advocates of a liberal, free market economy led by Andreas Andrianopoulos, who is requesting a clarification of the party's ideology and political goals. -- Finally, pressure from those "generally dissatisfied," such as Mikhail Papakonstandinou, recently stripped of party attributes. Within this "cacophony," Evert is attempting a balancing act that aims at "hard criticism for governmental handling of institutional matters or reprisals against ND members, but low-key, constructive opposition with proposals in the legislative field," Papapanayiotis concludes. According to the 30 December left-of-center Athens daily TA NEA, Evert has resolved to ignore ND hardliners demanding an immediate confrontation with PASOK. He feels that his consensual policy and creative proposals will "sooner or later" be appreciated by the great majority of the electorate. His conviction stems from the results of recent polls showing that people are tired of "confrontation for the sake of confrontation," TA NEA notes.
