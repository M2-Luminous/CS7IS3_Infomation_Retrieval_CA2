According to him, the arms plant achieved quite extraordinary growth last year in the volume of the sales of its products: growth of 140 percent, compared with 1992, which amounts to almost Kc940 million. Director Janeba said that the biggest customer last year (and will also be this year) was the Turkish Police Force, which purchased CZ 75 pistols. The Lithuanian Interior Ministry is another major foreign partner. "So far, the Czech Armed Forces have not made a binding order for our products; nevertheless, we anticipate that they will become an important partner when the concept for their armament has been drafted," said Janeba. The Austrian companies A. Kind and Sarnitz, the German Frankonia company, and a series of other companies from France, the United States, Israel, Poland, and Hungary are among the arms plant's most important partners in the civilian market. According to the commercial director, in 1994 the Czech Arms Plant will be oriented, from the point of view of exports, toward the arms markets in Turkey and the United States. The plant's most sought-after products include the CZ 75 pistols and the CZ 85 9-mm Luger pistol, whose price on the U.S. market, for example, is approximately $500. "According to the trends in the price of its shares, the Czech Arms Plant is one of the better valued engineering enterprises, so it will be interesting for the second wave of coupon privatization," says Janeba. The nominal value of a single Czech Arms Plant share rose to Kc3,885 at the most recent session of the stock market on 17 February. The company was privatized to a considerable extent in the first wave; of course, there are still 22.5 percent of the shares left for the second wave. These shares are owned by the National Property Fund.
