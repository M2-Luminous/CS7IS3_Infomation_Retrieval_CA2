Declaring that ideology can never be bound in chain, the analyst says: Some time ago, the puppet Kwangju District Court passed prison terms on five students of Chonnam National University who had studied the chuche idea. Kim Yong-sam, who ruthlessly tramples upon the freedom of the choice of ideology and quest of truth, while advertising "civilian politics," is a political hooligan and tyrant not different in the least from the preceding military dictators. His group is trying to keep off the attraction of the great chuche idea and incite North-South confrontation, resorting to bayonet. But it is a foolish act. The more frantic Kim Yong-sam gets in brandishing the bayonet, the stronger the resistance of the people will grow and the clearer it will reveal to the world its ignorance and incompetency as a ruler without a philosophy worthy of being followed by the people. The puppets must guarantee the people the freedom of choice of ideology and the quest of truth and release the illegally arrested students.
