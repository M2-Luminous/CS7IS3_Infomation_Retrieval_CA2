The uranium epic is one of these. In the late 40's and early 50's, it grew to be the meaning of work and of life, and if you will, even the fate of a whole generation, thousands and thousands of people who were later called atomshchiki. The story of the production of uranium for the atomic bomb preserves the names of talented and brave people, victors in a duel with the dangerous unknown and with uncertainty. The events and the documents I want to talk about help us to understand the times and the task, and along with that, also the people who accomplished it. To some this may seem a boring, harsh, functional chronicle. So be it. But it is interesting and exciting, and it seems to me not just for history, but also for today. In general, everything associated with atomic weapons is reminiscent of a detective novel: Tension and dynamics of action, critical situations, suspicions, mysterious codes, puzzles, and questions. The Starting Point August 17, 1945. On this memorable day for the People's Commissar of Munitions, Boris Lvovich Vannikov (a Friday), Stalin summoned him and asked how much time was needed to develop an atomic bomb. Vannikov was evasive. "I think," he began, but then, glancing at the morose face of the generalissimo, he continued resolutely, "I can't say." "Yes, you're right," Stalin nodded. "But that means we have to hurry." The clock of fortune of many scientists, designers, and construction engineers was started that day, and began ticking. But then, purposeful work had been started even earlier at Kurchatov's Laboratory No 2 (codename LIPAN -- Laboratory of Measurement Instruments of the Academy of Sciences). Before Hiroshima and Nagasaki, however, the physicists had no serious external incentives. After a talk with Stalin, Vannikov met with Kurchatov. The talk lasted for more than three hours, and as early as September 5, 6 and 10, "closed" conferences were held at the laboratory, to which a narrow circle of scientists was invited. I.V. Kurchatov, G.N. Flerov, A.I. Alikhanov, I.K. Kikoin, P.L. Kapitsa, L.A. Artsimovich, A.F. Ioffe, and A.P. Aleksandrov reported on the "status of scientific research and practical work in the field of utilization of atomic energy." At that time the number-one task was set, to select the optimal method of "separating isotopes" to produce enriched uranium. The 37-year-old professor Kikoin was appointed project director. Stalin made Vannikov the coordinator for development of the new field. By all appearances, there were two reasons. The first was that Stalin trusted Vannikov. The second was that the leader feared that the methods of Beria in this case might not work. For that reason, while making the head of the NKVD the "problem chief," he gave a lot of authority to Vannikov. Soon the First Main Directorate (PGU), "Atomic," was established in the Sovnarkom [Council of People's Commissars]. Today, when possible deadlines for development of something new are discussed, they are given in years. Then the count was in days, weeks, months. To speed up the design workups and for the transition to serial production of special equipment for the uranium project, two major defense plants were brought in: The Leningrad Kirov (formerly "Putilovskiy") Plant, which in the war produced heavy tanks and turbines, and the Gorky Machine-Building Plant, where they made artillery weapons. Of course these were monster plants, where thousands of highly qualified engineers and blue-collar workers toiled. But they did not have the slightest idea of gas-diffusion machinery, especially since at that time the machines themselves were a "complete unknown" for many physicists, as is evident from the documents. An Imported Wind At this point, when a painstaking selection of the way to "separate isotopes" was under way, a book by Professor G.D. Smith appeared in the U.S., "Atomic Energy for Military Purposes." It also had a second, more intriguing name: "Official Report on the Development of the Atomic Bomb Under the Supervision of the U.S. Government." Via intelligence channels the book was immediately sent to Moscow and translated. Interest in the unusual publication was even stronger because the author was an active participant in the "Manhattan Project." The book was studied most carefully at Laboratory No 2. The suspicion arose: Might this be "disinformation?" Before Hiroshima and Nagasaki, i.e. before August 1945, all atomic matters of the U.S. had been kept in the strictest secrecy, and now suddenly there were such revelations in September. By then, there were no special revelations. Professor Smith was sly. The scientific and technical details were submerged in the laudatory outpourings of the author, and when the logic of his discussions demanded specifics, there would be the apologetic phrase: "For reasons of secrecy, we cannot say," etc. Nonetheless, the "grain" was found, and with it the physicists received confirmation that the path they had chosen was the right one. It was clear from the text that "serious study of the diffusion method had begun in the U.S. in mid-1941," and the fact of receipt of secret information from the British was recalled, where work had been done on gas-diffusion separation in 1941-1942. So there was something behind this, especially since the Americans used enriched uranium in their bomb. Installation D-1 So it was gas diffusion. On 1 December 1 1945, a government decree was signed on the development of installation D-1 (this was the designation of the gas-diffusion plant). An area close to the village of Verkh-Neyvinsk was chosen as the construction site. This was in the Northern Urals, comparatively close to the former Sverdlovsk. In the 18th century, the famous Demidov had built a small metallurgical plant here on the bank of the Neva. There was a rail spur nearby, and an electrical transmission line, and the incomplete hulk of an aviation plant had an area of fifty thousand square meters. Most importantly, the woods concealed the then almost unpopulated region from outside eyes. The decree strictly defined the deadlines: 1948 for the start of operation of installation D-1, and 1949 for operation "of the whole plant system." The construction work was directed by General A.N. Komarovksiy (his rank was "shock defense" general). The work continued around the clock, and around 30 thousand construction workers of the MVD's Glavpromstroy [Main Directorate of Industrial Production] were involved in building the plant. Every day a report on the progress of affairs at the secret installation landed on Beria's desk. The Chief Designer of the Special Design Bureau No 1 of the Kirov Plant, Nikolay Mikhaylovich Sinev, recalls: "Today the technology for producing highly enriched uranium has been brought to perfection. But then. . . there were moments when some of the managers and designers doubted their success. The time factor was pressing. What would the diffusion plant be like, what sort of equipment was needed? At the start of 1946, no one knew exactly." In April, 1946, A.I. Churin was appointed the director of the still unbuilt plant. Before this he had worked as the chief engineer of Uralenergo [Ural Energy]. Within two years he was relieved of his post, and then after a short time returned again. But all this was later on. . . Wandering in the Labyrinth In January 1946, Professor I.N. Voznesenskiy was given the task of designing a 24-stage diffusion machine. In parallel a 30-stage variant was considered (codename "NVK"). The second project was transferred to Gorky (plant director Gen. A.S. Yelyan), where it was discarded. They began to produce finished items, and two aggregates had already been built when it became clear that this way was a dead end. Storm clouds gathered. Moscow demanded explanations. And what could they answer, if no time was given for profound development, and the trial and error method was fraught with failures? They switched to single-stage machines. But the failures kept on. Someone had the idea -- couldn't this be economic sabotage? Unable to withstand the stress and the nervous tension, Voznesenskiy died suddenly. The machines of the Gorky design bureau were codenamed "LB" (Lavrenti Beria), and later were called "OK" (special construction), while the Leningrad ones were designated by the letter "T." The entire plant complex was supposed to consist of 56 stages, 1,000 diffusion machines, an automatic control system, and auxiliary engineering services. At the start of 1948, special trains with the first items (called "reserved" trains in the traffic schedule) began to arrive at the rail yard of installation D-1. Assembly, installation and connecting in stages began. I won't try to explain the complexity of the technology for producing highly enriched uranium. Special aggregates and electrical equipment, sensitive monitors and meters, reliable automatic systems, materials resistant to the aggressive media, vacuum units, and special bearings and lubricants were required. I will only say that to produce one kilogram of uranium of the necessary concentration, it was necessary to expend 600 thousand kilowatt-hours of electricity. The bearings "broke." On thousands of machines. Their replacement required exhausting work, day and night. Suspicion of the management section of the laboratories and services increased, "voluntary informers" appeared. Work became a terrible ordeal -- that was impossible, don't touch, that's not permitted. And what was permitted, how correct was it? Everyone who was associated with installation D-1 signed non-divulgence papers and was deprived of the right to transfer to other work. The most unpleasant occurrence was in mid-1948. It was not possible to achieve a 90% concentration of uranium. The reason was decided on at once: there was a shortage of "separating potential." And a solution was found: "Finish building the technological system, and add another thousand separating stages." But how could they do this, if project D-1 had not called for such reconstruction? The Shadow of Trouble The Leningrad design bureau No 1 proposed a variant. On 17 August it was reported to Vannikov. Boris Lvovich, standing behind his people completely (the words of Academician Lt-Gen Ye.A. Gegin), approved the project, but with this stipulation: "Calculate everything again, with a reserve, we won't give additional time to correct mistakes." They calculated again. Everything worked out. They began to work, and then. . . At the end of September 1949, a special train traveled down the Moscow-Sverdlovsk road. Three passenger cars were unhitched and pushed to the Verkh-Neyvinsk region. They were parked on the railroad tracks opposite the building which housed the managers of the starting installation, who were in agony. Among the arrivals was the "problem chief," L.P. Beria, the chief of the PGU B.L. Vannikov, member of the special council General A.M. Petrosyants and others. They began to look into the causes of failure of an assignment of special state importance. Beria kept taking notes and rechecking the names of those who spoke. Vannikov's position, and the proposal on "technical finishing" from the chief designer Sinev made it possible to soften or divert the threat. However, it was not possible to avoid "organizational conclusions" and personnel changes. Deep autumn of 1949. Installation D-1 gained productive capacity (it was designed to produce just grams of uranium per day). All difficulties were seemingly past, but the concentration of "output product" did not exceed 75%, and they had to have 90%! What to do? Again the feverish search. They decided to do further enrichment at a then already operating unit in the Urals, which had been developed under the supervision of L.A. Artsimovich. It used the method of electromagnetic enrichment. The Push to the Future All the work on the uranium project was of priority importance. It was not possible to discuss every problem, and they popped up like mushrooms in the rain, at sessions of the Central Committee or Council of Ministers. The necessary decrees were prepared by members of the Special Committee, and Beria affixed Stalin's signature to them. All the same, installation D-1 did produce uranium for atomic weapons. Fifty-six stages of 7,040 machines plus other special equipment operated without failure. After the first plant, D-3, D-4 and D-5 came on line. Science-intensive industry of the 20th century was gaining force. Our first atomic bomb was tested on 27 August 1949, at 0230 hours. It had a plutonium charge. It was called RDS-1. What did this number code mean? First I thought of this expansion: "Stalin's rocket engine." Actually it was different: "Russia does it herself." I named the names of only a few out of many, by no means because their merit was any different. All of them, privates and generals, technician/trouble-shooters and chief designers, laboratory assistants and academicians, were accomplishing one task, accomplishing it together, aware that their fortunes were uncertain and belonged to the state. They had a goal and no illusions. Today, probably, there are many people for whom this chronicle will be a first revelation.
