Forestry is shouldering the great mission of improving the environment and promoting development and is playing a vital role in improving the ecology and bringing about sustained growth. Forests are major natural resources which are indispensable for human development. Judging from the above two most essential characteristics, the building of forestry involves two strategic issues: 1) As main bodies of the ecosystem on land, forests build and refine the earth's ecology and maintain the most basic conditions for subsistence of human being. 2) As a key to bringing about sustained growth, forests are of extremely momentous strategic significance to the sustained economic development of mankind, and, in particular, to the developing countries in their endeavor to extricate themselves from poverty. Soil erosion is one of the most important environmental problems faced by mankind and is therefore called a global crisis. The destruction of forest vegetation is the source that has caused serious soil erosion in the whole world. At present, the forest coverage rate throughout the world is only 25.08 percent, and one-third of the land on earth has been seriously eroded. The only way to resolve this problem is to rebuild forest vegetation all over the world. Desertification is the most serious of the 10 major environmental problems in the world. At present, 35 percent of the world's land area has already or is becoming desert, and economic losses caused by this have exceeded $40 billion a year. This means that one-third of the land on earth has lost or basically lost conditions favorable to human subsistence, and this area is constantly expanding. Therefore, extension of forest vegetation into deserts to recover the conditions for human subsistence has become one of the most important and arduous tasks faced by the entire world. Too much water causes disasters, but too little water gives rise to anxieties. The fundamental cause lies in the serious shortage of forest resources. Scientific research at home and abroad shows that forests absorb rainfall like a "sponge," stop or reduce the currents of flood water, and prolong water flow in dry seasons. Hence, forests have the dual functions of preventing floods and drought. Serious destruction of forests has damaged the genetic bank of some species. At present, there are approximately 3,956 species on the verge of extinction, 3,647 species in peril, and 7,240 species that are rare due to the sharp decrease in the number of varieties. Protection of forests, therefore, has become a major subject of maintaining diversification of living things. Serious destruction of forests is also one of the major factors leading to poverty. Currently there are approximately 250,000 babies born all over the world each day. This drastic population increase has forced people to make unrestrained demands on nature. But the deteriorating environment has made densely populated areas even poorer. At present, environmental refugees throughout the world have increased to more than 30 million, and the deterioration of the ecology has thrown impoverished countries and regions into a difficult situation in terms of environment and sustained economic development. It is thus obvious that protection of forests, development of forestry, and improvement of the ecology have become comprehensive and vital issues for humans and human society. The building of forestry in China has been seriously heeded by the party and government for a very long time. The party's Central Committee and the State Council have included afforestation and improvement of the ecology as basic national policies. Over the past 10 years or so, prominent comrades of the central authorities have taken the lead in participating in tree-planting activities as ordinary citizens every year and have set brilliant examples for the entire people. In the meantime, China has deliberately formulated and practiced a series of policies, laws, regulations, and measures in forestry, so that the building of forestry in China has entered the orbit of steady development. Through the collective efforts of the people throughout the country, China's building of forestry has undergone great historic changes. Since 1981, people taking part in voluntary activities of afforestation have exceeded 3.4 billion person-hours, and a grand total of 18 billion trees has been planted. In recent years, an area of approximately 80 million mu was afforested throughout the country each year. There are no more barren hills in Guangdong, Fujian, and Hunan now, for which these provinces have been commended by the party Central Committee and State Council. This year, some more provinces and autonomous regions will have their barren hills planted with trees. Considerable progress has been made in the construction of seven key forestry projects throughout the country so that the basic framework of ecological construction in China has taken shape. With the scope of afforestation continuously expanding, the quality has been notably enhanced too. After verification, the total area of qualified afforestation reached 285 million mu during the past five years, and the rate of acceptable quality rose from 65.6 percent in 1988 to 84.5 percent in 1992. Exhaustion of forest resources has also been effectively controlled. According to the fourth nationwide screening of forest resources between 1989 and 1993, China's forest resources have shown a tendency of steady growth. However, the tasks of building forestry in our country are still extremely arduous. On the one hand, China is still a country with very few trees, as the forest coverage rate is only 13.92 percent, which is lower than the world average, and the level of per-capita forest area is even lower. At present, there are still quite a lot of barren hills and waste land around the country which must be afforested, and vast area of desert and land becoming desert must be harnessed. On the other hand, owing to insufficient forests, problems concerning the ecology are still very grim, as one-half of the country's population, one-third of cultivated land, and major large cities are below water level along rivers in flood season so that the areas in which industrial and agricultural output value accounts for two-third of the country's total are threatened by floods. According to statistics, approximately 500 million mu of farm land have been hit by various kinds of natural calamities in China. To put an end to this situation once and for all, the most important thing is to further enhance the green ecological and environmental awareness of the entire society, vigorously intensify the construction of forests, consistently increase forest vegetation, fully exercise the role of forests as ecological shelters, and make the most of their multiple functions and effectiveness. The voices for the development of forestry are louder and louder in the contemporary world, and the demands on forestry construction for China's modernization drive are higher and higher too. As a primary mission and central element of environmental building, forestry should make contributions not only to ameliorating the ecology, but to getting rid of poverty and advancing toward a moderate prosperity for the masses in mountain areas, as well as to creating a fine investment climate and promoting the building of spiritual civilization to facilitate the endeavor of opening up to the outside world. We should persist in taking the road of building forestry with Chinese characteristics, aim at the goal of achieving high yield, fine quality, great efficiency, and sustained growth for forestry and, centering around the two major themes of reform and development, comprehensively fulfill the goal of struggle set for forestry development in the 1990's. That is, by the year 2000, all barren hills will be basically planted with trees in 21 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, and the forest coverage rate across the country will reach approximately 15.3 percent. Besides, the country's total output value in forestry will increase to 304 billion yuan from 140 billion yuan at present.
