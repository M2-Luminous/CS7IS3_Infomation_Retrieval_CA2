He added: I prefer to meet them in Turkey regarding an issue that concerns Turkey. Yasar Kefeli from the Turkish Radio and Television team in Brussels reports the following: [Begin Kefeli recording] Karayalcin replied to reporters' questions aboard the plane on his way to Brussels. In reply to a question on what his stand would be in the event the former DEP deputies who are in Brussels requested to meet with him, Karayalcin said: I do not feel the need to discuss the DEP issue with others. I, on principle, am ready to meet with everyone who expresses a wish to meet with me. I, however, do not believe that this is right from the political viewpoint. I am the Turkish deputy prime minister. I am ready to meet with anyone to discuss any issue in Turkey. In reply to another question on whether this statement could be interpreted as a refusal to meet the former DEP deputies in Brussels, Karayalcin said: Such a meeting is not in my program, nor is it in my thoughts. I would prefer to meet in Turkey with DEP or other deputies to discuss issues concerning Turkey. Karayalcin stated that discussions by the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly concerning Turkey might also be discussed during his contacts in Brussels. In reply to a question on the European Union [EU] membership of the Greek Cypriot sector and Malta and Turkey's stand on the issue, Karayalcin said that Turkey has established its relations with the EU much earlier and that it has priority regarding its membership application. He added: In my capacity as the deputy prime minister of my country I do not think it is appropriate to discuss Turkey's application together with the other issues. Turkey's application should be discussed as a separate issue carrying its own weight. Karayalcin noted that the EU wish for a peaceful solution of the Cyprus problem on the one hand and its view of the Greek Cypriot administration as a separate state on the other might raise the timetable issue put forward by certain sectors in Cyprus and added: This is totally wrong from the viewpoint of Turkey's security and peace in eastern Mediterranean. I think that this is a great obstacle for the EU. Karayalcin will meet with Philippe Busquin, president of the Francophone Socialist Party, in Brussels this afternoon. He will later meet with Belgian Interior Minister Louis Tobback. Karayalcin will meet with EU Commission President Jacques Delors, Commission Deputy President Sir Leon Britten, and Belgian Vice Prime Minister Melchior Wathelet tomorrow. [end recording]
