(KISHINEVSKIYE NOVOSTI No. 51, 4 December of this year) [For a translation of this article, see pages 75-77 of the FBIS REPORT: CENTRAL EURASIA, FBIS-USR-002, dated 10 January 1994] was the difference between socialists and social-democrats in Moldova. First, we have to thank Mr. Morev for drawing this distinction, because at the other end of the polemic spectrum there are attempts to discredit us--social-democrats--precisely by putting us in the same boat with socialists. Now on substance. Mr. Morev accuses us of being a party of national bourgeoisie. Yes, the social democrats as early as in the spring of 1991 submitted to the parliament an alternative draft of the Law on Privatization, and this is just as true as the fact that our draft contained a privatization mechanism (which later was included in the final law) that gives every citizen of Moldova a chance to own property. It is this privatization mechanism in the social democrats' version, that is based on the idea of privatization through registered national wealth bonds (rather than through depersonalized vouchers as in Russia), and that, if we finally succeed in implementing this mechanism, will contribute to forming in the Republic of Moldova a rather numerous and stable stratum of property owners, who, as any schoolboy knows this days, are a guarantee of social stability, dynamic economy, and real social protection in the society. It is not the social democrats' fault that the State Privatization Program was adopted by the parliament (in which the Conciliere--Accord club, currently headed by Mr. Morev, carried rather substantial weight: more than 30 deputies) almost two years after the adoption of the aforementioned law. And that esteemed deputies, including Mr. Morev and his club mates, should probably ask themselves: What kind of a government have we formed that still does not implement the laws we have passed? Or another example of election-time populism: "We think," Mr. Morev tells us, "that on 27 February 1944 it is necessary to submit to a referendum the question of the political independence of the Republic of Moldova, and its joining the CIS and its economic union." But why did you, the people's representatives, not resolve all these issues when the parliament still continued to function, albeit as a formality. The SDPM [Social Democratic Party of Moldova] never concealed its position regarding the need to hold a referendum on the issue of Moldovan statehood. Everybody who is familiar with our activities, knows this, as well as that from the moment the party was founded in May 1990, social democrats consistently supported state independence. We present this position absolutely clearly not only in Chisinau, but also in Moscow, Bucharest, Tiraspol, and Komrat. This position is "what you see is what you get"--when we proclaim ourselves supporters of state independence in Chisinau, we do not send our representatives--like the Socialist Party did--to the congress of the peoples of the USSR (Moscow, September 1993). Also very endearing is Mr. Morev's concern regarding establishing "true people's power" on Moldovan soil. In short, Soviet power. But have not citizens of our country had the opportunity to see for themselves that what had been called Soviet power could exist only in the environment of one party's diktat, and as soon as this diktat disappears, Supreme Soviets inevitably drive themselves into a dead end, and take the entire society with them? "Demo-cracy" is precisely "people's power." But democracy can only exist when there is a functioning law-based state: clear separation of powers, multiple parties, periodic free elections on a multiparty basis, and a referendum. And all of this only on the foundation of a constitution, which the current deputies also for some reason failed to adopt. But democracy is not a "citizens rally" under the title of "High National Assembly" and not 380 people's representatives who do not answer to anything and who are holding sessions under the banner "All Power to the Soviets." Now regarding the Moldovan social democrats' position on the tragic events in Moscow at the beginning of this year's October, as mentioned by Mr. Morev. It is enough to read our official documents of that time to see that the SDPM was not ecstatic over the no-win situation in the Russian Federation, as well as over the turn of events when instead of the force of law Moscow chose the right of force. In our statement on the topic of the latter, we expressed our deep concern over confrontational processes in Russia and expressed hope that a way out of the conflict would be found on the basis of free expression of the people's will. I would like to note, however, that while we strive to move toward modern European social democratic values, the SDPM is certainly not a "foreign-oriented" political force. After all, the real orientation of a party shows, let me put it this way, in the domestic market. And here I have to remind our political opponents that when blood was being spilled in Moldova on the left bank of Dniester, many now "bold" political parties for some reason remained mum... And so did some individual people's deputies, who now are very "brave." The only party that issued a stern warning that the resolution of the Dniester crisis by military means, reliance on violent methods, will bring Moldova to a catastrophe to the state structures and the public in the spring of 1992 were social democrats. Unfortunately, our lone voice was not heard. In conclusion I would like to point out that there are people now who are trying to resurrect a split in the society that existed in 1989-1990. At the time the opposing forces "marked" people by their ethnic attribute. Now the people are quite tired of hysteria and are more inclined to think about the daily bread. However, the temptation to divide everybody into "us" and "them" turned out quite resilient, so now the readers are reminded that Nantoi used to belong to the "front" (not as a cochairman, though--just a deputy chairman)! The Popular Front, just like the Communist Party, initially brought under its umbrella people with very different political views. I have never been a Communist Party member, but I remember very well that some leaders of the National Front of Moldova [NFM] had been, and so did Mr. Morev. It took some time for the logic of political events to sort out all this confusion and call things their proper names. At least I do not intend to deny the facts of my biography: I broke up with the NFM in the beginning of 1990 precisely because I stuck to my beliefs and did not try to use my position in the Front to secure some prestigious job. By the way, a few words about the attitude toward "frontism." Social democrats have advocated early elections and forming a professional parliament on a multiparty basis since last year. The greatest rebuke of this idea came from NFM deputies, as well as other parties of "democratic orientation." And, strange as it may be, most deputies who belong to the Conciliere--Accord club, not being "frontists," for all practical purposes ended up in the same boat with the NFM. (And Deputy V. Krylov, who carelessly voiced his support for an early disbanding of parliament, which had discredited itself in the eyes of citizens, was replaced as the club leader by "nonfrontist" V. Morev). Therefore, as Kozma Prutkov used to say, let us "look into the root of things" and not count KISHINEVSKIYE NOVOSTI readers as people without memory and without ability to analyze facts. As to taking politicians' words at face value, this is not recommended in any country.
