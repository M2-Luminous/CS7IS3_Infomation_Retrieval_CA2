FR941107-2-00029 FR941107-2-00008 [A&hyph;351&hyph;824] Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Silicomanganese From Brazil AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul Kullman or John Brinkmann, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW.; Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;1279 or (202) 482&hyph;5288, respectively. FINAL DETERMINATION: We determine that imports of silicomanganese from Brazil are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 735 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the preliminary determination and postponement of the final determination of this investigation on June 10, 1994, (59 FR 14852, June 17, 1994), the following events have occurred: On June 16, 1994, the U.S. Department of Commerce (the Department) received the response of Companhia Paulista de Ferro-Ligas and Sibra Eletro-Siderurgica Brasileira S/A (collectively ``Paulista'') to the Department's cost of production (COP) and constructed value (CV) questionnaire. The Department sent a COP/CV deficiency questionnaire to Paulista on July 8, 1994, which the company answered on July 29, 1994. On August 3, 1994, the Department sent a letter requesting additional clarification, which the company responded to on August 23, 1994. The Department conducted verification in Brazil of Paulista's COP/CV response in August 1994. On September 2, 1994, Paulista informed the Department that it would no longer be participating in the investigation. Paulista cited a lack of personnel and the fact that the company was operating under the Brazilian equivalent of U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as reasons why it was withdrawing from the investigation. Paulista requested that all of its proprietary information be removed from the record. The petitioners (Elkem Metals Company and the Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers, Local 3&hyph;639) submitted a case brief on September 23, 1994. Paulista submitted a rebuttal brief on September 28, 1994. At petitioners' request, a public hearing was held on September 30, 1994. Scope of the Investigation The merchandise covered by this investigation is silicomanganese. Silicomanganese, which is sometimes called ferrosilicon manganese, is a ferroalloy composed principally of manganese, silicon, and iron, and normally containing much smaller proportions of minor elements, such as carbon, phosphorous and sulfur. Silicomanganese generally contains by weight not less than four percent iron, more than 30 percent manganese, more than eight percent silicon and not more than three percent phosphorous. All compositions, forms and sizes of silicomanganese are included within the scope of this investigation, including silicomanganese slag, fines and briquettes. Silicomanganese is used primarily in steel production as a source of both silicon and manganese. This investigation covers all silicomanganese, regardless of its tariff classification. Most silicomanganese is currently classifiable under subheading 7202.30.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Some silicomanganese may also currently be classifiable under HTSUS subheading 7202.99.5040. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope is dispositive. Period of Investigation The period of investigation is June 1, 1993, through November 30, 1993. Such or Similar Comparisons We have determined that the merchandise subject to this investigation constitutes two such or similar categories, lumps and fines.
