A diplomat from the North Korean Embassy in Vienna met with an IAEA official in charge of the North Korean nuclear problem, but did not present his country's position on the problem, he said. The source said that he could not say there had been significant progress. The North Korean diplomat just listened to the IAEA's position and opinion on the place and date for consultation on when and how the IAEA will inspect the nuclear sites, and did not say anything about Pyongyang's position, according to the source. The diplomat said that he would notify the IAEA of Pyongyang's position after he received instructions, but given that North Korea agreed to allow nuclear inspections earlier in the day, detailed consultations between North Korea and the IAEA will take place this week, the source said. He said he expected progress toward inspection, including an agreement on a venue for negotiations, to be made soon. IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer said that North Korea had not made any proposal or given any notification about official contacts or official consultations. The IAEA's position was officially unchanged from the end of 1993 except that positive progress was being realized in the North Korean-U.S. contacts, Meyer said.
