Like the two Southeast Asian states, North Korea is suspected of developing nuclear weapons of its own -- or at least of being able to. Pyongyang denies this, but it permits inspectors of the Vienna International Atomic Energy Agency to enter the country and obstructs them in the fulfillment of their tasks. The governments of Pakistan and India do not even permit such checks. However, they are at least more predictable than the government of North Korea. Nobody -- not even the South Korean, Japanese, or U.S. agents who have worn themselves out with the Northeast Asian country for years -- can really say who is pulling what strings in the regime of aging great leader Kim Il-song and his son Kim Chong-il. The nuclear inspectors from Vienna were only able to state that it cannot be ruled out that North Korea is working on nuclear arms. The intelligence services claim that the country also has or is developing booster rockets. It is known that the isolated country with a seriously damaged economy gets oil and foodstuffs from China and exchanges arms for oil with Iran. None of that is new and it does not amount to a current crisis. What is new is that Bill Clinton's administration has now "lost patience," and that it is now believed in Washington that one has to defend the credibility of U.S. foreign policies, whose declared aim is to free the world from the nuclear threat. Let us assume that it is not a diversion, and that the Clinton Administration is not looking, in a reflex action, for a chance to divert the public's attention from domestic policy problems -- Whitewater -- while, at the same time, repairing the foreign policy mistake in China. Let us also assume that not only the pacification of the officers in the Pentagon and the U.S. armament industry, who find it difficult to get rid of their Patriot missiles elsewhere, is at issue. What threats can be used against a regime like that of North Korea? An economic embargo? That is to say, that the Korean community in Japan must not send any money and goods to North Korea? That Iraq, Iran, or China must not deliver any more oil? What is the use of threats that cannot be translated into reality? Whatever induced the U.S. Administration to advocate sanctions, the result will not reduce the danger in the region. What is more, it must be feared that the forces in the north and south of the Korean peninsula who tend to be prepared for dialogue will be silenced and that the hardliners on both sides will win. Then there might really be a crisis.
