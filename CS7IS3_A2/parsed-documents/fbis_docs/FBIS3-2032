Super 301 is an amendment to Section 301 of the 1974 trade act, which gives the President authority to impose trade sanctions, although it allows trade disputes to drag on for as long as a decade. Under Super 301, effective from 1988 to 1990, U.S. names the countries which it says engage in unfair trade practices and, if a resolution is not reached in 18 months, imposes punitive tariffs, sometimes as high as 100 percent, on certain imports from these countries. In 1989, Japan, Brazil and India were the targets for Super 301. The threat of trade sanctions resulted in concessions from Brazil and Japan, especially in the areas of processed wood products, supercomputers and satellites. Reinstitution of Super 301 by an administrative fiat from the President, meanwhile, supersede efforts in Congress to renew the measure through legislation.
