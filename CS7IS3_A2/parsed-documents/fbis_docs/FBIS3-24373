In it, our special correspondent Edgar Elyashchev told about the life and work of polar Norilsk, about what the city and its mining and metallurgical combine are doing for people. We are not going to retell the lengthy account, which was rich in facts and figures. We will only repeat the most important thing, something that was very aptly expressed in the article's headline, "Norilsk Loves People." In that city, in the extreme conditions of the Far North, everything possible was done to ease for working families the concerns and hardships that made their lives difficult and to protect and strengthen people's health. Year after year, Norilsk increased capital investments in the social sphere. "If this pace is maintained for another five to seven years, life here will be completely normal by that time," Boris Ivanovich Kolesnikov, general director of the Norilsk Zavenyagin Mining and Metallurgical Combine, told the journalist. That period of time has now passed. But instead of a "completely normal" life, there is crisis, poverty, and alarm. As is the case throughout the North, the situation in Norilsk is utterly desperate. Workers at the plants and mines are on the brink of holding mass protests. They sent a representative delegation to Moscow in hopes of seeing high-level officials with the help of the Russian Federation of Independent Trade Unions. The group of trade-union officials and leaders of the council of labor collectives visited the editorial offices of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. The guests gave us a package of documents addressed to the authorities, and here is what they told us.
