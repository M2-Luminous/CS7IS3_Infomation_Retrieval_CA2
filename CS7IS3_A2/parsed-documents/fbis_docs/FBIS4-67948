Denying ROK media reports that an advance team would leave for North Korea over the weekend, spokesman Kyd said those reports are groundless. Spokesman Kyd admitted that the advance team did prepare to leave for North Korea. However, since North Korea has not responded to a list of IAEA inspections so far, chances are slim that the team would arrive in North Korea by 28 April, he added.
