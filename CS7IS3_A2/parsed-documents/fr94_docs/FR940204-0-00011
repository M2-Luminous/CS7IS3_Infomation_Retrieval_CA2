FR940204-0-00011 FR940204-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Secretary 24 CFR Part 87 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1705; FR&hyph;3574&hyph;F&hyph;01] RIN 2501&hyph;AB66 Limitation on Use of Appropriated Funds to Influence Certain Federal Contracting and Financial Transactions; Change in Threshold for Single Family Compliance AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, HUD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule complies with a statutory amendment to raise, for single family mortgage transactions, the threshold for compliance with the government-wide certification and disclosure requirements on lobbying. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Garry Phillips, Acting Director, Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815; TDD number (202) 708&hyph;1112. (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 23, 1989, section 319 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;121) was enacted. This provision amended subchapter III of chapter 13 of title 31, United States Code, to add a new section 1352 (the ``Byrd Amendment''). The Byrd Amendment contains a general prohibition on the use of federally appropriated funds for influencing any Executive or Legislative Branch personnel in the award of Federal contracts, grants, loans, cooperative agreements, and certain post-award actions (such as the modification or extension of any of these forms of assistance). It also requires disclosure of certain information on payments from non-federally-appropriated funds that are used to influence the above Federal actions, as well as the insurance or guarantee of loans. The Byrd Amendment applies to all Federal agencies and was implemented by a government-wide common rule that was published in the Federal Register on February 26, 1990, at 55 FR 6736. HUD's adoption of the common rule is set forth at 24 CFR part 87. Under the provisions of 24 CFR 87.110, each person who makes a submission for consideration of an award of a Federal loan or a commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan exceeding $150,000, or receives such an award, must file a certification regarding the prohibition discussed above and a disclosure form (Standard Form LLL, ``Disclosure of Lobbying Activities''), if indicated by the use of non-federally-appropriated funds to influence the covered actions. Section 320 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1991 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;512) amended section 1352(e)(2)(c) of the Byrd Amendment to expand the original exception for loan guaranty and insurance transactions of $150,000 or less to also except guaranty/insurance transactions when the amount is within the applicable single family mortgage limit. Under HUD's new higher mortgage limits, transactions in a number of states could exceed the $150,000 threshold. Accordingly 24 CFR 87.110 (a)(2) and (b)(2) are amended to reflect this technical change by adding to the references to $150,000 ``or the single family maximum mortgage limit for affected programs, whichever is greater.'' Other Matters Justification for Final Rule Making In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with its own regulations on rule making, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from that general rule where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1) The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this rule for effect without first soliciting public comment, in that prior public procedure is unnecessary and contrary to public interest. This rule makes a technical amendment in compliance with a statutory change which reduces the burden on the public. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule applies to single family mortgage transactions only and relieves the certification and disclosure requirements which might have applied in some circumstances. Environmental Review A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR Part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection during regular business hours in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the order. This rule applies to single family mortgage transactions for certain HUD programs only. Executive Order 12606, the Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. Regulatory Agenda
