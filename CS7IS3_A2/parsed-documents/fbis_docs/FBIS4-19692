The motion refers to reports that during Prime Minister Ciller's recent visit to the United States, President Clinton pressured her in connection with the Cyprus question. ANAP said: It is inconceivable to accept such behavior, which means that our foreign policy is under foreign domination regarding a national issue such as Cyprus. The prime minister herself must urgently clarify this issue before the TGNA. ANAP said the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC], which has been living in peace for a long time, is recently being pushed toward chaos, step by step. It claimed that the debates being held at the United Nations are nothing but efforts to exert pressure on the TRNC delegation and Turkey. ANAP also charged that the government program does not pay enough attention to the issue of the TRNC.
