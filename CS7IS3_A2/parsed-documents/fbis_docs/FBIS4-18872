This was an understandable step taken by the United Nations, Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel stated in Bonn on Monday. The Serbian side had been warned but failed to heed the warning. Bonn was hoping that the Serbs would now come to reason and that the hostilities could be ended quickly. Vogel would not comment on the Russian protests against the military action. He said that the Federal Government recognized them.
