FR940803-2-00047 FR940803-2-00038 Food and Drug Administration [Docket No. 94D&hyph;0259] Draft ``Points To Consider in the Manufacture and Testing Of Monoclonal Antibody Products For Human Use;'' Availability Agency: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. Action: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a draft points to consider (PTC) document entitled ``Points to Consider in the Manufacture and Testing of Monoclonal Antibody Products For Human Use.'' The draft PTC document is intended to assist sponsors and investigators of monoclonal antibody (mAb) products intended for human use. This document revises a 1987 document entitled ``Points to Consider (PTC) in the Manufacture and Testing of Monoclonal Antibody Products for Human Use.'' The updated version contains the general guidance from the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) regarding monoclonal antibody product development, including information to be submitted when filing an investigational new drug application (IND) and product license application (PLA). DATES: Comments by October 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written requests for single copies of the draft PTC document to the Congressional and Consumer Affairs Branch (HFM&hyph;12), Food and Drug Administration, 1401 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852&hyph;1448. Send two self-addressed adhesive labels to assist that office in processing your requests. Persons with access to INTERNET may request this document from ``CBER_INFO@A1.CBER.FDA.GOV.'' The document may also be obtained by calling the CBER FAX Information System at 301&hyph;594&hyph;1939 from a FAX machine with a touch tone phone attached or built in. Submit written comments on the draft PTC document to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one. Requests and comments should be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The draft PTC document and received comments are available for public examination in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kathryn E. Stein, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Office of Therapeutics Research and Review/Division of Monoclonal Antibodies (HFM&hyph;555), Food and Drug Administration, 1401 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852&hyph;1448, 301&hyph;402&hyph;4606. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FDA is announcing the availability of a draft PTC document entitled ``Points to Consider in the Manufacture and Testing of Monoclonal Antibody Products for Human Use.'' The draft PTC document reflects the considerable experience that has been gained through review of submissions since 1987 and discussions that have taken place at several national and international meetings. The draft PTC document provides a discussion of topics that should be considered in the development of monoclonal antibody products. At present, most monoclonal antibody (mAb) products are produced by hybridoma cell lines through immortalization of antibody-producing cells by chemically-induced fusion with myeloma cells. In some cases, additional fusions with other lines have created ``triomas'' and ``quadromas.'' CBER anticipates an increase in recombinant and human antibodies in the future. The principles reviewed by the draft PTC document may be applied in general to all hybridoma and heterohybridoma generated products, regardless of species of origin. The draft PTC document details the approach that sponsors and investigators should follow in product manufacturing and testing, preclinical and clinical studies, and the information to be provided for review and evaluation of clinical testing and licensing. The draft PTC document describes the characterization of purified, unmodified mAb which is essential for manufacturing control of product, determination of potency and stability, and development of an appropriate clinical development program. Special considerations for immunoconjugates (monoclonal antibodies conjugated with toxins, drugs, radionuclides or other agents) are addressed. The draft PTC document also details the considerations for combination products. Issues addressed in the draft PTC document include: (1) Quality control and product testing including cell line qualification; (2) lot-to-lot quality control monitoring of bulk lots and final product specifications; (3) stability of the product; and (4) quantitation and removal of a known contaminant. The draft PTC document also addresses issues related to manufacturing changes, including those made either during clinical development or subsequent to product approval. The draft PTC document discusses issues relating to: (1) Preclinical studies including in vitro testing for cross-reactivity; (2) preclinical pharmacology; (3) safety; and (4) toxicity testing. With respect to clinical studies, the draft PTC document discusses general study design for Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies, clinical considerations involved in immunogenicity, dosimetry, and imaging agents for cancer. As with other PTC documents, FDA does not intend this draft PTC document to be all-inclusive and cautions that not all information may be applicable to all situations. The draft PTC document is intended to provide information and does not set forth requirements. The methods and procedures cited in the draft PTC document are suggestions. FDA anticipates that sponsors and investigators may develop alternative methods and procedures, and discuss them with FDA. CBER may find those alternative methods and procedures acceptable. FDA recognizes that advances will continue in the area of monoclonal antibodies and that this document may become outdated as those advances occur. This PTC document does not bind FDA and does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits on or for any private person, but is intended merely for guidance. Interested persons may submit written comments on the draft PTC document to the Dockets Management Branch (address above). FDA anticipates revising the draft PTC document periodically in response to comments received or to reflect advancements in monoclonal antibody therapies and products. Dated: July 28, 1994.
