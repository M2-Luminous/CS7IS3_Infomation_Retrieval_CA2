In contrast to Rwanda, in Burundi it is still the Tutsi minority that rules the Hutu majority and relies on the army, which is exclusively composed of Tutsis. On the weekend, the Tutsi Army began to search Hutus, who had been crammed into a stadium, for weapons, after the armed forces had attacked the district of Kamenge, which is inhabited by Hutus, in the capital city of Bujumbura. This was a reason for my colleague Rupert Neudeck asking Leonard Nyangoma, security minister of Burundi, about the situation in Kamenge during his visit to Germany. [Nyangoma] Since late afternoon of 28 April the Burundi Army, which consists exclusively of Tutsis, has started to bomb the district of Kamenge in Bujumbura. This attack was carried out with the heaviest weapons, that is, with artillery and grenades; it is even said that Stalin organs were used. However, no matter how this attack was carried out, it is quite clear that the Hutu inhabitants of Kamenge are now victims of these attacks. [Neudeck] Are there already figures about the victims, the dead, and the destruction in Kamenge? [Nyangoma] We do not yet have any exact figures, but I have already been told that the number of dead is reportedly very high. However, we have received reports that the Burundi Army allegedly massacred about 2,000 people in the hills around the capital city. Casualties in Kamenge must be very high, because the Hutu people there are surrounded by the army, they cannot flee anywhere, they have no protection at all. [Neudeck] How can you explain this complicated situation to the German public? [Nyangoma] On 21 October 1993 there was the attempt to carry out a coup d'etat, when the then president and his associates were killed. The consequences are known. Internal ethnic fighting flared again in Burundi. There also was heavy material damage. Currently, we are again facing an imminent coup d'etat. Nowadays the excuse used by the Burundi Army for torturing and attacking the population is that the population must be disarmed. We, the Government, basically agree with disarming the population. However, there remains the question of who is disarming whom. To the extent to which the Tutsi army has again and again issued arms to its Tutsi compatriots since 1972, it has completely given away the legitimation for disarming the population, particularly, now, exclusively the Hutu population. Therefore, the disarming, which is carried out now under these conditions, is rejected by the people. It should be carried out only by the international community. There is a group of extremist Tutsis among the people that does not want to accept the process of democratization in Burundi. This group wants to guarantee the status quo. This group enjoys so many privileges that it does not want to agree to this process. They think that the process of transparent democratization in Burundi will not leave them with their privileges. This, however, is wrong, because since democratization began in June 1993, no property rights -- neither of Hutus nor of Tutsis -- have been touched upon. This group of extremist Tutsis wants to stop democratization, because it is worried about its privileges. [Neudeck] Mr. Minister, what do you ask of the German Government and of the German people in this serious situation? [Nyangoma] The people of our country are in a difficult situation. Even the new institutions of democracy have been taken hostage by the army. Since 21 October 1993, we have lived like hostages. Unfortunately, our crisis in Burundi is not really known abroad. The international community does not even really see it. Germany, in particular, however, should know about our crisis. I think that particularly Germany, as a democratic country, should now react to our crisis. Germany should alert the international community so that the people in Burundi are helped in this extremely tense situation so as to, in particular, solve the problem of this terrible coexistence of an army in Burundi that is not neutral and the threatened population. We are appealing to the international community to help us organize a round table or a conference that might help with reestablishing peace and security in this region. [Neudeck] In what framework do you envisage a solution for your country? [Nyangoma] I believe that the solution should be tackled bilaterally as well as multilaterally. An international conference should be convened, with the particular participation of our neighboring states, that is, Tanzania, Zambia, and Kenya, but also with the help of those countries, which have long been friends with Burundi. I am particularly thinking of Belgium, France, and the United States. Of course, we also need the support of the United Nations very much, just as of the Organization of African Unity.
