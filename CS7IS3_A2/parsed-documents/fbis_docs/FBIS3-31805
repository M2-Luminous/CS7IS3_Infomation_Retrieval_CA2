As [Fidesz deputy] Jozsef Szajer and [SZDSZ deputy] Istvan Szent-Ivanyi said, at the meeting they had mainly discussed European affairs and security problems, and exchanged their views on what kind of foreign affairs structure the two parties would form if they both came to government. There is no dispute about the country's orientation between the two liberal parties, they said; both organizations consider early European Union [EU] and NATO membership their fundamental goal. In connection with this, the participants of the meeting thought that the Hungarian Socialist Party's [MSZP] NATO policy is not unequivocal but, according to Szajer, downright "confusing." The Fidesz would not consider it a campaign measure if the government submitted a formal request for EU membership in the coming weeks. However, the SZDSZ considered it important to hold prior inter-party consultation on this issue. The liberals find the establishment of a unified foreign affairs management desirable. Accordingly, they would wind up the Ministry of International Economic Relations, in spite of the fact that this would not mean budget savings in the short term. In their view, it is important that the diplomatic body develops in the direction of public service. If they come to power, the liberals envisage 10 to 15 appointments in the foreign affairs leadership and the same number in ambassadorial positions. They do not want to perform a political cleanup in the Foreign Ministry's staff; the professionalism and loyalty that can be expected from public service employees will be the basic criteria in assessing diplomats.
