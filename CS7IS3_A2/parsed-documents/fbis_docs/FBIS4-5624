The survey was conducted in major cities, such as Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka, by conducting personal interviews or interviews over the phone. In answering "who should be the next prime minister?" 78 people (31.2 percent of the respondents) supported Hata, 35 (14 percent) Masayoshi Takemura, and 30 (12 percent) Michio Watanabe as the next prime minister. Lower house member Makiko Tanaka and Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi were also favored as the next prime minister. Hokkaido Governor Yokomichi, however, is not eligible to become prime minister because he is not a Diet member. As the reason for supporting Hata, a 28-year-old man in Tochigi Prefecture said: "He has made a contribution to the Hosokawa government. Also, he has been known as Japan's foreign minister in other countries. He seems to be an able man." A 25-year-old woman in Yamaguchi Prefecture said: "Because he has strong backing, he will be able to exercise leadership." Takemura ranked second to Hata as a favorite figure to be the next prime minister. He was popular mainly in the Kansai area where he is from. A 47-year-old woman in Osaka said: "He has a relatively clean image." A 27-year-old man in Hokkaido also said: "He will inherit Mr. Hosokawa's good points." Watanabe was popular among elderly people. Because of his career as foreign minister and finance minister, many hoped that "Watanabe should carry out Japan's diplomatic policy saying what it has to say to the United States, as well as the work to reconstruct the economy." Takako Doi and Masaharu Gotoda were also popular because of their "clean" image. A 45-year-old woman in Tokyo put her expectations on Doi, saying: "I hope that the Diet will take the plunge and name Doi as the first female prime minister."
