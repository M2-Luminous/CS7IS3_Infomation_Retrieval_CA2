The four were accused of stealing 40,200 yuan (4,620 dollars) from two Chinese on February 24 in a Harbin hotel after threatening them with a knife. They were arrested several days later in the neighbouring province of Liaoning. One of the Russians managed to escape but was recaptured a short time later in the eastern city of Nanjing. The escapee was given 16 years in jail March 22, while his accomplices received terms ranging from five to 10 years, it said. The sentences were particularly heavy given the relatively small amount of money involved and the fact that neither victim was injured, observers said.
