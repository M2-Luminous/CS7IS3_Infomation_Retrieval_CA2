FR940504-1-00052 FR940504-1-00018 After reviewing the comments received in response to the July 22, 1993, Federal Register notice, the Department proposes to revise the type B rule to include appropriate standards to improve the reliability of CV when used to estimate lost nonuse values. The Department is issuing this notice to ensure that interested parties have an adequate opportunity for review and comment. On March 25, 1994, the Department published a final rule to revise the type B rule to comply with all aspects of the Ohio v. Interior remand other than the assessment of lost nonuse values. 59 FR 14281. Pending completion of this rulemaking, the Department is temporarily leaving unchanged the language of the original type B rule concerning the assessment of lost nonuse values. E. Other Rulemakings CERCLA mandates biennial review and revision, as appropriate, of the natural resource damage assessment regulations. The Department plans to begin the biennial update of the type B rule in July 1994. All aspects of the administrative process and the type B rule will be subject to review during that update. During the biennial review, the Department will consider ways of ensuring the greatest consistency appropriate between its damage assessment regulations and the damage assessment regulations being developed by NOAA. Further, later this year the Department plans to issue a proposed rule to revise the type A rule for coastal and marine environments in compliance with Colorado v. Interior . The Department is also developing an additional type A rule for assessing damages in the Great Lakes. Like the type A rule for coastal and marine environments, the type A rule for the Great Lakes will incorporate a computer model. II. Calculation of Damages Under the Type B Rule A. Costs of Restoration, Rehabilitation, Replacement, and/or Acquisition of Equivalent Resources The type B rule as originally published on August 1, 1986, provided that damages consisted of the lesser of the cost of restoring the injured resources (plus the lost interim use value) or the diminution in the value of the injured resources without restoration. In Ohio v. Interior , the court ordered the Department to revise the rule to reflect the statutory preference for using restoration costs as the measure of natural resource damages. CERCLA provides that sums recovered in natural resource damage actions may be used to restore, rehabilitate, replace, or acquire the equivalent of the injured natural resources. The court used the simple term ``restoration'' costs as shorthand for the cost of performing any of these actions. 880 F.2d at 441. On March 25, 1994, the Department published a final rule that revised the type B rule to allow trustee officials to recover the costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources in all cases. 59 FR 14281. The March 25, 1994, final rule provides guidance on projecting the costs of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured resources. Under that final rule, trustee officials first identify and consider a reasonable number of possible alternatives for restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured resources. Trustee officials also estimate those services that are likely to be lost to the public pending completion of each alternative under consideration. Trustee officials then select one of the possible alternatives based on several factors. The trustee officials document their decisions in a Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan, which is subject to public review and comment. Once the trustee officials select a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative, they choose the methods they intend to use to estimate the costs of implementing that alternative. To do this, trustee officials select among specified cost estimating methodologies. Trustee officials include the rationale for their selection in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan. B. Compensable Value Under the March 25, 1994, final rule, the costs of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured resources are the basic measure of damages; however, these costs are only one component of the damages that trustee officials may assess. Trustee officials also have the discretion to assess the value of the resource services that the public lost from the date of the release or discharge until completion of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. 59 FR 14283. The term ``compensable value'' is used to encompass all of the lost public economic values, including both lost use values and lost nonuse values. The Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan includes a description of the methodologies trustee officials intend to use when estimating compensable value during Damage Determination. The original type B rule provided a ranked list of methodologies that could be used to calculate lost use values. If the market for the injured resource was ``reasonably competitive,'' then the diminution of the market price attributable to the discharge or release was used to estimate damages. If a market price methodology was not applicable, then the trustee officials were required to use appraisal methodologies. Only when neither market-price nor appraisal methodologies were appropriate for the resources being assessed did the original version of the rule allow trustee officials to use non-market-based methodologies.
