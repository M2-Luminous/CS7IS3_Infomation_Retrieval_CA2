On his arrival in Bucharest President Iliescu stated among other things: "We had a very busy schedule with interviews with President Konstandinos Karamanlis, with Premier Andreas Papandreou, with several members of the government and of parliamentary parties, as well as with representatives of business and banking circles. The common note of these interviews was their warm atmosphere. On one side we assessed the good level of the ties between our countries and a considerable similarity of opinions as regards issues of our direct concern, as well as international developments in our area and in Europe at large. We have also noticed the firm political will on both sides to support the expansion, diversification, and development of ties in all fields, especially the economic ones, and we also considered the current volume of commercial exchanges as modest compared to the potential of our economies. From this point of view my opinion is that there is a real interest and a climate of confidence among business and economic circles of both countries to expand these relations. However, these issues will be debated on the forthcoming session of the joint commission due next week in Athens. Worth mentioning would be also a new and positive element in our relations in the banking system." "As for the issues confronting our area and Europe in general, we also noticed a similarity of opinions in their approach. Referring to Yugoslavia, both sides were of the opinion that progress could be made only by supporting efforts for a political approach of the potential solutions to be found, and that steps made until present in this direction are sufficiently promising." Romania's president was accompanied during his visit to Greece by Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, by Traian Chebeleu, presidential aide, and by other officials.
