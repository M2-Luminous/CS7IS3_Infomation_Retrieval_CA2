In a recent interview, which the finance minister gave me, he joked: "When I resign, I will make a bet.... No, first I will make a bet that the exchange rate will reach 2,000 [rubles to $1], and the next day I will announce that I am going...." Many commentators today think that there is a very real possibility that Mr. Fedorov will resign. Everything depends on who will be named as vice premier by Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday. "It is very unlikely that Fedorov will stay if Zaveryukha is vice premier," according to, for instance, Sergey Vasilyev, leader of the Russian Government's Working Center for Economic Reforms. The finance minister and Aleksandr Zaveryukha, representative of the agrarian lobby in the government, have been engaged in long and hard conflict, which is naturally based on the fact that the latter persistently demands money from the former while he equally persistently denies it to him. But virtually no one doubts that Mr. Zaveryukha will become a vice premier. While the chances of Fedorov himself becoming one of the four vice premiers are seen as minimal. So the prospect of the finance minister finding himself not on a par with his antagonist, and even in a subordinate position to him, are perfectly real. People who know Boris Grigoryevich well claim that he would certainly not accept that. Does this mean that the end of financial stabilization is nigh? The ruble exchange rate is already falling, and quite appreciably. Igor Doronin, expert at the Interbank Currency Exchange, considers that "this is a perfectly natural phenomenon. The minimium wage has almost doubled. Transport fares have doubled. Municipal services have gone up two- or threefold. Why shouldn't the exchange rate fall in such a situation?" His forecast is 1,800-1,900 rubles to the dollar within the next few weeks. Fedorov's departure in this situation will certainly cause alarm among commercial structures, according to Igor Doronin. "The political situation, the top-level reshuffle, the strengthening of the position of the sectoral lobbyists in government -- all this creates a background conducive to destabilization of the ruble," Doronin contends. In such a situation "no normal businessman will sell foreign currency." In the Interbank expert's opinion, even the current rate is being maintained thanks to massive currency intervention by the Central Bank. If reshuffles do take place in the Finance Ministry, much will depend on who replaces Boris Fedorov: Will the next minister be sufficiently tough and independent? Petr Aven, president of the Alfa-Bank and former Russian minister of foreign economic relations, thinks that only one person is rightly able to claim the post -- Yegor Gaydar. The prime minister's opinion on this score is known only to him for the time being. Two other names are cited: Sergey Dubinin and Andrey Vavilov -- current deputy finance ministers. However, those candidates' chances are slim.
