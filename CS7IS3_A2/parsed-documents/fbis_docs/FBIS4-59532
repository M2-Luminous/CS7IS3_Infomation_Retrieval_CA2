The Arab League delegation is currently on a visit to our country. The two sides reviewed the developments in our country in light of the war ignited in the homeland by the gang of apostasy and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership. The deputy prime minister explained the developments in the Yemeni arena, holding the secessionist rebellious leadership of the YSP responsible for igniting the military situation in the country. He noted that this took place in accordance with a premeditated scheme and began with the actions of this gang, which is rebelling against political legitimacy by violating the framework of the government coalition, paralyzing the legitimate institutions, casting doubts about them, and obstructing their role. The deputy prime minister expressed his appreciation for the Arab League's role in shouldering its pan-Arab responsibility to protect Yemeni unity, which is considered a pan-Arab achievement that concerns all the sons of the Arab nation, and to support justice and constitutional legitimacy.
