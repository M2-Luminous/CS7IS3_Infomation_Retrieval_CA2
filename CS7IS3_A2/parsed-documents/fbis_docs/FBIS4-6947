At Treng, Sdau, and Snoeng: The demoralized and routed invading forces, both chiefs and rank and file, with light and heavy guns, tanks, and armored carriers rushed precipitately by driving or walking from Pailin toward Battambang. 2. At Kamping Puoy, Ta Kream, Krapeu, and Phnum Sampoeu: The forces here were the positions which defended Battambang and the base of the 196th Division and which had militarily been reinforced for years, but were also routed. They also rushed precipitately toward Battambang. The cause of their unstoppable fleeing was that the 196th Division sent by the communist Vietnamese puppet leaders to Pailin had basically been smashed. As such, the remaining terrified troops broke from their ranks and ran from Kamping Puoy, Ta Kream, Krapeu, and Phnum Sampoeu toward Battambang with the hope that they would set themselves free from the battles. 3. The chaotic situation in the town of Battambang: In the situation where the troops of the communist Vietnamese puppets and of the U.S. puppets, who were badly smashed and routed in Pailin, rushed precipitately toward Battambang town -- some had only their clothes with them -- Battambang was thrown into a terrified, alarmed, and confused situation. This was not because of fear of imminent attacks by the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK], but mainly because the routed troops from Pailin and Route 10 robbed, shot at, and tossed hand grenades killing people at market places in a tumultuous, uncontrollable, and unpreventable manner. As both chiefs and rank and file carried out robbery and shooting, Battambang became a place where war erupted and where the communist Vietnamese puppets, both military and civilian, and the U.S. puppets, both military and civilian, murdered people according to their fascist nature. 4. In this situation, Battambang's residents are running about in horror. They angrily curse the base robbers and pray that the NADK and the people will arrive immediately to ensure security for them.
