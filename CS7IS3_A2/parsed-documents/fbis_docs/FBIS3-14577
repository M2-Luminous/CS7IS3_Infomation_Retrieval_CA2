The first goal of the Majles in cutting expenses is to reform the government's administrative and financial structure. The above was announced yesterday in an interview with RESALAT'S parliamentary correspondent by Engineer Hashem Rahbari, deputy from Tehran and member of the Majles Plan and Budget Commission. He said: The Plan and Budget Commission believes that the administrative organizations can be managed in a more limited form than the present one and that this amount of cost is not needed for the nation's administrative organizations. If the price of foreign exchange is going to rise on the one hand and on the other hand the organizations are going to expand, no kind of structural reform will take place. Continuing, he added: To cut unnecessary government expenses, the Majles has made a policy that strict economy will be observed in the purchase of buildings, land, automobiles, and in changing decorations and carpets, and this is the will of the Majles. On the one hand, in view of outstanding foreign commitments, to establish a positive direction, 50 percent of the cuts made in the government's proposed budget, in the event that additional revenues are obtained, will be used to pay commitments, which will protect the nation's credit. Continuing this interview, Engineer Rahbari said: It is the Plan and Budget Commission's view that the finished costs of goods and services announced by the government are not that high, and that by adopting certain measures the finished costs can be reduced. He added: In view of the presence of concerned specialists and existing resources, more reliance can be placed on domestic construction, and the finished cost can be reduced by reforming procedures, economizing, and creating more efficiency, productivity, and profitability, in order to make the pressure on the consumer just and logical. Because this measure is in the interest of the people, they will accept it. For this reason, all the price increases proposed by the government were not accepted by the Majles. The Plan and Budget Commission member emphasized the fact that the Majles places great importance on solving the economic problems of the people. He added: To achieve this goal, the Majles increased the subsidies on some goods needed by the people. The amount of subsidies for drugs was increased from the government's proposed $330 million to $400 million, the subsidies for basic goods were increased from $695 million to $800 million, 220 billion-rials[R] credit was approved for education and training and R70 billion was approved for student scholarships and food. He then discussed the credits allocated for the deprived areas. He said: The Majles added R50 billion to the credits for this sector. Credits were approved to provide water service in 1,000 villages. The government proposed to provide electrical power to 500 villages, and the Majles increased this to 1,500 villages. In addition, the Majles has provided for the expansion of electrical power in 300 cases. Likewise, the Majles has made provisions in next year's budget to install telephones in 500 villages. He noted that to expand gas delivery service, the Majles allocated R100 billion for the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995]. He emphasized: While the Majles has set out to economize, it is moving in the direction of implementing social justice.
