From Ciorbea, we have learned that he is not willing to accept that position either, as long as the government coalition includes the Greater Romania Party, Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania, National Romanian Unity Party, and Socialist Party of Labor. As a result of this, the CNSRL-Fratia, in an almost definite cooperation with the Alfa-Trade Union Confederation, takes over its duties. "On 28 February we will hold a one-day strike and it will be seen not only in the paper or on the television," said Miron Mitrea. "Bread factories and bread selling stores alike will work only with a third of their capacity, refineries will be operating but will not produce anything, oil deliveries will be interrupted, drivers will not move from their garages, teachers will go to classes but will not teach, and the wood processing industry will stop its activity. The telecommunications will be interrupted every 10 minutes, road workers will block roads, and work will stop at construction sites. Enterprises will have strike pickets and nobody from the outside will be allowed to enter the factory. The idea is to prove our organizational capability and, at the same time, to prepare the ground for our future actions planned for March and April."
