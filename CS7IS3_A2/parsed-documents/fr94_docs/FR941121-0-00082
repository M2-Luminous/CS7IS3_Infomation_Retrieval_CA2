FR941121-0-00082 FR941121-0-00009 C. Administrative Review Requirements for HCPPs Comment: Two commenters expressed concern about our regulations extending the section 1876 managed care administrative review requirements to HCPPs and disagreed with our interpretation of the intent of the Congress in this regard. It was the opinion of both commenters that the Congress should expressly legislate these requirements. Response: As noted previously, section 1833 of the Act simply permits entities that provide Part B services on a prepayment basis to be paid reasonable costs rather than reasonable charges. There is no indication that the Congress intended to deprive enrolled beneficiaries of meaningful appeal rights. Our regulations governing HCPPs were designed to establish a workable mechanism for reimbursing them, in light of the fact that the way they do business is more comparable to HMOs and CMPs than it is to physicians, suppliers, and providers who are paid under Part B. As certain aspects of the Medicare program have been improved over the years, such as the addition of beneficiary protections, we have not revised HCPP regulations to reflect these changes. Recently, we have embarked on an effort to identify actions that are within our authority, to ensure that the HCPP program is administered prudently and that Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in these plans have rights and benefits comparable to those that beneficiaries have in the fee-for-service system and in HMOs/CMPs. We believe that we have administrative authority to ensure that these beneficiaries are given appropriate appeal rights. Comment: One commenter was concerned that, since HCPPs are not required to provide all Part B services, the administrative review process be limited to those Medicare covered services provided by the health plan under its agreement with us. Response: Paragraph (b)(2) of ยง417.838 (``Organization determinations'') of the regulation addresses this concern by specifying that a determination regarding services that are not covered under the HCPP's agreement with HCFA is not an organization determination.
