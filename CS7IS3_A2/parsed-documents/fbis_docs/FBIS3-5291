The upper house approved the amendments following passage by the lower house Tuesday. Under the amendments, 300 seats will be allocated for single-seat constituencies and 200 by proportional representation based on the popular vote in 11 electoral units. Currently, 511 lower house members are elected from multiseat constituencies. The complete reform package will be enforced after enactment of another law identifying the locations of the 300 single-seat constituencies. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura has said the coalition government wants to submit a bill on the constituencies' locations to the current Diet session ending June 29. But the presentation may be delayed to autumn if legislators insist their opinions be reflected on the locations. The original government-sponsored package called for 274 single-seat districts and 226 seats allotted by proportional representation on a nationwide basis. The original package banned corporate donations to politicians and their fund-raising organizations, but the revised bills will allow firms to donate up to 500,000 yen per year during the next five years as a temporary provision. The original package was passed on January 29 at an extraordinary Diet session shortly after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and opposition Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei Kono agreed that the amendments and date of enforcement would be discussed during the current ordinary session.
