[passage omitted] Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin, Russian first deputy defense minister, answered questions from our correspondent. [Begin Kokoshin recording] The task of the Defense Ministry has been in the key areas to ensure, albeit with minimum funding, since we have been constantly underfinanced, both the development of the most up-to-date equipment and its serial production; nonetheless, the new equipment that has been developed in general in recent years has been, so to speak, a very slender trickle, but it is coming through and it will come through. In 1994 we shall probably have to direct our main efforts on preserving what the forces have and on modernizing what they have. This includes such celebrated air defense missile systems as the S-300VM and TOR systems. We will also of course be ordering the BUK M2 system and a number of others, which cover the whole spectrum in respect of range and altitude. That is to say, we are talking about those systems which when linked together in a unified complex can tackle air defense tasks in a theater of military actions. We have in general, I consider, reached a definite new level in the development of tactical communication systems. By as early as the end of this year we should have provided the most up-to-date communications facilities for a number of our elite units in the most important areas where combat tasks or tasks close to combat ones have to be tackled. We do not intend either to do without new ships, and the launching of new ships is planned. The hoisting of the St. Andrew's flag is planned aboard a new destroyer at the Northern Shipyard and we hope by the end of 1994 to have completed work on the heavy missile cruiser Petr Velikiy. We are continuing work on the most varied kinds of space facilities and this year we shall be adding something and our space group, so to speak, will be renewed. Improvements are being made too to our space missile-attack early warning systems and to our space-based communications, including for the tactical system for instance.
