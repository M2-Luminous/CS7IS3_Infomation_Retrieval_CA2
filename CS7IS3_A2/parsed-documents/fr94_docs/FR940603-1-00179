The time of completion hereinabove set forth shall be increased by the number of days of any such suspension, except when such suspension is due to the failure of the Bidder to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract. In the event that work is suspended by the Bidder with the consent of the Owner, the Bidder before resuming work shall give the Owner at least twenty-four (24) hours notice thereof in writing. Section 7. Defective Materials and Workmanship. a. The acceptance of any materials, equipment (except Owner-furnished materials) or any workmanship by the Owner or the Engineer shall not preclude the subsequent rejection thereof if such materials, equipment, or workmanship shall be found to be defective after delivery or installation, and any such materials, equipment or workmanship found defective before final acceptance of the construction shall be replaced or remedied, as the case may be, by and at the expense of the Bidder. Any such condemned material or equipment shall be immediately removed from the site of the Project by the Bidder at the Bidder's expense. The Bidder shall not be entitled to any payment hereunder so long as any defective materials, equipment or workmanship in respect to the Project, of which the Bidder shall have had notice, shall not have been replaced or remedied, as the case may be. b. Notwithstanding any certificate which may have been given by the Owner or the Engineer, if any materials, equipment (except Owner-furnished materials) or any workmanship which does not comply with the requirements of this Contract shall be discovered within one (1) year after Completion of Construction of the Project, the Bidder shall replace such defective materials or equipment or remedy any such defective workmanship within thirty (30) days after notice in writing of the existence thereof shall have been given by the Owner.

Only ninety percent (90%) of each such estimate approved during the construction of the Project shall be paid by the Owner to the Bidder prior to Completion of the Project: Provided, however, that at any time after work, which, in the sole determination of the Engineer, amounts to fifty percent (50%) of the maximum Contract price has been completed, the Owner may elect, in lieu of paying ninety percent (90%) of each such subsequent estimate, to pay each such subsequent estimate in full. Upon completion by the Bidder of the construction of the Project, the Engineer will prepare an inventory of the Project showing the total number and character of Construction Units and, after checking such inventory with the Bidder, will certify it to the Owner. Upon the approval by the Owner and the Administrator of a Certificate of Completion_Contract Construction, REA Form 187, showing the total cost of the construction performed, the Owner shall make payment to the Bidder of all amounts to which the Bidder shall be entitled thereunder which shall not have been paid: Provided, however, that such final payment shall be made not later than ninety (90) days after the date of Completion of Construction of the Project, as specified in the Certificate of Completion, unless withheld because of the fault of the Bidder. b. The Bidder shall be paid on the basis of the number of Construction Units actually installed at the direction of the Owner shown by the inventory based on the staking sheets or structure lists; Provided, however, that the total cost shall not exceed the maximum Contract price for the construction of the Project as set forth in the Acceptance plus the costs of any additional change orders, unless such excess shall have been approved in writing by the Owner. c. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.a above, the Bidder may, by giving written notice thereof to the Owner, elect to receive payment in full for any Section of the Project upon: (1) completion of such Section as certified by the Engineer and approved by the Owner; (2) submission to the Owner of the releases of lien and the certificate referred to in Section 2 hereof; (3) approval by the Owner of the inventory in respect of such Section; and (4) submission to the Owner and the Administrator of the consent in writing by the Surety or Sureties, if any, on the Contractor's Bond to payment in full for such Section prior to Completion of the Project. If no Sections are designated in Article II, section 1c, the term Section shall mean for purposes of this subsection c and Article IV, section 3b only, a part of the Project as designated by the Owner which represents at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the maximum Contract price as stated in Article III, Section 1, and which is capable of being energized and operated by the Owner.
