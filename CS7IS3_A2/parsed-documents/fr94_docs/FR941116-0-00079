FR941116-0-00079 FR941116-0-00012 The Commission believes that the procedures for proceeding on an application for a market power determination should be tailored to the specifics of the case. Hence, the Commission will make no generic decisions here. The protestants should make their request for a hearing before an ALJ when they file their protests. The oil pipeline applicants may make their request after the protests are filed. The Commission is not establishing provisions for limited discovery. The oil pipeline and the protestants should file their case-in-chiefs and responsive pleadings without discovery. The Commission believes that the oil pipeline and the protestants should have sufficient information available from public sources or their own experience to submit their cases. Of course, the Commission encourages the informal exchange of information to expedite and facilitate the application process. The protestants may request discovery when their protests are filed. The oil pipeline applicants may request discovery after the protests are filed. Both requests must provide a full explanation for the need for discovery, a hearing, or both. X. Environmental Analysis The Commission is required to prepare a Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement for any action that may have a significant adverse effect on the human environment. 58 The Commission has categorically excluded certain actions from these requirements as not having a significant effect on the human environment. 59 The action taken here is procedural in nature and therefore falls within the categorical exclusions provided in the Commission's regulations. 60 Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environment assessment is necessary and will not be prepared in this rulemaking. 58 Order No. 486, Regulations Implementing the National Environmental Policy Act, 52 FR 47897 (Dec. 17, 1987), FERC Statutes and Regulations, Regulations Preambles 1986&hyph;1990 Â¶30,783 (1987). 59 18 CFR 380.4. 60 See 18 CFR 380.4(a)(2)(ii). XI. Reporting Flexibility Certification The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 61 generally requires the Commission to describe the impact that a rule would have on small entities or to certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. An analysis is not required if a rule will not have such an impact. 62 Most oil pipelines to whom the rule will apply do not fall within the definition of small entity. 63 Consequently, pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, the Commission certifies that the regulations will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 61 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. 62 5 U.S.C. 605(b). 63 Section 601(c) of the RFA defines a ``small entity'' as a small business, a small not-for-profit enterprise, or a small governmental jurisdiction. A ``small business'' is defined by referent to section 3 of the Small Business Act as an enterprise which is ``independently owned and operated and which is not dominant in its field of operation.'' 15 U.S.C. 632(a). XII. Information Collection Requirements The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) regulations 64 require that OMB approve certain information and recordkeeping requirements imposed by an agency. The information collection requirements in this rule are contained in FERC&hyph;550 ``Oil Pipeline Rates'' Tariff Filings'' (1902&hyph;0089). 64 5 CFR 1320.14. The Commission's Office of Pipeline Regulation uses the data collected in these information requirements to investigate the rates charged by oil pipeline companies subject to its jurisdiction, to determine the reasonableness of rates, and when appropriate prescribe just and reasonable rates. In addition, the information to be required by the rule would allow the Commission to determine if an oil pipeline lacks significant power in the relevant markets when it proposes to charge market-based rates. Because the adoption of the procedural rules will create an expected increase in the public reporting burden under FERC&hyph;550, the Commission is submitting a copy of the rule to OMB for its review and approval. Interested persons may obtain information on these reporting requirements by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415]. Comments on the requirements of this rule can be sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB (Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission). XIII. Effective Date The final rule will be effective January 1, 1995. List of Subjects in 18 CFR Part 348 Pipelines, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. By the Commission. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
