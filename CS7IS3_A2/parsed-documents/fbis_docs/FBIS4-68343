Dushenov, press secretary to Ioann, metropolitan of St. Petersburg and Ladoga: "Warning in Informant Report-Style"] [Text] Well, gentlemen, say what you wish, but there is no greater torment for an intelligent man than feeling that he has not fulfilled his civic duty, which compels him to report to high superiors--immediately and in detail--all the shortcomings and (God forbid!) seditious inclinations of his compatriots that he may have noted. It must have been this noble feeling that moved Mr. Gleb Yakunin recently to write an open letter to the president, which was published by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on 12 April of this year. All jokes aside, though! In the letter, written in the genre of a frankly shameless informant report, the author urges the president to initiate administrative and criminal proceedings against the highest hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church. "The patriarch," according to Mr. Yakunin, "covers up anticonstitutional activities... of pseudo-Orthodox chauvinists," while "the agreement signed by Patriarch Aleksiy II and Minister of Defense P.S. Grachev may potentially result" in "fascist ideology penetrating the Russian army." Metropolitan Kirill, chairman of the External Church Relations Department, was attacked by Yakunin for having dared to send SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA editors a letter containing the "seditious" phrase that he is "ready to work together for the good of our Fatherland and the Russian people." "The patriarchy," Yakunin draws the conclusion, "through Metropolitan Kirill officially announced its solidarity with the national-communist opposition." But the famous democrat reserved the most vicious slanderous attacks for the Most Reverend Ioann, metropolitan of St. Petersburg and Ladoga. The author of the denunciation accuses him of "preaching anti-Semitism and inflaming religious strife and enmity between peoples," and openly urges criminal proceedings against the most authoritative Russian archbishop under the famous Article 74 of the RSFSR Criminal Code. (Footnote 1) ("Congratulations, citizen, you lied," one famous literary character used to say in such situations.) What is the reason, however, for Mr. Yakunin's unstoppable rage of denunciation? It turns out that on 22 March 1994 a RUS PRAVOSLAVNAYA newspaper insert devoted its issue to discussion of the "forbidden" Jewish question. The key material in that issue was an article by His Eminence Ioann "Creators of Cataclysms," in which he answered questions and letters from readers, including foreign ones. Urging, by the way, that discussion of this topic be approached "without hatred and bitterness," "without preconceived conclusions," and without pinning insulting and unfounded labels onto opponents. Unfortunately, as the material in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA shows, this appeal went unheeded. Keeping in mind G.P. Yakunin's origins, we understand his interest in discussing the Jewish topic. Moreover, we share his concern in the part that incompetent consideration of this issue, as well as hushing it up without good reason, may be fraught with negative consequences for Russia's sociopolitical life. It is unclear, however, why at the same time some politicians persistently try to suppress public, pluralistic, comprehensive, and interested debate of this burning and topical problem. Against the background of the unprecedented groundless stream of accusations dumped on Metropolitan Ioann, permit us to pose a few questions to Mr. Yakunin as well. Such as: --Why does any attempt on the part of the public to touch on the "forbidden" topic and begin constructive discussion of it cause a hysterical reaction on the part of the groveling press? --Why does the unwritten "double standard" permit, for instance, Svanidze to feed with impunity the fruits of his wounded ethnic pride to multimillion television audiences--such as vulgar concoctions regarding "Zhirinovskiy the Jew"--while at the same time suppressing all attempts on the part of "outsiders" to discuss the Jewish question at a serious scientific-historic and moral-religious level instead of a kitchen-provincial one? --Why is the mean and unfounded lie of "Russian anti-Semitism," "Russian chauvinism," and "Russian imperialism" being spread so willingly by "democratic" mass media, while the slandered and plundered Russia is sliding deeper and deeper into the abyss of public chaos? One can ask many more such questions. Judging by all signs, neither the "democratic public" nor the powers that be apparently have any intention of answering them. On the other hand, there is still hope that the Russian people, awakening from decades of atheistic and cosmopolitan haze, will figure out on their own who is their enemy and who is their friend; who is a loving--albeit strict--shepherd, and who is a provocateur and a liar. As to Mr. Yakunin's exhortations to put Metropolitan Ioann on trial, they truly are superb! In conclusion we cannot refrain from the pleasure of quoting two excerpts which shed an especially clear light on Mr. Yakunin's complete theological and political incompetency. The first belongs to the holy saint John Chrysostom, to this day revered by the entire Universal Church (even Catholics) as one of the pillars of the Divine Truth. "A synagogue is a thieves' den and a lair of beasts," this holy man said 1,500 years ago (should we perhaps put him on trial, too, under Article 74?). "Demons inhabit it, and not only this place but also the very souls of Hebrews. Should we not avert ourselves from them as a universal disease and a sore for the entire universe? Is there any evil they have not committed? Is there a villainy or lawlessness that has not been surpassed by their infamous murders?... What should amaze us in them the most? Their dishonesty, or their cruelty and inhumanity?... If someone killed your son, tell me, would you be able to look at such person, to listen to him talk? The Jews killed the Son of your Lord, and you dare to hold court with them in one and the same place?" The second quote belongs to Henry Kissinger, the famous American politician of Jewish origin. "Anybody who has at least minimally seriously studied Russian history," he said recently, "knows that it was Russian nationalism that always ensured the integrity of the country and helped it deal with numerous enemies and troubles. Now the Russians have lost the huge empire they built. Could anyone expect a different reaction to this humiliation other than an explosion of nationalism? I see Russian nationalism as simply a reality of Russian life, which we should accept the way it is..." Very valuable advice for everyone who, like G.P. Yakunin, is blinded by hatred toward the Russian people and the Orthodox Church.
