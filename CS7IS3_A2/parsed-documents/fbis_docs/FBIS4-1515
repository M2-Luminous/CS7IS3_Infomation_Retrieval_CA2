Cheng Weigao said: Many reasons contribute to enterprises' deficits. We should wait, depend on nothing, and adopt different methods for them. As for enterprises that have been running in debt and have suffered serious losses for a long time, Cheng Weigao maintained: We should help them upgrade and update their products, accelerate technological transformation, and develop new products. Or we should help them use existing resources to carry out some other production. In the course of transforming mechanisms of enterprises and readjusting their production and operational structures, we should help unprofitable enterprises accelerate the readjustment of their organizational structures by encouraging them to incorporate or integrate themselves with others, to narrow their accounting units, to carry out the system of being run by the people but owned by the state, and to bring in foreign funds. For enterprises whose products are readily marketable, whose market prospects are relatively bright, but nonetheless suffer losses and are forced to stop production owing to a temporary lack of circulating funds, Cheng Weigao demanded: Such enterprises themselves should mete out plans for reducing losses, and governments and banks at all levels should help them tide over difficulties. In particular, for unprofitable enterprises which engage in production throughout the year and continue to sell their products, the unprofitable enterprises which engage in production on a season basis and sell their products throughout the year, and the enterprises whose products are related to the national economy and people's lives, the financial, tax, banking, industrial, commercial, and other related functional departments in all localities but suffer losses should give appropriate treatment to them within the scope of their powers. Cheng Weigao stressed: This year, most reform measures will be set forth. Party committees and governments at all levels should become even more liberated in their ideas, even more dynamic in reform, and better in mental state in order to help unprofitable enterprises surmount difficulties and get out of difficult state on the basis of conducting in-depth investigation and study.
