FR941205-0-00127 FR941205-0-00027 1991 Organic Methods Manual (EPA, 1991)␣One commenter requested a change in the scope of EPA Method 505 because of the detection limits for some method analytes. These changes included withdrawal of alachlor, atrazine and simazine, and addition of toxaphene. EPA is evaluating the detection limits in several methods. When this evaluation is complete, EPA may propose to withdraw approval of methods or modify the scope of methods, such as Method 505. In the interim, EPA does not agree that the scope of Method 505 should be changed to withdraw alachlor, atrazine and simazine. However, EPA agrees that analysis for these nitrogen-containing compounds may require use of a nitrogen-phosphorous detector (NPD) rather than the electron capture detector (ECD). Today's rule specifies that an NPD should be substituted for the ECD in Method 505 (or another approved method should be used) to determine alachlor, atrazine and simazine, if lower detection limits are required. EPA agrees with the comment about toxaphene. In today's rule EPA is correcting an omission in the 1993 proposal by continuing to approve Method 505 for toxaphene. However, EPA notes that the Method 505 MDL for toxaphene is very close to the MCL. To improve the sensitivity of the analysis analysts may wish to use Method 508 for toxaphene and other Method 505 analytes for which use of an NPD will not improve the sensitivity. Method 508 is very similar to Method 505 except that the MDLs are lower, because a larger sample volume is extracted. MCL compliance determination for PCBs requires that EPA method 505 or 508 be used as a screen for PCBs as Aroclors prior to quantitation as decachlorobiphenyl by EPA Method 508A. Three commenters requested that EPA switch the sequence of compliance methods for PCBs, i.e., use Method 508A to screen and Method 505 or 508 to quantify PCBs. The suggested change in the sequence of compliance methods is beyond the scope of this rule since it would require amending the MCL compliance determination sequence in 40 CFR 141.24(h)(13)(i)&hyph;(iii). Only Method 508A can measure decachlorobiphenyl, and §141.24(h)(13)(ii) specifically requires ``using Method 508A to quantify PCBs as decachlorobiphenyl''. It was suggested by a commenter that EPA include hexachloro- cyclopentadiene (HCP) in the scope of EPA Method 508. EPA agrees with the commenter, and will allow measurement of HCP with EPA Method 508. However, the analyst must show that the analyte recoveries and other criteria, which are specified for HCP in Section 9 of Method 508.1 are achieved using Method 508 procedures. This option will be described in the document, Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA, 1994d). 1993 EPA Inorganic Methods Manual (EPA, 1993a)␣A commenter asked what the differences were between Method 335.3 and the updated version, Method 335.4, since both versions require manual distillation of the sample to prepare it for measurement of cyanide. The technical differences between these methods are minor. EPA improved the automation of procedures in Method 335.4, and added the option to use a labor-saving distillation procedure. The distillation option is described in Method 335.4, and it is approved and described for other spectrophotometric methods in Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA, 1994d). Two commenters objected to replacement of Method 335.3 with 335.4. The objection appeared to be based on the mistaken belief that Method 335.4 requires a manual distillation of the sample to prepare it for measurement of cyanide and that the earlier version, Method 335.3, did not. EPA has never allowed spectrophotometric measurements of cyanide in water samples without manual distillation of the sample using SM 4500&hyph;CN&hyph;C (cf. 40 CFR 136.3, Table 1B; 59 FR 4507, January 31, 1994; and 57 FR 31839, July 17, 1992). Commenters may have been misled by a discussion in Method 335.3 of an alternate ultraviolet (UV) digestion procedure that does not require manual distillation. EPA has never approved this optional UV procedure for compliance measurements of cyanide, because EPA has no data to show that UV digestion would not provide inaccurate results that underestimate the level of contamination. To avoid manual distillation of the sample, laboratories may use a selective electrode method for cyanide.
