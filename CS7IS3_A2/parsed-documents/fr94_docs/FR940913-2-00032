FR940913-2-00032 FR940913-2-00023 York filed a ``Petition for Waiver,'' dated June 16, 1994, in accordance with section 430.27 of 10 CFR Part 430. The Department published in the Federal Register on July 14, 1994, York's petition and solicited comments, data and information respecting the petition. 59 FR 35918. York also filed an ``Application for Interim Waiver'' under ยง430.27(g) which DOE granted on July 9, 1994. 59 FR 35918, July 14, 1994. No comments were received concerning either the ``Petition for Waiver'' or the ``Interim Waiver.'' The Department consulted with The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning the York Petition. The FTC did not have any objections to the issuance of the waiver to York. Assertions and Determinations York's Petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition of the burner and the starting of the circulating air blower. York requests the allowance to test using a 30-second blower time delay when testing its P2DP, PBKD, and XED02 lines of induced draft furnaces. York states that since the 30-second delay is indicative of how these models actually operate and since such a delay results in an approximately 0.5 percent improvement in energy efficiency, the petition should be granted. Under specific circumstances, the DOE test procedure contains exceptions which allow testing with blower delay times of less than the prescribed 1.5-minute delay. York indicates that it is unable to take advantage of any of these exceptions for its P2DP, PBKD, and XED02 lines of induced draft furnaces. Since the blower controls incorporated on the York furnaces are designed to impose a 30-second blower delay in every instance of start up, and since the current provisions do not specifically address this type of control, DOE agrees that a waiver should be granted to allow the 30-second blower time delay when testing the York P2DP, PBKD, and XED02 lines of induced draft furnaces. Accordingly, with regard to testing the P2DP, PBKD, and XED02 lines of induced draft furnaces, today's Decision and Order exempts York from the existing provisions regarding blower controls and allows testing with the 30-second delay. It is, therefore, ordered that: (1) The ``Petition for Waiver'' filed by York International Corporation (Case No. F&hyph;073) is hereby granted as set forth in paragraph (2) below, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (3), (4), and (5). (2) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of Appendix N of 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, York International Corporation, shall be permitted to test its P2DP, PBKD, and XED02 lines of induced draft furnaces on the basis of the test procedure specified in 10 CFR Part 430, with modifications set forth below:
