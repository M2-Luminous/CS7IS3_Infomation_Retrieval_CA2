This was stated by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to an ITAR-TASS correspondent upon his arrival today in Athens. Russia, A. Kozyrev confirmed, is a permanent member of the Security Council, and the United Nations cannot make such a decision without us. According to the minister, he has the impression that "we were not, at any rate, fully informed about the content of the NATO decision." "But we will not allow ourselves, no matter how much anyone might try, to be deflected from our chosen course toward a strategic partnership, about which there was a conversation quite recently between the presidents of Russia and the United States in Moscow, or to be deterred from the efforts that Russia has been making for the past 2-3 weeks in order to promote its initiative in Bosnia. The initiative, A. Kozyrev indicated, is aimed at strengthening the security zones, including, above all, the security zone in Sarajevo, and the withdrawal of the sides' armed formations and heavy weapons. Vitaliy Churkin, who is now the Russian President's special representative, the Russian minister continued, is personally in the conflict zone and is conducting intricate talks. In the minister's opinion, it is necessary to follow most attentively the course of these talks and to listen to the news coming from there, since it is precisely at these talks that the question of lifting the siege of Sarajevo and removing armaments is really being tackled. Speaking about relations between Russia and the Republic of Macedonia, the minister declared that Russia was ready, in principle, to make its good offices available to both states -- Greece and the Republic of Macedonia -- so as to help them find mutually acceptable solutions to the problems of relations between them.
