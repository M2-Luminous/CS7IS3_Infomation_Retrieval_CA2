FBIS4-29170 "dreas116__a94006" FBIS-EAS-94-116-A Daily Report 16 June 1994 ANNEX Japan Continued Reportage on Reaction to DPRK Issues Continued Reportage on Reaction to DPRK Issues DPRK `Tough' Nuclear Position Viewed OW1606090794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 16 June Morning Edition p 8 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1606090794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN ["Summary" of interview with Yi Tong-pok, former special assistant to the ROK prime minister, by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN's Yukiyoshi Fujimura in Seoul; date not given; first paragraph is NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN introduction] [Text] The ROK has so far taken a generally calm attitude with regard to the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected development of nuclear arms. However, after North Korea started to adopt a tough position, beginning with the replacement of nuclear fuel rods, quarters concerned and experts in South Korea are beginning to take a more pessimistic view that "may be the suspicions are true." One such person is Yi Tong-pok, former special assistant to the prime minister, and spokesman for the ROK delegation during the North-South prime ministerial talks. We interviewed Yi on what the DPRK will do next. [Fujimura] How do you view the tough attitude adopted by North Korea? [Yi] Looking at the recent exchanges, I do not think they are merely using the development of nuclear arms as a "nuclear card." They have now clearly indicated their intention to develop nuclear arms. [Fujimura] What do you think is the present state of their development of nuclear weapons? [Yi] North Korea already possesses enough plutonium to make one to three atomic bombs. Given another two years, they will actually be able to make nuclear bombs. They are also building two new reactors. Compared to existing reactors, one will have 10 times the capacity of current reactors, and the other, 40 times. Together, they can produce 200 kg of plutonium each year. This means that if things go on like this, North Korea will become a nuclear superpower in three or four years. [Fujimura] Will North Korea compromise under the pressure of economic sanctions? [Yi] Because the United States has been sending the wrong signals to North Korea recently, North Korea is taking the United States lightly. It probably thinks that the United States is incapable of imposing economic sanctions. [Fujimura] Do you think there is a possibility that North Korea will start a war? [Yi] I cannot really say the possibility does not exist, but I think the possibility is very slim. North Korea has merely conducted test launches of its missiles; they are not yet ready for active deployment. With their present military capability, they are quite incapable of launching an attack.
