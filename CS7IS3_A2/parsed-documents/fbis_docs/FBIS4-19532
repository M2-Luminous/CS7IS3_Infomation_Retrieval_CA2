[passage omitted] So far, Geneva has officially applied to house the new WTO. However, Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt told journalists that he wants to prepare the Federal Government's application for Bonn. If there are no reservations by the ministries concerned, the cabinet could decide on Bonn's application for the WTO headquarters before the summer recess, Rexrodt said. He wants to announce the German application in a letter to Sutherland in order to document Germany's interest in the WTO seat for the preparatory committee. As a former capital, Bonn meets all the requirements, Rexrodt said, promoting his proposal. It has the necessary administrative and conference capacities, and most of the WTO countries already have diplomatic missions in Bonn. What also speaks in Bonn's favor is that no major international organization has its seat in Germany at the moment, which has a tradition of advocating free world trade and is one of the largest trading nations in the world. The Swiss delegation in Marrakesh was astonished at Germany's interest in the WTO seat. The Swiss Government is taking Bonn's application, competing with Geneva, seriously. Experts say that trying to keep the WTO in Geneva might prove expensive for Switzerland. A new office building will also be needed in Geneva, because the existing GATT headquarters will be too small for the WTO. Sutherland wants to discuss conditions with the competitors over the next few months. In accordance with its share in world trade, Germany is paying some 12 percent toward the cost of GATT and the future WTO. The new organization is to start work as early as 1 January 1995.
