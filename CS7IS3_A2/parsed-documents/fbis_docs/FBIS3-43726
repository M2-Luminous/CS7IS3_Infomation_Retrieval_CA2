The amendment of Article 85 of the Burundi Constitution should enable the National Assembly to elect a new president of the Republic to replace late President Melchior Ndadaye, who was assassinated last October. According to the Rwandan Embassy in the Burundi capital, the demonstrators were dispersed by security forces. While being dispersed, the demonstrators attacked the premises of the Rwandan Embassy in Bujumbura which they ransacked after breaking windows and smashing doors. The Rwandan Embassy, however, has given assurances that all Rwandan diplomats in Bujumbura are safe and sound. The Rwandan chancery and other diplomatic missions in Bujumbura invited the Burundi Ministry of Foreign Affairs to visit the scene to see the damage caused by the demonstrators to the Rwandan diplomatic mission in Bujumbura.
