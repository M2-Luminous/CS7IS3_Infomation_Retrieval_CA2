During a lunch with the Costa Rican Union of Private Enterprise Chambers and Associations (UCCAEP), the man who will be governing Costa Rica beginning 8 May warned in his administration he will seek a "true commercial opening." "We have opened the economy, but we need greater vitality to compete more intelligently with greater courage, not with lower wages," Figures said, adding he will strengthen and improve the quality of social programs. He promised businessmen, however, he will respect "macroeconomic balances" by lowering the fiscal and commercial deficits and will promote tax reform not to impose more taxes but to improve the collection of existing ones. UCCAEP President Marco Vinicio Ruiz said "the key of success" for Costa Rican society depends fundamentally on achieving a successful and high quality incorporation into the world economy. "This can only be attained if the country advances in congruence with improving competitiveness and Costa Ricans' quality of life," the business group leader said.
