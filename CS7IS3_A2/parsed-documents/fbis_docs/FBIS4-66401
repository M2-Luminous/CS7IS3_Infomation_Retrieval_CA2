A messaging system is an easy-to-use voice mail system that permits a customer to leave a recorded message for a responsible person when he cannot come to the phone. Thus the job of receiving and responding to phone calls is eliminated. Moreover, the system can be used as a fast and sure communication network for workers within a company utilizing the functions of batch announcement or voice mail. With the rising mood of productivity improvement, the system will be employed widely by on-site as well as off-site employees enabling them to interface with customers from inside and outside the company and its service department. A "messaging system" typically has a recording function which allows a customer to leave a recorded message for a responsible person when he is absent from the office, and basic voice mail functions. The product that can be as simple as a voice mail system is getting quite a bit of attention among companies aiming at increased productivity. The system can be interfaced with a combination of push button telephones or a PBX. If the system's recording function is utilized, then the overwhelming job of answering the phones will be nearly eliminated. Also it is possible to use the system as a communication network for employees including off-site workers by using batch announcement and voice mail functions. Recorded messages can be retrieved with human voice quality, close to that of the speaker, from any place including outside the company, at any time as long as a telephone is accessible. The product will be employed largely by those companies busy with answering calls from customers. The companies and departments involved with on-site and off-site work such as customer service will also likely use the system quite heavily. Reduction Of One Hour Overtime Active users who make full use of the messaging system are getting improved results. For example, a trading company, Kyune and Nargel Japan (headquartered in Tokyo, Japan) with a total employment of 50 people including on-site and off-site workers, uses the system and they have "reduced overtime for each worker by at least one hour a day." The initial investment including telephone equipment was ¥5 million, but the cost was recuperated in about two months. After two months, the system reduced the costs. "The business can no longer be managed without the messaging system." Air-conditioning installation company, Angei Industry (headquartered in Tokyo), also evaluates the result by saying, "productivity for on-site office workers has improved. The efficiency for off-site workers is also improved greatly by communicating using voice mail. Wasteful phone calls are reduced and the amount of our telephone bill is lowered too." Market Participation By Each Maker Intensifying Product Variety Since Matsushita Communication Industry introduced the "Simple Messaging System 2 WAY" in April, 1991, which aimed at market penetration for messaging systems, gradually each maker has been entering the market. In 1993, each maker has come up with a variety of products ranging from push button telephones to PBX interfaces (see table 1 for product list). Table 1.

Matsushita Communication Industry has already delivered almost 6,000 units of the 2 WAY Series to customers. Other makers are also saying, "for new push button telephone sales, the market will grow at a rate of 20-30 percent and installations will also increase" (Manager of Nittsu Industry). "Within the year, over 1,000 systems will be sold," said the Manager of Oki Electronics Industry. That is the overall situation. Although there aren't makers other than Matsushita that have sold over 1,000 systems, it is projected the day will soon come when the combined sales of all makers reaches over 10,000 systems. Voice Is Digitized, Stored, And Processed Looking at its configuration, the messaging system has a built-in push button telephone in the main unit or connected to a digital interface integrating a single system. That is because incoming calls are set initially to connect to the telephone via the messaging system when the telephone call is received by the recorder. The voice to be recorded is digitized (bit rate 16k - 64k/second, differs for each maker), stored, and processed. Because of the digital sound processing, it became easy to send the voice data to a specified address or to copy it, allowing a voice mail function or batch announcement to be easily provided to users. A messaging system has a built-in hard disk and memory device, and the system is operated by establishing the same kind of individual mailbox that is seen in the traditional model. A call can be selected for either automatic recording, meaning that when the telephone is connected, it will record automatically, or for manual recording by which a caller can choose to record by pressing a specified button. After recording, if the address is specified by pressing a button, then voice will be recorded into the specified mail box. Input and output of voice mail from off-site is possible by entering a user's ID or personal identification number or by calling a separate telephone number to which the messaging system is connected. Easy To Use Functions Have Been Added to the System Also, even when voice mail (including recording) is received, if a message indicating arrival of mail is not displayed, the user may miss the message. For this reason, messaging systems have various message announcement functions. It is standard that for on-site use, a lamp will be turned on to indicate the arrival of a message. The lamp will be turned off once the message is retrieved. It is possible to verify the status of mail sent to an off-site worker, that is, you can determine whether or not the message has been received. For the purpose of mail status verification, a wall indicator on which the status of mail can be displayed is available as an option (see table 1). To announce the arrival of mail to off-site workers, a function connecting the system to a paging system or mobile phone can be added as an option. Messaging systems also include several other functions to make them more user friendly. For example, when recording messages, people sometimes speak for a long time. For this reason, when the message is sent, an additional recording function may add a comment to the content of the message (when message is retrieved, comment is heard initially) or there may be a skip function allowing the user to skip messages in order to speed up playback. There is also a function to transfer the call to some other extension number after retrieving the mail, so that the caller can talk to a responsible party in the company. With the addition of these various functions which enhance the system's recording ability, they can be more effectively utilized in a corporate environment. Improvement of On-Site Work By Recorded Communication A real effect of recorded communication can be found in the good example of leaving mail for on-site workers who receive a call for the absent responsible party at a company. Traditionally, if an on-site office worker receives a call from a customer, the following will take place: (1) memo will be taken while call is received; (2) after the telephone conversation, summary of telephone conversation is written and message will be written; (3) the message will be delivered to the responsible person; (4) a call is received from a responsible person; (5) or go to the responsible person; (6) deliver the content of the message. If an emergency call occurs, then the person who receives the call must wait patiently for a responsible person. Meanwhile, the work of an on-site office worker is interrupted because he is waiting for a call from the responsible person. On the other hand, by using a messaging system, the on-site office worker can record the message from the customer (automatic or manual), and the voice mail can be transferred to a responsible person by pressing a button. In the case of an emergency, it is possible to immediately announce the arrival of mail to an appropriate person by use of a paging system. After paging, the off-site worker can listen to the message by accessing the mail. Thus frequent calls that an off-site worker must place in order to get a message at the office are eliminated, and responsibility for the on-site office worker who is sometimes obliged to deliver an emergency message to an absent off-site worker is reduced. As a result the on-site office worker can devote more time to his own work. Support the Telephone Interface For Operator Substitution To support the telephone interface, various telephone operator substitution functions are provided. For example, as a standard function the messaging system can act as an answering machine serving individual extensions or each user. Also, there are quite a few products which are equipped with "substitution call during busy line," or "substitution for non-responsive call" in which the system substitutes for its operator function to obtain the caller's message while the line is busy or after several rings when an incoming call does not produce a response. The answering machine function is especially effective for a company which has business operations overseas involving time differences. The "individual answering machine function alone is quite helpful, and the use of a messaging system has become quite important" (manager of Newsweek International). Also another application of the answering machine function is to receive orders during off-business hours. With NEC's messaging system the caller can select a menu item by pressing a button to provide voice information in order to retrieve appropriate information based on the purpose of the call. For example, travel agencies can use the telephone system as a telephone-based guide system. Progression To Voice Mail And Batch Announcement Although messaging systems have several enhanced functions, "many companies decide to use it because of its recording function" (Nittsu Industry). That is the real reason to decide to use the system. As usage increases, "batch announcement applications will increase too" (Matsushita Communication Industry). Utilization will also change as demand increases. In reality, batch announcement or voice mail are utilized, but "the ratio of these applications is about 10 percent for the announcing function, and information exchange among colleagues at the site and voice mail is about 40 percent," said one of the users at Angei Industry). Applications for communication networking using voice mail and batch announcing have been surfacing. Messaging Systems Do Not Do Everything However, in order to smoothly operate a messaging system, it is necessary for a decision maker to play a wise game to enforce the system and to get user cooperation. For example, Kyune and Nargel cited above, decided to eliminate all memo messages when they decided to employ a messaging system. When a female office worker received a phone call, memo pads were not accessible on the desk so that voice mail use was enforced. Thus, if an off-site employee calls, nobody will find any memos to read. Such an environment forced the off-site workers to use the messaging system. In order to fully utilize the system, "the decision maker must be prepared psychologically to become an expert for this system" (Angei Industry). At Angei Industry, if off-site workers would like to communicate with each other, and if a caller forgets the other party's mailbox number, the individual mailbox number is announced at the beginning of the call, so that the call will be enabled. Unless a real user's situation is witnessed, real problems will not be fully understood, and even if the messaging system is understood, if utilization of the functions is not fully grasped, it will be difficult to act on the situation. In reality, "if the purpose of utilization is not fully understood by the employees, full use may not be expected" (unspecified company). Naive thinking may not bring effective results. Also if the recording function is utilized in the messaging system, privacy considerations must be included. If a caller can easily leave a message it may raise issues of personal privacy. Each maker typically adds some note indicating, "please first include brief introductory warning to a caller, and then start recording." In real situations the recorded message, "your voice message will be left . . .," which requires an optional response from a caller, may be sufficient. In order to protect privacy some makers are studying inclusion of an optional "periodic beep during the call which signals the caller that their voice is being recorded." Future Topic On the System Connections Between Distant Areas As utilization of the system increases, problems increase too. For example, if each department at the company employs a messaging system, then the necessity of connecting between the main office and branch offices to cover a wider area will arise. Present messaging systems do not have an ability for such integration connecting all local systems. For this reason, voice mail can not be transmitted between each local system. If a communication network which includes all the branch offices and the main office is desired, then it will be necessary to consider the voice mail service provided by VAN companies such as Marubeni Telecom or Recruit. However, their service does not include the recording function. Because of this the decision maker must consider whether the recording function or the voice mail function is more important.
