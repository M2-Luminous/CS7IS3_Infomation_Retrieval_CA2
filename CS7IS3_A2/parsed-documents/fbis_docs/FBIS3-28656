Bangaoil] [Excerpts] The Philippine economy grew by 2.3 percent in 1993 but fell short of the 2.5 percent downscaled target by the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA). In a press conference yesterday, NEDA officials led by Economic Planning Secretary Cielito F. Habito said the gross national product (GNP) growth rate last year made them stick to the 4.5 percent in 1994. They pointed out that the GNP growth in 1993 reflected a "definite" improvement from the 1 percent real growth in 1992. "The 4.5 percent for 1994 under the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan is achievable," Habito assured in a separate interview. The growth, according to the NEDA officials, was primarily led by the private sector. Consumer purchases, investment and exports all posted improvement. The domestic economy likewise improved in 1993. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 1.7 percent from 0.1 percent in 1992. NEDA said this shows that the local economy has gathered steam. [passage omitted] NEDA cited the improvement in power supply as a "big factor" in the economic growth last year. Although the year started with a "debilitating" power crisis which kept the economy from growing in the first six months, the fast-tracked power projects came on stream to improve the power situation in the last two quarters, the officials said. Net inflow from abroad amounted to P [Philippine pesos] 21.8 billion, showing a 27.5 percent improvement compared to that in 1992. In real peso terms, however, imports grew by 13.7 percent outstripping total exports which increased by 9 percent according to NEDA director Ofelia Templo. Templo said the disparity may be corrected this year when export growth in real peso term is expected to reach 11.2 percent and import growth to slow down to 12 percent. All production sectors showed better performance in 1993. The agriculture sector initially provided the push in the first two quarters. When power supply improved in the third and fourth quarter, the industry sector played a more dominant role. Among the production sectors, the services sector recorded the highest growth of 2 percent compared to 1 percent in 1992. The services subsectors -- except for the government services -- improved, communications went up by 6.5 percent, private services by 2.9 percent and trade by 2.4 percent. The output of the combined agriculture, fishery and forestry sector went up by 1.5 percent, showing a turn around from the 0.1 percent decrease in 1992. Growth came from palay [unhusked rice] which went up by 7.9 percent, livestock at 4.7 percent, poultry by 6 percent, and corn which grew by 1.8 percent. Among the industry subsectors, construction growth showed the highest at 4.5 percent. According to the NEDA officials, this was mainly due to higher public construction growth as well as the turn around in private sector construction activities. [passage omitted] Growth on the demand side was marked by a strong export performance. In real terms, merchandise exports expanded by 13 percent led by semi-conductors and electronic microcircuits. [passage omitted] Investments in fixed capital grew by 8.6 percent which is slightly lower than the 9.2 percent in 1992, though marked this time by a huge increase in private construction which grew by 7.1 percent. To stimulate the growth of the production sector, NEDA proposed some measures which include: -- Ensure the normalization of power supply; -- Vigorously implement the key commercial crop development program to increase the production of high-value crops; and -- Undertake intensive promotional campaign to attract more tourist investors into the country.
