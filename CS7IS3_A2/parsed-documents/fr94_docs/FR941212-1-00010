FR941212-1-00010 FR941212-1-00007 Executive Order 12612 The proposed rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under E.O. 12612. Executive Order 12866 The proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. Paperwork Reduction Act The proposed rule contains a collection of information requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. A request for review of the forms has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to be 1.15 hours per response (form). The burden on the U.S. Reporter will vary depending on the number of forms that must be submitted in a given reporting period; this ranges from 1 to 225 forms. The estimated burden of 1.15 hours per form includes the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Comments from the public regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information should be addressed to: Director, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BE&hyph;1), U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; and to the Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officer for the Department of Commerce. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Assistant General Counsel for Legislation and Regulation, Department of Commerce, has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, under the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), that the proposed rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Because it raises the exemption level for filing the survey, it will actually reduce the reporting requirements of smaller entities.
