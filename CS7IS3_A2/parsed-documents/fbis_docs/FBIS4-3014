It is the first time that Taiwan has been hit with trade sanctions of any kind from any nation. Lien told lawmakers that this is a selective action running counter to fair and just principle as well as ignoring the concerted effort the ROC [Republic of China] Government and people have made in ecological and wildlife protection. Lien's reaction came a couple of hours after U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the measure to subject Taiwan to sanctions on the grounds that the island failed to satisfactorily end illegal commerce in rhino horns and tiger parts. The ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its deep regret and dissatisfaction with the U.S. Government's obviously unfair and unjust sanction of the ROC, it said.
