Landsbergis said Lithuania should already use the rights given by NATO's Partnership for Peace plan and must invite NATO experts to observe the situation in and around the Baltic region. At a press conference Monday [7 February], the opposition leader said the step is necessary because Russia concentrates its military force in the Kaliningrad region, delays the withdrawal of its troops from the Baltics and creates its army bases in Belarus. Landsbergis said Lithuanian leaders have not asked the alliance for help because they think the step may be interpreted as a challenge and may be annoying to Russia. In Landsbergis' words, despite all statements by Western leaders that they do not want to set new borders in Europe, the continent is divided into three parts. The opposition leader said the first and "safe" part of the continent is Western Europe, which comprises members of the European Union, NATO and "those on the threshold." "Russia-dominated Eurasia" makes up the second part, he said. The third, "exhausted" intermediate zone may turn to either side. The countries that belong to this zone are unwilling to be swallowed by the ruble zone or a military union with Russia, but they face such a threat, the opposition leader said. Hence, Landsbergis said, Lithuania and other countries in this zone must make up their minds on how to regard Partnership for Peace - as a substitute for NATO membership or as a prerequisite for it.
