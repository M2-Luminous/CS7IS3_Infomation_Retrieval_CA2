The intended effect of this notice is to solicit applications for FY 1994 and award grants before the end of the FY. The purpose of the grant program is to establish and operate centers for rural technology or cooperative development. DATES: The deadline for receipt of a preapplication is August 31, 1994. Preapplications received after that date will not be considered for FY 1994 funding. ADDRESSES: Entities wishing to apply for assistance should contact Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) State Offices to receive further information and copies of the preapplication package.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jennifer Barton, Loan Specialist, Community Facilities Division, Room 6304, South Agriculture Building, 14th and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20250&hyph;0700, Telephone: (202) 720&hyph;1504. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Refer to the interim rule for 7 CFR Part 4284&hyph;F, published elsewhere in today's Federal Register , for the information collection requirements of the rule and this notice. This interim rule provides details on what information must be contained in the preapplication package. The RTDG program is authorized by Section 310B (f) through (h) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1932). The RTDG program will improve the economic conditions in rural areas by promoting development and commercialization of new services, products, processes, and enterprises. Grants may be used to pay up to 75 percent of the cost of the project and administrative costs; the applicant must contribute at least 25 percent. RTDG grants are competitive and shall be awarded to nonprofit institutions and public bodies based on specific selection criteria, as required by legislation and set out in 7 CFR Part 4284&hyph;F. Project selection will be given to those projects that contribute the most to the improvement of economic conditions in rural areas. Preferences will be given to those projects that will create industries or agribusinesses, increase employment, stem the flow of outmigration, and increase the tax base in the areas to be served. Applicants must provide data to support these criteria. The information submitted should provide an accurate picture of the economic conditions of the rural areas to be served. The Agency will use the information collected to select the best projects for funding. The interim rule published elsewhere in today's Federal Register contains more detailed information on the selection criteria. 1994 Application Submission Due to the short application period for FY 1994 funds, qualified applicants should begin the preapplication process as soon as possible. The highest ranking applications in each State may be recommended by FmHA State Directors and referred to the National Office for approval authority. The National Office will provide funds for projects based on ranking criteria and availability of funds. Grants will be awarded by September 30, 1994. Successful applicants will be notified by the FmHA State Office or the RDA National Office. Preapplications must include a clear statement of the goal(s) and objective(s) of the project and a plan which describes the proposed project as required by the statute and 7 CFR 4284&hyph;F. The plan must contain specific criteria which is necessary to carry out the intent of the program. Dated: August 8, 1994. Wilbur T. Peer, Acting Administrator, Rural Development Administration.
