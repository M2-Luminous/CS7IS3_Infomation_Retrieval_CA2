The status quo of North Korea's missile development is gaining much interest after foreign news reported that North Korea is developing new ground-to-ground missiles tentatively named "Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2" with ranges from 2,000 to 3,500 km. In connection with this, a government intelligence source said, "It is true that North Korea is developing new missiles with a range of 2,000 to 3,500 km. ROK and U.S. intelligence authorities are closely tracking this." With North Korea's development of new missiles, the first thing of concern is the relationship between the already known Nodong Nos. 1 and 2, and Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2. North Korea began developing the Nodong No. 1 in 1989 and successfully test-launched it for the first time in May 1993. It has a range of 1,000 km which covers Tokyo, Japan but has not been deployed to an actual fighting position. The existence of the Nodong No. 2 was first known in last year's U.S. Senate report, but its specifications have not yet been confirmed. Its range is estimated to be 1,500 to 2,000 km and a prototype is expected to be introduced next year. The Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2 are the newest missiles discovered at a missile research center in Sanum-tong, Pyongyang by a U.S. spy satellite in February 1994. That was the first time the U.S. spy satellite discovered the missiles stacked in the open air with improved Scud B missiles and Nodong No. 1's. Judging from the size of the propellants, Taepodong No. 1 is estimated to have a range of 2,000 km, and Taepodong No. 2 approximately 3,500 km. Considering that the range of the Taepodong No. 1 is estimated to be 2,000 km, ROK and U.S. intelligence officials are reportedly closely analyzing the possibility of this being the Nodong No. 2. Specialists are focusing their attention to the background of the fact that North Korea developed various types of new missiles in only one year and keeps expanding the ranges of missiles. Usually, it takes several years to develop just one type of missile and it is also questionable that North Korea keeps expanding the ranges, although only 1,000 km would cover the Korean peninsula and major regions of Japan. Specialists believe that, as in the case of Nodong Nos. 1 and 2, the new missiles are being developed at the order of Middle Eastern countries, including Iran, for exports to the region, or are aimed to cover major U.S. bases in the Pacific, including Guam. Others also point out that these may be false prototypes considering that North Korea displayed them in the open air knowing that they were under the surveillance of U.S. spy satellites. Specialists analyze that even if North Korea develops and deploys Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2 in actual fighting, these will be of less threat to South Korea than Scud B or improved Scub B's because, like Nodong Nos. 1 and 2, Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2 also use a Scud B as the main body but reduce the weight of warheads to expand the range, and thus their accuracy and destructive power are inferior to those of the Scud B. However, ROK and U.S. authorities believe that if North Korea's missile development continues with this trend, it may be able to develop strategic mid-range ballistic missiles with a 4,000 to 5,000-km range in the near future and create missile-phobia in Northeast Asia. The authorities are seeking various countermeasures while closely watching North Korea's missile development trend. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Status of Development of Ground-to-Ground Missiles by North Korea | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Name of Missile |Range (km) |Weight of Warhead |Year Produced | | | |(kg) | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Scud B |320-340 |1,000 |1985 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Improved Scud B |500 |700-800 |1989 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nodong No. 1 |1,000 |800 |1993 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nodong No. 2 |1,500-2,000 |? |1995 (projection) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Taepodong No. 1 |2,000 |? |? | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Taepodong No. 2 |3,500 |? |? | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
