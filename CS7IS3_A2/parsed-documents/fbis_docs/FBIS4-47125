Goods and services hold approximately equal shares of its volume, and about 7 percent -- net (less state subsidies) taxes on products, and on imports to which added-value tax, excise and import duties apply. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Trln rub. |In % of total |Reference: 1993 i-| | | | |n % of total | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gross domestic pr-|142 |100 |100 | |oduct | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including: commod-|63.3 |44.6 |49 | |ity production | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |service production|69.2 |48.7 |42 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |net taxes on prod-|9.5 |6.7 |9 | |ucts and imports | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- The proportion of services in the structure of the GDP continues to increase, and the relative proportion of net taxes on products and imports continues to decrease. In the 1st quarter they constituted respectively 47.8 percent and 8 percent. On the whole for January-April of this year, the decrease in the gross domestic product was 17 percent. The drop was caused by a further cut in output, work and services in the physical production sectors. The composite price index (GDP index-deflator) in January-April of this year was 705 percent as compared to the January-April 1993 level. Industry In January-April of this year, Russian industry produced goods worth R77 trillion at existing prices, including R21 trillion worth in April. The physical production volume, as compared with January-April last year, decreased by 25.4 percent, including a 26.9 percent decrease in April (in January-April 1993, it decreased by 18.6 percent, including a 16.4 percent decrease in April). The average daily output in April of this year, as compared with the same month last year, decreased by 25.2 percent, and as compared with March of this year -- by 3.3 percent. The dynamics of industrial products output by months of 1992-1994 can be seen from the following graph: (in percent of the corresponding month of 1991) The production volume decreased to the greatest extent in the sectors producing primarily goods for investment purposes and non-food consumer goods. For example, while in the fuel-energy sectors the output of goods, during the period of the year that had elapsed, decreased by 11 percent, and of the food industry -- by 21 percent, in machine building the decrease was 45 percent, in chemicals and petrochemicals -- by 35 percent, the timber, woodworking and pulp-and-paper industry and industrial building materials -- by 32 percent and in the light industry sector -- by 39 percent. The number of enterprises having prolonged shutdowns of all or some production facilities increased. While in January of this year they numbered 3,800, in April there were over 5,000. The main reason for the shutdowns were difficulties in selling the products because of the consumers' inability to pay. In January-April 1994, of the 406 most important types of products, recorded in urgent returns, the production volume, as compared with January-April 1993: Increased for 24 items (including iron-ore pellets, coking equipment, cash registers, sulfur, parquetry, ceramic floor tiles, cotton fabric, freezers, mayonnaise, sausage items, cheese and brynza [sheep-milk cheese], live and salted fish, cognac, toothpaste), or 6 percent of the total number; Decreased for 377 items, or 93 percent of the total number. In this case, the output of 283 items (70 percent of the total number) decreased by one-fourth and over, among them: lubricating oil, rolled sheet metal, roll-formed steel, steel pipes, steam, gas and hydraulic turbines, diesels and diesel-generators, freight and passenger railcars, city telephone communication cables, metal cutting machine tools, press-forging machines, trolleybuses, tractors, rolling bearings, mineral fertilizers, pesticides, synthetic dyes, synthetic resins and plastics, chemical fibers and filaments, synthetic rubbers, motor vehicle tires, lumber, wood-fiber and wood-chip boards, cardboard, cement, prefabricated reinforced concrete structures, wall materials, asbestos board, asbestos, ceramic plumbing items, fabric of all types except cotton, hosiery items, knitted outer wear, garment items, footwear, sewing and washing machines, electric vacuum cleaners, tape recorders, radio-receiving devices, television sets, cereal and macaroni items. No computer or computer-control complexes, cutters, shunting or industrial diesel locomotives, scrapers or harvesters were produced in the elapsed period of the year. Standard of Living Income of the population. The monetary income of the population in January-April of this year amounted to R78 trillion and was 8.5-fold higher than in the corresponding period of 1993. The available monetary income (income less compulsory payments), based on the consumer price index, rose by approximately 12 percent. In April 1993, 26 percent of the population had average per capita monetary incomes of up to R10,000 a month, 40 percent -- from R10,000-R20,000, 27 percent -- from R20,000 to R40,000 and 7 percent -- over R40,000. The coefficient of concentration of incomes (Dow Jones index) in April 1994 was 0.311 (in April 1993 -- 0.353). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Distribution of Total Volume of Monetary Income by Population Groups (in p-| |ercent) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |April | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1992 |1993 |1994 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |All monetary inco-|100 |100 |100 | |mes of the popula-| | | | |tion | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including groups of the population (20% each) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |first (with lowes-|10.6 |6.8 |7.8 | |t incomes) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |second |15.3 |11.6 |12.7 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |third |19.2 |16.4 |17.3 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |fourth |23.8 |23.2 |23.4 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |fifth (with highe-|31.1 |42.0 |38.8 | |st incomes) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- The mass of monetary income of the fifth group of the population exceeded the mass of monetary income of the first group in April 1992 by a factor of 2.9, 1993 -- by a factor of 6.2 and 1994 -- a factor of 5. The change in amount of the subsistence minimum for the population of the Russian Federation in 1994 (determined in accordance with the methodology of the Russian Ministry of Labor) is shown in the following table (on the average -- thous. rubles per month): ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | |including | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Entire popula-|Fit for work |Pensioners |Children | | |tion | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |January |47.2 |53.1 |33.3 |47.7 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |February |54.8 |61.6 |38.6 |55.3 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |March |60.4 |67.9 |42.6 |61.0 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |April |66.5 |74.8 |46.9 |67.2 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- The incomes of 11 percent of the population (16 million persons) in April 1994 were below the subsistence minimum, including the incomes of 3 percent of the population not reaching the produce "basket" value, which, in estimating the subsistence minimum, was R45,400. According to the estimate, the average wage put down for workers, on the whole for Russia in April of this year, was R175,000, and rose by 6 percent as compared with March of this year and by a factor of 1.3 as compared with January. The monthly increase in wages in March of this year in the sectors of the material sphere was 15 percent, nonproduction -- 11 percent. The amount of social payments and benefits in March of this year, calculated per worker, was R14,700, and increased by a factor of 1.5 as compared with February. The highest payments of a social nature were for extending credit and insurance -- R105,100, material-technical supply and sales -- R47,200. At public health and education institutions, they were respectively R6,900 and R7,400, calculated per worker. The consumer basket. The value of the "basket" made up of the 19 basic food products at the end of April was R47,600 estimated for the month. During the month it rose by 7.5 percent, and since the beginning of the year -- by 55 percent. The differentiation in the value of the basket for individual regions in April was 4.5-fold. The minimum value of the basket was recorded at Ulyanovsk (R28,700), and the maximum -- in Magadan (R128,400). In Moscow and St. Petersburg, its value in April was respectively R52,500 and R49,800.
