A correspondent of Message of Freedom Radio and Television reports that in the first sermon of the Friday prayer brother Hekmatyar delivered a comprehensive speech. In a section of the speech he said: [words indistinct] There should have been a government in Kabul but there is no administration nor government. Over the past 20 months there has been no security even around the Arg [presidential palace] nor were the property, dignity, and life of the people safe. Brother Hekmatyar added: Unfortunately the other side has opted for the path of force, deception, and broken promises. A ceasefire came to force in Tagab, but they started fighting in Kabul a short time after that. For [words indistinct] we proposed a plan but the other side rejected it. They wanted [word indistinct] or Khiarkhan [a district northwest of Kabul] government to continue. Tagab blood had not yet dried up when they started more bloody fighting in Kabul. The prime minister said: [words indistinct] every force and mojahedin who believes in God and pities the nation shall take each other's hands and take steps for a final action. God willing the present fighting is the final battle which will resolve the crisis of the country. Concluding his speech brother Hekmatyar said: All those equations which ensured the chance of the coalition's survival have been disrupted.
