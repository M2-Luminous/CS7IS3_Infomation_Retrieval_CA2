What is important in increasing the might of the NAM is to maintain the fundamental principles and idea of this movement, the paper notes, and stresses: To regard independence against imperialism as its idea, stay outside all blocs and pursue an independent policy is the fundamental principles of the NAM. Only when the NAM adheres to the fundamental principles, the source of its viability, can it further enhance its might and role and successfully realise the noble idea of independence against imperialism. It is also important in increasing the might of the NAM to keep the movement pure and cement its unity. Any attempt to open its door in an unprincipled manner must not be allowed. Whether a country can be a member nation of the NAM or join it with any other qualification depends on whether it pursues a policy according with the basic idea and principle of the NAM or aspires after and sympathizes with it. If the non-aligned nations unite with each other closely on the basis of independence and wage a common struggle, they can check and frustrate the moves of the dominationist forces and carry into effect the idea of the NAM. Now the NAM is faced with tasks to struggle to achieve democracy and independence of the whole world, reject the policy of strength and arbitrariness of the dominationist forces and establish a new international political and economic order on the basis of equality, justice and impartiality. What is important in this is to activate the work for the reform and democratization of the United Nations so that the non-aligned nations can take part in the solution of international issues with equal responsibility and rights. The non-aligned nations must work out a common strategy for the reform of the United Nations, take a joint action and make concerted efforts to put an end to pressure, sanctions and interference in other's internal affairs based on the abuse of the authority of the United Nations. It is one of the main duties of the NAM to oppose all manner of domination and subjugation, aggression and interference, achieve disarmament and safeguard the world peace and security. The non-aligned nations must reject any attempt seeking a political purpose in a military way and actively struggle to resolve all the disputes on the principle of mutual respect and non-interference in other's internal affairs. They must make strenuous efforts to free themselves from the economic yoke of the imperialists and establish a new international economic order on the basis of independence, equality and impartiality by establishing a South-South economic order on the principle of collective self-reliance. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean people will, as in the past, so in the future, too, steadfastly defend the basic idea and purpose of the NAM, remain faithful to it and make every possible effort to enhance its role.
