He said the group's activities had reached a level which could divide Muslims and create tensions in the country. He said there were also elements of excessive devotion shown by some Al-Arqam members who appeared to believe that the group's leader Ashari Mohamed was the only person qualified to administer the country. "Such elements could create tension among the Malays and cause fear among non-Muslims to the extent of undermining national security," he told reporters after opening the Bukit Chawi UMNO [United Malays National Organization] branch general meeting here. He said Al-Arqam had 10,000 committed members who were prepared to do anything on the orders of their leaders apart from 100,000 ordinary followers. Megat Junid said Al-Arqam members had taken to calling Ashari "Abu Ya" (father) and were willing to do whatever he commanded for fear of being accused as traitors. The ministry was working with the Islamic Centre to investigate the activities of Al-Arqam and 40 other missionary groups from the social and security aspects before taking further action, he added. He said the government assimilated Islamic values without force and provided good models to let non-Muslims make their own evaluation. Asked whether Al-Arqam had been warned over its deviations, he said the government was waiting for the result of the Islamic Centre's investigation. He said there had been occurrences of religious fanaticism in the past such as the destruction of temple images in Kerling and the attack on a police station in Batu Pahat which led to deaths. "So the government does not want the activities of Al-Arqam and other missionary groups to cause a repeat of such incidents," he said. Megat Junid also revealed the activity of a missionary group which practised recitations in candle-light and accompanied by the playing of drums and clarinets. "Members of this group include the wives of well-to-do people and businessmen," he added. He said the group was motivated by self-gain and greed.
