Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff, who arrived in Japan on Thursday, will discuss a wide range of diplomatic issues with Fukuda, the officials said. Tarnoff's visit comes at a time when discussions are intensifying over ways to deal with North Korea's alleged development of nuclear weapons. But the officials said the nuclear problem is not the only topic scheduled for discussion at the talks since the meeting is part of regular high-level bilateral consultations on political and security matters. Tarnoff is expected to visit Seoul after the Tokyo trip. Japan, the United States and South Korea agreed last weekend that the U.N. Security Council should "urgently" consider action against North Korea for its refusal to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
