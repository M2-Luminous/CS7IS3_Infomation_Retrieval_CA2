FR940105-2-00114 FR940105-2-00054 [Release No. 34&hyph;33403; File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;35] Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval of Proposed Rule Change Relating to Additions of Market-at-the-Close Orders to the ``List of Exchange Rule Violations and Fines Applicable Thereto Pursuant to Rule 476A'' and Amending Minor Rule Violation Enforcement and Reporting Plan December 28, 1993. On October 7, 1993 the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to revise the Rule 476A Violations List for imposition of fines for minor violations of rules and/or policies by adding to the list Exchange procedures with respect to entry and cancellation of market-at-the-close (``MOC'') orders on expiration days (i.e., expiration Fridays or the day on which Quarterly Index options expire). The NYSE also requested approval, under Rule 19d&hyph;1(c)(2), to amend its Rule 19d&hyph;1 Minor Rule Violation Enforcement and Reporting Plan to include the MOC procedures. 3 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). 3 See letter from James E. Buck, Senior Vice President and Secretary, NYSE, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Exchange and Options Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated October 5, 1993. The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33161 (November 5, 1993), 58 FR 60078 (November 12, 1993). No comments were received on the proposal. Description and Background In 1984, the Commission adopted amendments to paragraph (c) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 19d&hyph;1 to allow SROs to submit, for Commission approval, plans for the abbreviated reporting of minor rule violations. 4 Subsequently, in 1985, the Commission approved an NYSE Plan for the abbreviated reporting of minor rule violations pursuant to Rule 19d&hyph;1(c) under the Act. The Plan relieves the NYSE of the current reporting requirements imposed under section 19(d)(1) of the Act for violations listed in NYSE Rule 476A. The NYSE Plan, as embodied in NYSE Rule 476A, provides that the Exchange may designate violations of certain rules as minor rule violations. The Exchange may impose a fine, not to exceed $5,000, on any member, member organization, allied member, approved person, or registered or non-registered employee of a member or member organization for a violation of the delineated rules by issuing a citation with a specific penalty. 5 Such person can either accept the penalty, or opt for a full disciplinary hearing on the matter. Fines assessed pursuant to NYSE Rule 476A in excess of $2,500 are not considered pursuant to the Plan and must be reported in a manner consistent with the current reporting requirement of section 19(d)(1) of the Act. The Exchange also retains the option of bringing violations of rules included under NYSE Rule 476A to full disciplinary proceedings, and the Commission expects the Exchange to do so for egregious or repeat violations. 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21013 (June 1, 1984), 49 FR 23828 (June 8, 1984). Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 19d&hyph;1, an SRO is required to file promptly with the Commission notice of any ``final'' disciplinary action taken by the SRO. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 19d&hyph;1, any disciplinary action taken by an SRO for a violation of an SRO rule that has been designated a minor rule violation pursuant to the Plan shall not be considered ``final'' for purposes of section 19(d)(1) of the Act if the sanction imposed consists of a fine not exceeding $2,500 and the sanctioned person has not sought an adjudication, including a hearing, or otherwise exhausted his or her administrative remedies. By deeming unadjudicated minor violations as not final, the Commission permits the SRO to report violations on a periodic, as opposed to immediate, basis. 5 The List if contained under Supplementary Material to Exchange Rule 476A. As discussed in note 4 supra , only those fines imposed that are not in excess of $2,500 are subject to periodic reporting. Fines imposed pursuant to Rule 476A in excess of $2,500 are deemed final and therefore are subject to immediate reporting to the Commission. In adopting Rule 19d&hyph;1, the Commission noted that the Rule was an attempt to balance the informational needs of the Commission against the reporting burdens of the SROs. 6 In promulgating paragraph (c) of the Rule, the Commission was attempting further to reduce those reporting burdens by permitting, where immediate reporting was unnecessary, quarterly reporting of minor rule violations. The Rule is intended to be limited to rules which can be adjudicated quickly and objectively. 6 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 13762 (July 8, 1977), 42 FR 35411 (July 14, 1977). The NYSE currently is adding its procedures with respect to entry and cancellation of MOC orders on expiration days to the list of minor rule violations subject to the Rule 476A minor rule violation plan. The MOC order entry and cancellation procedures require, for example, that MOC orders be entered on the Exchange by 3:40 p.m. on expiration days if they are related to a strategy including any stock index future, stock index option or option on stock index future in expiring contracts, and that no cancellations of such orders be effected after 3:40 p.m. Violations of these policies could include late entry of MOC orders, entry of MOC orders which do not offset a published imbalance of 50,000 shares or more in a pilot stock or an improper cancellation of an MOC order. These procedures are announced to members and member organizations through an Information Memo issued approximately one week before each expiration day.
