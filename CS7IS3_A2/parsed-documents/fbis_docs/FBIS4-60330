Speaking on the admissibility of the identical adjournment motions, the federal interior minister, retired Major General Nasirullah Khan Babar, said there is no reality in the report that the American deputy secretary of state during his recent visit put forward proposals for capping of nuclear program. He said the present government has more than once indicated clearly that there will be no such unilateral action. He assured that the Pakistan People's Party government will never be a party to any design that will limit our national objectives. He said India is fully aware that Pakistan has a deterrent power and that is the reason that Pakistan is safe against any offensive from the adversary.
