Could there really be a war between Ukraine and Russia over the Crimea? It is impossible to believe. However, reports are coming from Simferopol about the appearance of dozens of armored personnel carriers in the outskirts of the Crimean capital. I see from my window a nationalist demonstration descending toward the Khreshchatyk, with the demand to strip the Crimea of its autonomy written on the banners. In a television picture from the chamber of the Crimean parliament: The deputies are delighted by their own courage. I cannot understand what they are happy about. As it is, they have put the country on the brink of a war between the fraternal peoples (I will not shrink from this combination of words, which has suddenly fallen from grace) whereas they could have resolved everything amicably. Did the Crimean deputies really fail to understand that they have fallen into a trap set by those who do not wish the election to be held on schedule? Leonid Kravchuk has been talking for a long time now about the need to cancel or at any rate postpone the June presidential election. The president played by old rules, but the situation in the country began to change. A new Ukrainian parliament has operated for just two weeks, but the possible direction of the country's political life after the election is already emerging. Two events have been particularly indicative. By an impressive margin, a majority of the Supreme Council voted to strip the well-known liberal, Volodymyr Hrynyov, of his deputy credentials because, through the fault of the Central Electoral Commission (and contrary to his will!), he ended up without a competitor in the second round. The credentials of two Communist deputies who had been elected to the parliament in the exact same manner as Hrynyov were confirmed. In essence, Volodymyr Hrynyov was punished for his liberalism. Here is what is interesting: Not only the "Reds" voted against Hrynyov but also the nationalists who feared Hrynyov's adherence to the idea of a rapprochement between Ukraine and Russia and other CIS countries. It suddenly came out that the national forces that were defeated in the election are prepared under certain circumstances to form an alliance with not only the former nomenklatura Communists who have given up their party membership cards, but also with the Communists who have remained faithful to their dogmas. One would think it was no accident that immediately after the election, the Rukh [Ukraine People's Movement] leader, Volodymyr Chornovil, stated that the MBR [Interregional Reform Block] of Kuchma and Hrynyov appeared to him more dangerous than the communists. Nonetheless, there will not be a strong alliance between the nationalists, even moderate nationalists, and the communists. They will not agree on the issue of an attitude toward Russia. On this score, the leftists have more in common with the centrists from the Kuchma-Hrynyov bloc, as was revealed by voting for candidates for the post of parliament chairman. At first, there were nine contenders. However, later five of them, including the leaders of the moderate nationalists, Chornovil and Yavorivskyy, withdrew their candidacies. The national-democrats understood that they would not corner the position of speaker; for this reason they supported the former Deputy Speaker Durdynets whose career was made in the Youth Communist League and subsequently in the militia--anyone but a proponent of integration processes. However, the chances of the radical nationalist from the extremist organization UNA-UNSO [Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian People's Self-Defense Forces], Yuriy Tyma, to win were none, just as those of a representative of the MBR, Oleksandr Karpiv, whose presentation in the parliament made a very good impression. The point is that the Kuchma-Hrynyov reformist bloc conducted the parliamentary campaign poorly, betting on the election of the president. Correspondingly, the deputy faction of the MBR turned out to be quite small. This is how it happened that in reality only two persons competed for the seat of parliament chairman--the leader of the bloc of leftist forces (communists, socialists, agrarians), Oleksandr Moroz, and the man of the nomenklatura, Vasyl Durdynets. The votes of their direct supporters were clearly insufficient for either. The nomenklatura man was supported by the nationalists, and the socialist by the centrists, including several deputies from the Kuchma bloc. They were the ones to ensure the victory of Oleksandr Moroz. It is obvious that the centrists of L. Kuchma did not at all support O. Moroz selflessly. Of course, they are counting on a reciprocal step by the left. As it were, Oleksandr Moroz is one of seven candidates for the post of Ukrainian president. Leonid Kravchuk, Leonid Kuchma, Ivan Plyushch, and Volodymyr Lanovyy are his main rivals. Recently, Kravchuk's rating has declined. Kuchma's rating has been the highest for half a year now. The number of supporters of Plyushch and Lanovyy is now growing. They are supported by the nationalists; I will add that many people from Kravchuk's team are now going over to Plyushch, including the chiefs of the official mass media. The rating of Moroz is relatively low. However, the leftists are the most disciplined people and will certainly take an active part in voting. Generally, Moroz could get 25-30 percent of the vote; however, this is not enough to become president. However, if Moroz withdraws his candidacy, the chances of L. Kuchma will be preferable because only he and Moroz favor the reinforcement of the CIS, the Economic Union, and other forms of integration, which is what 80 percent of the citizens of Ukraine want. To my mind, the tandem of President Leonid Kuchma and Chairman of the Supreme Council Oleksandr Moroz is currently the optimal scenario for Ukraine in which it is plainly impossible to not reckon with the leftists' influence at present, and, at the same time, it is extremely undesirable to yield full power to them. It is safe to suggest that the current president feels the most uncertain from among the "big five" candidates. By all signs, Leonid Kravchuk' time is coming to an end. However, the president does not want to go, all the more so because, in keeping with our rules, everyone tries to kick those who are leaving where it hurts. Kravchuk is doing everything he can to prevent the presidential election in June. It appears that it will be quite difficult, or virtually impossible to do at this point. Aware that a majority on the issue of canceling the election will not be gained without the leftists, L. Kravchuk is beginning to flirt with O. Moroz, and not unsuccessfully at that. Moroz has expressed his willingness to consider this problem in the parliament on the condition that the president comes out with the relevant initiative. In addition, the leftist leader proposed to discuss in the Supreme Council the issue of reducing presidential powers to the level of the head of state rather than the executive authorities. I think that Kravchuk would have agreed to that in order to keep anything at all. However, in this case, an amendment to the Constitution is at issue to which end 300 votes are necessary in a parliament that now has just 336 deputies. Therefore, the success of this endeavor is unlikely. Leonid Kravchuk cannot fail to understand this, and for this reason his main bet is on the destabilization of the general situation in Ukraine, which will give him a pretext to impose a state of emergency and reschedule the elections. This is why the "Crimean card" is being played now. The wars in Nagorno-Karabakh, the Dniester area, Ossetia, Ingushetia, Chechnya, and Abkhazia have claimed a great many lives of the citizens of what once was a united state...where the right of the people to self-government clashed with another right--the right of the newly formed independent states to sovereignty. Only the experience of Tatarstan in this area may be considered favorable. I think that it should be used in solving the Ukraine-Crimea problem, the Crimea being within Ukraine but on a treaty basis. A treaty always envisions the participation of at least two parties rather than unilateral actions by the Kiev or Simferopol authorities. On 24 May, Leonid Kuchma made a statement in which he proposed a quite constructive scenario for solving the Crimean problem. In particular, this statement says: "I am convinced that the territorial integrity and inviolability of the borders of Ukraine can and should be preserved while building relations with the Crimea on the basis of a treaty and the Constitutions of Ukraine and the Crimea." Considering Kuchma's good chances in the election on 26 June, we may count on the successful resolution of the conflict in the interest of both the Crimea and entire Ukraine in the immediate future. To be sure, the degree of readiness of the members of the Crimean parliament for negotiations is not quite clear. At the same time, the situation in the Supreme Council of Ukraine has been sharply aggravated because the leftists and the Unity faction that supported them have managed to elect their people to the deputy speaker positions by majority votes. I think that, for now, the words of the Rukh leader, Vyacheslav Chornovil, to the effect that the Communists have accomplished a parliamentary coup are nothing but a hyperbole; however, the fact that the leftists have taken control of the entire leadership of the parliament cannot but give rise to serious concern.
