Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim confirmed the importance that the organization places on the Haitian crisis, but he was skeptical about the possibility of increasing pressure on the military regime led by General Raoul Cedras through a total embargo against the Antillean country. Diplomatic sources said they expect the Haitian issue to be discussed next Tuesday, but it could also be discussed on Sunday, at a meeting prior to the official assembly opening. The most controversial issue is the use of force to reinstate President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who announced that he will attend the Belem meeting, Amorin told the press. The five-day meeting will mark the end of the mandate of Brazilian Joao Baena Soares as head of the OAS for the past decade. The meeting will give way to his elected successor, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria. Gaviria, 47, should assume the post by late August or September, after the runoff presidential elections in Colombia. The foreign ministers will also discuss the situation in the Dominican Republic resulting from fraud charges, following the recent presidential elections. Several countries of the region announced they will not recognize the results of the elections that gave a slight victory to incumbent President Joaquin Balaguer over Social Democrat Francisco Pena Herrera. Among other issues, the Belem meeting will deal with an inter-American convention on women's rights, and the state of the struggle against drug trafficking and gun running.
