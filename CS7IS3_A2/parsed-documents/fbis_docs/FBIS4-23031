Shcherbanyuk, I.V. Kasatkina, L.N. Makarovskaya, Antiplague Scientific Research Institute, Rostov-na-Donu] [Abstract] A lack of data on the efficacy of phosphomycin--a phosphonic acid group antibiotic with a bactericide effect against the Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Psedomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Vibrio cholerae, etc., strains--prompted a study of the efficacy of this drug and its combinations with other antibiotics in treating experimental plague in albino mice. To this end, mice were infected subcutaneously with a 1,250 LD[.sub]50[/] dose of the suspension of day-old Yersinia pestis 231 agar culture. Phosphomycin was injected 24 h after infection once a day for seven days in the amount of 2, 4, 8, and 16 g per mouse. The efficacy of the single antibiotic and its combinations with amikacin or cefotaxime was assessed using deliberately inadequate doses. In addition, phosphomycin and amikacin was administered alternately for four days. The efficacy of combined application of phosphomycin and amikacin or cefotaxime for experimental plague treatment in albino mice is summarized. The experiment reveals that phosphomycin is a highly efficient preparation for treating experimental plague in albino mice and demonstrates the possibility of its combined use with either of the two other antibiotics.
