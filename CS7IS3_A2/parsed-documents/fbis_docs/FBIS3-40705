It also spells out the citizen's fundamental rights, liberties, and duties of individuals. A constitution is tied to the presence of a state. There is no society with any degree of organization which does not have some fundamental rules that explain this society's system of government. Therefore, the lack of a constitution that regulates government affairs throws the door wide open for political conflicts among various political and intellectual tendencies. Moreover, the logic of force, domination, and monopolization of the control of government affairs prevails, thus resulting in many negative consequences that harm society's unity, stability, and development. A constitution, like other laws, is a social phenomenon that expresses the spirit of the educational, intellectual, and cultural environment prevailing in a society. By its nature, this environment is subject to change in accordance with the law of ceaseless development in a society's life. This change dictates that a degree of accord and harmony be achieved between the new reality produced by the given facts of change and modernization in society's social, political, and economic life on the one hand and, on the other hand, society's fundamental law, which is embodied in the constitution, so that the latter will be subject to the logic of amendment that keeps up pace with and expands to accommodate the change. In other words, any change in life's ever-dynamic circumstances must be coupled with and accompanied by parallel development in the laws so that society's real conditions will not be divorced from its legal structure. While acknowledging that it is important and necessary that a constitutional system be stable, this stability cannot be so absolute that it leads to rigidity in constitutional life. Absolute rigidity of constitutions is incompatible with the principle of development and it poses the threat of violent unrest in a society's life. Moreover, absolute constitutional rigidity results in denying sovereign nations the exercise of their sovereignty to amend their constitutions whenever they deem it necessary to do so. This contradicts the nature of things. How could a group impose on itself laws which it cannot amend afterward? In harmony with these logical considerations, we find that the constitutional legislator himself inserts into the constitution provisions that make it permissible to amend one or more articles of the constitution and that spell out the procedures that have to be observed in this regard. Thus, the negatives of slipping into absolute rigidity are avoided and, at the same time, a reasonable degree of stability in the constitutional system is ensured. In a related area, when the constitutional legislator establishes the fundamental rules of the system of government and of public liberties in the state, he gives expressin to the true nature of the existing conditions and circumstances, be they political, social, or economic, and the nature of the tendencies and ideas prevailing at the time. Therefore, the legislator cannot bypass the circumstances and leap ahead of time, thus taking into account circumstances and conditions that have not developed yet. Therefore, it is a proven fact that when circumstances dictating amendment develop, amendment of the constitution becomes inevitable. This is because justifications for the continued presence of past conditions have disappeared and because one has to keep pace with new developments. On this basis, we find that most political, economic, social, cultural, and administrative ideas and opinions on the national horizon of the Yemeni arena are unanimous that the 1981 constitution of the republic was drafted under certain political circumstances that are different in form and content from the current political circumstances and all their transformations, changes, and developments. The constitution has been founded, as everybody knows, on harmonizing the various political ideas and the contradictory positions that were adopted by the two former regimes under the extraordinary conditions of partition. Thus, the constitution document emerged as a formula which balanced the different political and organizational ideas and tendencies of each of the two parts. It was evident that the provisions of this document lacked precision, cohesion, and harmony. It was even rumored that some provisions had been written with the determination not to achieve anything for Yemen's unity. Despite all this, the supreme national interest dictated that the document's weak points and deficiencies be overlooked so as to preserve the harmony formula that had been developed and that was suitable as an agreed foundation for accomplishing the great objective. This formula constituted a gain then, having been achieved over a long period of time and only after great and exhaustive efforts. It is well-known that the period from 1981 to 1992 produced a number of important national, regional, and international developments and changes, most significant of which was accomplishment of the great civilizational plan embodied in restoring unity and proclaiming the Republic of Yemen on 22 May 1990. This development was followed by great national efforts to implement the process of the republic's political, economic, administrative, and judiciary development and merger through energetic and ceaseless efforts by the state's concerned authorities. These authorities have begun to eliminate the traces of partition and its hateful legacy. They have been able, despite the state's flawed institutional structure and despite the duality and ambiguity of the constitutional institutions, to accomplish numerous important institutional and legislative achievements to unify the Republic of Yemen. The recent period has produced numerous unified laws. That period has, moreover, led to rearranging and unifying most of the organizational and administrative structures and to establishing unified institutions and agencies that are engaged in various activities and that seek varied objectives. It is worth noting now that prior to the referendum on the constitution, the Presidential Council had promised the people in a statement to present to the early meetings of the elected House of Representatives any observations brought up regarding the constitution. The fact that the current house has been elected in accordance with the constitution puts this house and the Presidential Council face to face with their responsibility to fulfill the commitments they had made to the people. As an extension of this effective activity to build and develop the Republic of Yemen and in view of the fact that the practical application of the constitution has demonstrated that its provisions-- which are based, as we have already pointed out, on the circumstances under which it was drafted and prepared, i.e., the circumstances of partition--cannot keep up with the developments the region is experiencing, this constitution has to be reviewed and examined article by article so we can put our finger on its weaknesses and deficiencies and on the ambiguities in its principles and rules and so we can emerge with a new and clear vision that achieves harmony, that embodies unity's objectives, and that keeps pace with all of the national developments in the political, economic, and social areas. In this review and examination, consideration must be given to all the opinions, observations, and criticism voiced on some of the constitution's provisions. We must deal with whatever is raised in this regard with a patriotic and democratic spirit that respects contrary opinion and gives precedence to the supreme national interest. For all the general considerations and justifications explained above, it has become urgent to amend the constitution in order to secure the future of the democratic procession, to strengthen national unity, and to lay down sound foundations for building the modern state of Yemen--a state of constitutional institutions. This step is also a national mission with which to crown the accomplishments that have already been achieved in an endeavor to create Yemen's desired cultural revival under the modern edifice of a state of constitution and laws. There is no doubt that the national resolve which accomplished Yemen's unity is capable of achieving a lot to serve the country with the same patriotic spirit and peaceful national democratic dialogue which prevailed in the achievement of unity, that great historical accomplishment. It is established and confirmed in constitutional and legal jurisprudence and it is unanimously agreed among jurisprudents and interpreters of constitutional law that the concept of constitutional amendment includes amending or abolishing what is extant and adding what is proposed to be included in the constitution. Amendment includes amendment by addition, omission, abolition, or rephrasing. This is because a constitutional amendment is passed to meet an urgent need or to keep pace with existing developments or developments that are likely in the foreseeable future. Consequently, the firmness of a constitutional base hinges on its ability to absorb society's political, economic, cultural, and social constants and society's aspirations in all areas of society's activities, and for the longest time possible. According to this legal framework, it is extremely important to review the issues on which the demand for amendment focuses, whether by rephrasing the constitutional article, by adding to it, by omitting from it, by abolishing it, or by adding new provisions to some sections and chapters of the constitution. The reasons dictating the demand for amendment must be clarified for every one of the issues included in the demand for such amendment. This clarification must be made according to the sequence of the constitution's sections and chapters, as shown in the following: Section 1 Fundamentals of State Chapter 1 Political Fundamentals Article 1. It is required to amend this article by adding to it a phrase which emphasizes that the state, both as an entity and as people, belongs to Arabism and Islam. These two characteristics must be underlined for both the State of Yemen and the Yemeni people and not just for one without the other, which is what article one of the constitution has done. The article must also emphasize that the Yemeni people belong to the Islamic nation, in addition to being part of the Arab nation. The phrase "Islamic nation" should replace the "Islamic world." Article 3. It is required to amend this article in order to clarify the source from which laws are derived by pointing out in a clearly worded phrase that the Islamic shari'ah is the source of all legislation, considering that there is no disagreement over this issue. We must do this on the basis of our belief in the dictates of the Islamic shari'ah and in the capacity of its tolerant teachings which can accommodate all changes and developments at all times and in all places. The shari'ah can accomplish this through its comprehensive sources of its controls that are defined in the principles of jurisprudence. These principles include sources from which laws appropriate for the development of human societies are derived. The sources include consensus, analogy, consent, the example of the prophet's companions, incompletely transmitted interests, and other evidence approved legally by Islamic jurisprudence. All this ensures the freedom of opinion in a manner that doesn't violate the Islamic shari'ah. Article To Be Added Article...An amendment is required by adding to Chapter 1 an article that defines the state's political identity in light of the democratic option that is based on party pluralism in its capacity, along with the principle of the peaceful rotation of power, as one of the national constants that must be underlined in the constitution and must be bolstered with stipulations stated within the political principles incorporated in Article 39 of the constitution. This amendment shall also stipulate that the law will define the categories of state employees who shall be prohibited from engaging in any party activity because the public interest dictates it. The amendment introduced by this added article also seeks to enhance what is already stated in the political parties and organizations law about the impermissibility of exploiting public jobs or public funds to serve the interest of a certain political party or organization. The amendment also seeks to establish this impermissibility as a constitutional principle and as one of the state's fundamental principles so as to strengthen the democratic system and party pluralism; to ensure the safety and neutrality of public jobs; and to protect public money. In order to achieve this end, the text of the amendment must be binding to all agencies, parties, and officials in the various positions of responsibility. Chapter 2 Economic Fundamentals Article 6. It is required to rephrase this article in order to clarify the economic tendency so that the state's economic policy will be founded on a free economic activity that doesn't undermine society's interest; so that national independence will be strengthened; and so that all interests will be tended and balanced. To accomplish this end, clear and harmonious principles based on the following tendencies have to be embraced: A. Islamic social justice in economic relations with the aim of achieving social solidarity and balance, developing and improving production, and enhancing society's living standard. B. Apply the rule of profitability to economic and production activities managed by the public sector, considering that these activities are tantamount to a public social property that must be managed according to economic and commercial criteria. This is accomplished by adopting the principle of legitimate competition which ensures fair cooperation between the various economic activity sectors and makes sure that these sectors are treated equally and fairly. C. Protect and preserve private ownership so it will not be undermined, unless for the sake of a public interest and only with fair compensation in accordance with the law. Article 7. It is required to amend this article in order to eliminate the ambiguity engulfing the word "derivatives." This word should be replaced by "kinds" because derivatives come into existence after natural resources are discovered and produced. Article 8. It is required to rephrase this article in order to eliminate the restriction it contains regarding public institutions and public resources. It is required that the state's general plan be established with a comprehensive view of all of society's resources. The cooperative sector should be included as one of the sectors which, as stipulated by this article, must be developed and enhanced through the state's economic policy. Article 9. It is required to amend this article to make it compatible with free economic activity so that the government role will be to tend and encourage rather than to direct and control, which are incompatible with the principle of free economy. Free economic activity shouldn't be restricted, unless it undermines society's interest. The amendment should also state that monopoly, which is harmful to society, is prohibited. The amendment should also seek to encourage private capital to invest in the various areas of economic and social development. Article 15. It is required to amend this article so as to make a distinction between contracts on the utilization of natural resources which, as stipulated by the article, must be concluded by law, and concession contracts connected with public utilities. It is difficult to conclude the latter contracts by law in every case because they take many and varied forms and because most of them are small contracts, such contracts to manage rural water projects, a park, or a school cafeteria. Therefore, the text should state that these contracts shall be concluded in accordance with the law and not by a law. In addition to the articles that are required to be amended in this chapter in the manner demonstrated above, amendment should also be made through the addition of a number of articles to Chapter 2 so as to deal with the deficiency from which the current constitution suffers in a number of important areas connected with economic components for which no provisions exists. These amendments should be included in five articles that deal with the following issues: - article...concerning the inviolability and protection of public property. - article...to ban the confiscation of public property and to require a court decision for the confiscation of private property. - article...on alms tax as one of the resources which the government must collect and which it must spend for purposes specified by the shari'ah. - article...to underline the inviolability of awqaf [religious trusts] and to improve their resources and spend them in a manner that ensures achievement of the objectives and goals of these trusts as specified by the shari'ah, thus ensuring that they perform their role in development in accordance with the shari'ah. Chapter 3 Social and Cultural Fundamentals Article 12. Because various provisions of the constitution state explicitly that numerous relations and activities shall be regulated by the law, it is extremely important that a provision be added to this article of the constitution to stipulate that the law shall regulate unionist and and professional activity and relations between labor and work owners so as to ensure that these relations are founded on an economic basis that observes the rules of social justice. Because there is an evident deficiency in this chapter regarding a number of important social components that are compatible with the principles of Islam and the principles and objectives of the Yemeni revolution and that reaffirm the noble values which have been ingrained in the Yemeni society's conscience throughout its life and development, the constitution must incorporate and confirm these components in articles that should be added to this chapter as follows: - an article stipulating that the Yemeni society is based on a social solidarity founded on justice, freedom, and equality; - an article on family as the basis of society and on religion, morals, and love of the country as the mainstays of both family and society; - an article on the government's role in protecting maternity and childhood; - an article on education, health, and social services as mainstays of society's structure and progress and on the government's and society's role in providing them; - an article on the role of women in society; - an article on natural disasters and general catastrophes and the need to ensure that the government, in solidarity with society, shoulders the burdens emanating from them; - an article on the government's preservation of historical antiquities and on cooperation by the citizens with the government to incriminate those who undermine the inviolability of antiquities. Chapter 4 Fundamentals of National Defense Article 21. So that the ban stated in the text of the article on the formation of military or paramilitary organizations by any circle or group may include political parties and organizations, it is extremely important to amend the article by inserting into it an addition to make it state that the ban includes the formation of any military or para- military organization by any political party or organization for any purpose and under any name whatsoever. Article 25. The subject of amendment in this article should focus on clearly defining the police's relationship with the judiciary authority, on eliminating the ambiguity as to who controls the police, and on requiring the police to adhere to orders issued to them by the judiciary authority in accordance with the law. Article...The national interest dictates that an article be added to this chapter to underline the armed forces' neutrality in order to reflect their embodiment of the national unity, to prevent their exploitation for the interests of any party, individual, or faction, and to protect them from all forms of discrimination. Section 2 Citizens' Fundamental Rights and Duties The amendment's main tendency in this regard is to replace some words or phrases over which there has been controversy because their indications have been understood vaguely by some people. Because of the confusion created by this vague understanding and in order to settle the controversy, it is necessary to replace these words and phrases by other words or phrases that serve the purpose clearly and in a manner that leaves no place for ambiguity and that creates no verbal controversy. The amendments should be as follows: - Article 27. It is required to amend this article so that it will stipulate that all citizens are equal in public rights and duties and that the state may not discriminate or make distinctions in human rights because of sex, color, origin, language, profession, social status, or religion. - Article 31. This article should be amended by replacing the phrase "by law" with the phrase "in accordance with the word of...." This article should be rephrased so that it will make it clearly understood that no penal law may be issued with a retroactive effect. - Article 32. It is required to amend this article so as to eliminate the contradiction in some of its paragraphs, to achieve a clearer and more realistic definition of the authorities concerned, to underline the public prosecution's authority to keep somebody detained for a maximum period of seven days, and to make the law spell out the maximum duration of precautionary detention. - Article 33. It is required that this article be amended so that any ambiguity regarding its intent will be eliminated. Amendment should be done by rephrasing the article to make it clear that its intent is to ensure that the execution of penalties is carried out with proper means and that no laws to the contrary may be passed. - Article 37. It is required to amend this article by adding to it a provision stating that education shall be compulsory in the basic phase and that the state shall exert efforts to eliminate illiteracy and to expand technical and vocational education. In a related area, some provisions must be added to some articles of this section of the constitution in order to fill the gap it contains and to underline a number of the citizen's fundamental rights that haven't been stipulated by this constitution and that are no less important than the right to education, which is stipulated by the constitution. These rights must be stipulated by amendments that add to this Section 4 articles that cover the following: - an article that ensures the right to defense directly or indirectly throughout the phases of interrogation and litigation before all courts and that makes certain that the state provides legal aid to those who are financially incapable; - an article on the right of all citizens to health care--an article that calls for a law to regulate the medical profession, for expanding free medical services, and for spreading health awareness; - an article to ensure that the government provides the citizens with social guarantees in cases of sickness, disability, unemployment, and old age, as well as guarantees for martyrs' families; - an article on the citizens' right to vote, to run for election, and to express their opinion in referendums. The law should regulate the rules governing the exercise of this right. Considering that this chapter is concerned in the first place with the citizens' fundamental rights and duties and that the constitution has failed to define the citizens' fundamental duties in this same section, amendment should be made by adding three articles on the following: - an article on the duty to pay taxes and public costs in accordance with the law; - an article on the duty to perform the national defense service [military service], which is regulated by the law; - an article on the duty to preserve national unity, to protect state secrets, and to respect laws and abide by their provisions. Section 3 Regulation of State Authority It is important to point out that the title of this section as it is currently found in the constitution has the word state "authority" and not state "authorities." This section incorporates four chapters that regulate the state authorities, which are embodied in the House of Representatives, the Presidential Council, the Council of Ministers, and local government agencies. The section does not include the powers of the judiciary authority as one of the state's three main authorities. Rather, a separate section, namely Section 4 which is entitled "The Judiciary and Public Prosecution," has been set aside for this authority under a title which gives the impression that it is no more than a service utility. It is evident from this that Section 3 regulates several state authorities and not just one authority, as implied by its current title. Moreover, the provisions concerning the judiciary are listed in Section 4, which means that this authority is not considered one of the state authorities. This position clearly reflects the totalitarian conditions and concepts which existed under the partitioned Yemen and which did not acknowledge the principle of plurality of powers and of their separation. There is no doubt that this position has reflected negatively on the content of a number of the constitutional provisions, especially in this regard, considering that these provisions are either vague, two-sided, or deficient. This is a normal outcome of the balancing approach which governed the method that was used to draft the constitution under the conditions of a partitioned Yemen. Were it not for the collective sense of national responsibility which the entire political leadership has displayed in dealing with state affairs and with the authorities' relations with each other, numerous dangers and crisis would have surfaced and it would have been difficult to obviate their consequences and ramifications. This is one of the fundamental motives and justifications for the endeavor to amend the constitution. The constitutional provisions regulating the state authorities must be clear and specific in a manner that does not permit duality in powers and authorities and that does not allow the undermining of one authority vis-a-vis the other authorities. These provisions must leave no place for the inability to determine accountability or to prevent overlapping in the authorities' exercise of their powers so they can make it easy to determine the areas of integration or cooperation between the authorities. Obviation of the negatives existing in the constitutional provisions and the likely future perils of these negatives cannot be just left up to the patriotism of the people in charge of the various authorities and to their assumed wisdom in dealing with issues. It is a national duty to draft constitutional provisions that regulate the state authorities precisely so that we can have a firm and clear base for the future; can ensure, cement, and protect the country's gains; and can move forward with firm steps to achieve our people's legitimate aspirations. Before we deal with the main amendment tendencies concerning each chapter of this section separately and before we tackle the articles that need to be amended, which will be listed later, we will review briefly here the structural composition of the state institutions which the amendment seeks to establish so that components of Section 3 will be as follows: Chapter 1 Legislative Authority: House of Representatives Article 40. The amendment listed for this article is as follows: 1. The word "approve" should replace the word "decide" because this is compatible with the house jurisdiction, considering that the word "decide" signifies drafting and preparing more than it signifies giving approval. 2. The word "guidance," which precedes the phrase "and control" should be abolished, considering that the House of Representatives is concerned with legislation and control. The constitution defines the means of constitutional control to which the house is entitled and which are embodied in: ratification of treaties and agreements (Article 48); approval of the state's final account (Article 49); approval of the state budget (Article 50); approval of the transfer of any sum of money from one section of the general budget to another and of any expenditure not listed in the budget or exceeding the estimates (Article 51); approval of the law which determines provisions of the public establishments and organizations budget, of their accounts, and of the independent budgets and their final accounts (Article 52); and the right to offer directions, meaning recommendations, to the government on public issues. It is then the government's duty to explain to the house why it cannot implement the recommendations, if it cannot implement them (Article 68). The house is entitled, if 20 percent of its members so request, to hold a general debate and to query the government policy on any public issue and to exchange ideas on it (Article 69). The house is also entitled to form a special fact-finding committee or to assign one of its committees as a fact-finding committee to investigate issues in numerous areas and with broad powers (Article 70). The house is also empowered to approve public economic and social development plans by a law. At the same time, the house passes the law that defines how plans shall be drafted and presented to it (Article 71). On top of all of this, the house grants the government the vote of confidence (Article 72) and is entitled to withdraw it from the government (Article 73). The house is also empowered to refer the prime minister, his deputies, and ministers to the courts (Article 111). Every house member is entitled, moreover, to query and question [the government] and to propose laws and law amendments. All these are constitutional control instruments. Even if a small part of them is used well, it will be beneficial to the country, the people, and the country. This is why it is better not to keep the word "guidance" or to cling to it. Its presence serves no purpose. All this word does is arouse futile debate and conflicting ideas that contradict the constitutional structure and the principle of the separation of powers. Article 42. The amendment listed for this article is as follows: 1. Provision (3) of Paragraph (B), which merely stipulates that a candidate running for election to the House of Representatives shall not be illiterate, must be replaced by the requirement that a candidate must master reading and writing so that the house can achieve greater efficiency. 2. Add to the prerequisites the requirement that a candidate running for election to the House of Representatives must observe the religious rites and must not have been convicted of the crime of violating honor and trust, unless rehabilitated. The objective is to underline the important aspects of good conduct and behavior and to encourage those who wish to run for election to the house to behave accordingly. Article 46. It is required to amend this article so as end dual jurisdiction over election disputations, listed as jurisdiction that belongs to the Supreme Court. This amendment should be made by either abolishing the article or by rephrasing it. Article 48. It is required to amend this article by rephrasing it to define clearly and precisely the issues which have to be approved by the House of Representatives so as to steer away from the inapplicable generalization of the current article. What should be approved by the House of Representatives are: treaties and agreements connected with defense, alliances, peace, or border modification; treaties and agreements that result in financial obligations to the state; and treaties and agreements which require that a law be issued for their implementation. [13 Sep, p 6] [Text] Following are the main tendencies of the amendment needed for each chapter of this section separately, according to the classification noted above, as well as the articles required to be amended within each chapter: Section 3 Regulation of State Authorities Chapter 1 Legislative Authority: House of Representatives Article 40. The amendment listed for this article is the following: 1. The word "approve" should replace the word "decide" because this word is compatible with the house jurisdiction, considering that the word "decide" signifies drafting and preparing more than it signifies just approval. 2. The word "guidance," which precedes the phrase "and control," should be abolished, considering that the House of Representatives is concerned with legislation and control. The constitution defines the means of constitutional control to which the house is entitled and which are embodied in: ratification of treaties and agreements (Article 48); approval of the state's final account (Article 49); approval of the state budget (Article 50); approval of the transfer of any sum of money from one section of the general budget to another and approval of any expenditure not listed in the budget or exceeding the estimates (Article 51); approval of the law which determines provisions of the budget of public establishments and organizations, approval of these organizations' accounts, and approval of independent budgets and their final accounts (Article 52); and the right to offer directions, meaning recommendations, to the government on public issues. It is the government's duty to explain to the house why it cannot implement the recommendations, if it cannot recommend them (Article 68). The house is entitled, if 20 percent of its member so request, to hold a general debate and to query the government policy on any public issue and to exchange views on such a policy (Article 69). The house is also entitled to form a fact-finding committee or to assign one of its committees to investigate issues in numerous areas and with broad powers (Article 70). The house is, moreover, empowered to approve public economic and social development plans by law. At the same time, the house passes the law that determines how plans shall be drafted and presented to it (Article 71). On top of all of this, the House of Representatives grants the government its vote of confidence (Article 72), and it is entitled to withdraw this confidence from the government (Article 73). The house is empowered to refer the prime minister, his deputies, and ministers to the courts (Article 111). Every house member is entitled, moreover, to question and query and to propose laws and law amendments. All these are constitutional control instruments. Even if a small part of them is used well, it will be beneficial to the country and the people. This is why it is better not to keep the word "guidance" or to cling to it. Its presence serves no purpose. All this word does is arouse futile debate and conflicting ideas that contradict the constitutional structure and the principle of the separation of powers. Article 42. The amendment listed for this article is as follows: 1. Provision (3) of Paragraph B, which merely stipulates that a candidate running for election to the House of Representatives shall not be illiterate, must be replaced by the requirement that a candidate must master reading and writing so that the house can achieve greater efficiency. 2. Add to the prerequisites the requirement that a candidate running for election to the House of Representatives must observe the religious rites and that he must not have been convicted of the crime of violating honor and trust, unless rehabilitated. The objective is to underline the important aspects of good conduct and behavior and to encourage those who wish to run for election to the house to behave accordingly. Article 46. It is required to amend this article so as to end the dual jurisdiction over election disputations, listed as jurisdiction belonging to the the Supreme Court. This amendment should be achieved by either abolishing the article or by rephrasing it. Article 48. It is required to amend this article by rephrasing it to define clearly and precisely issues which have to be approved by the House of Representatives so as to steer away from the inapplicable generalizations of this article. What should be approved by the House of Representatives are: treaties and agreements connected with defense, alliances, peace, or border modification; treaties and agreements that result in financial obligations to the state; and treaties and agreements which require that a law be issued for their implementation. Article 50. The amendment listed for this article is purely formal. It calls for dividing the article into two paragraphs, making the final sentence of the article an independent paragraph, listed as paragraph B. What precedes this paragraph will be listed under paragraph A. This is because even though the final sentence is short, it encompasses several important provisions that are distinctive from the rest of the article. Article 52. The amendment listed for this article calls for adding the word "otherwise" before the phrase "shall be subject to the provisions...." The purpose is to phrase this article precisely. The fact that this word is missing in the article negates the justification for the entire article because the main purpose of this article is to have the law establish special provisions for the budgets and accounts of public authorities and establishments, and for independent and attached budgets and their final accounts. This is what justifies creating these authorities and establishments and making them financial accountability independent of that of the state. The provisions governing the general budget and its final account will thus become the general rule where no special provisions exist. Article 54. The amendment listed for this article seeks an effective structure of the house leadership by stipulating that this leadership should consist of a speaker and three representatives who constitute the House of Representatives Office. The amendment also stipulates that the house shall have a general secretariat headed by a general secretary, provided that the house bylaws spell out the provisions concerning formation of the secretariat and other related provisions. Article 57. The amendment listed for this article seeks to ensure complete clarity and absence of duality regarding convocation of the house's ordinary and special sessions. It stipulates that the house shall convene two ordinary sessions. It makes it permissible, meanwhile, for the house to convene special sessions on a decree issued by the president at his own wish or in response to the written request of the house office or of one third the house membership. It also stipulates that the session convened in the final quarter of the year shall not be adjourned until the general state budget is passed. This determination is very important for making the house efficient, considering that the current text is deficient and that past experience convinces one that this amendment is necessary. Article 66. To ensure that the House of Representatives member is effective and that the house membership rises to the level of the house's immense responsibility and the level of the voters' good opinion of the house, the amendment listed for this article focuses on making a member's serious violation of his membership duties, as defined by the house bylaws, a reason that makes it permissible to drop his membership. One should keep in mind that the constitution empowers the house to draft its bylaws in accordance with the text of Article 45 of the constitution. Article 67. The amendment listed for this article seeks the following: 1. Omit the power granted to unions and mass organizations to propose, through their representatives, draft laws or law amendments because this is in violation of the character of the House of Representatives member as a general representative of all the people and because this stipulation is incompatible with the reality, considering that there are no House of Representatives members who represent unions of specific organizations directly. 2. To ensure that no bills to increase, abolish, or reduce taxes, to lower some taxes, or to allocate a part of the state funds for a certain project are initiated, the amendment requires that such such bills be presented by the government or by one-fourth the house members. For further clarity, the phrasing should be amended to state explicitly that a law proposal may be submitted by one or more members of the House of Representatives. Article 68. It is required to amend this bill by replacing the word "directives," which occurs twice in the article, by the word "recommendations" because the word recommendations is compatible with the principle of the separation of powers that is founded on cooperation and integration. The purpose is to eliminate the word "directives" as a cause of controversy over whether the word signifies or does not signify the separation of powers. If the word "directives" is understood to be binding, then it means that there is no separation of powers. Such an understanding is incompatible with the powers and other control instruments granted to the house but is compatible with the totalitarian system, as we have pointed out in connection with the amendment concerning Article 40. Article 72. It is required to amend this article by adding to it a phrase that clarifies what is meant by the phrase "government program," which is mentioned in the text of the article, and to eliminate the ambiguity engulfing this program. The phrase that is required to be added is "which defines the broad lines of the domestic and foreign policy." To eliminate any future ambiguity or controversy, the word "program" should replace the word "statement" which occurs in the article. Article 77. The majority of the provisions of this article repeat provisions already stated in Article 55 of the constitution. It is required to rephrase this article so that this repetition will be eliminated. The amendment should also state that a final vote shall be taken on every draft law and that the house bylaws shall determine the relevant procedures. Article 78. The amendment seeks to fill the gap existing in the article regarding the practical procedures that have to be established in case it is planned to dissolve the house--such as procedures that set the period during which elections have to be held and that suspend house sessions until results of the next election appear. It is very important to regulate these aspects so that lack of provision will not be a cause for offhandedness or conflict. In a related area, the amendment needed for this article should not require that the cabinet resign before an election because the election is supervised by an independent and neutral committee, namely the Higher Election Committee. The cabinet has no role in the election. Article 79. The amendment focuses on adding a provision on the consequence of the president's nonpromulgation of a law when the constitutional period for the president to return the law to the house has expired or when a law has been returned to the house and passed again. The consequence should be that the law has been issued by the force of the constitution without the need for it to be promulgated. The law should be published in the Official Gazette immediately and should be enacted two weeks after its publication. (Added) article. To eliminate any confusion regarding the permissibility or impermissibility of combining House of Representatives membership with other jobs, it is proposed that an amendment be made in this regard by adding an article that incorporates contents of the provision stipulated in the current general election law. The added article should read as follows: Article...on...It is impermissible to combine House of Representatives membership with membership in a local council or with any public job. As an exception, it is permissible to combine House of Representatives membership with cabinet membership. Chapter 2 Executive Authority The executive authority consists of the presidency and the government. Because the president of the republic is the head of state and the top of the executive authority at the same time, this chapter will be divided into two branches: the first is the presidency of the republic and the second is the government. First Branch Presidency of the Republic Determining the shape of the presidency is one of the most important issues with which amendment must deal as part of the effort to organize the state authorities in a manner which ensures ideal stability that agrees with the givens of the age, that is compatible with the real situation, and that is in harmony with the human experience. In accordance with the constitution, the presidency of the state is currently based on the principle of collective leadership, which is embodied in the Presidential Council. This principle, like others contained in the constitution, reflects the political, cultural, and social environment which was created and defined by the extraordinary factors and conditions of a partitioned Yemen under which the constitution was drafted. The principle of collective leadership or of partnership in the presidency of the state was one of the compromises made at the time to overcome those conditions. It was a compromise made from the perspective of serving the conflicting political and organizational positions and tendencies of the two previous regimes, not from the perspective of what is dictated by the national interest and what embodies unity of the Yemeni people, thus making the presidency of the state harmonious with the people's unity and with democracy. Now that the people's great historical dream of regaining their unity has been accomplished; in light of the important national and foreign transformations and changes that materialized since creation of the blessed Republic of Yemen, changes and transformations that are different in form and essence from the circumstances and conditions under which the constitution was drafted; and to strengthen the mainstays of unity and stability, the current form of presidency of the state must be reexamined and restructured so that the powers of the presidency, i.e., the "head of state," will be exercised by the president of the republic and so that the president will have a vice president. This means a change from collective leadership of the presidency of the republic, which is embodied in the Presidential Council, to another form that has prevailed in the world throughout history and in today's world, namely the form of president of the republic. Organizing the presidency of the republic in the manner proposed above accomplishes numerous positives and eliminates all the faults and negatives associated with the collective leadership method. The most important justifications and considerations confirming and clarifying the soundness of adopting the proposed form of presidency can be summed up as follows: 1. It embodies the principle of national unity, represented in the president of the republic who symbolizes unity of the country, its sovereignty, and its independence. This is the system prevailing in today's world as a result of the human experience generally. 2. This form is compatible with the special characteristics of the Yemeni society which does not have a multiplicity of ethnic groups which, when they exist, are careful to be represented in a collective council. 3. As a general rule, management of the state by the collective leadership system is unsuccessful because it is engulfed in numerous negatives that weaken the movement of the country's higher political and economic leadership. The most significant of these negatives are: A. The indifference and dependence that prevail in the collective leadership's exercise of jurisdiction and powers connected with the presidency of the state, the subsequent weakness at the control and execution level, and the negligence of numerous important issues. B. The difference of visions and ideas for dealing with issues--a difference which reflects itself in the decisionmaking process. C. Complexity of the collective leadership's work system and its negative impact on prompt decision making, especially on issues and subjects that cannot be delayed. D. The multiplicity, confusion, and contradiction of directives issued by the collective leadership members, and the subsequent confusion they cause the administrative process. E. A collective leadership's members often stay on the peripheries of a productive practical life and far from action in the central executive authority because of their equal status as collective leadership members and because they are tied down, at the same time, by regular meetings. In light of the above, it is necessary to rephrase and reorganize articles of the second chapter that need to be amended in a manner compatible with the fundamental tendencies of the proposed amendments for the first branch of Chapter 2. It is also normal that when the required amendment concerning the form of presidency of the state is passed, the phrase "presidential council" will be automatically replaced by the phrase "president of the republic" wherever it occurs in the constitution. In the article concerning the vice president, it should be stipulated that the provisions of Articles 85, 86, 88, 89, 90, 92, 93, and 101 will be applied in this regard. Following are the articles required to be amended: Article 82. It should be amended to read that the presidency of the republic, i.e., "chairmanship of the state, shall be exercised by the president of the republic, who is the head of state and who shall be elected in accordance with the constitution. The president shall have a vice president, shall select his vice president, and shall announce his name so he will be known before the general presidential election is held. Article 83. It should be amended so that nomination of the candidates for president and vice president will be as follows: 1. The president of the republic shall be elected by the people in a competitive election. 2. Nominations shall be presented to the House of Representatives. 3. Nominations shall be examined by the House of Representatives speakership to make sure that candidates meet the constitutional prerequisites. 4. The names of candidates who meet the prerequisites shall be submitted to the House of Representatives for approval. 5. Any nominee gaining the approval of 10 percent of the House of Representatives shall be considered a candidate for presidency of the republic. 6. To ensure that the election is competitive, the House of Representatives shall be required to name at least two persons to run for the position of president of the republic prior to presenting the candidates to the people for a competitive election. 7. The candidate gaining an absolute majority of the votes of those who take part in the election shall be the president of the republic. If no candidate gains such a majority, both nomination and election shall be repeated in accordance with the aforementioned procedures. Article 84. It should be amended to state that the president of the republic shall work to underline the people's sovereignty, to respect the constitution and supremacy of the law, to protect national unity and the principles of the Yemeni revolution, to tend the peaceful rotation of power, and to establish the bounds for the various authorities so as to ensure that they perform their roles. Article 85. It should be amended to state that every Yemeni who meets the established prerequisites is fit and entitled to run for election to the position of president of the republic. An amendment should be made to require that a candidate's [minimum] age must be 40 and that a candidate must not be married to a foreigner, must not marry a foreigner during his term, must be of upright conduct and character, and must observe the religious rites. Article 87. It should be amended by adding to it a provision that limits the president and the vice president to just two five-year terms. Article 91. It should be amended by adding to it a provision stating that the vice president shall replace the president for a period of no more than 60 days in case the president's position becomes vacant. New presidential elections should be held during the aforementioned period. In case the vice president's position becomes vacant, the president should select a vice president and submit his name to the House of Representatives for approval. Article 98. It should be amended with a provision which states that the president and the vice president shall exercise the executive power on behalf of the people within the bounds stipulated by the constitution. The amendment is required to fill a noticeable deficiency in this regard and because the justification for the existing provision that concerns the form of the presidency will have ended, considering that it is proposed to amend this form. Article 99. It should be amended to state that the president of the republic is the supreme commander of the armed forces. This amendment is required in order to fill a noticeable deficiency in this regard, considering that this command is underlined in the National Defense Council law and the military service law and that this provision is a given in the various constitutional systems. In addition to the articles in this chapter that need to be amended in the aforementioned manner, whether in content or form or whether by replacement, the public interest dictates that the following three articles be added to this chapter: Article...The president shall be assisted in his duties by the vice president, and he may delegate some of his powers to the vice president. Article...An advisory council comprised of experts and specialized capabilities shall be formed to expand the base of participation with opinion and to organize utilization of the accumulated national capabilities and expertise. The law shall determine the provisions concerning the council. An article to prevent carrying out death sentences, unless approved by the president of the republic: The president of the republic shall be empowered (except in cases of religious punishment) to pardon or reduce the punishment. A general amnesty shall be by law only. All constitutions agree to tie this provision, which requires the president's approval for the execution of a death sentence, to the head of state. The same thing applies to tying a general amnesty to the law. Second Branch The Government (Council of Ministers) In the skeletal structure of state authorities, the government represents the second branch of the executive authority. This is its normal status. The provisions concerning the government are listed in Chapter 3 of the constitution. This gives the impression that the government is an authority that is far from the state presidency whereas most articles of the various chapters of the constitution contain explicit and specific provisions concerning the status of the government as a higher state executive and administrative authority. The president of the republic supervises the formation of this authority and its performance of its duties; controls its activities; and brings its members to account. This authority is also subject to the control of and accountable before the House of Representatives. According to the structure of state authorities that has just been presented, inclusion of the provisions pertaining to the government in a branch within the chapter on the executive authority will set matters right, will accomplish the required clarity in the structure of the constitutional institutions, and will regulate relations between these institutions. The above reflects the main tendency concerning classification and the indications emanating from classification. As for articles that are required to be amended within the framework of this branch, they are the following: Article 103. The constitution is the law which defines fundamentally the powers of the Council of Ministers, the prime minister, and the ministers. Therefore, there is no place for a special law to define these powers. However, there is nothing to prevent laws from stipulating that special tasks or powers may be assigned to the Council of Minister, the prime minister, or the ministers, depending on the nature of the issues with which each law deals separately and on what is dictated by the nature of the activity exercised by each minister. It is extremely difficult for one law to encompass the powers of the ministers that are scattered in various laws. But on the other hand, it is logical that the law should spell out the general rules for organizing cabinet ministries, the various state agencies, and public establishments and companies. But to define the powers of cabinet ministries and their outfits by law is extremely difficult. It is difficult practically and in terms of the sound concept of administrative reform and of what is dictated by the science of administration. This science requires reasonable flexibility in organization and modernization, which are tantamount to an ongoing and ever-renewed process that is governed by the general organizational principles determined by the law. Therefore, the required amendment dictates that the legislator be content with ensuring that the law defines the general principles of organization, including the criteria and controls that must be observed in organizing the cabinet ministries, establishments, and other administrative divisions. The law must also define the other legislative instruments with which this administrative division is accomplished. Article 111. This article should be rephrased to ensure that the House of Representatives is empowered to refer the prime minister, his deputies, the ministers, or their deputies to interrogation and trial instead of being empowered to just recommend such referral and trial. The amendment should also make clear the natural sequence of the relevant procedures. Article 113. It should be amended to empower the prime minister to ask the president of the republic to relieve a minister with whom the prime minister deems it impossible to cooperate. This would replace the provision stipulating that the prime minister merely refer the matter to the president to determine what he deems fit. Thus, discipline will be achieved at the cabinet level. Article 114. It should be amended by adding to it that in case the House of Representatives withholds and withdraws confidence from the cabinet and in case a new general House of Representatives election is held, then the prime minister must submit his cabinet's resignation to the president of the republic. Article...It is required to add an amendment to this branch to define the prerequisites a cabinet minister has to meet, the same as in the case of house members, bearing in mind that a cabinet member may not be less than 30 years old. Third Branch Local Government Agencies The main amendment tendencies in this connection--in addition to the new classification which will put this authority under the Third Branch instead of Chapter 4, thus making it harmonious with the aforementioned skeletal structure of the constitutional institutions-- focus on adding some provisions to fill the deficiencies in some aspects and to expand the powers of local councils, considering that they are an indivisible part of the state authority. The amendment tendencies also focus on rearranging some paragraphs within the articles of this chapter as follows: Article 117. It should be amended by adding to it a provision so the law will indicate how the heads of administrative units are selected and so it will state on what scientific principles and criteria administrative division is founded. Two paragraphs in this article should be transferred to Article 119. Article 118. It should be amended to state clearly that governorate and district councils shall be elected in a general and free direct referendum. The amendment should also expand these councils' powers in the areas of public services, of proposing programs, plans, and budgets for the administrative unit, and of supervising and bringing to account local government agencies in accordance with the law. The amendment should also adopt decentralized administration as a basis for the local government system. Article 119. It should be amended by adding to its beginning some provisions transferred from Article 119 because this would be the natural place for these provisions. The phrase "president of the republic" should be added next to the phrase "Council of Ministers" in connection with the accountability of governors. Article...An amendment is required by adding an article to this branch on promoting and nurturing cooperative development bodies in the administrative units, considering that they are among the most important instruments of local development. Chapter 3 The Judiciary Authority In harmony with the main amendment tendencies that seek to clarify the skeletal structure of the constitutional state institutions, amendment seems to be most urgently needed in the judiciary authority, whether in terms of classification or of the name under which the judiciary authority is listed. It is noticed that in the current classification of the constitution, the judiciary authority is not considered one of the state authorities included in Section 3. A subsequent section, i.e., Section 4, has been set aside for this authority. This classification gives the impression that this authority is just a service utility. The title of this section, namely, "The Judiciary and Public Prosecution," creates confusion. Therefore, the normal thing is to classify the articles governing the judiciary authority under Section 3. In the new tendency, this section is entitled "Organization of the State Authorities." Chapter 3 of this section should be devoted to this authority and should be entitled "The Judiciary Authority." On the one hand, this title is compatible with the conventional well-known division of state authorities and, on the other hand, it eliminates the confusion created by the current title in connection with the judiciary authority's unity. In addition to the aforementioned amendment concerning classification and title, the main amendment tendencies focus on achieving greater guarantees of independence for the judiciary and on eliminating the duality and overlapping connected with supervision over the judiciary, as well as the subsequent negatives emanating from this duality and overlapping. These guarantees are achieved as follows: Article 120. It should be amended to stipulate that courts shall have the power to settle all disputes. It should also state explicitly that it is not permissible to grant judiciary powers to any authorities other than the courts, thus reinforcing the original provision in Article 121 which prohibits setting up special courts under any circumstances. Article 123. It should be amended to strengthen the judiciary's independence by granting the Supreme Judiciary Council the power to study and pass the judiciary budget prior to its inclusion as one figure in the state's general budget. Article 124. It should be amended in a manner that does not undermine the judiciary's unity by providing for the presence of a single supreme court in the republic. But this should not prevent the presence of specialized courts, including administrative courts which are specialized in settling administrative disputes and disciplinary court cases, in order to ensure the supremacy of the principle of legitimacy and to emphasize judiciary control over the administration's activities. To safeguard this [control], the required amendment should include the Supreme Court's powers, adding to them the power to interpret laws and to try the president of the republic, the vice president, the prime minister and his deputies, and the ministers and their deputies. The numbers used to enumerate paragraphs shall be replaced by letters of the alphabet so as to make them compatible with the various articles of the constitution. Paragraph 3 formerly C in the proposed amendment, on election disputations shall be amended to ensure that its objective is achieved and that duality of power over these disputations will be eliminated. Section 5 Principles of Constitutional Amendment and General Rules In light of the aforementioned proposal to amend the classification concerning the judiciary authority so that it will be covered by an independent chapter in Section 3--which governs the organization of state authorities--instead of being covered, as it is currently, by provisions in Section 4, future amendment will change this condition, turning Section 5 into Section 4 and Section 6 into Section 5. This is a part of the main amendment tendencies in the area of form. Article 129. The main tendency of the principles of constitutional amendment focuses on providing greater protection for the constitution and for tying any future amendment of the constitution or of its provisions to the people. The amendment will add a provision that states that the issue of amendment of the constitution shall be presented to the people under all circumstances so as to get their approval of such amendment through a general popular referendum. Thus, no amendment will become valid unless it gains the approval of the majority of the citizens who take part in the referendum and who are included in the voter lists. This important addition has its roots in the need to refer to the people for amendment of the constitution which was approved by a popular referendum. Therefore, amendment should be made with the same legislative instrument with which the original constitution was approved, namely public referendum. Article...It is required to include a transitional provision concerning the president of the republic and his vice president in this section to stipulate that when this amendment is passed by the House of Representatives, the president will be elected by the house just once after the approval. Candidates for the position of president should be nominated by one-fourth the house members. A candidate who gains the majority of the house votes will be the president. This should be done because of the lack of time and out of consideration for the citizens who were summoned to vote in a general election only recently. Article...an article should be added to state that an independent and impartial higher committee shall supervise and control general elections and referendums. It should also stipulate that the law will determine how this committee is formed and appointed, what its powers are, and what prerequisites have to be met by its members. Article 130. It must be abolished because of the partitionist traces it reflects and because there is no need for it now that the transitional period has ended, considering all the laws that were passed during this period. Article 131. It should be amended by adding the phrase "I will adhere to the Koran and to His apostle's sunna" at the beginning of the constitutional oath out of harmony with the people's Islamic faith.
