EPA also proposes a maximum penalty of $5,000 per day for each violation cited, and a maximum cumulative penalty in the range of $15,000 to $25,000 per citation. Upon receipt of a field citation, a respondent must either pay the proposed penalty or submit a request for a hearing. Hearing procedures are also proposed in this document.
