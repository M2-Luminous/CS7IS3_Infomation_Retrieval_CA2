"We will only be able to maintain our place in the world if we compete together with others," Kohl said at an European election event of his party in Eutin (Schleswig-Holstein) on Tuesday evening [10 May]. Every fourth job in the old laender depends on exports to countries of the European Union, Kohl stressed. German unity and European unification are two sides of the "same coin," Kohl emphasized. "If we do the right thing now, peace and freedom in Europe will be secured in the 21st century." According to the chancellor, a single currency in a joint Europe must, above all, be stable. The FRG Government will not agree to a European currency if it does not have the same stability and quality as the German mark. At the rally, in which, according to police estimates, about 1,000 people participated, Kohl welcomed the decision in favor of Frankfurt on Main as the seat of the future European central bank. In the domestic policy part of his speech, Kohl said that, in his opinion, the FRG has overcome the economic low. There is an upward tendency. There are encouraging signs; a stable currency and a low inflation rate are the "most social policy." [as received]
