FR940906-0-00074 FR940906-0-00020 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Joseph C. White, ATP&hyph;230, Air Traffic Rules Branch, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591, telephone (202) 267&hyph;8783. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Offshore Airspace Reconfiguration Final Rule (58 FR 12128; March 2, 1993), effective December 9, 1993, replaced the Valparaiso, Florida, Terminal Area and Special Air Traffic Rules in part 93 of the FAR, with the Eglin Florida Class D airspace area. This rule also amended part 71 of the FAR to revoke the Eglin AFB, Florida and the Eglin AF Auxiliary No. 3, Duke Field, Florida Class D airspace areas; modified the Hurlburt Field, Florida Class D airspace area and the Crestview, Florida Class E airspace area; and established the Eglin, Florida Class D North-South corridor. However, by a separate rulemaking action (58 FR 63274; November 30, 1993), these two portions of the Offshore Airspace Reconfiguration Final Rule were delayed until December 8, 1994. This delay permitted the FAA and the Department of Defense (DOD) to conduct a joint micro-review of the effects of the airspace reclassification on this area. The joint micro-review concluded that when the Eglin, Florida Class D airspace area becomes effective on December 8, 1994, the requirement for enhanced air traffic control service in the North-South and East-West corridors will lead to dramatic increases in air traffic and the Eglin Radar Control Facility (ERCF) controller workload. These increases in air traffic and controller workload will increase air traffic control delays imposed on civil and military aircraft, both in the air and on the ground. Under the Valparaiso, Florida, Special Air Traffic Rules in part 93 of the FAR, access to the North-South corridor is limited during military operations, but access to the East-West corridor is not impeded. However, under the Eglin Class D airspace area, with the same type of military operations, access to the entire Class D airspace area (both the North-South and East-West corridors) will be limited. Accordingly, it was deemed necessary to retain the Valparaiso, Florida Terminal Area and Special Air Traffic Rules contained in part 93 of the FAR to maintain unlimited access to the East-West corridor and maintain the present level of safety for aircraft transiting the North-South and East-West corridors. On July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34192), (Notice No. 94&hyph;23), the FAA proposed to retain the Valparaiso, Florida Terminal Area and Special Air Traffic Rules in part 93 of the FAR; revise the Class D airspace areas for Eglin AFB and Eglin AF Auxiliary No. 3 Duke Field, and Hurlburt Field; revise the Crestview Class E airspace area; and delete the Eglin Class D North-South corridor. Additionally, to enhance safety in the immediate vicinity of the Eglin AFB, the FAA proposed to move the southern boundary of the North-South corridor from its present lateral position north of Eglin AFB to a position south of Eglin AFB coincident with latitude 30 ○25 ’01 ’ ’ North. The existing designation of the entire North-South corridor and the center section of the East-West corridor, from surface to an unlimited altitude, was found to be excessive. Therefore, the FAA proposed to modify both the North-South corridor and the center portion of the East-West corridor to the surface up to, but not including, 18,000 feet MSL. Excluding the center portion described above, the remainder of the East-West corridor airspace located below Restricted Areas R&hyph;2915C, R&hyph;2919B, and R&hyph;2914B extends from the surface up to but not including 8,500 feet MSL. This effectively divides the East-West corridor into a western section, a center section, and an eastern section. This action was proposed to simplify operating procedures and the complex aeronautical charting of Eglin's airspace. Additionally, the action was proposed to further reduce the potential hazard of VFR aircraft crossing the flight paths of high speed, high performance, and often armed military aircraft transiting to/from/between Eglin's most commonly used East (R&hyph;2914A, R&hyph;2919A) and West (R&hyph;2915A, R&hyph;2915B) ranges. Notice No. 94&hyph;23 as published, incorrectly described the Class D airspace area for Eglin AFB; and inadvertently deleted the Hurlburt Field Class D airspace area and the Crestview Class E airspace area. Therefore, on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 36730), the FAA published a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking which corrected the Eglin AFB description, and retained/revised the Hurlburt Field Class D airspace area, and the Crestview, Florida Class E airspace area. No comments were received on these proposals. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and Class E airspace designations are published respectively in paragraphs 5000 and 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9B, dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. In addition, this action modifies the Hurlburt Field, Florida Class D airspace area by amending the area's effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operations. This action also modifies the Crestview, Florida Class E airspace area by amending the area's effective hours to coincide with the associated Flight Service Station's (FSS) hours of operation. The intended effect of these modifications is to clarify when two-way radio communications are required and when weather observation services are provided when the associated control tower and FSS is closed. The Hurlburt, Florida, Class D airspace area and the Crestview, Florida, Class E airspace area will revert to Class G airspace when the associated control tower and FSS are not in operation. The Rule This action retains the Valparaiso, Florida Terminal Area and Special Air Traffic Rules in part 93 of the FAR. Further, this action: (1) revises the Class D airspace areas for Eglin AFB, and the Eglin AF Auxiliary No. 3 Duke Field, and Hurlburt Field, Florida; (2) revises the Crestview, Florida Class E airspace area; and (3) deletes the Eglin, Florida Class D North-South corridor. Additionally, this final rule revises the North-South corridor airspace area described in part 93 of the FAR, by reestablishing the vertical limits of that corridor from the surface up to, but not including 18,000 feet MSL and by moving the southern boundary from its present lateral position north of Eglin AFB to a position south of Eglin AFB coincident with latitude 30 ○25 ’01 ’ ’ North. This action also modifies the center portion of the East-West corridor to include airspace from the surface up to but not including 18,000 ft MSL. This effectively divides the East-West corridor into the following three sections: (1) The west section which includes that East-West corridor airspace area underlying Restricted Area R&hyph;2915C and extending upward from the surface to, but not including, 8,500 feet MSL. (2) The center section which includes that East-West corridor airspace area that does not underlie any of the restricted areas associated with Eglin AFB and extends upward from the surface to, but not including 18,000 feet MSL. (3) The east section which includes that East-West corridor airspace area underlying Restricted Areas R&hyph;2919B and R&hyph;2914B extending from the surface up to, but not including, 8,500 ft MSL.
