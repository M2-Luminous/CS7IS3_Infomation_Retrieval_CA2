"We should not exaggerate differences existing among us. We should not forget that we are committed to being a united nation. Our slogan is unity in diversity. We are diverse but are determined to be united," the president said. Receiving students from the fourth course of the National Defence Institute (Lemhanas) at the Bina Graha Presidential Office, the head of state said that the main challenges being faced by Indonesia are issues regarding human rights, openness, democratization, and the environment. "Human rights, openness, democratization, and environmental issues could be abused to create unrest at home," Suharto said. If this happened, he added, it would threaten national development and weaken national stability. The president was accompanied by Defense and Security Minister Edi Sudrajat and Lemhanas Governor Lt. Gen. Mutoyib. He said the challenges facing Indonesia from outside are the negative impacts of economic globalization and the penetration of foreign cultures due to sophisticated technology and information systems. Lemhanas Governor Mutoyib reported earlier that the Lemhanas course began on February 5 and would last until June 25. It is being attended by 95 participants, including 39 senior armed forces officers and officials from government departments, non-governmental agencies, and social organisations. President Suharto told the course participants that it is the duty of a leader to change a challenge into an opportunity, a weakness into a strength and to explain to the people what is happening around them. "The duty of a leader is difficult to carry out if the relevant parties do not provide support. Therefore, a leader must have a wide horizon and a mature personality" Suharto said.
