[passage omitted] Four "neutral" security circles were established in the cathedral where the talks will be held with representatives of the military police, nongovernmental organizations, the Mexican Red Cross, and the International Red Cross. [passage omitted] During the day the members of the EZLN will work on their agenda and work plans, Major "Moises" said shortly before entering the cathedral. "We are going to seek peace (...) we want better answers from the federal government," Lieutenant "Camilo" said in Ocosingo Municipality shortly before leaving for San Cristobal. In three communiques published by the media on Sunday, the armed group said it would not come to this city to ask for forgiveness but to demand justice. Shortly before departing to pick up the first group of rebels, Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation, stated in a communique that the effectiveness of the political solution "lies in a real commitment for change that will not endanger the essential principles of the nation and the state. We should emerge with new solutions for just causes here, but we should also strengthen the state of law. Only then will we have solutions and achieve lasting and democratic progress." We must respond to the demands of the armed group, but we must also respond to the demands of the communities in Chiapas who do not belong to that organization, to social groups who do not support them, and to an entire society which is hopeful but also troubled. [passage omitted] There are no deadlines to end the dialogue because "its objective is truly building peace, and therefore we are not going to make the main aspect -- the political part -- fail due to formalisms," Camacho Solis said. The agenda for the talks, agreed upon through indirect negotiations, includes economic, social, and political demands, in addition to definitively ending the hostilities. The economic demands refer to the situation of the Indians in Chiapas, while the social demands refer to racism, neglect, and respect for the culture and traditions of the Indian people in Chiapas. The political demands refer to opportunities for real participation by the Indians. Camacho Solis said on 20 February that the agenda includes economic, political, and social problems in Chiapas and no national topics. He added that national topics will be discussed, but no resolution will be issued on them. Camacho Solis had said he would allow the participation of EZLN representatives carrying weapons or wearing the ski masks that the rebel leaders usually wear. "If I must be in front of someone carrying a submachine gun or someone who prefers to wear a ski mask, I will respect his decision. If he decides to take it off, I will also respect his decision," Camacho Solis said. He explained that representatives from the registered political parties will attend the meeting and that there will be permanent communication with the so-called Plural Group of the National Congress for Chiapas in case there is need for another government representative at the talks. "If there is a joint conference or a joint communique at the end of the first round of talks, it would be an excellent signal that we are on the right track," Camacho Solis stressed. Bishop Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, and Camacho Solis issued a call to the people of San Cristobal to contribute to guaranteeing security during the meeting. After announcing the site of the talks at the cathedral, Ruiz asked the people to prevent any type of provocations, disturbances, partisan demonstrations, or irresponsible actions. In his homily, Ruiz said that in view of the importance of the meeting, San Cristobal and its main church will be called from now on "the city and the cathedral of peace" and urged the people to mark their homes with the sign of peace.
