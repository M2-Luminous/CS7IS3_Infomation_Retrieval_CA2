At the summit convened in the Senegalese capital because of a financial crisis facing the multi-national airline, its French director Yves Rolland-Billecart a new five-year mandate. Niger's former prime minister Amadou Cheiffou had been mooted to replace Rolland-Billecart, whom some African governments had accused of failing in his management of the airline. The 11 heads of state and government gathered here called for a "financial audit" of the company. Rolland-Billecart said his new plan provides for a profit of 300 million CFA francs (almost one million dollars) in 1994, turning round a deficit of four billion CFA francs (13.6 million dollars) in 1993. "There will be economies across the board, but no cuts in staff," he declared. Share-holders of Air Afrique are Benin, Burkina Faso, Congo, the Central African Republic, Ivory Coast [Cote d'Ivoire], Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, Chad and Togo. The last recovery plan Rolland-Billecart introduced in 1989 led to the loss of 1,750 jobs among 5,000. The new recapitalisation plan has been made necessary by the refusal in December of the African Development Bank to contribute to a raising of the company's capital, obliging each member state to pay 500 million CFA francs (1.7 million dollars). France has agreed to help out countries unable to do so. At the meeting here, Guinea-Bissau became the 12th member of Air Afrique. [passage omitted]
