The spokesman made the above statement on the occasion of Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos's interview with LA REPUBBLICA. During that interview, Pangalos referred to the mutual right, or mutual demand as he later corrected it, by Greece and Skopje for the term "Macedonia." In the same interview, Pangalos said that Greece will lift the embargo against Skopje if Skopje removes the Sun of Veryina [from its symbols] and makes a clarifying declaration regarding the disputed articles of its constitution. In an interview on FLASH Radio [Athens-based private radio station] this morning, Pangalos said that he was referring to a mutual demand and not to a mutual right to the term "Macedonia." On this issue, the government spokesman said: I think that to search for very specific expressions or interpretations of expressions, does not help the execution of our foreign affairs.
