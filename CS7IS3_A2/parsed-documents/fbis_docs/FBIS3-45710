Officials of Korea have recently held secret talks with Australian diplomats in Jakarta and Bangkok on the reopening of diplomatic dialogue between the two governments, the spokesman said. The move came 19 years after diplomatic ties between the two countries broke down in 1975 when Australia backed South Korea in the United Nations. The Australian Government is considering the proposal by the DPRK, but "no decisions have been made at present", the spokesman stressed. However, it will be "an option" for Australia to invite a North Korean official at junior minister level to visit Canberra later this year to discuss the issue, he said. It is understood that Australia has made it clear that some conditions will have to be met by Pyongyang before the ties between the two countries can be renewed. The conditions include North Korea allowing international inspectors into the country to examine its nuclear facilities and resumption of high-level talks between North Korea, South Korea and the United States. If Australia restores diplomatic links with the DPRK, it will be the first English-speaking western country to do so. The Australian Government has informed the U.S., Japan and South Korea of the approach by the DPRK, the spokesman said.
