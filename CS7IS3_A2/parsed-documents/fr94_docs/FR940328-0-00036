FR940328-0-00036 FR940328-0-00012 A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range The native vegetation of the Koolau Mountains and adjacent areas has undergone extreme alterations because of past and present land management practices, including deliberate alien plant and animal introductions, agricultural development, military use, and recreational use (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Wagner et al . 1985). Degradation of habitat by feral pigs and competition with alien plants are considered the greatest present threats to the 11 plant taxa in this final rule. Feral pigs ( Sus scrofa ) have been in the Koolau Mountains for about 150 years and are known to be one of the major modifiers of wet forest habitats (Stone 1985). Pigs damage the native vegetation by rooting and trampling the forest floor, which encourages the spread of alien plant taxa that are better able to exploit the newly tilled soils than are native taxa (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Stone 1985). Feral pigs also feed on the starchy interior of tree ferns ( Cibotium ) and other succulent-stemmed plants (See Factor C). The last known population of three individuals of Cyanea truncata in Hidden Valley was destroyed in recent years by feral pigs (CPC 1989a, 1989b, 1990; HHP 1991b1). The continued impact of pigs poses an immediate and severe threat to any plants of Cyanea truncata that may remain (L. Mehrhoff, pers. comm., 1993). Habitat degradation and predation of Rollandia crispa by pigs has been observed at the Hidden Valley population (L. Mehrhoff, pers. comm., 1993). Feral pigs are known to frequent regions of the Koolau Mountains and threaten to destroy the habitat of Eugenia koolauensis , Hesperomannia arborescens , Lobelia oahuensis , Rollandia crispa , and Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa (HHP 1991f10, 1991g5, 1991j16, 1993a3, 1993d2; HPCC 1990b1, 1990c; K. Nagata and S. Perlman, pers. comms., 1991). The only population of Hesperomannia arborescens on Maui is threatened by pigs as well (HHP 1991f23, HPCC 1990b2). Goats ( Capra hircus ) have become established on the island of Molokai as well as other major Hawaiian islands (Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii) (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, van Riper and van Riper 1982). Goats are managed in Hawaii as a game animal, but are able to forage in extremely rugged terrain and populate inaccessible areas where hunting has little effect on their numbers (Culliney 1988, HHP 1990). Feral goats eat native vegetation, trample roots and seedlings, cause erosion, and promote the invasion of alien plants. On Molokai, goats degrade dry forests at low elevations and they are expanding their range (Cuddihy and Stone 1990; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1991). Goats browse on introduced and native plants, especially in dry, open ecosystems similar to that found between Wailau and Waiehu on the island of Molokai. In 1989, it was observed that numerous goats occupied the Wailau-Waiehu area and threatened the survival of the only population of Hesperomannia arborescens on the island (HHP 1991f11). Although there is no longer a large feral goat population on Oahu, the effects of the goat trade in the early 1820s, which allowed goats to proliferate without being confined by fences, and resultant damage by goats to the native flora have permanently altered Oahu's native ecosystems (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Culliney 1988, Tomich 1986). Today, little of the original forests of the Koolau Mountains remain (Wagner et al . 1985). Like goats, cattle ( Bos taurus ) were once abundant on Oahu. Because of past restrictions on hunting, widespread ranching, and ineffective confinement of the animals, the goat and cattle population boomed and spread to many parts of the island (Culliney 1988). The impact of cattle on the native vegetation was similar to that described for goats (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Scott et al . 1986, Tomich 1986). It was not until local land managers recognized the extent of destruction of native vegetation by these animals that their numbers were controlled. However, by then much of the plant cover on cattle-grazing land on Oahu and other islands was already degraded. Such areas remained grassland for many years following the removal of cattle (Culliney 1988). Although not a current threat to the taxa in this rule, cattle that once roamed through the Koolau Mountains contributed to the reduction in the range of many native plants, probably including at least some of the 11 plant taxa.
