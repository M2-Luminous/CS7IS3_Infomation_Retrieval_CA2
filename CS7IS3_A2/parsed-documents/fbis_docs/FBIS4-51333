The move, covering the social and natural sciences, aims to raise the number in post-doctoral programmes from 1,500 to 3,000 by the year 2000, said Cheng Lianzhang, the Vice-Minister of Personnel. In January, the government raised annual funding for post-doctoral scholars from 15,000 yuan ($1,700) to 20,000 yuan ($2,300). Last year 728 post-doctoral scholars were recruited by almost 300 work stations in 165 higher-education and research institutes nationwide. Enrolment of such scholars has increased 27 percent annually since 1988, according to the Ministry of Personnel. The increase shows the importance the State pays to the work of post-doctoral scholars, Cheng said. The fund covers the salary and preliminary research expenditures of scholars, who usually undertake two to three research projects, including key State undertakings, during their two-year training. While enterprises and public organizations are donating more money to post-doctoral projects, government funds have increased by 30 per cent annually. Since the post-doctoral system was introduced in 1985, China has poured 115.56 million yuan ($13.34 million) to support research. And more than 1,300 post-doctoral scholars have come out of the two-year training programmes at the stations. Most of them have been employed as senior researchers and 32 became tutors for doctorate students, said Zhang Xiaowen. Vice Minister of the State Education Commission.
