It is not too early to say that that day saw the beginning of a new stage in the political life of the autonomous republic. And it began with a rather resounding scandal. The monolithic Russia bloc, which holds a majority in the Crimean parliament, proved to be made of clay and full of cracks. The split was caused by disagreement over the candidates for the office of the chairman of the autonomous republic's Supreme Council. The scandal itself broke out because Serhiy Tsekov, one of the candidates for the speaker's office, connived at concealing from the public that Serhiy Kovalevskyy, a Russia bloc deputy, had a criminal record. It was learned that S. Kovalevsky had once been sentenced to eight years of imprisonment for taking part in a gang rape of a minor girl. These "revelations," which were initiated by Deputy V. Mordashov, also a Russia bloc activist, who supported V. Klychnykov, another candidate of this bloc, nonetheless ended in the victory of former People's Deputy of Ukraine Serhiy Tsekov, a physician from Saky, who now heads the Republican Movement of Crimea [RDK]. Forty-eight of 98 deputies voted for S. Tsekov, which was enough to elect him chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea. For Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov, who supported Tsekov, this proved a Pyrrhic victory, because it led to a split in the "presidential" faction of the Russia bloc. There were strange happenings the following day as well. RDK activists O. Melnykov and V. Mezhak, who were nominated by the newly elected speaker and whose candidacies had been approved at a meeting of Russia bloc deputies, were voted down by parliament. Undoubtedly, this local crisis in the Supreme Council of the autonomous republic will be resolved in time. One could attribute it to the inexperience and "youthfulness" of the Crimean deputies. But some parliamentarians are already critical of their colleagues. Deputy Serhiy Shuryha, a well-known businessman from Sevastopol, told MOLOD UKRAYINA's correspondent in an interview that as things stand today, the Crimean Supreme Council in its present composition is far removed from vital economic problems and could become mired in politicking. Deputy Lilya Budzhurova, a Crimean Tatar journalist, agrees with him: "Unfortunately, the majority of the Russia bloc deputies are aggressive or simply incompetent in many matters that are of vital importance to parliamentarians." Thus the direction in which the newly elected parliament of the autonomous republic will lead the Crimea remains an open question.
