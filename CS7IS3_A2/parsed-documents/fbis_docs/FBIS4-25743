He said at the meeting that there are only three years plus 17 days before the transfer of government in 1997, but a good deal of things needed to be done to ensure a smooth transition. In particular, many issues in the field of economic affairs should be considered and solved as soon as possible. For example, the issue of property prices, the coordination of capital construction between Hong Kong and the mainland, the operational costs and charges of the container terminal, and the shipping arrangements between Hong Kong and the mainland. Lu Ping said: Now, there are only three years plus 17 days before the transfer of government in Hong Kong. "When meeting the delegation of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, our President Jiang said that time flies like an arrow, and the sun and the moon move back and forth like a shuttle. Three years will pass very quickly, but we are now still facing a great deal of preparatory work. Such preparatory work only serves the purpose of guaranteeing Hong Kong's smooth transition to the period beyond 1997. We hope to achieve this purpose in the political, economic, and social aspects." When talking about the issue of flat prices in Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Government's recent measures, Lu Ping said: "We should have foresight when approaching this issue, and should not only look at current prices. Because the measures set forth by the British Hong Kong authorities will become effective before 1997, we hope that after 1997, a smooth transition will be effected for both flat prices and land prices, and no major fluctuations will arise." He added that in order to ensure a smooth transition, the relevant issues must be submitted to the the Sino-British Land Committee and other channels for mutual consultation, because these issues are all related to how Hong Kong will be able to maintain prosperity after 1997. He said: The soaring flat prices have made ordinary people unable to buy flats, and this is indeed a big problem which must be solved. At the same time, the high flat prices will also raise the costs of production and thus weaken the competitive power of Hong Kong products. In addition, this may force some overseas transnational groups to give up plans for setting up Asian or Far East headquarters in Hong Kong, or force some of them to move their regional headquarters out of Hong Kong to other countries or regions. This will certainly affect Hong Kong's status as an international economic, trade, and financial center. Therefore, he stressed, the issue of high property prices must be resolved as soon as possible. The Chinese side has also long expressed its opinion. It is hope that the British Hong Kong authorities will squarely face this problem, and will adopt some measures that are really effective. On the other hand, however, this issue must be handled prudently. "Like a person who has a high fever, the body temperature cannot be lowered drastically, but should be cooled down gradually." The real estate industry is the pillar of the Hong Kong economy. If drastic ups and downs arise, the overall economy in Hong Kong will certainly be affected. As for the issue of coordinating the large-scale capital construction projects between Hong Kong and the nearby mainland areas, Lu Ping said that this will not only affect Hong Kong, but will also affect the development of the mainland cities. For example, the plans for the construction of railways, highways, and shipping terminals on the two sides must be properly coordinated. It is impossible that each goes its own way. Otherwise, what should be done in the future if the projects launched separately on the two sides do not dovetail or become incompatible? Lu Ping cited an example and said: At present, China is building the Beijing-Jiulong (Kowloon) Railway. After the railway line stretches to Shenzhen, where should it be extended into Hong Kong, how should the railways built on both sides be linked up? In addition, there is a shortage of storage facilities along the railway line on the Hong Kong side; after the new railway is opened to traffic in the future, how will the Hong Kong side handle the suddenly increasing freight as well as passengers? The settlement of all such issues requires coordination between the two sides. With regard to the construction of the new container terminals, Lu Ping said that Hong Kong actually needs to build new container terminals, but attention should also be paid to the competition from the new container terminals in Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Shekou. In particular, operation costs and charges of the Hong Kong container terminals are rather high now, and this may weaken their competitiveness. Therefore, Lu Ping said, if the construction and operation costs of Container Terminal Number Nine are not properly brought under control, the new terminal will not have competitive power if it is built. As for the shipping arrangements between Hong Kong and the mainland, Lu Ping said that it is necessary to consider as soon as possible the issue of whether ships registered in Hong Kong will be treated as "foreign ships" or "domestic ships" when entering mainland harbors after 1997, and how the Chinese ships will be treated when entering the harbor of Hong Kong, because this is an issue that both sides will be facing as of 1 July 1997.
