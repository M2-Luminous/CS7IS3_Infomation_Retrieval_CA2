Garten told Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), that the United States would like to know how it can help Japan's deregulation. He noted that numerous proposals are being made in Japan's industry, but that it is doubtful that they will actually be put into action. In response Toyoda expressed enthusiasm for deregulatory measures, saying, "We must go forth with deregulation even if it hurts." He said he hoped the U.S. Government would let it be widely known that deregulation will lead to more business opportunities. Toyoda also said that he is pressing the government to set up a surveillance body to oversee deregulation. On the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, Garten said he expects it will take some time before the discussions make progress. The U.S. official implied that the Japanese Government should continue making income tax cuts, pointing out that fiscal measures taken so far are insufficient to encourage domestic demand. 07 JUN 0446
