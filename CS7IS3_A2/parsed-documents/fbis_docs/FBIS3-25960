The move follows the announcement on December 29 that China was to scrap the dual exchange rate and float the yuan from January 1 this year. However, technical problems have prevented the new system from operating immediately. The first quarter of this year will be a transitional period when foreign exchange retention quotas will be gradually phased out and an embryonic interbank foreign exchange market will come into existence. According to Tsang Shu-ki, senior lecture at Hong Kong Baptist College, Beijing aims to connect all swap centres with the new system in three months. By April 1, the National Foreign Exchange Centre, located in Shanghai, will supplant existing swap centres in China and will become a national interbank market for appointed banks to trade and settle foreign currencies. All enterprises will then have to exchange currency with appointed banks. He said: "It needs a transitionary period to transform swap-based currency trading into a bank-based one. "By that time, Shanghai will become an interbank centre and those banks appointed can buy and sell currencies in the interbank market," added Mr Tsang, who has consulted a number of Chinese officials from various authorities in Beijing. Alex Tang, research director of Yamaichi International, said: "They should have enough time to connect all swap centres." Previously, there were three exchange rates in China -- the swap rate (8.7 yuan to one U.S. dollar), the official rate (5.7 yuan to one U.S. dollar) and the black market rate. Companies with approvals traded currencies at the 100 swap centres while foreigners and individuals with approvals exchanged the yuan at appointed mainland banks at an official rate. Under the new exchange system, all swap centres will be removed and approved enterprises will buy and sell hard currencies at appointed banks. Shanghai's National Foreign Exchange Centre connects Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Xiamen and Chengdu. "At present, the satellite network can provide information only. You can't make any transaction through the network," said a Shanghai source. The national centre is supposed to play an interbank role. Beijing has yet to announce the list of members that will be allowed to trade at the centre. Mr Tsang estimated that only the four specialised banks--the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank of China and the People's Construction Bank of China--and the China Investment Bank would be allowed to enter the centre. "The centre can not handle too many banks," he added. The new exchange rate will be based on the daily average exchange rate traded at the centre one day before. Although the new system has already been introduced, details are scant. Like the old exchange trading method, the new system offers limited access, catering only to companies that need foreign currency for their operations.
