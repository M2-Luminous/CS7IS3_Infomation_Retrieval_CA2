Cover Page Notice Single Payment Office The General Services Administration, Federal Supply Service is pleased to announce the establishment of a single payment office for receipt and payment of schedule invoices. Invoices submitted for payment for all orders issued under this Federal Supply Schedule will no longer be paid by the individual ordering activities.

This new single payment procedure relieves contractors of the burden of invoicing numerous billing offices, resulting in a reduction in administrative costs for contractors.
