At a press conference in Moscow prior to his departure to Tokyo, Hata requested North Korea to accept full inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). He said he was "gravely concerned" that the IAEA could not confirm North Korea was not converting nuclear material for military use. In Vienna, the IAEA adopted a resolution on Monday to refer North Korea's refusal to allow full inspections of its nuclear facilities to the United Nations Security Council. Hata also said if the United Nations decides any sanctions against North Korea, Japan would like "to take a responsible action as a nation which regards the UN as most important."
