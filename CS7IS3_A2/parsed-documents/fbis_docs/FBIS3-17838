The Ministry, in its statement, supports all peaceful initiatives to solve the problems on the Korean peninsula and considers the solution of the North Korean nuclear inspection question to be an important step toward the unification of the Korean people. The Ministry supports the international demand as stated in United Nations Security Council Resolution 825 (1993) according to which North Korea must allow international experts access to all its nuclear sites. The Ministry shares the concerns expressed in the IAEA resolution of March 21, 1994 about North Korean violations on March 13 and 14 of the agreement which had been reached on February 15, 1994. The Ministry finds North Korea's behavior in connection with the inspection of its nuclear sites to be non-constructive and serving to escalate tensions. The Ministry supports the resolution of the resulting crisis via negotiations, including if necessary other nations in that region into this process.
