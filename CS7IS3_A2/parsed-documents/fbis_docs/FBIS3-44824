Liu Fangren said: Party committees and governments at all levels must uphold the basic line of "one center, two basic points," seek truth from facts, seize opportunities, and quicken the pace of development. They should adopt the idea of moving ahead as fast as possible, forging ahead bravely, and being courageous enough to do pioneering work. In the course of deepening reform, they should help advance the overall process, strive to make breakthroughs at key points, integrate theory with practice, apply various economic policies properly and flexibly, make substantial efforts to seize opportunities and strive to gain the initiative, and seek development while overcoming difficulties. Liu Fangren said: Today, the gap between eastern and western regions is widening. A poor region like Guizhou Province should have a sense of urgency. We must adopt and firmly establish in our mind the idea of macroagriculture and develop the rural economy in an all-round way. While not relaxing grain production, we should vigorously develop diversified economic operations, township and town enterprises, animal husbandry, and courtyard economy. We must actively use the noncultivated land resources to optimum results, conduct farming properly, and try to reclaim more farmland from mountains. In organizing the implementation of reform measures, we must subject local to overall and immediate to long-term interests, handle well the relationship among reform, development, and stability, and create a fine environment for economic development. We must make a good job of the grass-roots organization building in rural areas, focusing on the building of party branches, so that for each village, a good party branch secretary is selected, a good leadership group set up, and a road to prosperity found. It is necessary to establish a scientific management system and do a good job in the [words indistinct] activity, so that this activity can be brought to a new height. Liu Fangren also emphasized that in the future, when assessing the performance of leading cadres of the autonomous prefecture and counties, we should, first, look at the growth rate of revenue in the specific locality; second, find out how much peasant per-capita net income has grown; and third, find out how well party and spiritual civilization building have been conducted.
