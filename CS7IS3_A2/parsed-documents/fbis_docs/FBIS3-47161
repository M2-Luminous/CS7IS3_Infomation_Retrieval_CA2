Kim has been sought by the government since last year for his alleged involvement in irregularities in the nation's military build-up program, Yulgok. A local newspaper report yesterday said Kim, who has been in the United States since May 1993, has recently filed an application for permanent residentship with the U.S. government. The report added there is possibility that Kim may seek political asylum in the United States to avoid Seoul's investigation. But officials of the Foreign Ministry in Seoul said they have no such information. They said the U.S. State Department is expected to notify them when such a celebrity as Kim seeks a U.S. residentship. But there were no such report from the U.S. government concerning Kim, the officials said. Nor has the ministry any plans to inquire with the U.S. government about the matter at the moment, they said. The officials doubted the possibility that Kim had filed a request with the U.S. government. They said Kim doesn't need new permission to stay in America for his visa still holds good for a few more years. Kim went to the United States in May 1993, three months after the inauguration of the Kim Yong-sam government, at the invitation of a research institute in Washington. He has not returned home since then, even when his mother died late last year.
