In contrast, the media and their comments are inadvertently playing the role of representative to those political circles which are incapable of providing an objective and constructive analysis. These media commentators are under the impression that they have sensed some kind of difference in approach or even in the manner between the attitude of the head of state and the behavior of the government. The premier adds: On the contrary, I would like to stress in this respect and in a prudent manner and without ambiguity, that there is firm and complete coordination in the perception and in the work between the head of the state and myself. The continuous and determined struggle of the Algerian state against barbaric terrorism concerns all state institutions, and the same is true in respect of the political work aimed at establising a serious dialogue with all those partners who reject violence and accept the principles of national unity and the constitutional system. This political work is the concern of the head of the state and of the government. In his statement, the head of government says: The head of state is the one who advocates the method that leads to the creation of a structured and effective economy, and to the management of Algeria's foreign financial obligations. The head of state also coordinates and leads that effort. In conclusion, the head of government adds: Indeed, the political situation is complicated and I therefore urge the information media and those who formulate public opinion to be vigilant. We must fight the process of deception used by terrorism, in addition to other means, to kill and slaughter Algerians from all segments of society, and eradicate it. The Algerian state remains strong, united, and determined. The protection of society and saving Algeria is a sacred patriotic duty. Matters are clear: The people's rejection and banishment of terrorism clearly stipulate the unwaivering condemnation of those who work to create confusion in order to maintain instability and mix up.
