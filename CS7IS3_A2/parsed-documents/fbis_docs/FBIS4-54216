The amended law, which is now called the Foreign Investment Promotion and Management Law, was endorsed by the third ordinary session of the National Assembly (Third Legislature) held last month. This was seen as a remarkable and positive move by the Lao government in its economic policy which is at a new stage of development. The amendments to this law were intended to make it suit the current investment climate in Lao PDR [People's Democratic Republic]. It reflects more clearly the renovation policy of the Lao government, and guarantees the interests of both the investor and the government. As this law is more or less related to the labor law, amendments were also made to the labor law during the same session. Improving the labor law ensures greater fairness in relations between employers and employees, both local and foreign. In 1988, the Lao government introduced an open-door policy of multilateral economic ties and cooperation with foreign countries in an effort to gradually strengthen the economy of the country along the lines of a market-oriented economy. To help realise this policy, it promulgated a foreign investment law in the same year which was designed to attract investors to boost the social and economic development of the country. A national level committee, known as the Foreign Investment Management Committee (FIMC) was set up under the Committee for Planning and Cooperation to promote and manage foreign investment. Over the past years the open-door policy and the foreign investment law have to some extent added to the attraction of Laos in terms of business opportunities as well as for tourists. Investment statistics obtained from the FIMC show that in the three months from January to March 1994 some 43 new licensed foreign investments coming to a total of U.S. $116 million were made. The investments cover such sectors as agribusiness, manufacturing, tourism, mining, construction, telecommunication, banking, and service industries. Of the sectors, the service industry takes the lead in terms of investment amount. The investors are from such countries as Thailand, Australia, Italy, Japan, and China. To keep foreign investment growing in the country, the Lao government will have to ensure the effective implementation of its newly amended foreign investment law.
