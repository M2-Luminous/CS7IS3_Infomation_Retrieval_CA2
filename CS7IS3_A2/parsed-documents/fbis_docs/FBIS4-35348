Southern anti-aircraft batteries shot the missile apart, but debris fell on the Shaykh 'Uthman district in the north of the city, killing one person, the statement said. Witnesses said they heard anti-aircraft fire and a muffled explosion and a flash in the sky around 10:30 p.m. (1930 GMT). Northern Yemeni forces have periodically fire Soviet-made Luna missiles at Aden during the night, but most of them have been downed by southern anti-aircraft batteries. Three more dull thuds were heard around 2:00 a.m. in Aden on Sunday, although it was not clear what had caused them. Southern Yemen on Saturday appealed to Jordan to intervene to stop the civil war that broke out between the former North and South Yemen on May 5, according to official sources here. Anis Hasan Yahya, chairman of the Provisional Assembly of National Salvation, the week-old caretaker parliament of the newly-proclaimed Democratic Republic of Yemen, sent the message to Jordanian parliamentary speaker Tahir al-Masri, the source said. Yahya had asked for the "rapid intervention" of Jordan with the aim of "stopping the war, returning the warring armies to their original positions and starting immediate negotiations without preconditions under the aegis of the Arab League," he said. Jordan brokered a Yemeni peace accord in Amman last February 20, but the move to ease relations between the two Yemens, which had never fully integrated despite their unification in 1990, remained a dead letter. Amman last Sunday reaffirmed its commitment to a united Yemen recognised in international law. Meanwhile Yemeni Foreign Minister Mohammad Basindwah, a northerner, arrived Saturday in Cairo for the Non-Aligned Movement's meeting of foreign ministers, opening on Tuesday. Basindwah told reporters he had brought a message for Egyptian President Husni Mubarak from Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih about the situation in Yemen. He also met his Egyptian counterpart 'Amr Musa, who told reporters Egypt and the Gulf states had asked the United Nations Security Council to look into the Yemeni civil war. Musa stressed that a ceasefire had to be secured to stop the situation deteriorating. UN sources in New York said Oman had on Friday submitted to the Security Council a draft resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Yemen and the renewal of negotiations between the warring sides.
