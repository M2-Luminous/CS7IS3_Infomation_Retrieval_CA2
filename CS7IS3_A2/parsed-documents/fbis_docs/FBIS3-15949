He said that on Wednesday evening, at the closed consultations of the Security Council, the UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali told the members of the Security Council that the Georgian-Abkhaz negotiations which had been under way at the UN headquarters since 7 March ended due to unavailability of good prospects for reaching an agreement. There is not a single agreement signing which could be possible, said de Soto. According to him, Georgian-Abkhaz negotiations would probably resume in Geneva next month.
