But he added that important negotiations on exports and imports of goods, particularly food, were to take place by the end of March. The talks need not have to be conducted by the premiers. They can be conducted by agriculture ministers or within the Customs Union Council, Klaus said. On Czech Television tonight, Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy expressed interest in the new Slovak Government to be stable. He said he hoped the Czech and Slovak parties would find a common language at the March 28 session of the Customs Union Council in Bratislava and would succeed in finding ways of removing unnecessary technical obstacles to bilateral trade.
