The analyst says: Recently, former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone claimed that if the Democratic People's Republic of Korea refused to accept a "special inspection," the United Nations Security Council must not rule out possibilities of "economic sanctions." Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata urged the DPRK to take "steps to remove the suspicion of nuclear arms development," saying that "pressure for an inspection of the DPRK's military sites" would increase. Such remarks can be made only by wicked fellows. Japan has no justification to poke its nose into the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The way for the solution to the nuclear issue through the DPRK-U.S. talks is now open. The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula can be resolved only by the DPRK and the United States. The recently published conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York includes no word of "special inspection." Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries are impudently crying for a "special inspection" and "sanctions" by the United Nations Security Council. This is nothing but a move to impede the progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost by admonishing the United States and putting pressure on it. This is aimed at stifling the DPRK by setting in motion even the UN Security Council. While slandering the DPRK, the Japanese reactionaries are also seeking to find a pretext for Japan's nuclear armament. Japan intends to use the DPRK's "nuclear issue" as a playing card for stepping up its nuclear armament and soothing the worldwide concern over it. Such a foolish act of Japan, however, cannot work. We cannot but keep heightened vigilance in coping with the strained situation created by the full-scale acceleration of the nuclear armament of Japan.
