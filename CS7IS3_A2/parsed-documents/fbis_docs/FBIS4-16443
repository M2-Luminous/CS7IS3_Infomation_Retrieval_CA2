The group will now be called the "12 December" Liberal-Democratic Union. The "Decembrists'" political platform is based on two fundamental principles: loyalty to liberal-democratic values and a "healthy" conservatism. As we know, the group's leader, Boris Fedorov, had previously opposed "the political extremism of some democrats." In the document on offer the idea of conservatism is reflected in the interpretation of individual elements of social policy (the conservation of the system of free state health care with the gradual development of compulsory medical insurance; the recognition as valid of all awards of the USSR and the retention of their benefits by heroes of the Soviet Union and holders of the orders of Glory) and in the view of global questions of statehood. The "Decembrists" proclaim loyalty to the conservation of the Russian state's unity, putting forward the following slogans: "No to self-determination, yes to self-management," "no to a single-channel tax system," and "we are for unity of status, equal rights and powers for all components of the federation." The thesis of the defense of the Russian-speaking population's rights outside Russia "by all means accessible to the state" has been put forward. The "Decembrists" are by no means put out by the fact that there is already one liberal-democratic party in Russia. They insist that they are the true liberals and democrats since they consistently defend the principle of the freedom of the individual and a strong state as a guarantee of the individual's prosperous existence. The main thesis of the economic platform is: "We are in favor of a firm ruble. Inflation in 1994 should be reduced to 1-3 percent a month." In addition the "Decembrists" advocate financial discipline, are opposed to the issue of all kinds of benefits, and favor a realistic budget, "a one-off reduction of taxes by 15-25 percent to encourage business activity with the simultaneous reduction of state expenditure, and a reduction in the amount and types of taxation." Social policy, the "12 December" group members believe, should be built on the intensification of targeted support for poor strata of the population. As for big-league politics, the attitude toward political parties and movements is outlined as follows. "Russia's Choice" and "Yabloko" are "potential allies." But "we are in favor of greater pragmatism and a less politicized approach." The Liberal-Democratic Party -- its leadership is "shaming Russia" and its name "does not reflect the essence of that leadership's activity." We are in favor of cooperation with "Women of Russia." We are in favor of collaboration with the Party of Russian Unity and Accord. But only with individual "members close to us in their views." Here it is stipulated that "the position of part of that party's leadership contradicts Russia's interests and does not promote the attainment of civil accord." In an exclusive interview with IZVESTIYA, Boris Fedorov specified that it is primarily the national-state policy of that "part of the leadership" which the "Decembrists" do not like. Obviously the group disagrees with that part (and they undoubtedly have Sergey Shakhray in mind) also on the question of the political amnesty, which is sharply denounced in the document. As for the Communists, "we will not accept the majority of their ideological dogmas" but "we see among them sensible people with whom we can cooperate on specific programs." The "Decembrists" see the Agrarian Party members as potential allies although they "do not agree with their present approaches toward economic policy." The document also outlines the attitude toward the government: "We are not in the opposition." But only "as long as there is a chance of the government continuing constitutional transformations." The idea is also expressed of supporting a coalition government if "the coalition is based on consistent market reforms and loyalty to democratic principles and the principles of a social state." The "Decembrists" oppose early presidential elections. Commenting for IZVESTIYA on the aims of the publication of the political platform, Boris Fedorov noted that the main thing "is to agree within the Duma." But he did not rule out the possibility that in the future the proposed theses could become the basis for the political platform of the "Decembrists'" party. But that is obviously a question for the quite remote future: At a press conference devoted to the platform's adoption both Fedorov and Khakamada stated resolutely that they will not set the tasks of creating a party in the immediate future. But work will nonetheless be conducted in the regions, for the members of the union represent the most diverse territories. "This is not another Moscow elite get-together at which only his staffers stand behind the leader," Boris Fedorov stated. At the same time observers note that if you combine Fedorov's prestige and "Mrs. Khakamada's ability to earth up people" the party could be successful. It is true that its electorate remains a serious question for the future party. The problem is that it coincides very much with the electorate of Gaydar's party. Fedorov himself has said on this subject that anyone who wants to come to us can come. This must be understood as meaning good riddance to anyone who does not want to. At the press conference convened yesterday to present the "Decembrists'" political platform the group's leader also sharply denounced the Russian Government's signing of the agreement on the unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems. And to ensure that in the future the authorities have no opportunity for making decisions so easily on the unification of monetary systems or of conducting monetary reforms, Boris Fedorov suggests adopting a new law on the Central Bank which he has written. The main difference between this version of the law and the current one is that Fedorov himself believes it leaves less room for voluntarist actions by the Central Bank leadership. And a dual-level system is proposed for the bank's management -- trough the council of directors and an observation council -- which in the author's opinion will block the adoption of pointless, unconsidered decisions.
