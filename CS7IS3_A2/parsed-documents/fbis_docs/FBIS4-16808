"The talks must continue. This is our general line and we will not retreat from this line," he stressed. The Russian side believes that "the only way to resolve conflicts in former Yugoslavia and other parts of the world is to hold political talks." This position, the diplomat said, is the reason why Russia is calling for restraint, compromise, and mutual understanding. The Foreign Ministry spokesman blamed the so-called "party of war" for inflaming the situation around Gorazde by "recklessly gambling on the achievement of military victory." According to him, this gambling will first of all inflict damage on the Serbian people themselves. M. Demurin pointed to the inappropriateness of raising the question of lifting sanctions in a situation "where the Serbian troops are at Gorazde." In his opinion, the resolution of this question is being postponed for some time, depending on which way the situation develops." He said that during the recent talks between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, the Russian side promised Belgrade its "most active support" in resolving the questions of lifting the sanctions stage-by-stage. He said: "During the same meeting, other agreements were also reached, in particular, unblocking the situation around Gorazde." The Serbian side gave appropriate assurances, M. Demurin stressed. "However, the words of those who gave these assurances are totally at odds with their deeds," the Russian diplomat said.
