Gomez] [Text] Come and get me. An alleged former official of the Communist Party of the Philippines [CPP] issued this dare yesterday to CPP leader Gregorio "Ka [Comrade] Roger" Rosal in reaction to reports that a "people's court" was set to mete out death sentences to him and three former comrades in the underground movement. "Let them shoot me," Ricardo Reyes, an alleged former member of the CPP Central Committee, told the INQUIRER. "I'm an easy target, anyway, going around, leading a normal life." A report emanating from a rebel base in Sierra Madre quoted Rosal as saying a communist people's court was about to convene and hand down judgment on the four alleged former CPP officials. The three others are Romulo Kintanar, reportedly a former chief of the New People's Army [NPA]; Arturo Tabara, alleged former head of the CPP Visayas Commission; and, Felimon Lagman, alleged leader of the CPP Manila-Rizal Regional Party Committee. Rosal, CPP spokesperson of the NPA Melitor Glor Command in Southern Tagalog, reportedly said all four were likely to suffer the same fate as Leopoldo "Ka Hector" Mabilangan, ousted leader of the NPA Banahaw Command. Mabilangan was shot dead in Sto. [Holy] Tomas, Batangas, on 3 April. It was Rosal, too, who announced that Mabilangan had been sentenced to death by a CPP people's court and that his command carried out the execution. "I will not be threatened by people who want to play god and who have no respect for due process," Reyes said. He said nothing could distract him from working for the renewal of the rift-laden leftist movement. Reyes is now identified with Siglo ng Paglaya [Century of Independence] (Siglaya), said to be a breakaway group from the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan [New Nationalist Alliance] (Bayan) and described in some quarters as part of the "third bloc" in the leftist movement. Reyes, Kintanar, Tabara, and Lagman have become critics of CPP founder Jose Ma. Sison, now on self-exile in the Netherlands. Sison, in turn, has called them "renegades," "counterrevolutionaries," and "agents of the government." Lagman and Tabara have openly declared "autonomy" from the pro-Sison faction last year. Tabara was captured on Negros Island in January. Blamed by the military for a series of kidnappings in Tiaong, Quezon, he is now detained in Fort Bonifacio. Kintanar has kept a discreet silence since regaining freedom in 1992. Reyes said there had never been a "people's court" but only a party-appointed one. "Their kangaroo court has no rules of evidence to go by," he said, adding that he and the three others would likely be tried in absentio without benefit of counsel. The judges in the "court," he said, would likely include Benito Tiamzon, allegedly the CPP vice chair; his wife Wilma Austria- Tiamzon; and, Leo Velasco and Armano Teng, believed to be top party leaders. The four, Reyes pointed out, were the same people who had long indicted him, Tabara, Kintanar, and Lagman as counterrevolutionaries and agents of the government. "We have this spectacle of the same people acting as accusers, prosecutors, fiscals, and judges rolled into one," he said. Reyes said Rosal and his comrades must have forgotten one very important revolutionary dictum: "They can kill people but not ideas." Rosal himself, along with several members of his command, was charged by the police last Friday with double murder and multiple frustrated in connection with the killing of Mabilangan and his aide, Alberto Remo, also known as Roberto Kumawan. [sentence as published] A policeman, SP0 [expansion unknown] 2 Jaime Rivera, and two civilians were wounded in the attack. On Negros Island, a CPP breakaway faction announced a plan to set up a new party and revolutionary organization to distinguish itself from the "Stalinist leadership of Sison." Juanito Montano, commander of the Negros Island Regional Operational Command-Autonomous, said in a statement last Friday that the consolidation of revolutionary forces under the CPP-NPA "autonomous region" in Negros was going on "in preparation for putting up a new party, its own revolutionary army and alliances."
