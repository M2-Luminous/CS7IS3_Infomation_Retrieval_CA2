Customs suggests that the state appropriate 60 million markkas in this year's budget. The X-ray equipment would be used starting in 1998. [passage omitted] The Bureau noted that Finnish Customs is prepared to implement the changes required by EU [European Union] membership. The geographical location of Finland is such that customs inspections must be maintained at most international airports and in most ports, even when Finland joins the EU. "Guarding the eastern border becomes even more important than it previously was," noted Customs Director Juha Niskanen. This year, Customs has not found any radioactive or other dangerous substances. In spite of that fact, the Customs Service is convinced that dangerous substances have been smuggled across the border from Russia and the Baltic states.
