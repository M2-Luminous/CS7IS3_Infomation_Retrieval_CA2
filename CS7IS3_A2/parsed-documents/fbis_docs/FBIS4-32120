Some of the attacks that have appeared on the public political scene have accused the Interior Ministry of infiltrating and breaking up various parties with the intention of dispatching them from the political scene. This is a known methodology used by a number of political parties in the past for plotting, and it is usually studied as part of the lesson on promoting global revolution. The general characteristic of revolutionary parties is the syndrome of conspiring and searching for conspirators engaged in breaking up a group and creating a new one. Frckovski emphasized that no police force has ever managed to break up a political movement or political party. It is neat when party problems can be covered up by such external factors because then we have a victim and an excuse for personal political defeats. However, we must be concerned with the low level on which the political struggle is being waged, making political pornography [as published] the main topic of political discussions. Playing around with confidential documents, trying to create party policies without having accusations investigated through a parliamentary or court procedure, or both, represent political manipulation, because they make serious hearings and serious democratic procedures impossible. There is no way to incorporate all of these into a procedure or to establish who is responsible. The aim is to satanize the authorities and to score cheap political points, Frckovski underlined. We can do nothing other than to offer to open our files and check the results, but that cannot be done in the media. However, I fear that the whole affair will remain within the sphere of political gossip. It causes great trouble when somebody's personal failure is associated with the political interest of a party. There were such manipulations when the Interior Ministry was accused of mass murder, with claims that it organized a traffic accident with five casualties in order to cover up the activities of one of its employees against some politicians. Such manipulations indicate not only mentally and morally disintegrated personalities, but also a situation in which there are no bounds in the political struggle. This is very dangerous for the political climate. The State Security Service and the Interior Ministry cannot be blamed for a meeting, which might even have been accidental, between a certain lady, an ordinary secretary of the VMRO-SMD [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Union of Macedonian Organizations, a Bulgarian-based party], and some politicians of a certain political party on 26 and 27 March of this year, who were then given 50,000 German marks in financial assistance. The Interior Ministry cannot be blamed for the meeting in the Rila Hotel [in Sofia] when some well-known politicians of this country met a group from the VMRO-SMD, and were also joined by the Sofia district attorney and chief of the city's Interior Ministry. On that occasion they agreed on a plan for the election campaign, including the placement of a radio station on a historically famous mountain close to our border, all designed to help the party in the elections. Three groups were formed: one for ideological preparations and publishing activities, another for distributing publicity material, and a third for military preparations. The Interior Ministry can present evidence on these matters, but nobody can be blamed for the failure of the party except its own political program. The claims that there was organized crime made us bring a number of criminal charges that we would not normally have done, in order to vindicate some statements made by former Interior Ministry officials, but that again is their personal problem. [sentence as published] The claim that we were allegedly not bringing charges so as to protect someone was an evident mistake made by the Interior Ministry to cover up political statements by operational work. [sentence as published] The legal case is closed that dealt with former minister Antoni Pesev, who issued a permit for the construction of a gas station without the permission of the Interior Ministry. I do not wish to make a personal inquiry into this mistake, but there was actually such a permit from the Interior Ministry. After that, the government made a decision, which simply made things ridiculous. The mistake was used politically to cover up the amateurish public statements of that time. There still remains the possibility of slander charges but I do not know what my reactions would be then. What we in the ministry owe is at least an apology for having been used, at least a number of us, to cover up political statements made by some senior officials. Concerning the events on the Macedonia-Serbian border Frckovski said it was in the domain of the Defense Ministry because it was about the border itself, not a border crossing or zone. He listed the incidents: One illegal crossing of 17 soldiers and two officers occurred on 24 May 150 meters inside our territory, threatening a UNPROFOR unit; the airspace was violated by a Yugoslav warplane on 27 May; two soldiers penetrated 200 meters into Macedonian territory on 30 May; two soldiers went 200 meters inside our territory on 1 June; on 8 June they set up a tent on our territory; they have dug trenches mostly on their own territory, except possibly for one. The situation is similar today. We have our forces positioned a close distance from there, but all of this is "frozen" until a settlement.
