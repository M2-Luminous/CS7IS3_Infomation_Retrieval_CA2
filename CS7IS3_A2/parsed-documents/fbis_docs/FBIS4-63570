The communists managed to get two of their representatives elected at the recent elections to the oblast soviet--both winning in Berdsk. Viktor Kuznetsov, secretary of the oblast committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, answers our questions today. [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] Viktor Yegorovich, how many communists are there in Novosibirsk? [Kuznetsov] The Communist Party of the Russian Federation has approximately 4,500 members. An oblast committee of the party and rayon committees operate. [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] What, in each rayon? [Kuznetsov] In all but three rural districts, although there are communists there, of course. [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] We all remember full well what the former CPSU oblast committee was. Is the oblast committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation similar? [Kuznetsov] No, it is not at all the same thing. Our oblast committee is made up of people elected from the rayons: 56 persons working on an unpaid basis. We hold plenums bimonthly. There is, naturally, no administrative system such as there was, just as there are not the opportunities for influence that the CPSU oblast committee had. [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] Does the Communist Party of the Russian Federation consider itself the successor of the CPSU? I do not mean only in the ideological sense.... [Kuznetsov] In a property respect we undoubtedly consider ourselves the successor of the CPSU. Although this is a question around which there are a great many difficulties. But this is not the most important issue, the main thing for us is restoration of the organization. The people who have today gathered together in the party ranks have done so not because they will be given some position for this and not because they can shout at demonstrations. Yes, there are people who express themselves this way, but normal people who adhere to a balanced position have come together in the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. At this time, for example, we are discussing the party program, and I can say that such documents were never discussed so thoroughly before. [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] The CPSU had immense experience in the most diverse matters. Why do you reject it? [Kuznetsov] This is a very complex issue. We are reaching the general conclusion that we cannot yet make full evaluations as to why and in connection with what everything happened. What was good and what was bad. It is still too early to speak of all this with confidence. Work on comprehension of the processes is under way, of course, research centers and scholars are at work. But, I repeat, it is still too early to draw the final conclusions. [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] Who is in the ranks of the Communist Party today? [Kuznetsov] Older people are preponderant, undoubtedly. There are few young people as yet, but there are young men in the university, for example, who are joining us. More than 30,000 young people joined the Communist Party of the Russian Federation nationwide in the period from last October through this April. What is happening in the country is forcing people to think, comprehend the situation, and make a choice. [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] You are united, most likely, by a rejection of Gorbachev and his policy? [Kuznetsov] Well, Gorbachev is Gorbachev.... Rejection, of course. There were big mistakes and much of what is now seen as treachery. We have to evaluate why it happened this way. What enabled events to develop this way, not otherwise. There were, after all, the rules.... But the nomenklatura was victorious. When the primary party organizations attempted to depose the general secretary, so to speak, he held on to his position with the aid of the bureaucratic machinery and the entire nomenklatura system. [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] What, then, there are no people from the former nomenklatura in the Novosibirsk organization of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation? [Kuznetsov] Why not? There are! And why not, for example, lend an ear to Aleksandr Pavlovich Filatov, former secretary of the oblast party committee, who left all communists thinking good thoughts about his work in this office. He has now been restored to membership of our party. And Vladimir Aleksandrovich Mindolin also is a member of the Novosibirsk organization of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] Do you intend to form your faction in the oblast soviet? [Kuznetsov] The times now, it seems to me, are not such that it is necessary to strictly distinguish a party faction. Reality compels a search for a broader base. The questions that confront us are very complex, and we need to do more than just go about carrying a flag.... After all, if we say that it is only we who know "what's right," and no one else, it is simply time to leave the political arena. Society is today oriented toward many goals, which frequently differ considerably among themselves, and for this reason a pragmatic approach is greatly needed. [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] There are, as we all know, several communist parties here. What are their relations like? [Kuznetsov] There will be no automatic combination--you may be sure of this. Yes, we are for a union of communist parties, but the decision we adopted was this: Each party with its own rules and its own program may join the union and work in it as if on a confederative basis. But there is no common roof nor will there be.... As far as Novosibirsk is concerned, there are just two serious organizations here: the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and the Russian Communist Workers Party. The Russian Communist Workers Party has its own image, distinct from ours, but this does not prevent us mounting many actions together. As far as the other parties are concerned, we jokingly call them "two-bus parties".... You do not need to be told why, I believe.... [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] Your aim is to come to power? [Kuznetsov] This is the aim of every party. For us it is a strategic prospect. We realize that no one party has a chance of coming to power in today's Russia. And the goal is to create a normal pragmatic opposition which assumes responsibility for the search for the country's escape from the crisis. What is this political accord about which so much is being said today?! It is just another political show, beneath the clamor of which the strict antipopular policy continues. And a change of course could occur only at the demand of a broad coalition of political forces, but not of one party. [VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK] The final question. Does Gennadiy Zyuganov want to become president? [Kuznetsov] It is hard to say whether he does or not. But responding to such a question at a recent party forum, Zyuganov said that all our misfortunes are happening because a presidential version of administration of the state has been imposed on Russia. We have already surpassed the world in terms of the number of presidents. We have no need of a presidential federation of republics--it is time to switch to a normal system.
