"In connection with the fact that the world around us is not nonnuclear, we are against signing an agreement between Clinton, Kravchuk, and Yeltsin." Mr. Ratushnyy noted that the Ukraine Republican Party considers the signing of an agreement on depriving Ukraine of its nuclear arsenal to be a betrayal of Ukrainian interests. "We do not believe American promises. America looks after its own interests first and foremost, and the Ukrainian Government should look after its Ukrainian interests, which it does not do."
