[Stolpe] Good evening, Mr. Wickert. [Wickert] Mr. Stolpe, the coalition among the Social Democratic Party [SPD], the Free Democratic Party [FDP], and the Alliance 90 has collapsed. You are now heading a minority government. Is it possible for you to continue governing? [Stolpe] Well, the most important news of the day for us in Potsdam is that the government is able to function, that the cabinet is complete, and that we can continue to fulfill the numerous tasks without delay. This is certain for the time being. Whether we will be able to achieve majorities on certain issues will simply depend on whether the solutions that we prepare are convincing -- solutions that were supported by many others during the preparatory phase, for example. Let me repeat this once more: The government will continue to function. [Wickert] You have adopted an uncompromising attitude. You demanded that Mr. Nooke from the Alliance 90 should withdraw his statement that you lied about your past to the investigation committee, that there is no other way. Why did you adopt this tough position? [Stolpe] Mr. Wickert, this was not toughness. I was simply interested in clarifying the matter. All my friends and I had the impression that the fact that I was condemned in advance was no longer a basis for cooperation. In addition, we had the feeling that one of our -- former -- partners was interested in exacerbating the situation and in ensuring that additional questions were raised and more documents were provided. Cooperation was simply no longer possible. I had no high expectations. I only asked for a withdrawal of the advance condemnation and suggested waiting until the investigation committee presents its results. I also asked for a certain reliable cooperation in the interest of the tasks that have to be fulfilled. My wishes were ignored, and thus we are no longer three partners but only two -- the Social Democrats and the Liberals. [Wickert] Well, you will have to continue governing. There have been contradictory statements by officials from the Christian Democratic Union. On the one hand, new elections are demanded, but on the other, it has been assumed that new elections will not take place because the Landtag members are not yet eligible for a pension. [Stolpe] This is certainly not the only reason. You must also take into consideration that elections are scheduled for 11 September anyway. In fact, I am interested in completing important tasks in a sensible way. The citizens of Brandenburg are simply entitled to good results of our work. Early elections would only be the last resort if we were no longer able to function. However, since this is not the case, I believe we will be able to conclude our work successfully. [Wickert] You are saying that this is not the case. Yet since you are now heading a minority government, you must be tolerated. Will you also accept toleration by the Party of Democratic Socialism? [Stolpe] Mr. Wickert, in the Brandenburg Landtag -- as in other landtags -- the results are important. There is always the possibility of coming to an agreement in the committees. Even when the coalition among the three parties still existed and we held clear majorities in the committees, we also took into consideration the views of the opposition. We purposefully sought agreement on certain issues. I suppose that this will pay off in the next few months. The issues that we still have to settle have largely been supported by all members of the Landtag. [Wickert] Mr. Stolpe, this was the first coalition between the SPD, FDP, and Alliance 90 in Germany at the provincial level. Can you imagine that such a coalition might also work at the federal level, or was yours an individual case? [Stolpe] Mr. Wickert, we have never claimed to be a model. We have always been aware that we have a special situation here east of the Elbe or in eastern Germany. Three years ago when we assumed office people predicted that the coalition would not even last 100 days. We have managed to survive over three years. We struggled to reach joint positions and have done a good job. I would say that this was useful for Brandenburg. However, we do not claim that it should serve a model for other governments. [Wickert] Thank you very much, Mr. Stolpe. [Stolpe] Good evening.
