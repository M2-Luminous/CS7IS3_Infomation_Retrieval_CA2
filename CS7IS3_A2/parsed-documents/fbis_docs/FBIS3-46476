I would like all of you to know that I think about and love you very much. I do hope that on the occasion of our traditional New Year in April, I will be able to come back to be with you as before and to work together in order to build and defend the country in an atmosphere of mutual love, mutual trust, and mutual care as brothers in our great Cambodian family. I was very happy to receive the delegation, with Samdech Chea Sim as its chairman and His Excellency [H.E.] Heng Samrin as its deputy chairman, which just visited me (?on behalf of) the nation and people. I and the queen miss our motherland and all our children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren very much. I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that the great Chinese friends have given me the best help. They have given our Cambodia, me and my family, and our people great friendship and genuine fraternity since time immemorial, now, and in the future. Moreover, this cancer treatment has been successful thanks to their efforts in scientific, technical, material, and all other fields. They have worked very meticulously and flawlessly, giving me good care (?so that) I will live longer to serve our Cambodian motherland. [Words indistinct] they said it would be completed (?this month). The reaction was good, there has been no difficulty. Many patients who are much younger than I am have suffered a bad effect after the third and fourth stages of the treatment because the medicine for curing cancer is very strong. This strong medicine causes the patient to lose strength, experience nausea, and have a headache or other bad effects. The great Chinese friends, however, have sought special Chinese traditional medicine for me. These doctors have tried to find medicine for dealing with this disease according to each step of its condition. Moreover, they have bought modern medicine from abroad, such as the newly developed American drugs, to cure me as soon as possible so that I can return to our motherland. It is expected that I will be able to return home in April, the month that we mark our traditional new year. Only two more phases of treatment are needed, that is, the fifth and sixth phases. After the sixth phase, there will be a recess of nearly a month in order to check results. After that, it seems that I will be allowed to leave. (?In conclusion), I would like to tell you that I am quite concerned about some problems facing you, brothers, children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. I have read our national newspapers, which my son-in-law, (Keo Put-reaksmei), sends me every week. Therefore, I have learned about all the big, medium, and small problems facing you. I would like to share all the woes you are facing. I always share your weal and woe and as our saying goes: Always share weal and woe together. My heart and soul always stay close to Cambodia, to all children and grandchildren, and to all venerables. Samdech Chea Sim, our National Assembly chairman who is the acting head of state when I am not in the Kingdom of Cambodia, and H.E. Heng Samrin have made reports to me [words indistinct]. I would like to commend all patriotic children and grandchildren for always having good intentions toward our motherland, for bravely and patiently enduring all the shortcomings, and for working hard with all your strength and wisdom to serve the motherland and the livelihood of your families. This makes all of you worthy of being citizens of our independent and sovereign kingdom. I would like to tell you that I am satisfied with your decision to serve the rights and freedoms of our children and grandchildren in line with our Constitution; that is, our people's rights as the masters of our land, water [words indistinct]. Children and grandchildren (?have the) rights and freedoms [words indistinct] use policy of nonviolence. This means that there should be no quarrels, arguments, nor danger to the nation. The only question of violence is that with the Khmer Rouge, who have not yet understood that nonviolent policy. Except for the Khmer Rouge, our entire nation understands the need to use nonviolent methods -- that is, peaceful means -- in all circumstances. Therefore, I (?hope that) all children will be able to avoid serious disaster by using peaceful means and they will follow the appeal I made in various messages. [Words indistinct] with our National Assembly, government, various ministries and departments, and our soldiers. This is because they belong to all children and grandchildren, to all Cambodian people. Whether they are called the royal government or whatever, they are your government, the Cambodian people's government. The government is called the royal government because our country is a kingdom. So, the word royal is added to everything just as in some countries like England. This does not mean that the government serves only the king. It primarily serves the people. This is because the people own the vote and the power. Therefore, all children and grandchildren [words indistinct] peaceful means. I support you so long as it is a peaceful one. Demonstrations are a normal happening. It is [words indistinct]. In a liberal democratic system, demonstrations are regarded as ordinary happenings. Therefore, I support all of you in this undertaking so long as there is no (?violence), no bloodshed, no injury. All of this is no good. But your voicing opinions and asking for this and that are just ordinary things. They are good undertakings to arouse our government, our National Assembly, and our administration -- both civilian and military -- to always pay attention to you and your problems. Concerning National Assembly members, [words indistinct] salaries, there will be problems. I know that there will be such problems. I told [words indistinct]. Now what I said was true [laughter]. Problems have taken place. Therefore, in my opinion, this matter must be resolved according to the majority of National Assembly members as well as the majority of citizens -- what do they want it to be; how do they want it to be? Do listen to them. As with the doctors who are giving me the treatment [words indistinct]. Therefore, I dare not say how much, to what extent should their salaries, their earnings, be. All I want to tell you is that you should listen to (?the majority). [Words indistinct] teachers, nurses, medics, professors, and (?youths) also have similar problem. Therefore, a cordial discussion, cordial contacts between our people and our National Assembly, our government, and the various ministries is a good thing. I would like all children and grandchildren to continue such contacts. That is all the information I have for you. I pray to the Lord Buddha's Triple Gems to please protect the Supreme Patriarchs, patriarchs, venerable monks, brothers, children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. May all of you always be blessed with longevity, social prestige, happiness, strength, and enlightenment. Thank you. (?This is my message) to the compatriots through Samdech Chea Sim, H.E. Heng Samrin, and all excellencies in the delegation.
