Akira Yamagishi, president of the eight million-strong Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), voiced the desire in a meeting with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. ''It is extremely difficult for the current administration, a weak, minority government, to push for political, administrative and economic reforms,'' Yamagishi told reporters following the meeting. It was the first meeting between leaders of Rengo and the government since Hata took office in April. The labor leader also urged Hata to take the lead in persuading the second largest opposition SDP, a former coalition party, to return to the fold and in strengthening the power base of his government, Yamagishi added. Rengo, founded in November 1989, supports the SDP and the Democratic Socialist Party, a middle-of-the-road party in the Hata administration. Hata, who heads Japan's first minority government since 1955, was quoted as replying he also longs for the SDP's early return to power. The prime minister reportedly agreed on Yamagishi's proposal for holding a summit between Hata and SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama to discuss the SDP's possible re-entry to the coalition government. Yamagishi also offered Hata a set of recommendations on major policy issues, including economic management, tax system reform and pension system reform. Hata and Yamagishi agreed on the need to hold a meeting between the government and Rengo to build consensus on key policy issues.
