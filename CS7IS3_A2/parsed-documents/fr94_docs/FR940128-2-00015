FR940128-2-00015 FR940128-2-00005 KT disagrees, claiming that the cost verification report clearly indicates that KT accurately reported all direct labor and factory overhead expenses incurred during the POI. Thus, KT contends that petitioners' claim that the Department was unable to verify KT's fabrication costs should be dismissed out of hand. KT states that it allocated fabrication costs between industrial and ornamental pipe production based on the actual staffing for factory laborers, the actual usage of production equipment, the company's actual production experience and, for variable overhead expenses, budgeted usage rates. According to KT, the difference between fabrication expenses per kilogram for industrial and ornamental pipe reflects the fact that KT produces more industrial pipe than ornamental pipe. Additionally, KT claims that the Department should accept its submission methodology of allocating fabrication costs on the basis of weight for three reasons. First, the methodology conforms with the way in which KT calculates the cost of goods sold in the normal course of business, and there is no evidence on the record that allocating fabrication expenses on the basis of weight is in fact distortive. Second, during the POI, KT did not track the information needed to allocate fabrication costs on the basis of machine time. Third, the Department has accepted weight-based allocations of these costs in past cases involving stainless steel pipe. Accordingly, KT argues that the Department should accept its allocation of fabrication expenses for purposes of the final determination. DOC Position: At verification, we determined that KT accurately reported its aggregate fabrication costs during the POI. Therefore, we disagree with petitioners that KT's fabrication costs should be dismissed for purposes of the final determination. In cases where machinery or processes were dedicated to the production of specific product types ( e.g., WSSP), KT assigned costs directly to these products without allocation. For example, KT assigned depreciation expenses on machinery dedicated to the production of WSSP directly to WSSP. Only in cases where KT incurred fabrication costs common to the production of both subject and non-subject merchandise did KT allocate these costs. We recognize that KT's basis for the allocation of these costs to the subject merchandise used budgeted estimates which KT was unable to reconcile to its actual production experience during the POI. However, we found at verification that KT did not maintain the level of detailed records in its normal accounting system that permitted such a reconciliation. Moreover, the Department determined that these estimates are reasonable based on visual inspection of the production process and analysis of KT's documentation. Contrary to petitioners' assertions, during the POI KT did not maintain its records at a sufficient level of detail to perform a more product-specific allocation (e.g., records of machine time, etc.). Accordingly, we find that KT's allocation methodology is reasonable, in light of the specific circumstances of this case. Thus, we have accepted the use of KT's methodology in this case for purposes of the final determination. Comment 4: Petitioners argue that KT calculated its production costs on the basis of theoretical production weights that overstate the weight of finished production, thus artificially lowering its submitted per unit production costs. Therefore, petitioners contend that the cost data in KT's September 13, 1993, submission is unusable and should be rejected by the Department. KT contends that the use of theoretical weights does not affect the accuracy of its submitted production costs. According to KT, since KT used the same conversion factor for its calculation to convert (1) pipe production stated in feet to production stated in kilograms, and (2) production cost per kilogram to a production cost per foot, the conversion factors are uniformly over- or under-stated by the same amount. DOC Position: We agree with KT. KT's calculation of theoretical production weights overstates the actual weight of production during the POI. However, as information on the record indicates, this same theoretical production weight was used to convert the production costs from a per kilogram cost to a per foot cost. Thus, the effect of overstating the weight of production is offset by the use of the same formula in converting the per kilogram cost back to a per foot cost. Accordingly, no adjustment is deemed necessary. Comment 5: KT contends that it properly reported all expenses associated with management and financial services provided to KT by its parent as part of its submitted G&A. KT states that fees for these services are charged directly to KT and are reflected in the management fee amount KT's parent company received from its subsidiaries in FY 1993. According to KT, because all management fees that are properly allocable to KT are already charged directly to the company, there is no basis for charging any additional amount to KT. Petitioners contend that KT understated its submitted G&A by not including a portion of its parent company's expenses incurred during 1992. Petitioners argue that, since KT's parent is principally an investment holding company, all G&A incurred by the parent directly relate to its investment holdings. Petitioners maintain that KT's claim that all management fees and financial services provided by its parent company to KT are accounted for in its submission is unverified and unsupported. According to petitioners, the Department has no way of knowing if KT's management fees were correctly calculated and reported. Additionally, petitioners claim that the Department should increase KT's submitted G&A by the omitted amortization of pre-operating expenses as noted at verification.
