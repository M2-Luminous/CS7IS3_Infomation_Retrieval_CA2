Without Yugoslavia's stabilization there is no stabilization in the Balkans and beyond, he said. He resolutely denied any link between the Air Force of the Yugoslav Army and yesterday's incident in Bosnian skies. Here is a report by Slobodan Jankovic: [Begin recording] [Jankovic] Before about 100 foreign correspondents, President Lilic first presented a basic layout of the FRY policy regarding the crisis in the Balkans. Afterwards, he answered a dozen questions. Speaking about the most important pillars of our policy, Zoran Lilic said the following: [Lilic] The consistent policy of the FRY has, all the time, and is still based on two key aims. The first is a political aim and it consists of the maximum effort for the FRY to make its full contribution to establish peace. These are the activities that we have been carrying out continuously since the breakout of the crisis on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. The second aim is the economic one: Regardless of the drastic situation in the region, our country is going to stabilize its economy through (?real) deep structural changes in the monetary sphere, managing capital, mobilizing (?idle) capacities through the share-holding system, and, certainly, the functioning of the market of capital, and the reform of the taxation system. The economic program that began to be implemented on 24 January has as its aim realization of these very changes and it is evident that it has yielded good initial results. You know very well that inflation, or to put it better, hyperinflation was over 300 million percent, only to be reduced to about 1 percent during February and this is that right road that we are going to go along toward the (?stabilization) of our economy. Finally, it is logical to expect that everything that the FRY has done on the plane of stabilizing the situation in these regions, complying to everything that was demanded from it through the UN Security Council resolutions, as well as all the measures undertaken at the moment in the economic sphere, should now make the international community change its attitude toward us, whereby a recovery of the FRY and a peaceful future for the generations that have been unjustly put in the situation of living in isolation and under pressure would be made possible. I am convinced that only an economically recovered Yugoslavia can be of use to Europe and the world in general, because, without a stable Yugoslavia, I am deeply convinced there can be no stability in the Balkans or in the broader territories around us. [Jankovic] In reply to the question by a correspondent of the Chinese agency about yesterday's incident in the Bosnian skies, President Lilic said the following: [Lilic] I am convinced that you know of the announcement that was issued by the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army. I, as a supreme commander of the Yugoslav Army, can only confirm that, for a full two years, that is, since the constitution of the FRY, not a single aircraft has taken off from the territory of the FRY and flown to the region of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. What I would like to say is that I personally condemn any gesture that leads to an escalation of the conflict and any use of force by any side. This is only one more argument that negotiations need be accelerated and that we need peace and not war. It is obvious that there are people who want to provoke a continuation of war and new clashes on the territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. I can say with certainty that there have not been, and will not be, any such provocations. Our only task and aim is to continue the policy we have been leading. [Jankovic] Correspondents of foreign media in Belgrade have asked the FRY president about Belgrade's assessments of the war in Bosnia, unification with the Serbian Republic and the Republic of Serbian Krajina, as well as about relations with the former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM].
