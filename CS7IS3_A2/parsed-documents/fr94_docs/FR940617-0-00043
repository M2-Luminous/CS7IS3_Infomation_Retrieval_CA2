The Bidder represents that, to the extent required, it has complied with the requirements of Public Law 101&hyph;121, section 319, 103 Stat. 701, 750&hyph;765 (31 U.S.C. 1352), entitled ``Limitation on use of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracting and financial transactions,'' and any rules and regulations issued pursuant thereto. Article V Remedies Section 1. Completion on Bidder's Default. If default shall be made by the Bidder in the performance of any of the work hereunder, the Owner, without in any manner limiting its legal and equitable remedies in the circumstances, may serve upon the Bidder and the surety or sureties upon the Bidder's Bond or Bonds a written notice requiring the Bidder to cause such default to be corrected forthwith. Unless within thirty (30) days after the service of such notice upon the Bidder such default shall be corrected or arrangements for the correction thereof, satisfactory to both the Owner and the Administrator, shall have been made by the Bidder or its surety or sureties, the Owner may take over the performance of the Bidder's obligations hereunder and prosecute the same to completion by contract or otherwise for the account and at the expense of the Bidder, and the Bidder and its surety or sureties shall be liable to the Owner for any supportable cost or expense in excess of the bid price occasioned thereby. In such event, the Owner may take possession of and utilize, in completing the Project(s), any tools, supplies, equipment, appliances and plant belonging to the Bidder which may be situated at the site of the Project(s). The Owner, in such contingency, may exercise any rights, claims or demands which the Bidder may have against third persons in connection herewith and for such purpose the Bidder does hereby assign, transfer and set over unto the Owner all such rights, claims and demands. Section 2. Liquidated Damages. Should the Bidder fail to complete any Project as shown under Column 7, ``Completion of the Project,'' in Article I, Section 1, within the time herein agreed upon, after giving effect to extensions of time, if any, herein provided, then, in that event and in view of the difficulty of estimating with exactness damages caused by such delay, the Owner shall, so long as the subject Project shall not have been placed in service, have the right to deduct from and retain out of such moneys which may be then due, or which may become due and payable to the Bidder, the sum of: dollars ($ XXXXXX ) for (Project) for dollars ($ XXXXXX ) for (Project) dollars ($ XXXXXX for per day for each and every day that such completion is delayed beyond the scheduled time for Completion of the Project, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, up to the amount of the respective Base Bid plus accepted alternates for the affected Project: Provided , however, that the Owner shall promptly notify the Bidder in writing of the manner in which the amount claimed as liquidated damages was computed. The Bidder shall pay to the Owner the amount necessary to effect such payment in full. Such payment is not to be reduced by the value of any partial performance by the Bidder. At the technical sessions, each Bidder shall identify all features and capabilities that are not fully developed or do not have a verifiable satisfactory field performance record. If the Owner allows these features to be bid as separate Projects, then they are to be individually listed under Columns 1 through 10, in Article I, section 1. These unproven features and capabilities are to be individually listed in this section 2 also, with liquidated damages amounts determined by the Owner and stated for each. If a Bidder neglects to identify any such feature at the technical session, delay in providing the feature is considered a delay in completing the associated Project and the Owner may assess liquidated damages listed for that Project regardless of whether the Project is placed in service. Section 3. Consequential Damages. In no event shall the Bidder's liability for incidental or consequential loss or damage, except for personal injury or tangible property damage, exceed the amount of ten times the total contract price, as amended. Section 4. Enforcement of Remedies by Administrator. The Administrator may on behalf of the Owner exercise any right or enforce any remedy which the Owner may exercise or enforce hereunder. Section 5. Cumulative Remedies. Every right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Owner or the Administrator shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every right and remedy now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute and the pursuit of any right or remedy shall not be construed as an election. Provided, however, that the provisions of section 2 of this Article V shall be the exclusive measure of damages for failure by the Bidder to have effected the Completion of Project within the time herein agreed upon.
