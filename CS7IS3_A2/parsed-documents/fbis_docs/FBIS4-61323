I heard this loose interpretation of the saying "Tell me, who is your friend..." recently at the "Vulkan" factory in Kiev. Before my departure to Kharkov for a meeting with managing directors of CIS and Ukrainian industrial enterprises, I learned that the "Vulkan" working collective was the first Kiev enterprise to nominate Volodymyr Lanovyy for head of state. Now I understand what their words meant. Old disputes over who is currently more important for Ukraine -- a flexible politician, competent lawyer, or pragmatic economist -- have most likely brought us to a conciliatory conclusion: Ukraine requires all three of them. However, the third one is more important. The realization of difficulties of our economic reality will most likely not play the final part in choosing the future president. The invitation of V.T. Lanovyy, 42-year-old doctor of economic sciences and former prime minister, to meet with managing directors of more than 150 enterprises in Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Latvia, and Moldova shows, of course, that he is recognized as an authoritative economist and practical manager. [passage omitted] When drafting a state budget, it is necessary to change the tax structure: To issue payments to local budgets and drop tax payments to the central Republican organs (except the most essential ones), Volodymyr Lanovyy says. These payments should not be redistributed and regions should have a free hand in dealing with their budgets. The president of the Center for Market Reforms cited these figures: In 1993, the budget received only 40 percent of expected tax payments while during last January-February -- only 25 percent of planned payments. As for the insolvency of Ukraine, the presidential candidate: "Ukraine is solvent. It has a large currency potential, but the funds are not kept in the state. It is not profitable to bring currency into the state. I categorically oppose the practice of enterprises having to sell their earned currency to the state. This money should be deposited in Ukrainian banks. If this is not done, exporters will continue holding their money abroad. Excessive customs duties and export restrictions should be removed. Different currency rates and licensing have lead to under-the-counter deals: The one who buys currency at a lower rate, is always tempted to sell it at a higher rate. Volodymyr Lanovyy concludes that we have a unique situation. Due to the restrictive policy and the system of currency regulation, we export capital at a time when we most need it." [quotation marks as published] Answering a question as to whether the system of tax breaks is justified, Volodymyr Lanovyy remarked: "A system of tax breaks is permissible if payments for some percent of the credit are made with funds from the state budget. Such credits are necessary to achieve structural changes and encourage unprofitable sectors. In Ukraine, the issuing of loans is always unplanned and is carried out through currency emissions and the lowering of interest rates. In 1993, the average interest rate was twice as low as the minimum interest rate offered by the National Bank. Thereby, tax breaks are mandatory elements of the government's structural policy and should be economically grounded, based on the technological reorganization of an enterprise, its profitability, conditions for providing new jobs, etc." Estimating the current economic situation, Volodymyr Lanovyy stated: "Currently, economic policy is being shaped without considering its final results. The blind are leading the people." The corps of managing directors did not object to this. Academician A. G. Aganbegyan, president of the All-Union Club of Directors and a well-known economist, summarized, in my opinion, the viewpoint of the majority: "The sooner Lanovyy and his followers are able to implement reforms, the quicker the revival of the Ukrainian economy will begin." I heard more or less the same opinions at factories in Kharkov -- which were visited by the presidential candidate -- and at the House of Architects, where he organized a news conference with journalists. There is one curious detail: There are a considerable number of people, both among journalists and industrialists, who are ready to support Lanovyy during the presidential campaign.
