Yesterday, chiefs of enterprises, unions, and associations of entrepreneurs who assembled at the CCI congress center had a chance to learn the government's view on this burning question. Even earlier, the CCI information-analytical service conducted a poll among its 4,000 members on whether the government's taxation policy helps to boost production. A total of 96 percent of those polled said "No." Bending to the sentiments of the Chamber's members, CCI specialists have drawn up draft amendments to the current taxation system. Describing the current taxation system as unwieldy and inefficient because it gives rise to unbearable tax pressure, the specialists have suggested that taxation be adjusted so as to bring it in line with world prices -- the number of taxes, duties, and payments should be cut by merging them, and upper limits for profit tax rates should be established at 30-35 percent and 15-20 percent for small businesses. Meanwhile, Aleksandr Ivaneyev, chief of the Finance Ministry taxation reform department, who also spoke at the meeting, said that the Finance Ministry categorically opposes any revision of the taxation system. "Until the state cuts budget expenditures, any reduction in the tax burden is out of the question," the Finance Ministry's representative explained to interested businessmen. According to Mr. Ivaneyev, the current tax legislation is in perfect conformity with the country's economic situation. Mr. Ivaneyev conceded that taxes do not play as important a role in economic regulation as they do in developed countries, and a reduction, say, in value-added tax will not spark production growth. The main regulator is still the tax of inflation. "The state's grabbing reflex has not weakened yet," was how Ivan Kivelidi, chairman of the Russian Federation Government's Council on Entrepreneurship, summed up the Finance Ministry's stance. In Kivelidi's view, fiscal policy will prompt the conversion of money into cash and the across-the-board criminalization of entrepreneurial activity.
