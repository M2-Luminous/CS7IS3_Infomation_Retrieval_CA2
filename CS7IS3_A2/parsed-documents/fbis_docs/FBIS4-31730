What is your opinion about these discussions and your impression of Mr. Nemitz's discussions in Athens? [Crvenkovski] We had very useful meetings and very extensive discussions for two days, encompassing the general picture of the situation in the whole region, and not only relations between Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Greece, which is Mr. Nemitz's mandate. We had expanded discussions because these relations are affected by the situation in the whole region. I have not been informed about the course of his discussions in Athens. I think that Mr. Nemitz's stay here will be of great importance for the meetings scheduled for New York next week. It is also very important that during his stay in Ohrid Mr. Nemitz had the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the culture and traditions of the Macedonian nation, which will help him obtain a fuller picture of the Republic of Macedonia. [Karanfilovska] Was that the reason why you invited Mr. Nemitz to Ohrid? There has been some speculation about this in the media. [Crvenkovski] I think that it was useful to hold the discussions in a more relaxed atmosphere, as well as to take the opportunity of introducing him to the historical values of Ohrid and Macedonia. [Karanfilovska] Mr. Nemitz stated that both sides had agreed not to reveal the course and the results of the discussions. Therefore, we shall refrain from asking such a question.... [Crvenkovski] Nevertheless, I shall avail myself of this opportunity to remind you that I have been continually repeating this during these months of discussions, for which I was exposed to a series of attacks by journalists. Mr. Nemitz's statement at least helped me to explain my conduct in public. [Karanfilovska] A number of these attacks appeared in our weekly, too, which also mentioned on several occasions the "Irish formula" as a possible solution for the dispute. We are not asking you whether there are negotiations about that, but what is your opinion, and do you find it acceptable? [Crvenkovski] The reason why I cannot comment on any formula is because our stance is that there can be no separate solutions for any of the disputed questions, and that is something that we have explicitly advocated since the beginning. What we are prepared to discuss are the entire relations with Greece. If we reach a solution, it should be regulated in a satisfactory way, be acceptable for Europe, and encompass all aspects of mutual relations. In that context we can discuss separate solutions. It is not our goal to solve some transient problems in communications between the two countries, but to find lasting solutions for long-lasting relations. [Karanfilovska] Now that you have announced a new meeting in New York, probably at the ministerial level, does it mean that such a stance for discussions in a package is acceptable for the other side? [Crvenkovski] From the statements made by the other side during the past few weeks you could see that such a position has been accepted. Even I know that from their public statements, since we have not had any direct contacts. I think that this is a position that is more broadly accepted by the international community. That is a point that we have persistently insisted upon since the beginning of the dispute and I think that our positions are beginning to converge. [Karanfilovska] Is Greece a priority in your work? [Crvenkovski] Basically, what we are trying to do is to conduct a normal foreign policy, and we have been working on "driving that policy" on several tracks from the outset, in order to avoid the trap that Greece fell into when a single problem, regardless of its importance, dominated its entire foreign policy. This is not predominant in our work, neither in terms of the time that we are devoting to it, nor in its essence. It is a huge problem and we discuss it continually with all our partners, but we are also engaged in what a foreign policy should normally do -- not concentrate on one direction and one problem. [Karanfilovska] We are asking this because of the time that you yourself are spending on the negotiations! [Crvenkovski] It is true that I am spending a lot of time in New York, but that is principally out of respect for Mr. Cyrus Vance's invitations. They are sent to foreign ministers and I think that it would be impolite to respond at a lower level to invitations from a mediator whom we highly appreciate, and we think it is important to communicate with him properly. It is up to the other side to evaluate its own conduct. Second, the stay there, although linked with the discussions with Mr. Vance, provides a good opportunity for discussing other matters not connected with the dispute. There are a number of countries with which we still have not established contacts, or are having difficulties in establishing them, because we cannot find a suitable place to do this. On the other hand, the United Nations is an excellent place in which all countries have active missions. Therefore, a great deal of work on bilateral questions is carried out there, too. [Karanfilovska] You did not mention Washington, and you often have meetings with senior U.S. officials during your visits to the United States. You have met Secretary of State Christopher a couple of times. How prominent is the subject of Macedonia-Greece in these discussions, and how bilateral are these relations? [Crvenkovski] Concerning the level of our relations with the United States and the level of our cooperation, such meetings are normal during every stay there. The subject of Macedonia-Greece arises in all the bilateral meetings, and not only with U.S. officials, because everybody is interested in this. However, the discussions in Washington principally concentrate on bilateral questions and regional problems of interest to ourselves and to our partners, who want to hear our opinions and evaluations. [Karanfilovska] It looks as if the United States is choosing the more southern part of the Balkans for its presence, from where it will be able to achieve its interests. [Crvenkovski] I am not in favor of the idea that it has to do with some presence in the region, with some interests, at least not in the prevailing sense, as this is an idea that belongs to the first half of the 20th century and even before that, about spheres of interest and strategic positions in the classic sense. The interest is, first of all, in giving support to models of state development that promise longer stability. The strategic interest of the United States and the European Union in Macedonia is to see the success of the political model that we are applying, which can serve as an example for solving a whole complex of questions that generate severe crises in other places since they are not approached correctly. [Karanfilovska] Could that be the reason why after Washington was "meandering" from Greece, via Albania and Bulgaria, Macedonia was "selected" as a kind of a partner in the Balkans? [Crvenkovski] The ties with Macedonia have become closer simply because of the political model, and first of all the internal one, that we have chosen, and they consider that it is in their strategic interest to support it for the sake of stability in Europe, for open borders, with prospects for more intensive development. [Karanfilovska] Are the present relations in the Balkans, and principally the problems with Greece and the closure of the border, affecting the construction of a different policy toward the other neighbors, and would it have been different if relations with Greece had been different? [Crvenkovski] I think that the policy would have been the same, but the understanding and the support for that policy might have been different. What is crucial to Macedonia's position in the Balkans is to be open in all directions -- transportation and communications -- and to take the role that naturally belongs to it, that is to be the crossroads for all movement in the region. That is why it is of the utmost importance to establish normal relations and links with our neighbors. Therefore, the priority is to establish road, railroad, and communications links wherever they existed before. Thus, the east-west corridor was not imposed by the dispute with Greece or the Greek embargo. It was imposed by the natural role of the Republic of Macedonia that it is entitled to in the region. The fact that this corridor is now gaining importance and support from the international community is to a certain extent a result of Greece's conduct and the embargo, and in that context it has helped us. However, the bases of this policy of communications are independent of the dispute, and that should normally be the orientation, as should the development of the north-south route the moment the problems have been overcome. Macedonia cannot play any role, and principally economic, if it does not have both directions. The fact that it is a crossroads is a great advantage for Macedonia. It will lose it if it neglects either of the two directions. [Karanfilovska] It is paradoxical, but no matter how intractable the problem with Greece might look now, it is, in a way, smaller than the problems, first of all political, that Macedonia is having with the other neighboring countries, with which it still has political and economic cooperation. Why can this cooperation not be achieved with Greece? [Crvenkovski] We have offered this as a model with Greece from the outset and we have been insisting on it. Everywhere there are problems between neighboring countries. The question is what the attitude of those countries is toward such problems -- whether there is an open channel for dialogue, and whether there is good will for finding solutions. We are in favor of these kinds of relations, because they turned out to be successful in Europe. That is why the relations with Albania and Bulgaria, regardless of a number of questions that are burdening them, are normal relations between European countries. That is how we approach them, and to a great extent that is their conduct toward us, too. Therefore, Europe's relationship toward ourselves and these countries is different. [Karanfilovska] You said that after the situation is normalized, the Republic of Macedonia will go on developing the north-south route as a road to Europe. However, it looks as if Greece has been redirected on this road via Bulgaria and Romania. [Crvenkovski] I do not know how they can look for other directions knowing that they are creating problems on all sides and in all possible directions. I do not want to get into their motives for that. For our part, even in relations with Greece, the basis of our foreign policy is dominant, and that is the principle of equal distance with our neighbors. [Karanfilovska] Do you here also include the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia? [Crvenkovski] Absolutely, speaking in the long term, regardless of their situation now. [Karanfilovska] Nevertheless, at this moment there is no attempt for a dialogue with Belgrade, although this neighbor is still under the regime of the international community's sanctions? [Crvenkovski] There are no diplomatic contacts because the other side still refuses formally to recognize the Republic of Macedonia. At this moment the question of succession is an open problem. We think that it should be settled where it was agreed -- in the Contact Group in Geneva. [Karanfilovska] Your Yugoslav counterpart does not share this opinion. He thinks that Skopje-Belgrade relations will depend on Skopje-Athens relations. [Crvenkovski] That is their problem. However, a normal foreign policy should not limit itself to that. I would not accept a foreign policy that would be in one part dictated by someone else or be dependent on third countries. [Karanfilovska] The Yugoslav Government ordered its Foreign Ministry to start preparations for a dialogue with Albania. In your opinion, is it related to the latest events in the far south of the Balkans? [Crvenkovski] It certainly is an initiative that deserves congratulations, because it ultimately leads to the acceptance of our basic orientation -- that relations in the Balkans can only be solved through dialogue. The greater the number of countries that support it, and the greater the number of bilateral channels for dialogues among Balkan countries that are opened, the faster it will lead toward EU and U.S. strategic interest in supporting our model. [Karanfilovska] There are certain reservations among part of the opposition and among a number of self-proclaimed independent intellectuals in Macedonia, who have recently appeared in public, saying that the conduct of the Macedonian Government toward Bulgaria is not equal to other countries and that it still has some reservations inherited from the past. [Crvenkovski] The basic determination of our foreign policy is the principle of equal distance between our neighbors, because that is the only way in which the Republic of Macedonia can conduct a consistent policy even though at this moment it does not actually have a real dialogue with some of its neighbors. Relations with all our neighbors should be put on an equal footing and there can be no more or less privileged relations toward any of our neighbors. This naturally applies to the Republic of Bulgaria, too. Overall, we are trying to develop relations in a rapid and general way, by applying the principle of equal distance and by thoroughly insisting on equal relations in which it will be impossible to place or impose conditions burdened with the past. [Karanfilovska] Within the framework of stability in the Balkans there certainly stands security. Macedonia still has the open problem of its inclusion in the collective system of the CSCE, although Albania, in staying neutral, abstained, while Greece and Cyprus still oppose it. Another question connected to the security system is the "Partnership for Peace" project in which Macedonia has demonstrated a great interest, and it was even announced as one of the topics for the recent discussions with Mrs. Lin Davis [name as transliterated]. [Crvenkovski] As far as Albania's position on the CSCE is concerned, the meeting of President Gligorov and Mr. Berisha gives us the hope that there will not only be no problems from Albania, but that we can expect active support for the Republic of Macedonia, which indicates a very important step in relations. Concerning the "Partnership for Peace" project, we have shown our interest, as well as in cooperation with NATO. We have had several official contacts, which raised clearly defined interests in cooperation from both sides. We have had intensive discussions on all the possible forms of cooperation with the Western European Union. However, concerning the formal participation of Macedonia in the "Partnership for Peace," at this moment there is one obstacle -- membership of the CSCE. We discussed this with Mrs. Davis, and we shall continue the discussions, with the possibility of starting broader contacts before joining the project. [Karanfilovska] Are there any discussions with the United States about bilateral cooperation on a military plan? [Crvenkovski] At this stage we think our cooperation should be carried out within the framework of the multilateral organizations, first of all because they have already developed good channels of cooperation with the Republic of Macedonia. A process of adjustment is necessary in the sense of the military educational system, in order to achieve a cooperation on a compatible level. [Karanfilovska] Relations in the Balkans are also burdened by some far away partners; we have in mind principally Australia, not only relating to the decision to call the Macedonians Slav Macedonians, but even more because of the division of the Macedonian community in that country into those from Vardar Macedonia and the "others." Is there a danger that this may be accepted as a model for other countries where there are such large communities of Macedonians? [Crvenkovski] That action of the Australian Government caused a series of consequences that have deeply complicated relations inside Australia, where all the citizens, regardless of their origin, had equal treatment and made the country an example of a multiethnic community. This action, to which we immediately reacted very strongly, sets a precedent that can have consequences not only for the Macedonian community there, but also for others. We know of no country that has renamed its own citizens who have always had the right to declare their national affiliation. I hope that the Australian Government will soon reexamine this action. We were encouraged by the explicit reaction of the media and of some provincial governments. What came as a result of this in Australia is not division, but much stronger cohesion. In this extremely unpleasant situation there has been created greater cohesion and coordination among the Macedonians in Australia. I do not think that this will affect other countries in the sense of limiting the rights of their citizens. [Karanfilovska] When your name is publicly mentioned, it is usually linked with relations with the Republic of Greece. The journalists' "pursuit" of you usually takes place just at the time negotiations and discussions are carried out about this. There is little talk about the other aspects of your work. What does the minister do in his ministry? [Crvenkovski] Owing to the growing interest in relations with Greece, there are some very important events from the foreign policy area that remain unnoticed or uncovered. I shall point out the example of the visit to Holland. That was the first official visit to a European country after the establishment of diplomatic relations, to which the Dutch side devoted great importance -- a meeting was scheduled with the prime minister, there were separate discussions with five ministers, there was an address in parliament... it was an extremely important event for our foreign policy. As far as the work here is concerned, we were heavily engaged in organizing the ministry itself and its equipment, and in setting up embassies within a very short period of time. If we just have a look at this, together with the international meetings and conferences that we have attended and where we have achieved results, only then can we see the job that has been done here in the ministry. [Karanfilovska] The public often operates with wrong images. There prevails the opinion that you are a recluse, an uncommunicative minister, who rarely makes statements, who is often absent... however, on the other hand, people who have had official meetings with you have a different impression. We hear that you have established private contacts with them, that you often meet your partners, talk with them, and solve diplomatic problems in a different way, not only in your office.... [Crvenkovski] The impression that I rarely make statements, I would say, arises from the interest in the discussions with Greece. If you look at all my statements, I think that I may even appear too often. At one time I was even attacked by some opposition politicians for being too great a presence in public. As for the impression that people from the outside have, those who I have contacts with, it is true that it is much easier to establish official contacts with a state if you establish friendly links. That is normal in the work of every foreign minister if he wants to be successful. Private contacts are important first of all for the official part of the work, because they enable you to address a partner in the world at any time, asking for advice, an opinion, or support. [Karanfilovska] It is evident that, in spite of all your engagement, you will retain the image of "minister for Greece." Do you think that at the end of your mandate it will have a positive or negative connotation? [Minister] I cannot make evaluations about the final impression on my work. Nevertheless, it is true that what I am doing is far from being subordinated to relations with Greece.
