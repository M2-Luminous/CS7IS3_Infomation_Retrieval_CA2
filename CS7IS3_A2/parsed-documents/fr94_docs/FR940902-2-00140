FR940902-2-00140 FR940902-2-00058 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT Request for Reinstatement of an Expired Clearance for Form RI 38&hyph;31 AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (title 44, U.S.C., chapter 35), the notice announces a request for reinstatement of an expired clearance for an information collection. Form RI 38&hyph;31, We Need More Information About Your Missing Payment, is sent out by the Retirement and Insurance Group in response to a notification by an individual of the loss or non-receipt of a payment from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. The form requests information needed to enable OPM to trace and/or reissue payment. The information needed to replace a payment must be collected either verbally or in writing. This collection is still necessary in order for OPM to be able to obtain replacement payments as needed. This clearance was allowed to expire due to administrative error. Approximately 10,000 RI 38&hyph;31 forms are processed annually. Of these, approximately 9,800 are reports of missing checks. A response time for ten minutes per form reporting a missing check is estimated based on the amount of information required. The annual burden is 1,634 hours. The remainder, 200, are claims for missing electronic transfer payments. A response time of 30 minutes per form is estimated in these instances. The annual burden is 100 hours. The combined annual burden is 1,734 hours. For copies of this proposal, contact C. Ronald Trueworthy on (703) 908&hyph;8550. DATES: Comments on this proposal should be received on or before October 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send or deliver comments to_ Lorraine E.
