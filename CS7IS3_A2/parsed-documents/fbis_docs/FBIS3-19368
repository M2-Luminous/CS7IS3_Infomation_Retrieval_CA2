But Gligorov's government must first give specific practical proof. Venizelos made this statement when he was asked to comment on yesterday's remarks by Skopjean Assembly President Stojan Andov, who claimed that problems exist between Macedonia [as heard] and Greece but that he [Andov] does not think there are problems between the two peoples. Venizelos noted that Andov wanted to use the term FYROM [as heard] by which the United Nations has recognized their state and stressed that when the issue is resolved through the two-stage process [addressing the issues of the symbol, Constitution, and propaganda followed by that of the name], Greece will help the neighboring state in a positive way. Andov is right. The problem lies with the government, not between the peoples. But the problem does not lie with the Greek Government; it lies with the Skopjean Government, Venizelos said and concluded: Only when Skopje gives the three specific proofs--relating to the symbol, Constitution, and propaganda--in a dialogue with Greece, which has a known position on the name, will we also discuss bilateral economic relations.
