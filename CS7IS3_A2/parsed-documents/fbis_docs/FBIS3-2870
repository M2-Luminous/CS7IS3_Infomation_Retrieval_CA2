"There are 23 kinds of goods that are most closely related to people's livelihood," Li said. "The most important of them are what people would like to fill in their 'vegetable baskets'." In China, "vegetable basket" refers to fresh vegetables and foodstuffs such as eggs, fish and meat. The premier made the remark at a group discussion by deputies from Hebei Province to the National People's Congress (NPC) now in session in the Chinese capital. The deputies were discussing his government work report he delivered at an NPC session last Thursday [10 March]. Li praised Hebei Provincial authorities for doing a good job of developing "vegetable basket projects" in recent years and facilitating supplies of vegetables and foodstuffs to urban residents. In response to Hebei party chief's comment that low prices and drought were factors affecting cotton production, the premier said that the government has decided to raise purchasing prices for cotton by a proper margin. "However, if purchasing prices are raised too high, I'm afraid the textile industry won't be able to bear," he said. The problem will have to be solved gradually, in the process of establishing a market economic structure and carrying out price reform, he said. The premier proposed expanding the acreage of sprinkling irrigation and improving cotton varieties to combat drought. Li Peng also talked about enterprise reform, water diversion from the south, and development of water-saving farming.
