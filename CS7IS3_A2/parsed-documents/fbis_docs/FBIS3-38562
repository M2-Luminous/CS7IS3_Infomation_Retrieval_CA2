Discussing the ambush and killing of two Carabinieri policemen in the southern Calabria region on January 18 and a similar attack Tuesday [1 February], Mancino told the Lower House Constitutional Affairs Committee of "an attempt at a terrorist-type response from organized crime." There is, on the side of the 'Ndrangheta organized crime families in Calabria and abroad "a worrying terrorist escalation which is aimed at re-accrediting the authority of the clans, de-legitimizing the actions of the state," he added. Mancino told the hearing that the armed assault of two Carabinieri policemen in Calabria on Tuesday, which left the two men in critical condition, may have been carried out by the same team of hit-men which struck on January 18 on the Salerno-Reggio Calabria express highway. The minister went on to cover much the same ground in discussing the 'Ndrangheta before the Parliamentary Anti-Mafia Commission earlier when he provided data on the estimated strength and organization of the crime clans operating on the southern mainland. Today, he said, "Witnessed under the profile of organization is a process of the modernization of the traditional horizontal structures" to bring them under a collective leadership body thought to pursue "an idea of the management of criminal power characterized by unity, greater professionalism and greater enterprise." Also underscored by the ministers was that, "Relations between organized crime and the political and administrative components have kept pace with the phases of the evolution of crime in Calabria." The specific attacks on the Carabinieri policemen fits, he said, "into the framework of the 'Ndrangheta's leap of quality. The clans, seeing the threat to their own territorial roots in the increasingly stringent offensive of the start, react in an indiscriminate and symbolic way to the law enforcement services." The commitment of the government to the battle against these clans, he said, is "firm and irrevocable" but, he warned, "the efforts of the police and the judiciary will not be enough if the political and administrative class does not plan and launch initiatives aimed at reviving Calabria on the social and economic fronts as well." Still on the issue of the stepped-up battle, Mancino also outlined the dispatch of Army troops to the region before moving on to the anti-Mafia Golden Market sweep wrapped up yesterday by the Palermo judiciary and the National Anti-Mafia Directorate (DIA). Netted were three Palermo criminal lawyers, four doctors and two savings bank officials among the 76 persons named in arrest warrants plus the alleged members of what investigators said was the "most important hit team of recent years."
