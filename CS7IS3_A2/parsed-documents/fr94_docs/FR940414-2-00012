FR940414-2-00012 FR940414-2-00007 Office of the Secretary Manual for Courts-Martial AGENCY: Joint Service Committee on Military Justice (JSC). ACTION: Notice of proposed amendments. SUMMARY: The Department of Defense is considering recommending changes to the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1984, Executive Order No. 12473, as amended by Executive Order Nos. 12484, 12550, 12586, 12708, and 12888. The proposed changes are part of the 1994 annual review required by the Manual for Courts-Martial and DoD Directive 5500.17, ``Review of the Manual for Courts-Martial,'' January 23, 1985. The proposed changes have not been coordinated within the Department of Defense under DoD Directive 5500.1, ``Preparation and Processing of Legislation, Executive Orders, Proclamations, and Reports and Comments Thereon'', May 21, 1964, and do not constitute the official position of the Department of Defense, the Military Departments, or any other government agency. This notice is provided in accordance with DoD Directive 5500.17, ``Review of the Manual for Courts-Martial'', January 23, 1985. This notice is intended only to improve the internal management of the Federal government. It is not intended to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person. The proposed changes follow in their entirety: R.C.M. 1110(g)(1) be amended to read as follows: ``(1) In general. A waiver or withdrawal of appellate review under this rule shall bar review by the Judge Advocate General under R.C.M. 1201(b)(1) or R.C.M. 1201(b)(3) and by the Court of Military Review. Once submitted, a waiver or withdrawal in compliance with this rule may not be revoked.'' R.C.M. 1201(b)(3)(A) be amended to read as follows: ``(A) In general. Notwithstanding R.C.M. 1209, the Judge Advocate General may, sua sponte or, except when the accused has waived or withdrawn the right to appellate review under R.C.M. 1110, upon application of the accused or a person with authority to act for the accused, vacate or modify, in whole or in part, the findings, sentence, or both of a court-martial which has been finally reviewed, but has not been reviewed either by a Court of Military Review or by the Judge Advocate General under subsection (b)(1) of this rule, on the ground of newly discovered evidence, fraud on the court-martial, lack of jurisdiction over the accused or the offense, error prejudicial to the substantial rights of the accused, or the appropriateness of the sentence.'' Part IV, paragraph 4c, be amended by adding a new subparagraph (4) as follows: ``(4) Voluntary abandonment. It is a defense to an attempt offense that the person voluntarily and completely abandoned the intended crime, because of a genuine change of heart, prior to the completion of the crime. Voluntary abandonment because of a ``genuine change of heart'' means that the attempted crime was abandoned solely because of the person's own sense that it was wrong. The voluntary abandonment defense is not allowed if the abandonment results, in whole or in part, from other reasons, for example, the person feared detection or apprehension, decided to await a better opportunity for success, was unable to complete the crime, or encountered unanticipated difficulties or unexpected resistance. A person who is entitled to the defense of voluntary abandonment may nonetheless be guilty of a lesser included, completed offense. For example, a person who voluntarily abandoned an attempted armed robbery may nonetheless be quilty of assault with a dangerous weapon.'' Part IV of the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1984, be amended by inserting the following new paragraph after paragraph 103: ``103a. Article 134 (Self-injury without intent to avoid service) a. Text. See paragraph 60. b. Elements. (1) That the accused intentionally inflicted injury upon himself or herself; (2) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.
