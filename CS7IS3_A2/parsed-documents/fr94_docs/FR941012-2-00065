SUMMARY: Notice of De Minimis Settlement: in accordance with Section 122(i)(1) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (``CERCLA''), notice is hereby given of a de minimis settlement concerning past and estimated future response actions at the MIG/Dewane Landfill, Belvidere, Illinois. U.S. EPA Region 5 has submitted the proposed agreement to the U.S. Department of Justice for review concurrent with this request for public comment. This settlement will not be finalized until the approval process set forth in Section 122(g)(4) of CERCLA has been completed. DATES: Comments must be provided on or before November 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to Mary Tierney (Mail Code HSRL&hyph;6J), Remedial Project Manager, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois, 60604, and should refer to: In the Matter of MIG/Dewane Landfill, Docket No. V&hyph;W&hyph;94&hyph;C&hyph;254. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas C. Jacobs, (Mail Code CS_29A), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: One hundred forty-one parties executed binding certifications of their consent to participate in the settlement. These parties will pay approximately $2,800,000 in settlement payments for response costs related to the MIG/Dewane Landfill Site, if the United States Environmental Protection Agency determines that it will not withdraw or withhold its consent to the proposed settlement after consideration of comments submitted pursuant to this notice. U.S. EPA may enter into this settlement under the authority of Section 122(g) of CERCLA. Section 122(g) authorizes de minimis settlemants with potentially responsible parties (``PRPs'') that contributed hazardous substances to a site where those contributions were small and where the toxicity of the substances contributed is not significantly different from the other agreement proposed to settle with parties who are each responsible for less than 00.60% of the total volume of hazardous substances sent to the site. Settling de minimis PRPs will be required to pay their fair share of the past and estimated future response costs at the site. The settlement payment amount includes three levels of premiums against estimated total response costs to account for potential cost overruns, the potential for failure of the remedies selected to clean up the site, and other risks. The three levels are 50% (for those Settling PRPs who are signatories to the 1991 Administrative Order on Consent for Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study at the MIG/Dewane Landfill), 100% (for those Settling PRPs who did not receive general or special notice of potential liability prior to the de minimis settlement notice), and 200% (for those parties who received general or special notice of potential liability prior to the 1991 Administrative Order on Consent but who did not choose to sign the order) A copy of the proposed Administrative Order on Consent and additional background information relating to the settlement, including a list of parties to the settlement, are available for review and may be obtained in person or by mail from Thomas C. Jacobs (Mail Code CS_29A), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will receive written comments relating to this settlement for thirty days from the date of publication of this notice.
