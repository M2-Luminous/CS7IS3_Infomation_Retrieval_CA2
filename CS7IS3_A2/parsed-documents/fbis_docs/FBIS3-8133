Meciar said that the situation in Slovakia was moving towards its denouement, and that elections "would divide the wheat from the chaff." He said the president's refusal to appoint honorable chairman of the Slovak National Party (SNS) Jozef Prokes as foreign minister was an expression of lack of confidence in the HZDS, the SNS, the premier and the whole government (Prokes would replace the recently resigned Jozef Moravcik). Meciar attacked President Kovac for not having found time in half a year to receive him and Chairman of Parliament Ivan Gasparovic. Meciar's announcement that the HZDS would not invite Kovac to its conference was received with enthusiastic applause by those present. Michal Kovac was elected president as an HZDS candidate. When Meciar read out a "question from the floor" as to whether it would not be best to join the parliamentary elections to the presidential ones, the crowd chanted "Dismiss, dismiss." Meciar then commented on what some opposition politicians and foreign commentators had said about the referendum being a possible threat to Slovakia's membership of the Council of Europe. He said that Slovakia was observing all the commitments which membership entailed, and that there was no need to doubt the membership. The only unsolved question, he said, was that of the Council of Europe recommendation concerning bilingual names of towns and villages, but the Hungarian minority deputies had "spoiled this themselves." Meciar said his recent journey to China and Thailand had been a success, and in a clear reference to Czech President Vaclav Havel's recent accident in Thailand, said he "had not broken a rib" there. Just to be certain, however, he had not got into the bath. The premier expressed his dissatisfaction at the fact that Russian Foreign Minister Andrej Kozyrev had not arrived on his agreed visit to Slovakia on his February journey to the Visegrad Four countries [the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary]. Meciar said the postponement of the visit delayed the balancing of the trade deficit with Russia, which has reached 15 billion Slovak crowns (about $500,000,000). Meciar added that Slovakia was asking the Russians for an explanation. (Kozyrev allegedly canceled his visit because of the instability on the Slovak political scene.)
