Earlier, on the 4th of March, the traitor showed up at "the graduation ceremony of the military academy of the Navy" and incited war fever. It is ill-boding that Kim Yong-sam accompanied by brasshats incited the consciousness of confrontation and war fever at the military academies at a time when working-level contacts for the exchange of special envoys were underway. This shows that the puppets are little interested in the improvement of the inter-Korean relations, but persistently seek only division and confrontation. With the traitor Kim Yong-sam remaining in power, neither the successful promotion of North-South dialogue nor peace of the Korean peninsula and its peaceful reunification is thinkable.
