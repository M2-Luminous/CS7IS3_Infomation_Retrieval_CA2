The cocaine shipment was intended for the Nigerian connection in Sao Paulo State. The arrest of a Bolivian citizen indicates a new tactic by the traffickers on the Bolivia-Sao Paulo route. Antonio Omar Sanchez, a Bolivian merchant living in Sao Paulo, is under arrest. He was caught during a routine operation carried out by the federal highway police on the BR-262 Highway. In the federal highway police's opinion, impaired by successive arrests in which people were caught red-handed, the Nigerian connnection is reportedly using people who do not look so suspicious to carry the drug. Antonio Omar Sanchez was sent to the federal police and indicted for being caught red-handed in a crime.
