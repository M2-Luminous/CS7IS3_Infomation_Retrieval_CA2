FR940630-0-00123 FR940630-0-00037 II. Conforming Amendments Final Rule No public comments were received on the October 8, 1993 conforming amendments proposed rule. Accordingly, the Department, through this rule, adopts, as final, the conforming amendments set forth in the October 8, 1993 proposed rule, with some additional changes as described in this section. Revision to Conforming Amendment to Part 219 The October 8, 1993 conforming amendments proposed rule included a conforming amendment to 24 CFR part 219 which contains the regulations for the Flexible Subsidy Program. However, the October 8, 1993 conforming amendment made reference to the $7,500 threshold which is no longer applicable, because it has been removed by the section 3 (part 135) interim rule, published elsewhere in today's edition of the Federal Register . The section 3 interim rule provides one set of thresholds applicable to all HUD housing and community development programs. Additionally, on December 6, 1993, the Department published a final rule that amended 24 CFR part 219 to implement the changes made to the Flexible Subsidy Program by the 1992 Act (58 FR 64138). This December 6, 1993 final rule included references to the applicability of section 3 and the regulations of part 135 to the Flexible Subsidy Program. This conforming amendments final rule makes two changes to the amendments made by the December 6, 1939 final rule. The December 6, 1993 final rule included a reference to section 3 and the regulations in part 135 under the requirements applicable to Flexible Subsidy operating assistance. However, section 3, as amended by the 1992 Act, is no longer applicable to Flexible Subsidy operating assistance. Therefore this conforming amendments rule removes this reference. In addition, this conforming amendments rule makes a minor change to the reference to section 3 and the regulations in part 135 under the capital improvement requirements. Section 3 and the regulations in part 135 are applicable to capital improvement assistance, but as the section 3 (part 135) rule provides, this applicability is limited to housing rehabilitation, housing construction and other public construction projects as provided in part 135, and subject to the thresholds provided in part 135. This conforming amendments final rule clarifies the limited applicability of section 3. Addition of Conforming Amendment to Part 280 The October 8, 1993 conforming amendment proposed rule inadvertently omitted a conforming amendment to 24 CFR part 280 (Nehemiah Housing Opportunity Grants). Section 280.207 of this part currently contains a reference to section 3 and the part 135 regulations. However, the reference section 3 includes statutory language that has been removed from the 1992 Act amendment to section 3. The conforming amendment made to part 280 by this final rule removes the outdated statutory language. Removal of Conforming Amendment to Part 700 The October 8, 1993 conforming amendment proposed rule included a conforming amendment for 24 CFR part 700 (Congregate Housing Services Program). This program currently does not provide assistance for housing rehabilitation, housing construction or other public construction projects, which would be extent of coverage by section 3 and the regulations in part 135 for this Housing program. Accordingly, the conforming amendment to part 700 is removed by this final rule. If and when the Congregate Housing Services Program provides assistance for these three types of section 3 covered projects, the regulations in part 700 will be amended to include reference to the applicability of section 3 and the regulations in part 135. Addition of Conforming Amendment to Part 882, Subpart G This final rule also includes a conforming amendment to 24 CFR part 882, subpart G. As discussed in the section 3 (part 135) interim rule, the Department has determined that section 3 and the regulations in part 135 are applicable to section 8 project-based assistance that is expended for housing rehabilitation, housing construction, or other public construction project. Addition of Section Conforming Amendment to Part 905 The October 8, 1993 proposed rule included a conforming amendment to 24 CFR part 905 (Indian Housing Programs), but only in the section of the rule (ยง905.165) which addresses the subject of Indian preference in employment and contracting. The October 8, 1993 inadvertently failed to include a reference to section 3 and the regulations of part 135 in ยง905.120, which lists other applicable Federal requirements. This conforming amendments final rule corrects this error. Section 3 (Part 135) Interim Rule The Department again points out that the section 3 (part 135) rule published elsewhere in today's edition of the Federal Register is being published as an interim rule. The Department received substantial comment on the October 8, 1993 section 3 proposed rule, has made a number of changes to the section 3 regulations as a result of public comment, and seeks additional public comment on the section 3 rule. III. Other Matters Impact on Small Entities The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed and approved this rule, and, in so doing, certifies that the rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This final rule makes conforming amendments to various parts in title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations that include reference (and thus update this reference), or that should include reference to the part 135 regulations. Environmental Impact In connection with the development of the section 3 (part 135) proposed rule, a Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment was made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). That Finding of No Significant Impact was applicable to the October 8, 1993 conforming amendments proposed rule, and remains applicable to the section 3 (part 135) interim rule and this conforming amendments final rule. The Finding remains available for public inspection during regular business hours in the Office of the General Counsel, Rules Docket Clerk, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410. Federalism Impact The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order No. 12611, Federalism , has determined that this rule would not have a substantial, direct effect on the States or on the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power or responsibilities among the various levels of government. The rule simply makes conforming amendments to various parts in 24 CFR that include reference (and thus update this reference), or that should include reference to the part 135 regulations. The part 135 interim rule, published elsewhere in today's Federal Register provides, consistent with the section 915 of the 1992 Act, that the preference requirements of section 3 are to be carried out consistent with existing Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. Impact on the Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family , has determined that this final rule does not have the potential to promote family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and thus is not subject to review under the order. This final rule simply makes conforming amendments to several parts in 24 CFR to update reference, or include reference to the part 135 regulations. No change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this proposed rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. Regulatory Agenda This rule was listed as sequence number 1542 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20438) under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
