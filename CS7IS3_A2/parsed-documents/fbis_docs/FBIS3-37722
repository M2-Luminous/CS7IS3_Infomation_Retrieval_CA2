Communications personnel, who are owed 80 billion rubles [R] by television for last year, cut off transmission in many regions of the country. For a whole day fans of Santa Barbara [soap opera] scoured the news agency reports with bated breath for news of the development of the conflict. In the evening many breathed a sigh of relief: It was reported that Premier Chernomyrdin had ordered that television's debts to the Ministry of Communications be paid. True, this is to be in stages. It is not difficult to guess that with each stage, given today's inflation, the sum will "diminish," which, understandably, will not induce enthusiasm among the communications workers. Nor should it be forgotten that this year's debts will quickly augment last year's. At a press conference on Monday the leaders of the television companies reported that for 1994 they had been allocated only 18 percent of the sum required. It is not difficult to guess that six weeks from now, at the end of the first quarter, the communications personnel will again have grounds for raising the question of switching off our television sets. It is perfectly clear therefore that the problem needs a fundamental solution. Today it would seem the heavyweights of this world have grasped this simple truth. The premier spoke of the need to abandon a number of state television channels on the very evening of the day when the crisis in relations between television and the Ministry of Communications was resolved. But quite a few difficulties are concealed behind the outward simplicity. Sometimes naive people regard denationalization as a magic wand which will immediately enable all questions to be removed. In this latest conflict, for example, the myth has arisen thanks to someone that the communications workers are owed money only by state companies, the private ones having emerged with spotless year-end results. Indeed they don't have any debts. But why? The point is that TV-6 enjoys a special satellite communications link, while NTV only started operating quite recently and so has not had time to get into debt. The Ministry of Communications' complaints about poverty, which is prompting the strikes, is yet another myth. It is, of course, a thankless task to count the money in someone else's pocket, but, according to certain sources, the monopolists' earnings in this sphere are considerably above the average for other sectors of the economy. Finally, there is a third myth, to wit, the opinion that television and "Ostankino," in particular, is, through advertising, raking in millions in foreign currency and billions in rubles, and that it shares it with no one. Indeed, a lot has been written recently about abuses perpetrated by certain smart operators in television. However, something else must also be said: "Ostankino" not only pays taxes to the state but also "releases" quite a considerable amount of the large sum of money it has to the Television Center, which owns all the television company's property and equipment . In the opinion of A. Pimanov, deputy director of "Ostankino's" "Publitsist" Studio, neither share-flotation nor even the introduction of subscription payments for the use of televison receivers is capable of rescuing Europe's largest television company from financial failure. A whole set of different measures is required here. It is essential to have a separate bank and to put to work the money obtained from the state. The progress of every ruble should be tracked and the maximum return on it secured. Channels through which money is lost to television production must be plugged. But that is not enough, according to Pimanov. It is time to stop shifting money from one pocket to another with considerable losses en route. The practice which formerly prevailed at "Ostankino" and which is the rule throughout the world should be restored. After all nowhere, and that includes in the second largest Russian television company, is the creative side separated from the technical. The long-drawn-out question of the autonomousness of the Television Center, which has been artificially isolated from the single television organism, must finally be resolved. Incidentally, the Television Center recently, without any warning whatsoever, announced a retroactive increase, effective as of last December, in all prices for the services offered to "Ostankino." And these were up to fourfold increases! It is clear here that the television company will never be able to extricate itself from the trammels of unpaid debts. It will not be saved by crumbs from the government budget table, shareholders' investments, or even a subscription payment by millions of ordinary viewers.
