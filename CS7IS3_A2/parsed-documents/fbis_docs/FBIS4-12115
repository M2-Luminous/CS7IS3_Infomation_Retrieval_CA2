He also hoped that practical alternatives will be found to inspect al-'Aqabah-bound ships in order to solve the 44-month old problem. Al-Tarawinah said in a telephone interview with AL-DUSTUR that U.S. State Department officials have always stressed that the decision in this regard will be positive and that it will be made as soon as possible. Asked about the visit to the region by the U.S. secretary of state, Dr. al-Tarawinah noted that the visit depends on the results of the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli talks in Cairo and the final signing between the two parties. If the signing is decided, he added, it will be attended by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Dr. al-Tarawinah added that the Palestinian side insists that the signing takes place before 13 April, however, this would be delayed for a week. In light of this, the U.S. secretary's visit will be decided. Dr. al-Tarawinah noted that the U.S. secretary's visit is expected to take place in mid-April. In light of the results of the secretary's visit, he added, the date for resuming the Arab-Israeli talks in Washington will be set. Dr. al-Tarawinah expects the Arab and Israeli negotiators to return to the negotiating table at the end of this month if no new obstacles appear.
