A broadcaster called "Administration" is not envisaged in any law, and granting this subject--mythical from the standpoint of the "Law on the Mass Media"--the right to enter a contract with a GTRK is not only illegal but simply unnatural. There are rayon desks registered as mass media entities (dependent or independent of rayon administrations), and only they may be the subject of contracts involving broadcasting, says the protest. In addition, Simonov draws Malyshev's attention to the fact that the GTRK Petersburg--Channel 5 itself does not have a license to conduct broadcasting over the wire, and therefore its claim to exclusivity in wire broadcasting is extremely questionable. And finally, the unit that has been set up in the GTRK for the purpose of monitoring the content of radio programs broadcast by rayons is an act of local censorship, which in principle is contrary to the current law. As to election materials and their broadcasting through rayon "desks," the executive branch does not have the prerogative to sanction or ban this, even less so the "mother" television and radio company. "The fund is ready to support a court action by any of the rayon desks, whose legitimate rights are infringed on either by the `Directives' or the `Contract,' of which we hereby inform you simultaneously with this letter," Aleksey Simonov continued.
