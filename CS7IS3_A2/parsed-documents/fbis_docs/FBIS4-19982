Neither "Rhenish" nor "Anglo-Saxon," the "financial heart" is controlled by a caste drawn from the civil service. Edouard Balladur had solemnly promised that his government, at the head of public companies and future privatized ones, would not lead a witches' hunt. This time, the composition of the well-known "hard core" of the groups placed on the market would be beyond question. In short, the new wave of privatization would be unassailable. Six months after the transfer of the BNP [National Bank of Paris] to the private sector, the first grand style operation, we must accept that reality does not actually match with what was said. To be sure, all the bosses of the public groups were not dismissed immediately after the majority changed. To be sure, community rules make it theoretically mandatory to leave the door opened to investors of European Union countries. But the game does seem to be played in private among people belonging to the same world, between former denationalized companies and future privatized ones. The game was played in four rounds. 1982-1983: In addition to the leading institutions--BNP, Credit Lyonnais, Societe Generale--and the insurance companies that had already been nationalized since 1945, the Left in power nationalized some hundred banks, including the two investment banks (Paribas and Suez). The leading French industrial groups (the former CGE [General Electricity Company], which since then has become Alcatel-Alsthom, Saint Gobain, Bull, Thomson, Pechiney, Rhone Poulenc, Matra, Usinor and Sacilor) passed under state control. Four years later, having assumed power, the Right privatized a first wave of companies, Suez, Saint Gobain, Matra, Havas, the Societe Generale, and Alcatel-Alsthom--according to the "hard core" technique. A subtle balance fell into place among groups regarded as playing a pivotal role--such as Alcatel, Societe Generale and Havas. But in the autumn of 1987, the stock market crash brought the privatization program to a halt. Once again in power, the Socialists, for budgetary reasons, authorized cross-shareholding investments. Unable to appeal to the financial market and state capital endowments being rare, the public groups, looking for a capital base, increased mutual equity investments, which offered the double advantage of not involving state control once again and of bringing in fresh money. In the spring of 1993, the UDF [Union for French Democracy]-RPR [Rally for the Republic] coalition was back in business with an extremely ambitious privatization program. For convenience--why start all over again when drafts have already been formulated over a period of some 10 years?--or for political will, not only did the woven common interests remained intact, they resurfaced stronger. The government was able to rely on an untouched base: The privatized companies of 1986-1987 that had held on to their teams and shareholders. The only attempt undertaken by the Socialists to break up the hard core--the assault decreed in 1989 by Pierre Beregovoy against the Societe Generale--ended up in defeat and brought out new common interests. STABILITY - As a rule, the stability of the leadership in the privatized groups is much higher than that of public leadership, and even private, companies. It is so true that we can wonder if there is not legislation unique to the privatized companies, legislation which derives from the logic of neither public nor private logic, but from the method used, that of the hard core, the only calling of which would be to isolate French capitalism. Behind the popular success of the spectacular privatization of the BNP, Rhone-Poulenc and Elf Aquitaine, the prime minister shapes the ties, balance of power, and alliances among the largest of the French groups. The choice of standard chairmen and shareholders always obeys a very specific logic, namely, the gradual implementation of a all powerful "financial elite," lead by a limited circle of former top civil servants with an homogeneous social and political profile. First observation: For the most part, groups being privatization find their shareholders among the privatized companies and those capable of being privatized. Cross-shareholding investments between leading recently privatized groups, and those invited to do so, make it possible to manage the scarcity of capital, but they are aimed primarily at protecting the groups from the possible hunger of foreign capitalism. In fact, the Generale des eaux, the Lyonnaise des eaux and the AXA insurance company, which are the only exceptions, are allowed to share the economic power, but not in the best positions, these being reserved for the denationalized companies of 1986-1987 (Saint Gobain, the Societe Generale, Parisbas, and Suez) and 1993-1994 (BNP, UAP [Paris Insurance Union], and Elf-Aquitaine). The privatization of the UAP, planned for the very near future--and of the anticipated privatization of AGF [General Insurance of France] --gives its final coherence to the patiently implemented system. A new French-style capitalism is taking shape. But is it really new? Interwoven with the state since World War II, its nature has not really changed. There is no English-style market capitalism, no German-style bank-industry and no Italian-style network of powerful families. It is a "financial core" capitalism, actually rather close to the Japanese system. Have the "50 buddies" replaced the 200 families, as claimed by the opposition? The creation of groups of stable shareholders is more attuned to a give-and-take logic than to real economic motivations. A given industrialist will accept participation in the capital of his principal banker or insurer who is also one of his shareholders. Who is the BNP's main shareholder? The UAP. Who is the UAP's main shareholder? The BNP. Similar combinations link the Societe Generale to Alcatel-Alsthom, the Societe Generale to Rhone-Poulenc, Saint Gobain to Suez, Saint Gobain to the BNP, the UAP to Elf Aquitaine, and in time, they will link the UAP to Elf-Aquitaine, and Paribas to the AGF's. No true "godfathers" stand out against these mutual obligators. It would more likely involve a group of baronies forced to compromise with each other. For Jacques Friedmann, "companies gravitate toward each other, sharing common interests in addition to their capitalistic ties." If the division of these groups is hazy, their interests do not necessarily meet. INFLUENCE - Despite the stronger powers given to the Privatization Committee in 1993, influence continues to be a factor in French privatization. Some people claim that they are being totally controlled. The state nominates the chairmen, imposes its choice in the matter of stable shareholders and, in fact, decides who the members of the board of directors are to be. Elie Cohen, a CNRS [National Center for Scientific Research] researcher, is critical of this: "France is the only country in the world where the state nominates in advance the shareholders who will hold the real economic power. It is the reverse channel of capitalism, the public authorities, and the leaders whom they have appointed, choose influential shareholders who place the market before the accomplished fact." Even the Italian privatization process--which ignores the hard-core system--is far more liberal! The French system is all the more locked in as the leaders are drawn from the same pool, namely, the higher public offices--the Inspectorate of Finance and the leading government agencies; between 1986 and 1988, these individuals also often worked in ministerial cabinets--the whole system bound by a common political thought. The profile of these members is thoroughly homogeneous. In no way does it resemble that of the entrepreneurs and captains of industry. Elie Cohen states: "No difference is made between appointing bosses to head the public companies and choosing men to lead privatization. But in the first case, what a government does, another can undo. In the second, it involves incorporating a biased connection into the bedrock of capitalism." The government is developing from privatization a closed circuit control of the leading French groups. Corroborating this statement are, among other examples, the efforts used to secure the appointment of Jacques Friedmann, a very close adviser of Edouard Balladur and Jacques Chirac, as head of the UAP, which implied transferring the bosses of the Credit lyonnais and the Credit national. Another corroboration is the showdown between the prime minister's office and the Economics Ministry to find Michel Albert's successor. Edmond Alphandery had to throw his resignation into the ring to snatch a win for the appointment of his protege, Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, who is more friendly toward the UDF than the RPR. A true "cultural exception!" Boards of directors thus become "a true admiration society." As shown in the case of the Societe Generale, any threat against one of the leading beacons of the new capitalism would be perceived as a danger by the others. It remains that the rigidity of the system is also its weakness. How will it deal with quarrels of succession without cracking? Even more serious is the absence of a real counterpower and control outside the "club." Jacques Friedmann can assert all he wants that cross-shareholding investments do not lessen the scope of mutual controls ("We have the interests of our companies to defend and accounts to give to our boards of directors and to our shareholders as a whole."), there continues to be a doubt about the leaders' ability to escape the hold of the clan. The public authorities plead in their own defense a limited "address book." A few weeks ago, Gerard Longuet was acknowledging: "The number of French participants is relatively small. They are known. We have Paribas, Suez, the AXA, UAP, GAN [National Insurances Group] and AGF for the financiers; a few private groups, such as those of Marc Fournier (the Mixed Shipping Company), and mutually crisscrossing industries in the image of Elf and Renault, in addition to people who get along together like Philippe Jaffre, Michel Pebereau, and Louis Schweitzer. France is a small country." TO TAME -- But how can we imagine that BNP boss Michel Pebereau, as UAP's main shareholder, would question Jacques Friedmann, who seats on his board of directors, he too as a main shareholder? Boldness is not the first quality of high officials who are now business leaders and who built their brilliant career primarily by trying not to make mistakes. We can wonder about their ability to tackle business and to take industrial risks. For them, the transfer to the private sector corresponds to the need of taming the market. Therefore, it involves primarily showing an acceptable profitability and choosing management over offensive strategies. In fact, a falling stock price is the single factor of destabilization. Theoretically, the creation at a future date of a French-style pension fund could some day give small stockholders real power, but it has been postponed until fall. Finally, in-breeding carries with it another risk should one of these groups, which are the system's key factors, run into difficulty. It is easy to imagine that the state could not remain indifferent, the Treasury standing as the ultimate guarantee of a rigid and closed system. Does it really involve giving the private sector a chance?
