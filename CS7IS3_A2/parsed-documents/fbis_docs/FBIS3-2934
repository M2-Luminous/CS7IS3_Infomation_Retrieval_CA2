Delivering a report on the Supreme Court's work to the ongoing session of the National People's Congress [NPC], Ren, president of the Supreme People's Court, said, "Stability serves as an important guarantee for reforms and economic development." In 1994, he said, all courts will continue to unswervingly crack down on serious criminal activities and better use judicial means to regulate economic relations and protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens, and improve the explanation of new laws. Reviewing last year's work, he said that, in 1993, Chinese courts tried 3.4 million cases of all kinds, including 400,000 criminal cases, he said. Courts meted out severe punishment to offenders of such crimes as murder, robbery, rape, explosion, kidnapping and roguery, he said, adding that organized crime was a prime target of the law. The top judge said that last year courts convicted 230,000 criminals on charges of seriously damaging state security and disrupting public order. Meanwhile, courts mitigated sentences for, or released on probation, criminals who showed real repentance or performed meritorious deeds in reform through labor, with 230,000 mitigation cases and 33,000 probation cases handled in 1993. Courts at all levels speeded up the handling of cases involving economic crimes after the government decided to launch an anti- corruption campaign last year. According to Ren, courts handled 27,463 such cases last year and concluded 27,323 ones. They gave verdicts to more than 22,106 economic offenders, of whom 6,863 were sentenced to prison terms of five years or more, life in prison, death, or death with a reprieve. He revealed that among the convicted were 69 county-level and seven bureau-level officials. The top judge said that, in recent years, a number of government employees, including a very small number of officials, have abused their power to commit serious crimes of embezzlement, bribery and diverting public money for personal use, to public indignation. Courts took as their main punishment target officials committing such crimes who worked in leading bodies of the Chinese Communist Party and the government, judicial departments, administrative law-enforcement departments and economic administrative departments. With the growth of a socialist market economy, people's courts are in a better position to regulate economic relations. In 1993, the number of lawsuits involving economic disputes rose substantially, with many new types of such lawsuits occurring, he said. Last year courts handled 890,000 such lawsuits of the first instance, up 37 percent from 1992, involving a total amount of 70.5 billion yuan. Furthermore, with the development of China's foreign trade and marine transportation, the number of cases involving maritime disputes has risen steadily in recent years, Ren said. In 1993, maritime courts handled a total of 1,830 such cases and concluded 1,607 ones. Courts at all levels also concluded 1,311 economic cases involving foreign nationals or residents from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. Ren Jianxin said that in handling cases involving foreign parties, Chinese courts adhere to the principle of safeguarding national sovereignty, fully exercise China's jurisdiction, and protect, on the basis of equality, the legitimate rights and interests of both Chinese and foreign parties involved in accordance with international treaties signed or acceded to by China and by taking reference to internationally accepted practices. "The prompt and proper trial of such cases is conducive to improving China's investment environment and to promoting foreign economic cooperation and trade," he said. He said that, in 1993, Chinese courts attached greater importance to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and legal entities by various judicial means, and handled large numbers of cases involving the right of person and property rights. Last year courts handled 2.08 million civil cases of the first instance, 61 percent of the total number of all types of cases of the first instance. Of these handled, there was a sharp increase in the number of cases involving divorce, personal reputation, honor, nomenclature, name and portraits, disputes over labor contracts, wages, insurance, welfare and labor protection, debt, land development, housing sales and real estate mortgage. Meanwhile, courts also re-tried a total of 73,121 criminal, civil, economic, administrative, civil and maritime cases that had been given verdicts since 1949, he said. They changed verdicts for 14,271 cases that had been proven to be incorrect, he added.
