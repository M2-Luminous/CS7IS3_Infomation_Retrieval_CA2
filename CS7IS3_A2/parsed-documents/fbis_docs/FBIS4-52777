Business circles warned the government of this far in advance, but the classic problems that have emerged in the form of a high-cost economy have not been corrected. The problems appear in various forms, including illegal fees and lack of transparency in government policies, such as in the setting of quotas on textiles and textile products. These were the views of people in Jakarta whom KOMPAS contacted Monday, 7 March, to get reaction to the slow growth of Indonesian non-oil-and-gas exports, primarily textiles and textile products. Those contacted were Indonesian Textiles Association (API) Secretary-General Benny Soetrisno and API General Chairman Chamroel Djafri. H. Mohamad "Bob" Hasan, general chairman of the Indonesian Forestry Community (MPI), who was interviewed Monday after a gathering for breaking the fast, also acknowledged a recent sluggishness on international markets. "I do not think we can avoid what is happening internationally. We cannot do very much now, because other countries are having problems," Bob Hasan explained. Benny, who said he is "horrified" to see the declining competitiveness of Indonesian textiles and textile products on global markets, declared that all API directors have submitted to the authorities their analyses of the textile industry's future. Textiles are one of the four top exports. During the term of the Fifth Development Cabinet, API representatives called on Minister of Industry Hartarto; Junior Minister of Industry Tunky Ariwibowo; Minister of Trade Arifin Siregar; Junior Minister of Trade Soedradjad Djiwandono; Bank Indonesia Governor Adrianus Mooy; Minister of Finance J.B. Sumarlin; Coordinating Minister for Economics, Finance, Industry, and Development Control Radius Prawiro; and Minister of State and State Secretary Murdiono. "Those reports apparently did not get enough follow-up to reassure members of the textile industry. They hoped at least for measures to reduce loan interest rates more quickly, and improve the investment climate. The macro economy does not present a good picture, either. Meanwhile, foreign markets are more `furious' in their competition, because they are supported by various monetary factors and a much better climate," Benny said. Explain Again In view of this still disadvantageous situation, API directors feel it is necessary to discuss further the problem with officials in the Sixth Development Cabinet. Their scientific explanations as well as concrete examples will at least illustrate how concerned industrialists are, which will also have an impact on national interests. On that basis, then, the API submitted requests for direct dialogues with Coordinating Minister of Industry and Trade Hartarto; Coordinating Minister for Economics, Finance, and Development Control Saleh Afiff; Minister of Industry Tunky Ariwibowo; Minister of Trade S.B. Joedono; Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad; Bank Indonesia Governor Soedradjad Djiwandono; Minister of State and State Secretary Murdiono; and SESDALOPBANG [expansion not given] Tjuk Setyohadi. Complete information has been presented to the officials, but it is not yet known what steps are to be taken to resolve the problem. Moreover, there was recent word that at a meeting on economics, finance, industry, trade and development control, the government acknowledged that exports of Indonesian manufactures have declined, rising only by 8.41 percent in 1993. From 1988 to 1992, however, national exports rose by an average of 15.8 percent. "It is clear that we have made maximal efforts to defeat market competition. Competition is keen, however, primarily from new countries such as Vietnam, the PRC, and Turkey, which have unbeatable quality. They can sell at low prices, however, because their products are efficient. As for us, how can we be efficient? From production to export, there are many outside costs that have to be paid," Benny said. Ins and Outs of High Costs The API secretary-general tried to describe frankly the ins and outs of the problem. Indonesia's competitors can sell at competitive prices because they are not excessively burdened by a high-cost economy. For the national textile industry, however, there is a series of fees that must be paid--from getting permits for imported materials, importing them, processing them, to reexporting them. These include unofficial fees paid along the roads, which are quite large when all are totaled. Receipts cannot be requested for any of these fees, because none of the high-cost economy in field operations is found in regulations. Automatically, then, no proof can be given of having paid such fees. As a result, these various fees automatically go into computation of the production component without their being recorded in books for auditing by accountants, although the value of illegal fees are usually much larger than official ones--15 to 20 percent of production costs. This increased expense is naturally incorporated into calculations of profit or other revenues, and the result is that they are taxable. From this aspect alone, it means that companies are hit twice. First, they are bashed by costs in the field, and, second, they have to pay taxes. "With conditions like this, how can we compete? From every side, we are not competitive, although maximum efficiency goes into the commodities," the industrialist said. Unfair Monetary Climate Another thing that must be borne by industry, said Benny, is the upside-down thinking on strengthening the financial structure. In the monetary sector, an annual interest of 18 to 19 percent is imposed on working capital, whereas credit for housing incurs only 16 percent. Moreover, credit for housing does not consider whether the credit is for luxury housing, where one person may own more than one house, or for simple housing. Besides, that sector generally spurs more inflation than the demands of working capital. The blows do not end with the interest rate problem alone. Tax restitution for exports is not paid for months and represents dormant money that cannot be used. "Theoretically, according to regulations, restitution should be paid no later than one month after exporters complete all administrative procedures, but in reality the quickest time is six months," he said. To resolve the restitution arrears, the director general for taxes finally sent instructions to all regional tax offices in the provinces to convert restitution into bank guaranties. Nevertheless, in practice the implementation of the regulation is yet at a standstill. "Is it because commissions are too small, or are the exporters not prepared to complete all administrative matters?" "Our question is, has the problem been touched by the deregulation measures the government has issued? If it has, why have conditions not changed? It not, why is the situation not corrected immediately? Thus, whatever the case may be, the basic issue in this decline is whether the bureaucrats seriously care about realities faced by members of industry. I think that is the key to being able to go through the 'needle's eye' in this export market struggle," Benny declared. If there are indeed to be no changes, all parties must be willing to watch the decline of this "prima donna" of contributors to foreign exchange. This can be seen in the fact that the TPT [textiles and textile products] continue to grow in volume from year to year, while the value per kilogram declined in 1993. "That is a fact. What is to be done now is up to the government. As far as efficiency is concerned, we have been working on that from the beginning. Whether conditions change or not, in principle we as industrialists will continue trying to ensure that 'our bowl of rice' is not broken or smashed," he said. Quota Distribution System Chamroel Djafri said that besides the external factors there are domestic factors that hinder TPT exports. They include, he said, high interest rates that burden exporters and export procedures that still do not move as smoothly as industrialists hope. In addition, he said, the present system for distributing quotas does not support steady increases in textile exports. He gave an example in which an industrialist obtained a TPT export quota for 10 categories, whereas that industrialist did not produce as many as 10 categories. He said, too, that besides the fact that the quota distribution system does not meet its targets, the system remains closed, despite the commotion that has long existed. Under the closed system, he said, an industrialist who is able to make exports cannot do so because he has no quota. Meanwhile, industrialists who receive quotas cannot fulfill their quotas. "Therefore, the quota distribution system should be reviewed and conducted transparently," he said. Through the Association In connection with eliminating inefficiency, Bob Hasan said that such improvement can be done only through association upgrading. The point is, the association understands its members and the problems they face. Citing the case of plywood, Bob Hasan, who is also general chairman of the Indonesian Wood Panel Association (APKINDO), said that APKINDO members practically do not have a quota problem any longer. A joint promotion team, in cooperation with a price stabilization team, decides the distribution of quotas for each member. The joint promotion team itself is formed on the basis of the export goals of each member. The company with the most exports to a specific country automatically becomes team chairman, while the position of deputy chairman is filled by the company with the second most exports to that country. The joint promotion team then gets data on the capacities of each member. "Quotas for the members are decided based on that data. The results are then submitted to the Department of Trade, which is the authority for distributing quotas to APKINDO members," Bob Hasan explained. According to the APKINDO general chairman, there has been practically no dissatisfaction or deviation with regard to quota distribution. "As general chairman, practically all I have to do is wait for reports. I intervene only if there is disagreement. In APKINDO, small companies do not have to be oppressed, for they get the first opportunity when there are additional quotas," Bob Hasan declared.
