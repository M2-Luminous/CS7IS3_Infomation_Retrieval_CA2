On Tuesday the number of patients was reported to be about 150. Most of the victims are men aged 15 to 35 and children aged ten to fourteen, of which there are 64. Individual cases of jaundice have also been reported in the Kosice-Venkov district among people who daily commute to Kosice. Because of the large number of cases, several clinics in two hospitals had to be used temporarily as infectious disease wards, and the dormitory of the Central Health School had to be turned into a temporary hospital. The cause of the epidemic has not yet been determined, but health officials do not think it was caused by contaminated city water or by products of the local dairy. The chairman of the Kosice District Council has closed all basic and secondary schools in Kosice. Large gatherings have also been forbidden. Fish and packaged groceries sold in public places are subject to strict health regulations. In 1979, 3,000 people in Kosice were afflicted by jaundice.
