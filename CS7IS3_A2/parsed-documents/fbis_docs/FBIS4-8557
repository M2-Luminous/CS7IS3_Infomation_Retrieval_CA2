In a statement to the Yugoslav news agency TANJUG, Bulatovic said that the United Nations had sided with the Moslems and thus discredited its peacekeeping role and moral prestige. No one may use "arms to deny anybody's right to defend themselves and the Serb people have a legitimate natural right to self-defence, guaranteed them by the U.N. Charter," he said. The defence minister said that NATO bombing of Serb positions around Gorazde had hit "not only all the Serbs, but also the conscience of every man opting for peace and ending of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [no closing quotation mark as received] Said Bulatovic: If NATO's aim had been to persuade all warring sides to start negotiating it produced nothing but an exactly opposite effect -- it encouraged those favouring a war option, and worried those well aware that peace cannot be reached by the force of arms. He went on to say that, after an impartial justice show, representing an act of aggression against the Serb people, which could bring about unforeseeable consequences, one should expect and hope that NATO would give up the law of the stronger and enable the warring sides to lay their arms and return to negotiating a peaceful settlement.
