The reports includes recorded extracts of the proposal papers read by nine delegates from the special invitees and political parties group. First, U Aung Hkam Ti, a Pa-o national of the Southern Shan State Special Region-6, reads the report which describes the ethnic origin and language of Pa-o nationals. Elaborating on the basic principle prohibiting secession from the Union, he notes the secession clause in the Soviet Constitution which has led to the current disintegration of the Soviet Union and points out "the need to prevent any opportunity for secession." Therefore, he proposes to include a clause in the constitution which will prohibit any region, state, self-administered division, and self-administered zone from seceding from the Union. The report then points out the weakness of a system of government led by a prime minister and proposes a presidential system of government. He concludes the report by calling upon other groups of delegates to strive to make the constitution more complete through their proposals. Next, U Aik Mone of the Northern Shan State Special Region-7, reads the report of the group, describing the ethnic origin, language, culture, and traditions of the Ta-ang Palaung nationals and their involvement in the tea industry and agriculture. He explains that the Ta-ang Palaung prefer to call themselves Ta-ang. He estimates that the congruous territory inhabited by Ta-ang Palaung covers: "1. the vicinity of and within Mogok Township in Mandalay Division; 2. the vicinity and the town of Kyaukme in Kyaukme Township, where Ta-ang Palaung constitutes 60 percent of the township population; 3. the western and northern parts of Hsipaw Township; 4. Namtu Township, where 70 percent of the population are Ta-ang Palaung; 5. Mong Mit Township, where Ta-ang Palaung constitute 40 percent of the township population; 6. Kutkai Township, where 50 percent of the population is Ta-ang Palaung; 7. Namhkam Township, where Ta-ang Palaung constitutes 70 percent of the population; 8. Namhsan Township in Northern Shan State, where 90 percent of the population is Ta-ang Palaung. The population of about 600,000 Ta-ang Palaung live collectively in this congruous territory." Furthermore, there are Ta-ang Palaung living in Lashio, Tangyan, Mu-se, and Mong Hsu townships in the Northern Shan State; Kalaw, Aungban, Lawksawk, and Ywagnan townships in the Southern Shan State; and Keng Tung, Mong Hkak, Mong Hsat, and Mong Ping in the Eastern Shan State." The report proposes that, in consideration of their desire to live peacefully with their own language, literature, culture, customs, and traditions, it is proposed that the Ta-ang nationals be made the "Ta-ang self-administered division," that the term "Ta-ang be used instead of Palaung," that "the Mong Tung region be declared a grade-1 level township, and the Mong La region be declared Mong La grade-1 level township." He expresses support for the undertakings of the government for development of the border regions. In conclusion, he calls on the delegates to consider his proposals with patience and magnanimity. Next, U Kyaw Myint alias U Win Maung of Namhkam presented his proposal in his capacity as chairman of the Khulon Lishso National League. He says the real ethnic name of his group is not Lisu but Lihso, and explains the existence of various groups of Lihso. He says most of the Khulon Lisu of Lihso live in the northern parts of Shan State and they are spread throughout Myanmar [BurmaBurma Television Network Burmese Next, U Khin Maung, member of the Central Executive Committee of the National Unity Party [NUP], continues reading the NUP report. He says the status of self-administered divisions and self-administered zones should be given if the following requirements are met: "A. a national race which has not obtained the status of region or state; B. an appropriate size of population; C. a collective inhabitation in a congruous territory; D. having a territory which includes existing townships that can be formed into at least two districts." He says delicate ethnic issues in the country should be settled with love, consideration, trust, and under the principle of racial harmony. He also calls for consideration of the level of economic development, administrative skill, communications, racial background, religion, language, customs, and traditions in deciding on the ethnic issue. He proposes the "prescription of self-administered zones and self-administered divisions in the appropriate areas within the regions and states." He then refers to the existence of Wa, Kokang, Pa-o, Palaung communities in the Shan State and Naga communities in Sagaing Division and says they should be entitled to self- administered area status. Next, the report of the the Union Pa-o National Organization is read by U Aung Khin. He welcomes the efforts to upgrade the political status of national races by giving them self-administration under the new constitution. He stresses "the time has now come to give the status of self-administered divisions and self-administered zones to national races who have not yet obtained their own state." He explains that Ho-pang meets the requirement for population and congruous territory and calls for its recognition as "a self-administered division for the Pa-o." He suggests that the constitution should include a provision prohibiting secession. Addressing the chapter on the head of state, he proposes that the electoral college be composed of three groups from two chambers of Parliament to elect a president and two presidents. The plenary session goes into recess at 1350. When the session resumes at 1420, U Ti Dar Wai of the Shan State Kokang Democratic Party reads his party's paper. He says that "Kokang nationals would like to have the status of a self-administered division where they can live lawfully with their own literature, language, culture, and customs and that they would like to live in peace and freedom under a stable political system formed along democratic lines which fully guarantees human rights." He defines "the original size of the territory of Kokang self-administered zone as an area composed of the (Wetmauk) and (Kongtha) townships, which existed under the old constitution." He then discusses the principles for determining the status of a self-administered division and self-administered zone. He proposes that, like Kachins, who already have their own state, other national races should have their self-administered division or zone in other states and regions and that national races like Kokang, Wa, Pa-o, Mro or Khami, Palaung, Lihso, Naga, Lahu, and Akhar should be entitled to a self-administered division or self- administered zone. Continuing, he proposes that "the constitution includes a provision to recognize the peacekeeping force [nyein-chan-ye tat-phwe] as a legitimate people's armed peacekeeping force in order to provide national security, security of a respective self- administered division or self-administered zone, protection of the life and property of the people, and protection for the democratic system." Next, the proposal paper of the Mro or Khami National Solidarity Organization is read by its representative, U Tha Pan Aung, of Rakhine State's, Buthidaung Township. He points out the weakness of the 1947 Constitution, which contains divisive provisions for national races. Continuing, he expresses the belief that the granting of a self- administered zone or self-administered division should not be based on population and territory alone, but also based on the historical background of the races concerned. He explains that Mro or Khami nationals live in the northern part of Rakhine State and some areas of the Chin Hills. He says the Mro or Khami would like to live collectively in an area as they have done in the past. Therefore, he proposes an area consisting of some townships because of threats from insurgents. The population of Lihso is estimated to be about 70,000 and most of the Lihso -- about 40,000 -- live around the Namhkam-Kutkai mountain range. He asks the alternate chairman to consider whether the Lihso living in Namhkam-Kutkai area are entitled to self-administered zone status and to consider the alternative if the group is not entitled to the status. He says his group is prepared to abide by the decision of the national convention. He admits he cannot say whether his presentations are relevant to the chapter on state structure and asks the national convention to either put them on record or insert them under an appropriate chapter heading. Next, special invitee delegate U Myint Lwin alias U Wan Twetar from Kutkai Township, representing the Lun nationals from Northeastern Burma, presents his proposal. He explains the loyalty of the Lun ethnic group to the country and proposes that the "Lun national race be added to the list of national races when the constitution is promulgated". He says he is prepared to be abide by the decision of the National Convention. Next, U Tun Yi, general secretary of the National Unity Party, presents his party's report, which suggests: "1. Myanmar is a sovereign independent democratic republic; 2. the state shall be called the Republic of the Union of Myanmar; 3. the Republic of the Union of Myanmar is a nation where leaders of national races with equal status have lived eternally in harmony and unity; 4. the sovereign power of the state stems from the citizens and reside in the entire country; 5. the legislative, administrative, and judicial powers which stem from the citizens and the central organs of state power which represent the citizens and which are established in accordance with the constitution are to exercise these powers according to law. Civil service organizations or a single civil service personnel delegated by the central organs of state power shall be able to legally utilize these powers;" "6. the territory of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar shall be the land, sea, and airspace which constitute its territory on the day the constitution is adopted." Next, U Khin Maung, member of the Central Executive Committee of the National Unity Party [NUP], continues reading the NUP report. He says the status of self-administered divisions and self-administered zones should be given if the following requirements are met: "A. a national race which has not obtained the status of region or state; B. an appropriate size of population; C. a collective inhabitation in a congruous territory; D. having a territory which includes existing townships that can be formed into at least two districts."

Addressing the issue of head of state, he proposes that the electoral college for electing the president and two vice presidents be composed of all members from the two chambers of Parliament.
