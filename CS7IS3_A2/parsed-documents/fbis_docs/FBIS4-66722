FBIS4-66722 "jpnea025___94035" JPRS-NEA-94-025 JPRS Near East & South Asia 21 April 1994 SOUTH ASIA IRAN Bill on Judiciary Eliminates Revolution Courts Bill on Judiciary Eliminates Revolution Courts 94LA0142A London KEYHAN in Persian 21 Apr 94 p 1 94LA0142A London KEYHAN Persian CSO [Text] The current revolutionary courts throughout the country will be dissolved and then these courts will be formed anew where necessary, at the discretion of the chief of the judiciary. According to a bill that has been approved by the Majles and has become law, dealing with charges such as threatening the nation's domestic and foreign security, warring with God's representatives or corruption on the earth, insulting the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, armed activities and assassinations, destruction of institutions for the purpose of opposing the government, spying for foreigners and crimes related to smuggling and narcotics, will be handled by the revolution courts. The verdicts by the revolution courts are final except in cases involving execution and stoning to death, Islamic penalties, personal vengeance, confiscation of assets, and blood money in excess of one-fifth of the full blood price. The convicted person can request an appeal, and in this case the judicial proceedings will be turned over to the appeal courts, which will convene in the province centers. Under this law, the general courts must replace all the various existing courts and they will have the jurisdiction to hear penal, civil and nonlitigious cases (nonlitigious cases are matters such as appointing guardians for minors and other such things, where the issuance of a verdict will not harm or benefit anyone). The chief of the judiciary, whose prerogatives have increased under this law, is required within no more than five years of the law's effective date gradually to form the general courts and revolution courts and to create conditions for this law's implementation throughout the country. From the time of the formation of the general and revolution courts in each judicial precinct, all conflicting laws and regulation in those precincts are void. Several days before this bill was approved in the Majles, Shushtari, the minister of justice, discussed the "great changes facing Iran's judicial apparatus." He said that all the nation's judges must prepare themselves to implement this law. He said: It took 12 years to prepare this bill. An informed legislative source who did not want his name disclosed, said: If properly implemented, this law will probably eliminate some of the confusion that now exists in Iran's judicial apparatus. He also mentioned the right to request an appeal on heavy sentences such as execution, stoning and personal vengeance. Although these can be positive steps, the existence of sentences such as stoning to death and confiscation of assets shows the reactionary and worn-out essence of the nation's judicial apparatus. According to him, "warring against God's representatives and corruption on the earth" are cases where there is no specific accusation, just as putting the crime of insulting the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran on the same level with endangering national security also shows the oppressive essence of the Islamic regime. He said: One must wait to see if courts such as the special clerical court, the military court, the religiously prohibited crimes court and others will be dissolved or not.
