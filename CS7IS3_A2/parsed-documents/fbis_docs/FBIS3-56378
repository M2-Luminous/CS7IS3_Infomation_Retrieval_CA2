Is U.S. President Bill Clinton Prepared To Share It with the Russian People?"] [Text] Moscow -- If we take a look at the outward aspect of the visit, it was arranged in the best traditions of "warm hat and suit" diplomacy. The "walkabout" included some curious details: The U.S. President looked in at a store which sells, in addition to fish and meat, the widely advertised U.S. slimming products called Ultra Slim Fast, which fact usually perplexes quick-witted foreigners -- if the Russians do not have enough money for food, are they really prepared to shell it out on dietetic substitutes? In the bakery, which the inquisitive guest from across the ocean also visited, a mass of people were standing in line for bread. Clinton pulled rubles from his pocket and asked for a long white loaf. But his political flexibility is evidently complemented by an equally quick personal reaction, for he unhesitatingly took the saleswoman's advice: "Take the black bread, it is fresher." Moscow was the only stop on Bill Clinton's current tour where he dispensed with impromptu gastronomic shows. In Brussels there was a visit to a cafe, and in Prague a portion of schnitzel with a glass of beer in a small restaurant, while in our country he had to make do with supper at "Ogarevo," where the Yeltsins served caviar, pickled mushrooms, elk meat, and suckling pig around the family table. As for political delicacies, these too were provided for in the program of the visit. Reformers of various kinds were invited to meet with the President for the first time. Let us leave without comment the statement by Mr. Zhirinovskiy, who was not invited to Spaso House: "He is a coward. He is afraid of me." On the other hand, the appearance of 25-year-old banker Maksim Travkin, who was taken to be the representative of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, at the lofty gathering did not go unnoticed. Nor was it a coincidence that Anthony Lake, adviser to the U.S. President for national security affairs, spent a whole half-hour talking with Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Communists. Finally, even after the visit to Moscow, Boris Yeltsin's policy of reforms, which the U.S. President supported publicly and fervently, should be expected to have a big question mark over it with many people in America -- congressmen, scientists, and experts. At the final news conference one of the U.S. journalists asked Boris Yeltsin: Maybe the "shock" therapy ought to be eased somewhat, mindful of the high price the people of Russia are paying for this? "No," the president replied curtly. There will be no indulgence. He implied that even the loss of public support in the last elections will not turn the Kremlin away from tough measures. This statement by the Russian president was at once publicly applauded by the U.S. consultant and adviser Jeffrey Sachs, who believes that it certainly is not the "shock therapy" but panic that is to blame for the calamitous situation in the Russian economy. When the panic ends, economic stabilization will supposedly begin. But Professor S. Cohen, the well-known political scientist, thinks differently. "I do not know how to describe what B. Yeltsin's government has been doing in the economic sphere since 1992 -- 'shock therapy' or something foolish," Cohen said on strolling around Tishinskiy Market with a CBS-TV presenter. "For the people we see hear this policy has meant the loss of all their life savings and a disastrous drop in living standards. I am afraid that President Clinton has not discerned the real Russia in the time he has spent in Moscow. The real Russia today is more like this flea market." Let us stay silent on the flea market, but it is correct that our political leapfrogging is a kind of "shock therapy" for Washington.
