L. 99&hyph;499, in connection with the Ninth Avenue Dump Site (``the Facility'') by execution of a CERCLA de minimis waste contributor Administrative Order on Consent (``AOC'') prepared pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9622(g). The key terms and conditions of the AOC may be briefly summarized as follows: (1) IGT would agree to a settlement amount of $1,019,723.53, U.S. EPA would credit IGT for $340,863.00 for the amount already contributed by IGT toward the cleanup of the Facility, and, accordingly, IGT would pay $678,860.53 to the Hazardous Substance Superfund; (2) U.S. EPA would covenant not to sue IGT for ``covered matters'' which are defined as any and all civil liability in connection with the Facility for reimbursement of response costs or for injunctive relief pursuant to CERCLA Sections 106 and 107 and RCRA Section 7003; (3) IGT would agree to the following reservations of rights and reopeners (i.e., limitations on the covenant not to sue) by U.S. EPA_(a) U.S. EPA could sue IGT for failure to make a payment required by the AOC and/or in connection with any matter not expressly included in ``covered matters'', (b) the covenant not to sue becomes null and void if (i) U.S. EPA discovers that IGT contributed more than 400,000 gallons or 1.2% of the estimated total volume of hazardous substances at the Facility, (ii) U.S. EPA discovers that IGT's waste contributions contribute disproportionately to the toxic or other hazardous effects of the hazardous substances at the Facility, or (iii) IGT fails to make a payment required by the AOC. dates: Comments on the proposed AOC must be received by U.S. EPA on February 25, 1994. addresses: A copy of the proposed AOC is available for review at U.S. EPA, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. Please contact Bernie Schorle at (312) 886&hyph;4746, Michael Berman at (312) 886&hyph;6837, or Mike Anastasio at (312) 886&hyph;7951, prior to visiting the Region 5 office. Comments on the proposed AOC should be addressed to Michael R. Berman and Mike Anastasio, Office of Regional Counsel, U.S. EPA, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard (Mail Code CS&hyph;3T), Chicago, Illinois 60604. for further information contact: Michael Berman at (312) 886&hyph;6837, or Mike Anastasio at (312) 886&hyph;7951, of the U.S. EPA Region 5 Office of Regional Counsel. supplementary information: The Facility is located in Gary, Indiana, and was operated as a hazardous waste storage facility until the mid-1970s. Consequently, in 1983, the Facility was placed on the National Priority List. On December 7, 1988, U.S. EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order (``UAO'') pursuant to Section 106(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9606(a), to the Facility operator and other Potentially Responsible Parties (``PRPs'') for the performance of a Phase I Operable Unit, or interim, remedy. The Phase I Operable Unit remedy included construction of a slurry wall around the contaminated portion of the Facility, extraction of contaminated oil floating on surface groundwater, and storage of the oil at the Facility until implementation of the final remedy. In May, 1992, Phase I Operable Unit Remedial Action construction activities were completed. Phase I Operation and Maintenance activities are ongoing. In March, 1989, U.S. EPA proposed a final remedial action plan. After considering the public comments which it received, U.S. EPA selected a final, or Phase II Operable Unit, remedy for the Facility. On August 17, 1989, U.S. EPA issued a second UAO pursuant to Section 106(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9606(a), to PRPs for performance of the Phase II Operable Unit remedy. The Phase II Operable Unit remedy provides for excavation of contaminated waste and fill; removal of contaminated sediment and debris from surface water bodies; treatment of excavated waste, fill and highly contaminated sediments; back-filling of the excavated area, installation of a RCRA Subtitle C cap; and extraction, treatment and reinjection of contaminated groundwater. Phase II Operable Unit remediation activities are ongoing. In 1991, a de minimis settlement was entered into between U.S. EPA and 86 PRPs associated with the Facility. IGT was not provided an opportunity to participate in the 1991 de minimis settlement because the waste-in volumetric ranking at that time allocated to IGT a waste-in estimate that did not meet the de minimis cutoff for that settlement. However, during the public comment period for the 1991 de minimis settlement, IGT submitted comments arguing that it qualified for de minimis eligibility. In response to IGT's comments, U.S. EPA stated that ``the Agency has not foreclosed the possibility of an additional settlement, should one be warranted, to include such parties at IGT.'' Since that time, U.S. EPA has received sufficient information to make an appropriate determination, pursuant to Section 122(g) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(g), and all relevant U.S. EPA policy and guidance documents, that IGT is eligible for a de minimis settlement under the terms embodied in the AOC and in light of all the presently known facts and circumstances involving the Facility. A 30-day period, commencing on the date of publication of this notice, is open pursuant to Section 122(i) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(i), for comments on the proposed AOC. Comments should be sent to the addressees identified in this notice. William H. Sanders II, Acting Regional Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5.
