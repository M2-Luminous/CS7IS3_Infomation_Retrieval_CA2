FR940930-0-00052 FR940930-0-00009 Section 900.2 (21 CFR 900.2) of the December 21, 1993, interim rule (58 FR 67558 at 67563) defines essential terms used throughout the interim rules. These definitions are intended to inform mammography facilities and consumers of the meaning of terminology used throughout the MQSA regulations. This interim rule amends and modifies certain terms defined in ยง900.2. In determining which facilities would be subject to the standards under the MQSA, Congress defined the term ``facility'' to include a hospital, outpatient department, clinic, radiology practice, or mobile unit, an office of a physician, or other facility, as determined by the Secretary, and, by delegation, FDA, that conducts breast cancer screening or diagnosis through mammography activities. The term does not include a facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Congress further defined mammography ``activities'' to include the operation of equipment to produce a mammogram, the processing of film, the initial interpretation of the mammogram, and the (maintenance of) viewing conditions for that interpretation. However, Congress recognized that a mammogram may be performed in a place that is different from the facility that processes or interprets the x-ray film. In such a case, the MQSA requires the facility performing the mammogram to be responsible for meeting the MQSA quality standards. Under this interim rule, FDA is amending the definition of ``facility'' under ยง900.2 to clarify that it is the facility performing the mammogram that is responsible for obtaining accreditation by an FDA-approved accrediting body and certification by FDA to provide mammography services legally after October 1, 1994. The facility performing the mammogram must substantiate that the additional mammography activities of processing the x-ray film, interpreting the image, and maintaining viewing conditions, wherever performed, meet all quality standards required under the MQSA. Facilities that provide only partial services (e.g., film processing companies or interpreting radiologists) are not required at this time to apply for accreditation or certification under MQSA, although these partial providers will have to meet MQSA standards in order to be employed by any facility that performs mammograms. In the future, FDA may require facilities that perform any portion of the process required for a mammography evaluation to be directly subject to the accreditation and certification process. In addition, although the MQSA excludes facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from the scope of the legislation, VA is working to establish standards consistent with this legislation. All other facilities that conduct the following screening or diagnostic mammography activities are subject to the standards issued under the MQSA.
