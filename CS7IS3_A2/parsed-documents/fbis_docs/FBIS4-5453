Bank of Thailand spokesman Phisit Li-atham said yesterday that American industrialists claimed that Thai manufacturers of textile and yarn products obtained subsidies from the Government, enabling them to sell the goods in American markets at low prices. They asked the American authorities to impose anti-dumping duties on Thai products. However, the Thais deny the claim. To improve Thai exporters' position in the battle, the Bank of Thailand will suspend providing credit for them in the form of promissory note discounts. Dr Phisit said the suspension would not affect the exporters as no major companies needed such credits. Only small exporters that borrow from the central bank through commercial bank channels were affected.
