The Air Force is the only branch of the service where changes are practically defined. General Baptista Pereira, who was its inspector general for the last five years, will leave midmonth for the Azores to assume the command of that autonomous region, replacing Admiral Malheiro Garcia. Baptista Pereira's departure will make possible a promotion in the generals' ranks. According to available information, Brigadier General Vasques Osorio will be chosen by the Air Force Superior Council to receive a third star. To replace Baptista Pereira, General Mendes Dias will reportedly appoint Evandro do Amaral, presently in charge of the Air Force Logistic-Administrative Command (CLAFA). This appointment stems from the fact that Evandro is one of the generals with the most seniority, a prerequisite for occupying the third-highest position within the Air Force. With Evandro do Amaral's appointment as inspector general, the problem of his replacement arises. According to our sources, Sergio Carrilho is best placed to become CLAFA chief, even if the final decision has not yet been made. In fact, Carrilho has an excellent technical preparation for the post. Secondly, Mendes Dias's options are limited if he does not wish to cause a veritable revolution in the top leadership, for the following reasons: General Alvarenga Santos, presently deputy CEMFGA in charge of operations, has already been named to head the Portuguese military mission to NATO, and is thus out of the running. So is Aleixo Corbal, in charge of Air Force personnel, since he is a past CLAFA chief. Another possibility would be Vaz Afonso. However, this general has been director of the Air Force Institute for Higher Studies for less than a year and could not be transferred again. Under these circumstances, Sergio Carrilho appears to be the best solution, all the more so because the issue of his own replacement as head of the Air Force Operational Command (COFA) -- one of the best posts in this branch of the service -- is easy to solve. Brig. Gen. Vasques Osorio, who should get his third star with the departure of Baptista Pereira, would be a natural replacement for Sergio Carrilho. As far as the Navy is concerned, important changes are expected during the course of this month, first because it has lacked a general staff chief, and second because there are four vice admiral positions waiting to be filled. Until yesterday afternoon, the government had not decided which of three officers (Machado da Silva, Ribeiro Pacheco, and Carmo Duro) will succeed Fuzeta da Ponte as Navy chief. According to our sources, the decision will be made next week. Meanwhile, Admiral Machado da Silva, deputy chief of the Navy general staff, is reportedly out of the running, the reason being the rather inflexible image he projects. Above all a military man, Machado da Silva has great difficulty adapting himself to the political game that the relationship between military chiefs and the Ministry of Defense represents. A factor that may influence the government's choice is Adm. Fuzeta da Ponte's opinion. As principal adviser to Minister of Defense Fernando Nogueira, Fuzeta reportedly has expressed a preference for Carmo Duro. [passage omitted] However, despite Carmo Duro's strong support within and without the Navy, his appointment may cause important changes that do not figure in the government's plans. According to information, if Carmo Duro becomes the next Navy general staff chief, four promotions to vice admiral rank ought to take place, a figure considered excessive at a time when the Ministry of Defense's slogan is "redimensioning." Finally, the Army is also preparing for important changes. The Army Superior Council met for a whole day to advise Cerqueira Rocha about the general he should indicate to Fuzeta da Ponte for the presidency of the Supreme Military Tribunal. Joao Almeida Bruno was the name that attracted the largest consensus. With regard to other appointments, it seems increasingly certain that General Espirito Santo, present chief of the Portuguese mission to NATO, will take over the Army's operational command.
