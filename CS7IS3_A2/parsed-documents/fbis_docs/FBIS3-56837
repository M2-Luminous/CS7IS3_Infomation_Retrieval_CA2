The law establishes the legal status of the country's medical institutions and the basis of financing of the health care system. The law defines medical aid as the activity of doctors with a higher medical education to protect people's health, prolong their lives and improve the quality of life. Medical aid is arranged on three levels: general and specialized aid at the local government level and specialized medical aid on the national level. A national Health Care Council is to be set up under the government. General administration and supervision of health care will be placed in the hands of the Social Affairs Ministry. County medical officers are going to shape the state's health care policy on the regional level. They will be appointed for a term of five years by county elders, who coordinate the nomination with the Social Affairs Ministry. The law on the health care system takes effect on Feb. 15. The legislators amended the law on the relation between the local and the state budgets, and continued the second reading of the surveillance bill. Also Jaan Luik, a member of the State Court, was sworn in.
