As this developed, the Cotabato City Peace and Order Council (CCPOC) had urged higher authorities to investigate on the alleged involvement of some policemen and military personnel in the spate of the "unabated" kidnappings here since 1990. Reports reaching here said, in Marawi City, authorities on Wednesday received a letter purportedly coming from the abductors of Arceo Cruz, 66, who was snatched last 29 March by armed men in his cottage at the Ayala Resort, a hotel located inside the 2,500 hectare MSU campus. The letter, written in an MILF official stationery, stated a P50 million [Philippine pesos] ransom demand in exchange for the freedom of Cruz, who is supervising the implementation of a road project linking two towns in Lanao del Sur. Among those who signed the same letter were known criminals facing warrants of arrest: Commander Dimas, the group's leader; Sulaiman Marohombsar; Ibra "Brix" Cabugatan; Omar Usman; Linog Sultan; Michael Capal; Saide Caya, and Commander Mujahid. The kidnappers also included in their demands the implementation of regular infrastructure projects under the 1993 "seed money" of the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao [ARMM]; a performance audit of the ARMM particularly in Lanao del Sur; the "enforcement" of a standing truce between the government and Moro rebels; and the placement of qualified Muslims in the government. Police reports said the letter was personally handed by Assemblyman Benasing Macarambon of ARMM to Brig. Gen. Samuel Dunque, chief of the Army's 102d Brigade in Marawi City. It was not however, specified how Macarambon got hold of the ransom letter. Cruz is believed kept by his captors at Unayan area, a remote place bordering the towns of Ganasi, Malabang, and Kalanugas, all in Lanao del Sur's 2d district. "Even if we sell our souls together, still we cannot raise the P50 million," said Ernesto Chinjen, 55, brother-in-law of Cruz, who he said was not even a well-known contractor until the time of his abduction. "We cannot do something either with their (kidnappers) political demands," he said. "Only the national leaders and the ARMM authorities can do something about it." Mayor Macacna Pangandaman, who is among those negotiating for the safe release of Cruz, said the kidnappers' demand is equivalent to the total cost of the road project the victim was constructing. Chief Supt. Mangigin Magomnang, ARMM regional police director, said the police and the military have issued instructions not to give the kidnappers anything as it would set a bad precedent and would encourage more kidnappings in the area.
