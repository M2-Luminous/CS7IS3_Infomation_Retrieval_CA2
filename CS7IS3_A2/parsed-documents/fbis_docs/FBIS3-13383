Replying to a message from the Russian leader, 'Arafat said he accepted Yeltsin's invitation for "detailed" discussions on bilateral ties and Russia's contribution to implementing Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories. The official Palestinian news agency WAFA quoted 'Arafat as saying he was confident that Russia, a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process with the United States, would continue to work for implementation of the Israeli-PLO autonomy deal "in the time scale set by the accord", signed in Washington last September. Yeltsin's message was conveyed to 'Arafat on Friday by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 'Arafat praised Yeltsin's "interest" in getting the peace talks back on track, and the Russian Government's moves to get a UN Security Council resolution adopted "which responds effectively to Palestinian demands." [passage omitted] 'Arafat thanked the Russian Government for its "important" efforts aimed at "preventing an escalation of violence in the occupied territories," and said he was "very satisfied with the friendly and sincere" PLO-Russian dialogue. Besides Kozyrev, two Russian special envoys have visited PLO headquarters in Tunis in the past two weeks in a Russian diplomatic offensive to revive the peace talks. The US State Department's Middle East coordinator, Dennis Ross, will hold talks with 'Arafat in Tunis on Monday and travel to Israel on Tuesday. 'Arafat aide Bassam Abu-Sharif said the Ross-Arafat meeting would also be attended by a Russian envoy.
