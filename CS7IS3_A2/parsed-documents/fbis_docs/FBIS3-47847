A relevant government official on 16 January said that "the United States supported making the Joint Declaration on Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula an international treaty which will ensure that the nuclear states assign obligation to North and South Korea for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and in return for this, they will supply on a stable basis nuclear materials required for the development of atomic energy." This official said: The Joint Declaration on Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, which was signed on 31 December 1991 and effectuated in February 1992, stipulates that North and South Korea shall not possess nuclear reprocessing facilities. However, since North Korea did not comply with it, and in the event that its content is revised according to an agreement reached by the North and the South, there is a possibility for both sides to possess nuclear reprocessing facilities. It is likely that the United States is concerned with this situation. It was learned that the government has not decided on the policy up to date to cope with such a proposal by the United States. The U.S. proposal directly contradicts the allegation of some national assemblymen and scientists who call for recovery of nuclear sovereignty by possessing nuclear reprocessing facilities with peaceful purposes. As a result, heated controversy will likely be touched off in the future. The incumbent Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] prescribes that one is allowed to possess a nuclear reprocessing facility but should declare the quantity and purpose of plutonium extracted from it, and this quantity and purpose are subject to inspection and supervision. Therefore, an expert pointed out that the demand that North and South Korea turn their declaration into an international treaty which does not allow them to possess a nuclear reprocessing facility itself, contradicts the principle of international laws. He assumed that this proposal was prompted by the fact that suspicion of North Korea's development of nuclear weapons has become an international issue. At present, there is no international treaty, other than the NPT, which restricts a certain state or district from nuclear development. Another government official stated that "in the event that the declaration on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is turned into an international treaty, it will be greatly helpful to complete the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue and to win trust from international society concerning the nuclear policies of North and South Korea." He added: However, even if we want to possess nuclear facilities after the North Korean nuclear issue is completely resolved and the trust of the international community in nuclear policies of the North and South is built with the declaration turned to into an international treaty, we should have consent from nuclear states. Therefore, this proposal would be, in actuality, impossible.
