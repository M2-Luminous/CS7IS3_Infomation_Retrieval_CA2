Ariwibowo told the press after a meeting with President Suharto here on Saturday that the country's textile and textile product exports for all of last year were valued at 5.8995 billion US dollars, an increase of 0.01 percent from the previous year's figure. Compared with other export commodities such as wood and rubber, of which exports increased by 37 percent and 148 percent respectively, the growth rate of textile and textile product exports was very low, the minister said. The oversupply of products had caused consumers to buy products which had been already stored at warehouses as merchandise, leading to slow trade in new products, he said. He also attributed the slow growth rate of Indonesia's textile and textile product exports to the entry of China's textile to the United States, the appreciation of Japanese yen against the US dollars besides the emergency of new textile exporting countries. To boost the growth rate of textile and textile product exports, which currently become one of the prime foreign exchange earners, the government and textile producers should take various steps, including making immediate adjustments to new developments occurring in the world market. Tunky also reported to the head of state on the development of domestic electronic industries. According to the minister, the export of electronic goods in 1993 reached a record high of 1.1 billion US dollars but the import of electronic components increased to 800 million US dollars in the same year. The electronic components included cathode ray tubes, special components of radios and tape recorders as well as capacitors, he said. He said the government should encourage foreign electronic component manufacturers to relocate their plants in Indonesia as part of efforts to keep down the import of electronic components. The relocation of the electronic component industries in Indonesia would be successful if their products were bought by export-oriented companies, he said.
