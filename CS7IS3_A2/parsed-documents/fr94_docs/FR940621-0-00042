FR940621-0-00042 FR940621-0-00017 Regulatory Flexibility Determination The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened by government regulations. The FRA requires agencies to review rules that may have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, establishes small entity size and cost level thresholds for complying with RFA review requirements in FAA rulemaking actions. The small entities potentially affected by the rule are Part 121, Part 125, and Part 135 operators that own nine or fewer aircraft, which is the size threshold for aircraft operators considered small entities by the FAA. The annual cost thresholds are $119,500 for operators of scheduled services with entire fleets having a seating capacity of over 60; $66,800 for other scheduled operators; and $4,700 for unscheduled operators. A substantial number of small entities is a number which is not less than eleven and which is more than one-third of the small entities subject to the rule. The only type of entity with the potential to sustain a significant economic impact as a result of this rule is an unscheduled operator. Such an operator would have to purchase at least ten ELT's in a year in order to exceed the $4,700 threshold. The rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small unscheduled operators because most such operators own five or fewer airplanes each, and it is unlikely that at least 11 of them representing more than one-third of the total will purchase ten new ELT's in any given year. International Trade Impact Statement The rule will have little or no impact on trade for either U.S. firms doing business in foreign countries or foreign firms doing business in the United States. Foreign air carriers are prohibited from operating between points within the United States. Therefore, they will not gain any competitive advantage over U.S. carriers. In international operations, foreign air carriers are not expected to realize any cost advantage over U.S. carriers because the differential in costs between the existing and new ELT rule will not be significant enough to have an adverse impact on the international operations of U.S. carriers. Further, general aviation operations conducted in the United States are not in any direct competition with foreign enterprises. For these reasons, the FAA does not expect that the rule will result in any international trade impact. Federalism Implications The regulations herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Conclusion The FAA has determined that the potential benefits of the regulation outweigh its potential costs and that it is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. In addition, this rule will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This rule is considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979) because it concerns a matter of substantial public interest. A regulatory evaluation of the rule, including a Regulatory Flexibility Determination and an International Trade Impact Analysis, has been placed in the docket.
