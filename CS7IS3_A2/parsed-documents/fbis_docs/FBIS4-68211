Sergeyev, candidate of military sciences] [Text] Changes in the world military-political situation which began in the mid-1980's forced the U.S. leadership to revise its views on problems of the country's national security on the threshold of the 21st century. Since 1946, the day of the well-known speech by W. Churchill in Fulton (USA), the principal threat to U.S. national security was considered to be the Soviet Union, the only state in the world which could threaten the existence of western civilization. But disintegration of the USSR and of the Warsaw Pact Organization on the one hand and the rapid buildup of military potential of individual third world countries on the other led to a change in the correlation of forces in the international arena. In the assessment of U.S. political scientists, development of the world community up to the end of the 1990's will be characterized by growing political instability, serious economic shocks and an increasing number of states possessing a significant military potential. With consideration of the continuing process of proliferation of modern types of arms, including mass destruction weapons, all this creates a potential threat to U.S. security. The likelihood that the U.S. Armed Forces will be forced to defend the country's interests by arms remains high, in the assertion of Pentagon specialists, but the time and methods of their use will undergo significant changes in the future. In the situation at hand U.S. foreign policy pursues the following goals: assist in spreading freedom and democracy (as the Americans themselves understand it), ensure stability of the country's economic development (for which a need arises to protect very important sources of strategic resources and lines of communication), fulfill allied obligations, exert direct influence on development of the situation in unstable regions in U.S. interests, prevent a strengthening of unfriendly regimes, oppose proliferation of mass destruction weapons, and fight international terrorism and the drug trade. These provisions became the basis of new concepts of organizational development and employment of branches of the U.S. Armed Forces; development of the concepts were begun by appropriate ministries and staffs in the late 1980's. The Air Force was first to advance a new concept for its development, called "global reach-global power." It was submitted to Congress in February 1991 as an annex to a Secretary of the Air Force report on the draft budget for fiscal years 1992-1993. Basic provisions of U.S. national security strategy are formulated in the first part of the document. In determining the role and place of armed forces in ensuring national security, the U.S. administration proceeded from the following theses: - on a global scale the United States will continue to play a key role in the world to retain control over areas of its "vital interests" at any point on the planet; - Europe will continue to be a vitally important region and, despite a reduction in numerical strength of the U.S. Armed Forces grouping, ensuring European security (strengthening NATO, supporting ideas of the Conference on Security and Cooperation) will remain as before the principal task of the United States in this zone; - as the importance of the Asiatic-Pacific region grows, the sphere of U.S. "vital interests" is expanding and the threat on the part of traditional enemies is diminishing: - in the Persian Gulf U.S. interests remain the same--support friendly states and prevent any foreign power from establishing control over oil resources and lines of communication. Independently of the correlation of forces taking shape in the international arena, it is planned to carry on U.S. Armed Forces organizational development in the future as well guided by principles of a reasonable combination of offensive and defensive capabilities. The following remain fundamental military policy provisions: strategic deterrence and defense, forward presence, immediate reaction to crisis situations, and capability of quickly building up military might to the necessary level. These provisions served as the basis for the second and main part of the concept, which examines main directions of Air Force organizational development and methods of its employment at the end of the current century and beginning of the next century. The Pentagon leadership believes the Air Force has the necessary personnel and assets for performing missions in military conflicts of any scale and intensity. It is characterized by a long operating range, flexibility, operational efficiency, accuracy in delivering strikes and high offensive potential of weapon systems. In planning organizational development of this branch of the Armed Forces, the U.S. Air Force command attempts to achieve the following goals: provide capabilities for conducting combat operations in any TVD [theater of military operations], organize airlifts of troops and cargoes in a short time on a global scale, and achieve aerospace superiority. For this it is deemed necessary to develop nuclear forces; strategic, tactical, military transport and tanker aviation; and space-based forces and assets. Provide capabilities for conducting combat operations in a TVD. Questions of organizational development of Air Force general purpose forces hold an important place and are examined in greater detail with consideration of possible options of their employment both in peace as well as wartime. The concept assumes that in peacetime regions will remain such as the European Theater of War, where a potential need is preserved for conducting large-scale combat operations for a lengthy time, but the likelihood of initiation of war here has a tendency to drop. Meanwhile, there was a sharp increase in the likelihood of the appearance of a threat to U.S. interests from individual states located a considerable distance from the main TVD's. Pentagon representatives believe that military force will be used in local conflicts primarily in the form of brief, purposeful, effective operations. In the course of battles the U.S. Armed Forces must react quickly and adequately to actions of a well equipped and well trained enemy, deliver powerful strikes and win victory in compressed time periods. The Air Force has those capabilities to the full extent. The capability of promptly concentrating necessary forces and assets in remote areas of the globe and the flexibility and operational efficiency inherent to Air Force elements permit the command to deliver strikes against the most important elements of the enemy military and military-economic potential in very short time periods. The flight range of combat aircraft is such that it enables them to operate at a considerable distance from base airfields. Flexibility of employing Air Force elements permits reacting promptly to a change in the situation and influencing a situation created in a given region. The time aircraft are present in the enemy air defense weapon impact zone and the time of performing the combat mission as a whole are reduced because of high flight speed. In the opinion of western military specialists, the nature of combat operations by air groupings deployed in a TVD will undergo no substantial changes. They will perform all primary missions in the course of independent air operations and operations together with ground troops and naval forces: winning air superiority, giving close air support to troops, isolating the battlefield and combat operations area, and conducting aerial reconnaissance. Forces and assets assigned for this will be determined by specific conditions. At the same time, as the concept notes for the first time, in a number of cases aviation will independently perform such missions as neutralizing the enemy or depriving him of the capability to resist, and disrupting the cohesiveness of his troop operations, which may have a deciding influence on the course of a conflict. The 1991 Persian Gulf war is an example of this. The document emphasizes that although joint efforts of all branches of armed forces unquestionably are needed, judging from practice of recent years it is most often the Air Force that places the most combat ready force elements with a large radius of action at the disposal of the country's leadership. Aviation is capable of delivering weapons and destroying primary targets in any region. The Air Force role in protecting U.S. interests outside the country may grow even more in the future. Having considerable capabilities for destroying targets, strategic aviation can deliver a strike at any point on the globe in compressed time periods. Thus, during Exercise Bright Star-83, B-52 strategic bombers which took off from airfields in the continental United States delivered a strike with conventional munitions against targets on a range in Egypt, after which they returned to departure bases without an intermediate landing. U.S. military specialists assume that measures similar to Operation Eldorado Canyon (delivery of the strike against Libya in 1986) can be carried out by lesser forces and assets, but forward air bases or permission to fly through the air space of other states are necessary for this. In the opinion of the Air Force command, strategic bombers with conventional weapons can be brought in in the first hours (days) of a conflict to deliver a strike against vital targets. In this case the material costs turn out to be less than in realizing other options of armed intervention. In subsequent combat operations they can be used for mass bombings of troops in concentration areas, on forward movement routes, and against air and naval bases and infrastructure facilities. Their capability for performing combat missions at night and in adverse weather conditions permits the command element to organize continuous fire pressure on the enemy. In connection with the aging of B-52 aircraft, in recent years the Air Force command decided to modify the B-1B heavy bomber to expand its capabilities for employing conventional munitions. The B-1B has a number of advantages over the B-52 (less radar cross-section, greater flight speed, improved electronics) and is capable of performing combat missions more effectively, especially in initial stage of a conflict. The question of using new B-2 bombers (Fig. 1 [figure not reproduced]) developed using stealth technology is being discussed actively at the present time. This aircraft has greater survivability and an increased combat operating radius with the same ordnance payload compared with the B-52 and B-1B. Calculations showed that a B-2 bomber using two air bases (Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean and Andersen on Guam in the Pacific) is capable of delivering a strike with conventional weapons against targets in any part of the globe with one aerial refueling. The U.S. Air Force command considers this aircraft to be a highly effective means of delivering surprise strikes. Autonomous operations in the deep enemy rear are the principal feature of B-2 employment (it is proposed to destroy the maximum number of important strategic targets). Their use will permit significantly increasing surprise in delivering strikes, ensure destruction of any target on enemy territory and ensure continuity of the effect on his principal installations. But the primary role in accomplishing swift, adequate retaliatory operations in conflicts of varying intensity without use of nuclear weapons belongs to tactical aviation. In the opinion of the U.S. command, forward-based tactical air units and subunits providing a constant military presence (Europe, countries of the Asiatic-Pacific region, and the Persian Gulf) have a stabilizing effect on the situation in corresponding regions. Therefore, the planned reduction of air groupings on overseas territories is being carried out by moving subunits equipped with obsolete aircraft models (F-4 and F-111 tactical fighters, A-10 attack aircraft) to the United States. At the same time, it is planned to deploy units and subunits armed with modernized F-15E tactical fighters, and in the future also the newest F-22's (Fig. 2 [figure not reproduced]), in forward zones. Considering the increased likelihood of local armed conflicts being initiated in various regions, the Air Force command began creating composite air wings in accordance with the new concept. Because they include various types of combat and auxiliary aircraft, the composite air wings are capable of rebasing independently and quickly and performing all missions facing a deployed air grouping. Along with combat aircraft, such a subunit may include tanker, military transport, and radar early warning and control aircraft. The multi-option nature of employing tactical aviation outside the country depends to a considerable extent on the presence and preparation of an airfield network in forward zones. In this connection the country's military-political leadership believes that when allied interests are threatened, the requisite number of air bases and forward airfields supporting a redeployment of units and subunits within several hours should be placed at the disposal of the United States. In developing the Air Force organizational development concept, the command element proceeds from the need to preserve (up to the mid-1990's), and in the future also to increase, the firepower of strike aviation with a substantial reduction in its combat force level. Financial restrictions force certain reductions, and the latest changes in the correlation of forces in the international arena and achievements in the development of aircraft weapon systems provide an opportunity for such reductions, above all of tactical aviation (up to 30 percent by 1995-1997). The following basic directions are planned for development of aircraft and weapons in the next few years: An increase in performance characteristics and specifications of aircraft, above all through achievement of "supermaneuverability," use of supersonic cruising speed, and use of economical engines; introduction of automated flight and weapon control systems and equipment; realization of stealth technology to reduce the signature and vulnerability of aircraft and aircraft munitions; achievement of high effectiveness in engagement of airborne and ground targets by aircraft long-range precision guided weapons; development of remotely controlled aircraft for various purposes; expansion in the area of combat application of aircraft (use of upper layers of the atmosphere and hypersonic flight speeds); and development of aerospace aircraft capable of flying in low, near-earth orbits. Realization of research in the area of foremost technology under the Forecast-2 program, which unites basic priority technologies for creation of aircraft weapons and military equipment (39 advanced technologies and 31 new system developments), will be the material basis of the concept in question. Adoption of the latest aircraft (B-2, F-117, F-22, F-15E) outfitted with precision weapons and adoption of low-signature cruise missiles and drones will significantly increase Air Force capabilities, since they will be capable of engaging mobile ballistic missile systems, the main elements of reserve troop groupings in the interior of the country, state and military command and control entities, and very important transportation hubs and power and industrial installations. In other words, the destruction not only of forward groupings of armed forces, but also of deep reserves, disabling of enterprises of leading sectors of industry, and a reduction in the enemy military potential are probable. In addition, this may provide continuity of action of combat aircraft regardless of weather conditions and time of day, which reduces the effectiveness of the air defense system in repelling an air attack and strengthens the psychological effect on the enemy. Joint operations of the Air Force and Navy during which they will reinforce and supplement each other are singled out in particular in the "global reach-global power" concept. According to the command element's calculations, Air Force aviation is capable of substantially assisting the Navy in performing missions of covering ship groupings and protecting sea lines of communication in various areas. Should it be necessary, aircraft carriers in turn should arrive in a conflict area right after tactical aviation force elements in order to build up efforts. Combat capabilities of U.S. Navy ships' air defense forces and assets can be used in organizing defense of territory adjoining the coast, because of which Air Force aircraft can be retargeted to perform other more important missions. Thus, a squadron of B-52 bombers is capable of doubling the strike potential of a carrier force. In the course of combat training, strategic bomber subunits actively perform missions of laying minefields in sea waters and combating enemy ships by use of antiship missiles. In accordance with the new concept, missions are assigned to the U.S. Air Force in the course of special operations both for comprehensive support of those operations as well as for immediate involvement in them. (It is proposed to bring in special-purpose air units and subunits as well as tactical aviation force elements). One goal which is assuming ever greater importance is the fight against illegal drug shipments. The Air Force must assign necessary forces and assets for conducting aerial reconnaissance and surveillance, intercepting airborne targets and isolating areas of drug production. Support of strategic movements of troops and cargoes. The new concept also reflected a change in views on the Air Force role, place and missions in supporting Armed Forces mobility. If one takes into account the scale of the planned reduction in numerical strength of U.S. troops and unpredictable development of the situation in certain areas, support of strategic mobility will be one of the primary Air Force missions. The increased likelihood of local conflicts breaking out in third world countries, which as a rule have a poorly developed infrastructure, places the Air Force command face to face with additional missions in organizing airlifts. Among them is the need to deploy additional command and control systems and communication lines; the provision of navigation and meteorological support as well as logistic support, above all the supply of POL and spare parts. Guided by these provisions, the Air Force command advances the requirement to continue production and procurement of the new C-17 transport intended for replacing the C-141 and capable of operating from poorly equipped airfields, including from those with dirt runways. The second part of the concept ("global power") emphasizes Air Force strike assets (ICBM's, strategic bombers and tactical fighters) and its first part ("global reach") reflects command views on use of tanker aviation. The likelihood of a reduction in the number of U.S. air bases on overseas territories substantially increases the role of tanker aircraft, which are a mandatory, necessary means of supporting operations both of U.S. Air Force combat aviation as well as auxiliary aviation. Aerial refueling of aircraft increases the radius of action of combat aircraft, the flight range of military transport aircraft, and time in the air of air defense fighters, airborne command post aircraft and radar early warning and control aircraft, which contributes to increased effectiveness of U.S. Air Force operations. In addition, some tanker aircraft can be used for refueling Naval Aviation aircraft as well as allied aircraft, thanks to which their capabilities for conducting combat operations increase. It also should be noted that in the organization of troop and cargo airlifts, tanker aircraft will be used to deliver necessary aviation fuel reserves to the conflict area. Use of aerospace for supporting Air Force activity. The document emphasizes that in the future aviation will be used on a global scale day and night in any weather and climatic conditions in delivering strikes continuously against ground, naval and airborne targets. All this will require a qualitatively new approach to supporting aircraft and missile flights. Space reconnaissance, navigation, meteorological support and communications systems can play a special role in supporting aircraft operations. They will support the issue of target designations, battle management, information exchange, and a precise approach to the target area. Technical progress permits realizing such important advantages of space-based systems as global surveillance, relatively low vulnerability, and independence of operations, which can contribute to a significant increase in effectiveness of using aviation forces and assets. Aviation combat support systems supplement capabilities of space systems in following the quickly changing world situation. The AWACS radar early warning and control system as well as the advanced JSTARS, adapted for swift deployment in the most remote parts of the globe, are the principal and sometimes also the only source of information on the enemy in the initial stage of combat operations. Strengthening the security of allies and developing relations with them. The new concept attaches special significance to this area of Air Force activity as a means of achieving national policy goals in a corresponding region. In particular, aircraft deliveries considerably increase combat capabilities of partners' armed forces and give assistance in the area of preparing personnel and logistic support, which helps strengthen and spread U.S. influence and provides for advance deployment of the logistic support system in potential conflict areas. One Brookings Institution study entitled "Strength Without War" draws the conclusion that following the end of World War II the Air Force achieved positive results in various conflicts considerably more often than any other branch of the Armed Forces. Aviation's role will grow constantly in the future with a shift of emphasis to preparation for military operations using conventional weapons and an absence of immediate opposition (contact) of armed forces groupings deployed in peacetime. U.S. Air Force organizational development up to the end of the current century and at the beginning of the next century is to be accomplished in accordance with changes occurring in the world. The Air Force must perform assigned missions to the full extent in any part of the globe in compressed time periods. An analysis of plans and programs for development of the Armed Forces as a whole permits asserting that it is specifically aviation that will conform most fully to basic provisions of the strategy of U.S. involvement in regional conflicts and will become one of the means of fire effect against enemy targets regardless of their location, size, structure, mobility and other characteristics. Specifically these capabilities will be built up so that the Army, Air Force and Navy mutually supplement and reinforce each other. Thus, optimum Armed Forces will be formed to realize U.S. national security strategy.
