Instructions have been issued to the Fatah Hawks. However, these instructions have not been implemented yet because of the Israeli maximum state of alert in anticipation of a painful Palestinian response. Complaining about the weak coordination among the joint commands in the occupied territories, Zaki said Fatah has made no decision to end the armed struggle against the occupation. He complained that the Palestinian factions are vying among themselves for positions in unions or professional federations in the West Bank and Gaza strip, but fail to vie to confront the Israeli occupation. He said competition for positions has exposed many militants. He said Fatah means martyrdom, pride in martyrs, and the inevitability of the masses' victory. [passage omitted]
