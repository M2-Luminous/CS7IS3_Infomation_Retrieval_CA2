Mboweni said yesterday legislation was currently being drafted, but that there was no clarity about when it would be implemented. "I would stress that we're not plotting the downfall of companies -- the legislation will simply provide a framework for effective competition in the South African economy." Mboweni said anti-trust measures existed in most countries, and more so in the developed world. Companies which had suffered from the activities of monopolies and cartels were strongly in favour of the move, he said. "Those who have benefited, obviously aren't." In an interview, Mboweni said he hoped that anti-trust legislation would lead to greater competition domestically as well as internationally and would break up the concentration of economic power. He said there was a long way to go for full black empowerment. Mboweni thought many South African companies were going about affirmative action in "completely the wrong way" and said the ANC had no intention of introducing quotas. "Putting Africans in highly visible positions without giving them authority has inflated the cost of affirmative action." "Many black people are now beyond the reach of some companies and this action has promoted the tendency for black people to `job hop' for the highest salary, rather than for job satisfaction." Mboweni said companies should not lose sight of the fact that affirmative action was not the exclusive domain of one group, but included coloureds, black and white women and the disabled. Mboweni said some consultants had made a killing advising companies on affirmative action -- in most cases wrongly. However, the situation would become clearer once a framework for affirmative action had been legislated, he said. "There will be no quotas, but from now onwards any hiring, promotion or salary structures should be completely free of discrimination and staffing should reflect the demographics of our society." Mboweni said anti-trust legislation was a cornerstone of building the economy, as outlined in the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP). The anti-trust authority would be independent of government, he said. "The British system is based on a separation of powers to give integrity and transparency." Four bodies in Britain formed the competition authorities -- the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) and the Restrictive Practices Court (RPC). "The investigating authority, usually the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), initiates the inquiry, but doesn't make a judgment on the issue. This is done by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) or, in the case of restrictive practices, by the Restrictive Practices Court." However, South African anti-trust legislation would not copy the British system exactly, but would be adapted to suit South African conditions, he said. Unbundling, the corporate community's latest flavour, was not a way to avoid anti-trust, he said. "We also tend to focus strongly on interlocking directorates and pyramid structures." Mboweni said it was hoped that a commission looking into these matters would shortly come up with recommendations. Analysts yesterday said the concentration of economic power in South Africa had evolved over the years, due in part to foreign exchange regulations, the absorption of local interests from disinvesting foreign holding companies, a non-growth closed economy and the lack of a definition of capital gains for tax purposes.
