"It is simply an erroneous analysis, it is not true," Klaus said in the interview broadcast Monday [10 January]. He said this view is being voiced not only in the Czech Republic but often also in other post-communist countries which are slightly envious of the results the Czech Republic has achieved. No dramatic change as regards unemployment and bankrupts would take place, Klaus said, adding that this would be a continual process. "We are naturally expecting a certain increase in unemployment but it will be tenths of a percent, but not ten percent -- the difference between unemployment in the Czech Republic and, for example, in Poland," Klaus said. He expressed satisfaction that U.S. President Bill Clinton would visit Central Europe and especially Prague. "This is an important symbol," Klaus said.
