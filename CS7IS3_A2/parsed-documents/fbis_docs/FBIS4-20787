The Janata Dal member, Mr. Sharad Yadav, today drew the attention of the Government in the Lok Sabha to the crisis caused in the indigenous newsprint industry because of the relaxation in excise duty on foreign newsprint. Raising the issue during zero hour, Mr. Yadav said India needed 5.5 lakh tonnes of newsprint and it was met by indigenous production. Only one lakh tonnes was required from abroad. Because of excise duty cuts, about three lakh tonnes of newsprint had been imported and that had resulted in stockpiling of 40,000 tonnes. Mr. Yadav said that while Rs. 450 crores worth of foreign exchange was being spent the inflow had caused distress among the indigenous mills.
