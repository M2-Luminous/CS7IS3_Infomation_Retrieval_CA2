In an interview with western German radio this morning, Beckstein accused the justice minister of a lack of legal knowledge, stressing that the existing laws cover his action. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger criticized the fact that a simple statement by the Turkish ambassador on the security of deported Kurds should be sufficient. She rejected the deportations as long as it cannot be ruled out that those affected do not face torture or death in Turkey.
