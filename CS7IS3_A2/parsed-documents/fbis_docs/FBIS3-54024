Last week, al-Qadhdhafi again asked to visit Cairo or al-Sallum to remove the misunderstanding between his country and Egypt because of the al-Khikya incident. In his message, al-Qadhdhafi renewed his offer to mediate between Egypt and Sudan and to host an Egyptian-Sudanese summit in Tripoli. The Egyptian information minister told him that the Egyptian and Sudanese foreign ministers are holding contacts to resolve controversial issues between the two countries, and that any future summit depends on the success of the expected meeting between the two foreign ministers. Safwat al-Sharif also informed Libyan officials that the Egyptian Government categorically refuses to deport Libyan opposition activists in Cairo because they have not violated the terms of political asylum granted to them. Libya had proposed that the opposition activists be deported from Cairo to avoid any tension their presence might cause to Egyptian-Libyan relations. Egypt last week refused to welcome the senior Libyan official, al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi, who requested to visit Cairo during his recent presence in Tunis.
