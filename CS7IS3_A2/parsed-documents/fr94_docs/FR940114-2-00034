Since the proceeding in Docket No. FA88&hyph;62&hyph;000 involves various interrelated issues concerning the Company's recovery of reclamation costs through the wholesale fuel clause, the Company also requests the Commission to defer any action on this filing until all issues in that docket are before it.
