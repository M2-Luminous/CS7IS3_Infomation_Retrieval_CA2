He stressed that he had not proposed simultaneous referendums -- he had simply defined the "area in time" in which the Finnish referendum could be arranged. As far as the simultaneous timing of the referendums is concerned, he merely admitted that "it is possible to find reasons for holding a referendum at the same time as the Swedish referendum," but nothing more. Questions on the matter were put by Green Eduskunta deputies Paavo Nikula and Pekka Raty. Nikula pointed out that the president of the Republic had just expressed some very different views about the possibility of simultaneous referendums than those Aho voiced in his interview in LALLI on Wednesday. Briefly Aho had stressed that it is impossible to fix a firm date for the Finnish referendum before the EU has resolved its internal disagreements on institutional matters and before it has become clear when our EU membership agreement can be signed. He had also been speaking against the background of the discussions that have been held on the matter inside the government. And on the basis of these discussion the referendum should be held in the fall "long enough before the Eduskunta election so that we can as it were concentrate separately on this major national issue." Asked about the possibility of holding a referendum at the same time as Sweden's, he had replied that this is a very late date, but it still remains the latest possible date if it is to be possible to hold the referendum without upsetting the Eduskunta elections and the preparations for it. The thrust was therefore that the "area of time" available stretches from early fall to mid-November. Social Democratic Party chairman Paavo Lipponen for his part was strongly critical yesterday in his reaction to Prime Minister Esko Aho's remarks about the possibility of holding simultaneous referendums in the Nordic area. "The prime minister's vague statements about the timing of the EU referendum give rise to doubts about the government's real determination to adhere to the EU timetable," he said. According to Lipponen, Finland must reach an independent decision on its own referendum without bring in Sweden's and Norway's timetables. It is true that it is in Finland's interest that all the Nordic applicants become EU members, but Finland has its own vital interests to consider. That is why Finland cannot tie its own membership to the decisions of the other Nordic countries. "If there is a majority for EU membership in the Finnish referendum Finland will join the EU even if Sweden and Norway were to remain outside," Lipponen said. He also called on the government to stop its dawdling on the EU issue. Once the questions of interpretation have been resolved in a positive manner for Finland the EU agreement should be given its final form without delay and without any further maneuvering. For example, the government should announce without any further delay whether it approves the results negotiated by its own members in the EU membership negotiations.
