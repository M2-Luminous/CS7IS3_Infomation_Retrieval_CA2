At least this applies to their relations with the press. At the Ministry of National Defense, Minister Gheorghe Tinca, for instance, boosted up the press bureau, which is now holding news conferences on a weekly basis. If we also consider the fact that they appointed a young lady whose looks are crushing the male journalists as the ministry's spokesperson, we can see that we are dealing here with an attempt by the diplomat Gheorghe Tinca to seduce the press by all means. Even if the charm cast by the lady officer (with the grade of major) can seriously affect the professionalism of the journalists, the shrewdness of the new minister of defense is to be preferred over the obvious hooliganism of other dignitaries vis-a-vis the press. The decision to do everything possible in order to have excellent relations with the press can also be noticed in the case of the other two dignitaries appointed in the wake of the recent governmental reshuffle. At his latest meeting with the press, Doru Ioan Taracila, the minister of interior, satisfied the journalists' taste for the sensational. Minister of Justice Iosif Gavril Chiuzbaian tried hard, along political and journalistic lines, to convince the journalists that they have a friend in him. But there is another interesting thing about the three newly appointed ministers. Immediately after their appointment, each one of them became the target of some press attacks. At least the Ministry of National Defense came under all sorts of attacks. In spite of all that, none of the new ministers resorted to violent replies or, even worse, to banning the access of adverse journalists to the departments they are heading. Are we dealing here with people who are more intelligent that their government colleagues? Are these people more aware of the fact that the press is a power in today's Romania? Regardless of the answer, one can only welcome their attitude toward journalists, since it proves that they are aware of journalists' vanity and also concerned with their public image. Of course, the three are but at the start of their road. It is not excluded that, following the example of other dignitaries, they might lose their smiling kindness toward the press after it continues to criticize them rightly or wrongly. Anyhow, until there is proof to the contrary, we do not err in stating that the new dignitaries seem determined to turn the press into their ally. During his broad campaign of trying to win over the journalists to his side, Iosif Gavril Chiuzbaian held a long news conference yesterday, where he announced, among other things, that he plans to propose Judge Corneliu Turianu for a leading position in the justice department. The new minister seems determined to repair all the mistakes made by his predecessor, Petre Ninosu, prominent leader of the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. Yesterday's announcement is a serious blow to one of Ion Iliescu's most humble servants. First came his unexpected dismissal. Then came his failure at the vote in the Senate [for the position as Senate vice president]. Now, the new minister is canceling a decision taken by Petre Ninosu. We are thus witnessing a happy moment of justice being done to a wronged man. Corneliu Turianu was illegally removed from the presidency of the Bucharest Military Court by the former justice minister. A certain part of the press jumped, so to say, to Corneliu Turianu's defense. Petre Ninosu's political friends violently reacted to this rightful stand taken by the independent journalists. Now, life is giving credit to those who condemned Petre Ninosu's decision. Another act of destiny seems to be the downfall of Iosif Gavril Chiuzbaian's predecessor. In real life, all sins must be paid for. Petre Ninosu is also paying for the injustice he has done. Nevertheless, aside from all this, the PDSR is faced with a most pressing problem, which belongs more to the realm of metaphysics than politics. In spite of everything, Petre Ninosu is one of their people. I realize that they could do nothing to keep him in the post of minister of justice. I realize that they could not promote him to the position of vice president of the Senate. However, what I cannot understand is why they do not jump now to defend the decision taken by Petre Ninosu with regard to Corneliu Turianu's case. This because the statement of the new minister of justice is extremely ominous for the PDSR. It demonstrates to all present ministers that a time may come, after their departure from their posts, that their decisions can be canceled. Not by opposition ministers, but even by other PDSR ministers. This might make quite a few of these dignitaries think twice before they place their party's interests before the interests of the country.
