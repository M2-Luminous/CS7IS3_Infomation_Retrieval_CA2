According to statistics from the General Administration of Customs, exports of electronic products amounted to $8.1 billion in 1993, up 18.1 percent over 1992. Imports, meanwhile, jumped 32 percent to $10.6 billion. Imports of visual and audio merchandise and telecommunications products hit $5.53 billion, while exports totalled $5.01 billion. About $3.62 billion of electronic components and instruments were imported and $1.51 billion worth were exported. Foreign-funded enterprises are playing a bigger role in the exports, said a senior official from the Ministry of Electronics Industry. Last year foreign-funded enterprises accounted for more than 40 percent of all exports. The proportion will continue to grow in the coming years, the official said. Exports of consumer electronics kept rising last year. China exported 113 million cassette tape recorders worth $150 million and 11.31 million television sets of which 6.95 million were black and white. China's exports of cassette tape recorders and black-and-white TV sets rank first in the world. The official said China is trying to increase exports of electronic products for investment use and basic electronic components. For example, China exported $558 million worth of computers and related products last year, an increase of 85 percent over 1992. Last year's 18.1 percent growth in electronic exports actually was a slowdown from 1992, when they jumped by more than 40 percent over 1991. The ministry official attributed the slower expansion to the brisk domestic market and exporters' shortage of capital. According to the ministry's statistics for 1993, Chinese electronic production reached 139.8 billion yuan ($16 billion), an increase of 26.4 percent over 1992. Sales jumped by 37.6 percent to 113.27 billion yuan ($13 billion). The official said China now mainly exports low-grade products, which yield low profits. He noted that while exports of TV sets increased by 20 percent last year, their value rose by only 5 percent. At present, China depends on Hong Kong and Macao to absorb its exports, but the official said other markets will be explored. Although the imbalance in the trading of electronics accounted for nearly 20 percent of China's entire trade deficit last year, the ministry official said imports will probably continue growing rapidly this year. This expanding market for electronics has drawn the attention of many foreign companies, which are eager to supply the up-to-date equipment China needs to modernize itself. For instance, the country plans to set up nationwide economic information networks that will need sophisticated technology from abroad. Last year, many big names in the international industry sent high-profile delegations to China seeking business. More are expected this year. Lou Gerstner, chairman of IBM Corp., the world's largest computer maker, and William H. Gates III, chairman of Microsoft Corp., the software giant, are scheduled to make their first visits to China separately in March.
