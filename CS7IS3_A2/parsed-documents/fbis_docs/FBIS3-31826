[Abdic] Of course I wish to make a statement because I came here publicly, in the function of peace, because it is known that 18 days ago a fierce armed clash occurred between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps and the Srpska army. For the past 18 days I have been trying to do what could be done over the telephone in contacts with Slobodan Milosevic and Radovan Karadzic to stop the armed clashes. It is known that we have drawn up a cease-fire agreement and an agreement on the cessation of all hostilities, however, there are still instances of violating this agreement. Therefore, this was actually the reason why I turned to Slobodan Milosevic to ask Radovan Karadzic to meet with us here in Belgrade and to review once again the declaration which we signed on 22 October 1993, which Slobodan Milosevic also signed. I can conclude with great pleasure that Mr. Milosevic expressed readiness to call Karadzic, and that he remained committed to all the principles we agreed to on 22 October. That is why we have signed this agreement, and with this agreement I can guarantee the citizens of Bihac -- and the citizens of western Bosnia -- peace. That is the most important thing. Moreover, I believe that when peace is the issue, one must choose neither the time nor the place, nor spare oneself or fall under the influence of various comments, but must rise to the occasion since it is people and lasting peace that are at stake. It is the duty of all of us to do everything possible to ensure peace returns to all the territories. I have been criticized for striving too hard for peace in the autonomous province of Western Bosnia, rather than for peace throughout Bosnia- Herzegovina. I have to say that in my opinion, peace must have a starting point. The most realistic starting point is precisely in the autonomous province of Western Bosnia. I believe that we can establish peace throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina based precisely on the principles of this peace.
