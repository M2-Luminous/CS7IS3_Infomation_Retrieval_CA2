Raja Mohan: "Clinton Set-up Bent on Attacking India?"] [Text] Washington, Jan. 23--The Clinton Administration appears determined to go out of the way to hit out at India on human rights issues. It is no longer possible to attribute the statements emanating from the White House on the situation in India to mere callousness and insensitivity. Only unremitting hostility, spurred by interested quarters, among the White House aides can explain the fact that the President, Mr. Bill Clinton, had signed two letters on the same day, December 27, that make provocative statements on two of the most sensitive issues relating to India's security. Yesterday, Mr. Gurmit Singh Aulak, the self-proclaimed president of the Council of Khalistan based in Washington released a letter written by Mr. Clinton to the Congressman, Mr. Gary A. Condit. The letter said: "I am aware of the chronic tensions between the Indian Government and the Sikh militants, and share your desire for a peaceful solution that protects Sikh rights." Referring to the recent improvement in the ground situation in Punjab, the President talked of continuing police abuses in the State. He declared, "It is clear that abuses still occur, however, and we regularly raise our concerns about them with senior officials in the Punjab Government and the Indian Government." Stating that "human rights is an important issue in U.S.-India relations," the President assured Mr. Condit that Washington would "continue to make our concerns known to the New Delhi authorities." Reevaluation of ties needed: Two weeks ago, Mr. Clinton's letter to Dr. Ghulam Nabi Fai, an activist for the Kashmiri militants here, declaring his desire to "bring peace to Kashmir," had been publicised. It was possible to make light of that letter, seeing it as something that just slipped through the normally tight system in the White House that regulates presidential utterances on foreign policy issues. The fact that Mr. Clinton has now signed a nastier letter on Punjab to a Congressman must necessarily force reevaluation in New Delhi of the State of political relations between India and the United States. It is no longer possible for New Delhi to downplay the significance of the Clinton letters. Until now, it could be argued that the Khalistan cause is being taken up only by a few Sikh militants, their lobbyists and Congressmen who are funded by them. The reference to Punjab now comes from the President himself, the highest authority of the executive branch of the U.S. Government. It is necessary to recall that under the previous administration, despite a far graver situation in Punjab, the Sikh militants here could not get the President, Mr. George Bush, to endorse their cause. Now Mr. Clinton has done it when normality has returned to Punjab. That there is not a single reference to terrorism in either of Mr. Clinton's letters suggests that this administration does not even care to pretend there is some balance when it refers to the internal situation in India. New Delhi has until now shown great restraint in reacting to the provocations from Washington. Such restraint and the attempts to sincerely engage American concerns on human rights have obviously no value.
