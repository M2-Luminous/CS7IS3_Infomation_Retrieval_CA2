Most likely several political intrigues have clashed here, and their resultant force, so to speak, has apparently not satisfied anyone. First of all, the desire of the Duma leadership to demonstrate its independence of the president to the whole world and primarily to itself is completely obvious. No less obvious is the worry of certain parliamentarians that the possible trial of the "October prisoners" may stir up the electorate's interest in them on the eve of the presidential elections. On the other hand, unlike Zyuganov and Zhirinovskiy, Anpilov and Rutskoy were never professionals in political terms. And therefore, having been pardoned opportunely by the charity (and, clearly, it is only the powers that be that can be charitable) of these people, and having discovered their previous natural niche already filled, they would be forced, according to the cunning reckonings of the parliamentarians, to quietly and ingloriously leave big-time politics. This danger was obvious even from the Lefortovo cell from which Rutskoy, according to rumors, had told his supporters in the Duma not to even hint at any amnesty. However, the events following the amnesty have shown that even Boris Yeltsin is not at all inclined to oppose it. Thus, the leaders of the "Russia's Choice" movement, who include many first-class lawyers and legislators with experience of working in the previous Union and Russian parliaments, have found a great multitude of contraventions of existing legislation in the document adopted by the Duma. It would, apparently, be as easy as anything to suspend its effect and lodge a complaint in the Constitutional Court.... But nothing of the sort has happened. On the contrary, the executive has done all it can to ensure that the legislature's decision is irreversible. Is not the whole point that the president too has been able to come out of this with something? Once again this cannot be ruled out. Even the "Yabloko" faction has condemned the amnesty, arguing that by discontinuing the criminal proceedings against the defenders of the "White House" the parliament is thus removing responsibility from the opposing side, whose stance during the October events did not appear to be irreproachable to everyone either. And then, Boris Nikolayevich could easily count on the fact that each of his opponents will obtain a political double and, instead of opposing him, would be forced to prove to the voter his own self-identity. After all, it is no secret that at the December elections Zyuganov got into the parliament by inheriting Anpilov's electorate, and Zhirinovskiy -- Rutskoy's. However, it now turns out that they were written off too early, and they are now demanding back again what is theirs. I think that this state of affairs suits the president. After all, it is no secret to anyone today that there are no legal obstacles to holding extraordinary presidential elections. And so the only thing that can really avert them is a split in the anti-Yeltsin camp.
