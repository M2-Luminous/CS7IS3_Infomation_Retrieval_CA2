The statement says that certain quarters in the USA are trying to make North Korea accept the humiliating terms of settling this problem. The Russian communists express bewilderment that the Russian side is ready, though with reservations, to join the repressive measures with regard to North Korea. The authors of the statement believe that it is in the interests of Russia to "maintain balanced relations both with North and South Korea" and to create conditions for a dialogue between them. Communist MPs propose that a representative of the Foreign Ministry should report to the parliament about the Russian- South Korean talks that took place last week and about contacts with North Korea aimed at resolving the nuclear problem.
