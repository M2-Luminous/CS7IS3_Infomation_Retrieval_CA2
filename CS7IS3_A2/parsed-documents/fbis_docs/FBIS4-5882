At the beginning of next week, Muneaki Samejima, deputy secretary general of the JNP, and Kansei Nakano, the DSP's policy board chairman, will begin preparing for the forum to study policies to achieve a better quality of life for Japanese people, they said. The alliance will take over a suspended JNP plan to ask other coalition parties to join "Kaikaku (Reform)," the JNP's parliamentary group in the House of Representatives, the sources said. The launching of the group, however, means that the DSP will join the reform in the future, they said. The JNP, led by outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, disbanded a parliamentary alliance with new party Sakigake (Harbinger) led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura shortly after he announced his resignation on April 8. It then formed the reform with two United Social Democratic Party members including Science and Technology Agency chief Satsuki Eda and began urging other ruling parties' members to join. But the JNP suspended its campaign as ruling parties fell into deeper disagreement over selection of Hosokawa's successor. Another reason for the suspension was that some JNP members objected to allying with Shinseito and Komeito -- two powerful forces in the coalition.
