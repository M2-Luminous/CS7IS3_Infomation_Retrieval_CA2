Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech given at the session realistically assessed the previous anticorruption struggle, put forward opinions of the party Central Committee on the next stage of the anticorruption struggle, and urged the entire party to make unremitting efforts to carry on the struggle persistently, thoroughly, and more effectively. It represented another important policy decision on comprehensively promoting reform, construction, and development made by the party Central Committee after taking the overall situation into consideration, and it is also the concrete embodiment of the party Central Committee's adherence to the principle of attending to two tasks simultaneously and being competent in both in the new situation. We should thoroughly understand and resolutely implement it. Since August last year when the party Central Committee and the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, at its second plenary session, made important arrangements for the coming anticorruption struggle, party committees, governments, and discipline inspection and supervision organs at all levels across the province have adopted a firm attitude, actively taken action, and carried out a great amount of painstaking work. The vast number of cadres and the masses have also shown wholehearted support and actively participated in the work. Thanks to the efforts for over half a year, we have achieved good results in the three tasks of the anticorruption struggle at varying degrees, some of which are fairly remarkable, and checked the development and spreading of negative and corrupt phenomena. This has played a positive role in promoting Heilongjiang's reform, opening up, and economic construction and in safeguarding its political stability. Judging from the situation of the entire province, however, development in the anticorruption work has been uneven, some results have not been consolidated, and our work is still falling rather far behind and cannot satisfy the masses when considering the problems that actually exist and the expectations of the masses. Thus, the tasks for the next stage are still very arduous. This third plenary session of the provincial discipline inspection commission has made specific arrangements for Heilongjiang's anticorruption struggle for this year. Party committees, governments, and discipline inspection and supervision organs should conscientiously relay the guidelines of this session, meticulously organize their implementation, and, after consolidating the achievements already won, carry out this year's anticorruption struggle persistently, thoroughly, and more effectively. I will speak on four issues. 1. In-depth development of the anticorruption struggle is an important prerequisite for deepening reform, promoting development, and maintaining stability, and it should be regarded as the major work of the entire party. This year is a crucial year for accelerating establishment of the socialist market economy system and maintaining sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability meet the overall interests of the work of the entire party and entire country. Proceeding from the overall interests, the party Central Committee recently emphasized repeatedly and prominently that, in view of the current very heavy tasks for reform, development, and stability, we should continue to take the anticorruption struggle as the major work of the entire party. Our party and government leading comrades at all levels must have a clear and full understanding of this. First, persistently and profoundly opposing corruption is a strategic policy decision adopted by the CPC Central Committee after making a correct appraisal of the work at the preceding stage. Last year, after experiencing the spreading of corrupt phenomenon, our party made up its mind to mobilize the whole party to launch the anticorruption campaign and set a time limit to resolve the problems strongly complained by the masses. Through six months' endeavor, it can be said that some results have been achieved. However, some measures adopted at that stage were merely aimed at bringing about a temporary solution to problems. In checking the spreading of the trend of corruption, some cardinal problems have not yet been solved and some deep-rooted problems have not yet been touched. Viewed from the problems already revealed, corrupt phenomenon has now infiltrated into most spheres of social life. Worse still, corruption has seriously made inroads on our party and government organs and on the ranks of cadres. This is a great shock to us. Therefore, we must foster the idea of fighting a sustained battle and strive to, in line with the strategic arrangements of the CPC Central Committee, thoroughly resolve problems instead of merely bringing about a temporary solution so that we can deepen the anticorruption campaign step-by-step. Second, persistently and profoundly opposing corruption is an internal demand to deepen reform and accelerate development. The endeavor in anticorruption and the endeavor in reform, opening up, and economic development promote and complement each other. On the one hand, accelerating reform, opening up, and economic development will create essential material foundation and condition for checking corruption. On the other hand, anticorruption constitutes an important guarantee and essential measure for promoting reform, opening up, and economic construction. Failing to check corruption will not only seriously damage the image and authority of the party and the government and dampen the initiative of the vast numbers of cadres; but will also make the party's organizations and discipline listless, hamper the implementation of the party's principles and policies concerning reform and opening up, as well as the major policy decision concerning economic development, and destroy the hard-won achievements in reform and construction. In particular, under the current situation that old systems are being replaced by new ones and the legal system is not perfect enough, some corrupt phenomena will certainly arise and interfere with and hamper the smooth progress of reform and construction. If we fail in the economy, we will come to grief, and if we let corrupt phenomena spread unchecked, let embezzlement and bribery run wild, and divorce ourselves from the masses, we will also come to grief. It is absolutely wrong to set anticorruption against reform, opening up, and economic development. The practice of anticorruption at the preceding stage shows that anticorruption work did not affect reform and opening up but became an important guarantee for reform, opening up, and economic development. Therefore, the more we carry out reform and opening up, accelerate the establishment of the socialist market economic structure, and develop the economy, the more we should oppose corruption and strengthen the building of party style and the improvement of administrative honesty. This is an important experience in building the socialism with Chinese characteristics. Third, persistently and profoundly opposing corruption constitutes an important condition for maintaining political and social stability. This year, China will set forth more major reform measures than those in any other year. Along with the constant deepening of reform and the readjustment of relations of interests, many new contradictions and problems will emerge. In particular, some enterprises in the province have suffered losses for a long time, and considerably more workers and staff members have been unable to receive their wages on time. Failing to effectively check and punish corruption will sharpen contradictions, bring out incidence, and affect unity and stability. At the same time, we should clearly notice that at present the hostile forces at home and abroad are still waiting for opportunities to create confusions and disturbances and are trying every possible means to "Westernize" and "split" China. If the party itself is unable to resolve the problems concerning corruption, it will also provide a handle and a condition for the hostile forces to launch an attack on us. For this reason, party and government leading comrades at all levels must have the sense of worry, always keep sober-minded, launch the anticorruption campaign in a sustained and profound manner, provide necessary conditions for maintaining social stability, and create a fine social and political environment for reform, opening up, and economic construction. Fourth, opposing corruption in a deep and sustained manner is still strongly expected and required of the cadres and the people inside and outside the party. According to the sample survey on 5,000 people (households) made by the provincial discipline inspection commission and the municipal urban survey team, only 53.3 percent of them were satisfied or comparatively satisfied with the anticorruption work and 45.4 percent were not satisfied. Simultaneously, 57.1 percent of the people maintained that some corrosive phenomena were brought under control through the previous-stage struggle and that the achievements in opposing corruption are not consolidated. The broad masses of the cadres and the people earnestly expect that the struggle against corruption must be waged neither in the form of formalism nor in a perfunctory way. They hope to see real results as soon as possible. We must pay high attention to the people's opinions and voices. We must firmly foster the mass viewpoints of Marxism, enhance the sense of responsibility and the sense of urgency, adopt resolute and forceful measures to solve the problems that the people have strong complaints, and also closely rely on the support of the people to wage the anticorruption struggle in a sustained and profound manner. 2. Ensuring the realization of the current targets is the major task for opposing corruption. We must exert efforts to grasp consolidation, deepening, and fruitful achievements. The practice of the previous anticorruption struggle proved: To grasp the current-stage targets, we should first start from bringing about a temporary solution. Through the special struggle, we should concentratively solve some general problems of which the people have strong complaints, control the tendency that corrosive phenomena spread unchecked, and then gradually eliminate the sources and deep- layered problems that cause corrosive phenomena. These ideas and methods are accurate and effective. The general requirements for the 1994 anticorruption work are to comprehensively fulfill the three tasks as defined by the central authorities and to make efforts to grasp consolidation, deepening, and fruitful achievements. Grasping consolidation means that we should thoroughly grasp the work that started last year, ensure to see results in the work, and avoid going back to where we start. Grasping deepening means that the problems that have been sorted out should resolutely be corrected and handled, simultaneously we should firmly formulate and perfect relevant management systems and preventive measures, and gradually solve the sources and deep- layered problems that bring about corrosive phenomena. Grasping more fruitful achievements means that we should sum up and draw on the experiences gained in the previous stage, improve and intensify work measures, and make greater achievements. According to the work ideologies and the unified arrangements of the central authorities, the party committees and governments at various levels and the party and government leading comrades should base themselves on consolidating and developing the work achievements done in the previous year and comprehensively fulfill the anticorruption tasks in the previous stage. First, leading cadres should really be honest and self-disciplined and see real results in this regard. Leading cadres' administrative honesty and self-discipline is one of the three tasks for opposing corruption, as well as a key link to deepen the anticorruption work. Viewing the situation that the three tasks were fulfilled this year, we know that some leading cadres were relatively poor in terms of their administrative honesty and self-discipline mainly because some leading cadres were poor in their self-disciplinary awareness and exemplary functions and kept silent about major charges and admitted minor ones. Therefore, some deep- layered problems were not exposed and even some prominent problems were not conscientiously solved. The masses have many complaints. This year, the central authorities set forth five new requirements for leading cadres' administrative honesty and self-discipline and defined to continuously adopt self-investigation and self-correction methods. In reality, this is the party's important measure for cherishing and protecting cadres, as well as an extremely good opportunity for the broad masses of the cadres to conduct self-education, self-improvement, and self-extrication. We must cherish this opportunity, use the regulations on administrative honesty and self-discipline to restrict and standardize our activities, and consciously examine and correct existing problems. Of course, the problems of all the people cannot be solved through self-investigation and self-correction. We must strengthen organizational supervision over the people without awareness and have them be supervised by the masses. The provincial discipline inspection commission stressed the necessity to combine leading cadres' self-investigation and self-correction with the supervision by the masses, the special clearing-up, and the cadres' administrative honesty. This is extremely necessary. The provincial party committee has decided that in the first half of this year the leading bodies should regard the "new five principles" on administration honesty and self discipline as an important matter when holding their democratic life meetings. Prior to democratic life meetings, they should extensively solicit opinions from the masses. After the meetings, they should also circulate a notice in a certain scope to solicit appraisal and supervision. They should specially clear up the illegally purchased sedans and illegally occupied houses that have been listed by the central authorities in the "new five principles" related to administrative honesty and self discipline. Based on carrying out investigation to know the real situation and formulating work plans and the provisions of policies, departments responsible for the work and units taking the lead in the work should earnestly organize the enforcement of these principles. Efforts should be made to test the extent of honesty duty performance enacted by leading bodies or cadres that have encountered more complaints lodged by the masses and have not carried out self-improvement. In the course of testing the extent of honesty duty performance, it is necessary to integrate discipline inspection with organizational disposal and to adopt necessary organizational measures to deal with the problems cropping up by having cadres perform their official duties honestly and in setting forth employment orientation. Discipline inspection commissions and organizational departments at all levels should coordinate with one another and do a good job in earnestly grasping the work. Second, we should reinforce the dynamics in handling serious and appalling cases. Whether we can resolutely and effectively investigate and handle the large number of serious and appalling cases, as well as punish the large number of corrupt elements, represent an important sign to determine whether we can deepen the struggle against corruption. In line with the arrangements made by the central authorities we should regard as a focal point the work of continuously investigating and handling the cases committed by party and government leading organs, leading cadres, judicial departments, administration and law-enforcement departments, economic management departments, and the working personnel of these departments. We should emphasize investigating and handling the violation cases committed by leading cadres, by personnel in charge of enforcing the law and discipline through practicing favoritism and irregularities and bending the law by taking bribes, by personnel in charge of enforcing the law through violating the law, and by legal persons through violating the law and discipline. Party committees at all levels should resolutely eliminate the interference of pleading for mercy and establishing relationships with personnel and support the organs of discipline inspection, supervision, and procuratorate to investigate and handle the large number of serious and appalling cases. The principal leading personnel of these party committees should take personal charge of a case if necessary. All important cases and clues reported by the masses should be earnestly investigated and handled. Party committees at all levels may dispatch their reserve cadres to the discipline inspection commission to help it handle the cases. Only by so doing can they not only make up the manpower shortage in handling cases but also train their cadres to upgrade their party spirit. Governments and financial departments at all levels should make all-out efforts to ensure the supply of funds for handling the cases. By no means should we have the handling of cases be adversely affected by the shortage of manpower and funds. In investigating and handling serious and appalling cases, the organs of discipline inspection, supervision, and public security at all levels should closely coordinate with one another; supplement one another in strong points; and do a good job in conducting linking work. In investigating and handling serious and appalling cases, the party committee may exercise unified command and concentrate all social forces on waging total warfare in handling the cases and warfare in handling the key cases so as to make a breakthrough in this regard as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the party committee should hold open trials by selecting a large number of typical cases to frighten criminal elements and to create a momentum of deeply opposing corruption. Third, in correcting the malpractice cropping up among various industries and trades, we should give the work priority to the key problems in this regard. The present phenomena of malpractice and of trading between power and money, particularly those prevailing among industries and trades, as well as departments that are holding the power of personnel and financial affairs and of material supply, are still relatively serious. The provincial party committee defined last year the task of carrying out investigation, dissection, clearing-up, and correction over the key problems cropping up among 10 departments and will firmly grasp the task this year. According to the unified arrangements made by the central authorities and the provincial party committee, a good job should be done in conducting education and rectification in the contingent of political and legal personnel and in emphatically resolving the problems of enforcing the law unfairly; bending the law for private gains; and enforcing the law by violating it. In line with the reform in the financial systems and the task of conducting special consolidation over the problems on the financial front with regard to seeking personal gains by taking advantage of loans, the administration and law-discipline enforcement organs on the industrial-commercial front and tax front should enhance the building of systems for administration honesty. They should enforce in an overall way the systems of two openness, one supervision, and of the internal restriction of power. On the fronts of public health and education, which are closely related to the masses, we should generally conduct education on professional ethics and emphatically resolve the problems related to the ethics and morale of medical circles. All in all, by proceeding from the reality and according to the characteristics of various industries and trades as well as of various departments, we should define the focal points of consolidation; integrate work style rectification with the establishment of systems; unite administration honesty with administration industriousness; and conduct the comprehensive management of public security through multiple forms and methods to enable the morale of various industries and trades, as well as of various departments to achieve an obvious turn for the better. 3. Deepening reform is the fundamental way to tackle corruption and the anticorruption work should be carried out in close coordination with the implementation of major reform measures. The current anticorruption struggle is carried out in the process to accelerate establishment of the socialist market economy system. We should coordinate our endeavor to oppose corruption and advocate honesty with implementation of major reform measures. We should, on the one hand, pay attention to providing, by opposing corruption, favorable conditions and guarantees for implementation of various reform measures and, on the other, start with deepening reform and establishing necessary systems to fundamentally prevent and check corrupt phenomena so that we can bring about both a temporary solution and a permanent cure. First, we should strictly enforce discipline and carry out orders and prohibitions to ensure implementation of all reform measures. Our party's historical experiences proved that party discipline should be all the more strengthened whenever there is major social change. This year, the central authorities will issue a series of major reform measures for establishing the socialist market economy system. Whether we can ensure the smooth implementation of government orders is a matter concerning the success or failure of reform. Therefore, we should strengthen the restriction of party discipline and ensure a high degree of political and ideological unity and a high degree of unity in organization and action of the entire party. Party organizations at all levels and cadres with party membership should strictly abide by the party's political and organizational discipline; resolutely implement the policies and measures of the party Central Committee and the State Council for reform, development, and political stability; carry out all orders and prohibitions; and act in unison. It is not permitted to comply in public but oppose in private, act one's own way, and obstruct and interfere with the progress of reform; it is not permitted to take advantage of reform to line one's pockets and seek illicit interests; and it is not permitted to take advantage of one's authority to create difficulties to or extort money from enterprises and grass-roots levels. Discipline inspection and supervision organs at all levels should strengthen supervision and inspection in a planned manner according to established priorities, with the focus on implementation of the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee and implementation of the series of major policies and measures of the party Central Committee and the State Council for deepening reform, developing the economy, and safeguarding political stability. Second, when major reform measures are issued, we should adopt preventive measures from the angle of improving party style and administrative honesty and formulate corresponding regulations and measures to make sure that good results are achieved both in deepening reform and in opposing corruption and advocating honesty. In implementing major reform measures and economic policies, it is impossible to be perfect at the very beginning, and it is unavoidable that some people will take advantage of the loopholes created by the temporary imperfect supervision, management, laws, and regulations to indulge themselves in some new corrupt and unhealthy trends. At a discussion and study session for provincial-level cadres held in November last year, Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: "Is not it time to make it a regulation for party committees and governments at all levels, while implementing the major policies and measures of the central authorities for economic development, reform, and opening up, to list improvement of party style and administrative honesty high on their agenda, put forward realistic and feasible support measures, and conscientiously implement them together." In compliance with this requirement, party committees, governments, and pertinent departments, when issuing major reform measures, should conduct study early and work out measures to address the problems that may arise in party style and administrative honesty. Discipline inspection and supervision organs, in particular, should actively participate in this work and take the initiative in intensifying investigation and study on the forefront of reform, opening up, and economic construction to learn about and analyze the new conditions and new problems, to help party committees, governments, and pertinent departments study and formulate measures for preventing and checking unhealthy trends, and to use these measures to standardize the behaviors of party and government leading cadres and ensure the healthy development of economic construction, reform, and opening up. Third, we should strive to study and explore a new way for preventing corruption by relying on reform and building systems. One of the important reasons for the reappearance of passive corrupt phenomena is that we have failed to improve the situation by checking the sources of corruption and eliminating the soil and conditions that give rise to corruption. To solve the problem on corruption, we must keep an eye on the overall situation, grasp the sources of corruption, resolve problems in terms of systems and the legal system, and take both radical and stopgap measures. Through deepening reform of the financial, taxation, banking, and investment systems, we should resolve the problems on arbitrarily pooling funds, donations, and fees from enterprises, extorting money or articles from enterprises, and taking advantage of lending loans, collecting taxes, and approving projects to seek personal gain; through promoting reform of the cadre personnel system, we should give public examinations, recruit people by invitation, and introduce the competitive and incentive mechanisms, adopt the method of clearing the channels for exchanging cadres and ensuring that those who assume leadership posts can work at higher or lower levels as required, and solve the unhealthy trends in the course of carrying out cadre personnel work; through public bidding, we should check the unhealthy trends in real estate development and contract of projects; and through deepening reform of the housing system, we should solve the unhealthy trends in housing distribution and using public funds to furnish houses above the set standards or reselling public houses at a profit. We should formulate a method and a system of supervising and controlling power performance, such as making the work procedures public, analyzing and restricting the internal powers, assuming important posts on rotation, and jointly managing official work, and gradually institutionalize and legalize the anticorruption struggle. 4. Since upholding the principle of taking a two-handed approach is our party's strategic principle and an art of leadership, we must strengthen leadership over anticorruption struggle in the course of carrying out all fields of work. Persisting in taking a two-handed approach and be tough with both is an important component of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the strategic principle which our party should uphold for a long time, and the Marxist art of leadership. According to the previous experience and lessons, the trend of being soft with one hand and hard with the other hand will easily appear when the reform and economic work tasks are very heavy. This year more reform measures will be issued, the strength in this aspect will be great, and risks will appear. Under such circumstances, we should all the more uphold the principle of taking a two-handed approach and be tough with both, and should all the more strengthen leadership over anticorruption. In this connection, we should continue to stress the following few points: First, we should continue to implement the system of assuming responsibility over anticorruption work and form a trend of making both party and government organs jointly grasp and manage this work. Fighting corruption is a common task of the whole party. People who are in charge of the work of the party committee or the government must attend to and grasp the anticorruption work well. Grasping two tasks does not mean that one task should be grasped by the party committee and the other task should be grasped by the government. Instead, they should closely combine two tasks, grasp them well, and seek achievements. Party committees and governments at all levels should properly handle the relations of reform, development, stability, and anticorruption, firmly attend to the central task of economic construction, persist in taking a two-handed approach, give consideration to the overall situation, combine the work of fighting corruption with deepening reform, promoting development, and safeguarding stability, continue to introduce anticorruption to all fields of work, and establish a strict responsibility system. The party and government top leaders should assume full responsibility, and personally resolve major problems. Party and government leading bodies should share the work, really assume responsibility over the anticorruption struggle work on all fronts, and realistically form a situation in which the party and government jointly manage this work. Governments at all levels, operational departments, and pertinent departments in all trades should grasp not only the economic efficiency and targets in the course of grasping economic work, but also the work style and common practices of organs and various trades; in addition to grasping the economic factors that affect economic work, they should also pay attention to solving noneconomic factors that affect economic development. We should persist in simultaneously planning, inspecting, and summing up the economic work and anticorruption struggle, combine the two, and make them promote each other. Second, we should strengthen supervision, inspection, examination, and guidance. This year, the provincial party committee will continue to send inspection groups, examination groups, and investigation groups to grass-roots areas to supervise, examine, and guide the work of various localities and departments in opposing corruption and advocating administrative honesty. Leading cadres at all levels should try their best to go deep into some key departments, grass-roots units, and the places that are weak in anticorruption work to find out problems in a timely manner and give specific guidance to them. Those who only talk but not practice and those who are poor in conducting the anticorruption work should be criticized or warned and should be given resolute organizational measures if necessary. We should strengthen investigation and study, pay attention to new circumstances and new problems in a timely manner, and mete out countermeasures to ensure the sound and orderly development of an anticorruption campaign. Third, we should genuinely and sincerely support discipline inspection and supervisory organs to perform duties. Discipline inspection and supervisory organs shoulder arduous and heavy tasks in the first line of anticorruption work. Leading comrades of party committees and governments at all levels should pay high attention to and wholeheartedly support the work of these organs. First, efforts should be made to give full play to the role of discipline inspection and supervisory organs as the advisers and assistants to the party and the government. Party committees and governments at all levels, principal responsible comrades in particular, should frequently listen to the work reports of discipline inspection and supervisory organs, help these organs resolve all sorts of problems in a timely manner, and support them to conscientiously perform their functions of supervising, inspecting, coordinating, and comprehensive guiding anticorruption work. Second, discipline inspection and supervisory organs should be supported to enforce discipline and handle cases. When investigating and handling major discipline violation cases in particular, party committees and governments should serve as a powerful backing for discipline inspection and supervisory organs. Leading comrades at all levels should not only personally take a hand in handling cases but also support discipline inspection and supervisory organs to handle cases impartially and help these organs break with favoritism through connections and resist the practice of pleading for mercy. The discipline violation cases committed by members of discipline inspection and supervisory organs should also be dealt with without shielding and leniency. Third, discipline inspection and supervisory organs should be supported to resolve practical problems. Discipline inspection and supervisory organs shoulder heavy tasks and face relatively more problems. Some problems they face cannot be resolved by themselves. Party committees and governments at all levels should show concern for the work and life of the ranks of discipline inspection and supervisory cadres and should do several tangible things for these organs every year, such as, providing sufficient and competent members for their leading bodies, facilitating the exchanges of discipline inspection and supervisory cadres, improving the conditions for handling affairs and cases, and allocating sufficient funds for these organs. In the forthcoming organizational reform, party committees and governments should give full consideration to the anticorruption work and to the practical demand of discipline inspection and supervisory work so that the strength of discipline inspection and supervisory organs will not be weakened. Comrades of discipline inspection and supervisory organs should also continuously carry forward the spirit of selfless dedication, being devoted to one's duty, being law-abiding, and making innovations, and should do outstanding and fruitful work to make new contributions to launching the anticorruption campaign in a sustained and profound manner, to ensure reform, opening up, and economic development, and to safeguard political stability.
