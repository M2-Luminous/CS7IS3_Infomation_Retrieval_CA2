Now that friendly Russia, which is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, is eager to activate the peace process, we hope it will take into account Jordan's bitter suffering as a result of the U.S. siege imposed on al-'Aqabah. This siege has inflicted grave losses on the Jordanian economy and trade. Friendly Russia knows better than others the extent of Jordan's eagerness to achieve peace, security, and stability in this vital region of the world. At the same time, Russia knows that Jordan has recently linked the resumption of its role in the peace process to addressing this unfair siege. We thus hope that this friendly big power will give serious attention to this siege of the port of al-'Aqabah and work to lift it. What draws attention is that while President Yeltsin's envoy was visiting Jordan, the U.S. forces twice searched a ship carrying Jordan-bound merchandise and turned it back to Suez. Such a position does not serve the peace process in any way whatsoever. Jordan experienced much suffering and many economic and trade difficulties during the Gulf crisis and the second Gulf war. It is still suffering as a result of this siege which is imposed unfairly and without any convincing justification. Jordan complied with the Security Council resolutions, and the U.S. Administration itself acknowledged this compliance. This administration, however, insists on harming our national economy. It is known that Jordan is not the only neighbor of Iraq. Washington, however, did not impose a similar blockade on Turkey and Iran, which are also neighbors of Iraq. At any rate, we hope that the guest Russian envoy will brief President Yeltsin on Jordan's suffering as a result of the unfair siege in order to address this issue. It is inconceivable to activate the peace process in order to achieve peace, security, and stability in a region where some countries are suffering from an unfair siege at the hands of peace advocates.
