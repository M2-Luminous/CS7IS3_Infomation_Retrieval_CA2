In the proposal requesting the session to examine the draft law governing the management of urban real estate, Premier Li Peng said the objectives of this law are to improve the management of urban real estate, maintain the real estate market's order, protect the legitimate rights and interests of real estate owners, and bring about a healthy development in the real estate business. In the motion requesting the session to examine the supplementary regulations to the PRC Regulations for Controlling and Punishing Public Offenses, Li Peng says that, since their promulgation on 1 January 1987, the regulations have played an important role in maintaining public order and safeguarding social stability. However, because of the changes in public order and the appearance of certain new situations and problems, the regulations should be supplemented. Premier Li Peng added that the State Council's executive meetings have discussed and adopted the two drafts. At this morning's session, Vice Construction Minister Ye Rutang and Public Security Minister Tao Siju respectively explained these two drafts at the State Council's request. Ye Rutang said: The real estate business is a basic business preceding economic development, and it is one of the national economy's pillar industries. The real estate business' development not only provides the basic material foundation and precondition for economic development, but also can help improve city dwellers' living conditions and create an important avenue of financial resources for the state. Because of the important role the real estate business plays in the national economic and social development, it is objectively essential to regulate, guide, promote, and protect it by law. He said: China's real estate business has been developing rapidly since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, and especially since the systems governing the compensatory use of state-owned urban land and the comprehensive development and construction of real estate. In 1992 after Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave his important talks during his inspection in southern China and after the 14th CPC Congress was convened, both reform and construction have expedited, and development of the real estate business entered a new stage. Meanwhile, following the rapid development of the real estate business, certain problems badly needing a solution have appeared. The main problems are: loss of control in the total supply of construction land and loss of the state's land resources as a result of the craze in leasing land and building development zones; irrational investment in real estate development and excessive establishment of real estate developing businesses; and unregulated trade, chaotic prices, serious land and real estate speculation, and loss of incomes from state-owned land as result of defective mechanisms governing the real estate market. Fundamental solutions to these problems lie in codifying real estate management. On the guidelines for drawing up the law governing urban real estate management, Ye Rutang said: 1) In accordance with the decision made by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the law should provide that the state will monopolize the primary market of urban land so as to prevent the loss of land resources; and that mechanisms ensuring a normal real estate market should be established so that real estate development and trade can be managed more efficiently. 2) Attention should be paid to establishing a basic system for managing real estate, to coordinating the relationship between this law and other relevant laws and administrative regulations, and to reflecting the principle that the subjects [zhu ti 0031 7555] having the right to use state-owned land in cities and the right to own the houses on the land should be the same [yi zhi 0001 5268]. 3) The law's scientific attributes and its practicality should be integrated. On the basis of reviewing the experiences and lessons gained and learned from recent years' real estate development, we have codified the experiences of success and measures that can be put into practice with some efforts; deferred writing into the law those measures which are unlikely to be carried out today and in the time to come; and stipulated in principle those measures which conform to the policy for reform and development, but which cannot be carried out now owing to a lack of experience. In such a way we will have room for change and these principles can be reinforced and improved when conditions are ripe. Ye Rutang also elaborated on what and where the law will make adjustments, land for real estate development, real estate development businesses, regulation in the real estate market, and real estate registration and licensing. Tao Siju said in his explanation that the Regulations for Controlling and Punishing Public Offenses have played an important role in maintaining social security and order and safeguarding social stability since they became effective. However, he said, owing to changes in public security and the appearance of certain new situations and problems, certain acts that disturb social order, jeopardize public safety, and are detrimental to public interests cannot be handled because the regulations have no provisions for handling these acts. He said: The draft supplementary regulations have prescribed 18 additional punishable public offenses. The types of these offenses and the principles for punishing them are the same as those in the original regulations. Punishing these offenses which exist in real life and which jeopardize social security are absolutely essential for intensifying control of public order; for safeguarding social order, public safety, and public interests; for protecting citizens' legitimate rights and interests; and for safeguarding the progress of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization.
