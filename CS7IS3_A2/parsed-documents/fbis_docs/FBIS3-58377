[passage omitted] Cid Saldanha reports: [Saldanha] [Passage omitted] NATO is to intervene in two areas of former Yugoslavia, using force if necessary. The objectives will be to protect UN contingents in Srebrenica and to reopen the airport in Tuzla. This limited action was decided at last night's dinner, attended by the heads of state and government of the Sixteen. The action is not aimed at resolving the Yugoslav problem, the solution to which can only be a political one, Prime Minister Cavaco Silva said today. [Begin Cavaco recording] Therefore, the outcome of this summit, as a result of the accord achieved last night, is a very clear statement that the allies have asked the United Nations or the UN Security Council to take measures to protect UN soldiers, to enable the rotation of the Canadian soldiers, and to enable the opening of Tuzla airport to humanitarian aid. In anticipation of what you may ask, [let me say that] in this declaration and in what was agreed yesterday, the use of air strikes is implicit, if deemed necessary in order to achieve the objectives. [end recording] [Saldanha] As for the possibility of such an involvement representing greater Portuguese participation, Cavaco did not rule it out, but said that this was not likely for now. [Begin Cavaco recording] We cannot exclude ourselves from making a contribution to peace operations, via NATO, via the Western European Union, and via the United Nations. But at the moment, and in line with last night's discussions, the question is not one of increasing the number of troops on the ground. [end recording] [Saldanha] However, Cavaco Silva said that Portugal had made available a small team of air traffic controllers that could be stationed at Tuzla airport. The question of Bosnia has somewhat altered the outcome of this summit that had centered on the U.S. proposal Partnership for Peace. Cavaco Silva described this proposal as the future of world security and described this summit as one of the most important ever in NATO. [passage omitted]
