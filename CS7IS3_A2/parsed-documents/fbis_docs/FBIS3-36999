Ways of stopping the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and achieving a political solution of the crisis were discussed during the meeting. In this connection, the common opinion was expressed that the defusing of the situation in and around Sarajevo would be an important contribution to resolving this task. This would help remove the danger of foreign military intervention and the escalation of military actions fraught with serious consequences for peace and stability in the whole region. It was pointed out during the conversation that the recent decision by NATO on the possibility of air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions would damage the Bosnian talks' process. Both sides stressed that a political framework for the Bosnian settlement is the only sensible path to peace and stability in this region and there is no alternative to this path. At a meeting with Russian journalists in Belgrade, Vitaliy Churkin stressed that the main task of his new trip to the republics of the former Yugoslavia is to prevent strikes against the positions of the Bosnian Serbs. With this objective, he intends in the next few days to visit Zagreb, and also the Serbian and, possibly, Muslim parts of Sarajevo in order to study the situation there first hand and to find out the opinions of the UN forces command. The Russian diplomat pointed, in particular, to the need to learn such an important detail as the deployment of the sides' heavy artillery. NATO, he said, is demanding the withdrawal of the Serbian artillery 20 km from Sarajevo, but the Serbian side states it has reached an agreement with Yasusi Akashi, the UN Secretary General's special envoy in the former Yugoslavia, not on a withdrawal but on the transfer of its artillery over to the control of the "blue berets". The Serbian side says that the reason for this is that otherwise it may be left without means of self-defense, which may be used to their advantage by the Muslim formations who are in larger numbers. It is also necessary to raise the question of stepping up the work of the international commission to investigate the recent tragic incident in the Sarajevan market, V. Churkin went on. It is an unacceptable situation where everyone is outraged, but emotions hold sway over the facts and no one knows who is responsible for the mass deaths of innocent civilians. In his opinion, if it can be established that it was not the Serbs who did this, then this may affect progress in the negotiations process, since the Muslim side would have to go back on its extreme demands and come to an understanding. The Russian diplomat welcomed a greater degree of involvement of the United States in the process of the Bosnian settlement, because a major lever has thus appeared for putting pressure on the Muslim side and drawing it towards peace accords. He also advocated a realistic approach in terms of not asking too much from the Serb side. Bosnian Serbs have already made major concessions, agreeing first to ensure that Muslims have 30 percent, now put up to 33.3 percent of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, he said. They have no more flexibility left, and only a new, more acceptable for all sides "geometry of the territorial division" can be now discussed. Asked by ITAR-TASS whether Russia possesses at present political implements that would stop NATO from strikes against positions of Bosnian Serbs, Vitaliy Churkin said that the West is attempting to interpret in its own way texts of previous resolutions of the UN Security Council on Bosnia, claiming that NATO can act without a further discussion in the Security Council. We believe that such a crucial step must be discussed. In fact, the West began acting through NATO, rather than through the UN, fearing a Russian veto. I have an impression, however, that nobody has an interest in seeing the situation aggravated, and a peaceful settlement will be reached, the Russian diplomat said in conclusion.
