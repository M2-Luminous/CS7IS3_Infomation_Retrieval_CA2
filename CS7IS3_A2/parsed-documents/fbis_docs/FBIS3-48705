It is an unpardonable grave military challenge [yongho halsu omnun omjunghan kunsajok tojon haengwi] to scheme to introduce Patriot missiles to South Korea at a time when DPRK-U.S. contacts have taken place and the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks are expected for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. It is clear to everyone that the deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea will heat up the tensions on the Korean peninsula and increase the danger of war. The scheme to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea vividly shows that the reckless attempt of the United States and the Kim Yong-sam nation-selling traitorous clique to contain [cheap] our Republic militarily has gone beyond the danger line [omjung kyeson]. Some conservative forces and bellicose elements in the U.S. military have recently unhesitatingly made violent, war-frenzied remarks that international sanctions should be imposed on North Korea, strict countermeasures should be expressed to North Korea, the United States should confront North Korea with armed forces, and so forth. Timed to coincide with this, the United States is scheming to bring Patriot missiles into South Korea. This is not an accident at all. The hostile forces of the United States and the South Korean puppet clique claim that the deployment of Patriot missiles is to counter the threat of a missile attack from North Korea. This is no more than a crafty plea to justify their dangerous introduction of lethal weapons. A threat of a missile attack from North Korea did not exist from the outset. It is merely a fabrication of the enemies. The real purpose of their massive shipment of Patriot missiles into South Korea under the pretext of a nonexistent threat of a missile attack is to impede the progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and impose their unreasonable demand for nuclear inspection on us through pressure and threat. The projected deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea is motivated by the persistent antisocialist and anti-Republic campaign of the United States. Not content with the deployment of more than 1,000 nuclear weapons in South Korea, the traitor Kim Yong-sam allowed the introduction of lethal Patriot weapons [Patriot sarin mugi] to harm [haechida] fellow countrymen. By doing so, he revealed once again his dirty true color as a heinous traitor, flunkeyist, and civilian traitor outdistancing the preceding military fascist dictators. If the United States and its followers think they can subdue [kulbok] us with pressure and threat, they are mistaken. That method may lead the situation to a catastrophe [paguk], far from resolving the problems. The United States should look straight at the reality and act with discretion and drop at once the reckless plan of Patriot missile deployment to South Korea.
