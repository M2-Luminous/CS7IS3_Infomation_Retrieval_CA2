FBIS4-53552 "dreas098_a_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-098 Daily Report 20 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Coalition Defines Term `Universal Security' Coalition Defines Term `Universal Security' OW2005110394 Tokyo KYODO in English 1050 GMT 20 May 94 OW2005110394 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- The governing coalition Friday [20 May] sketched out an official view concerning the definition of a controversial phrase on Japan's defense policy that has been under parliamentary fire from the opposition. The wording "universal security" was inserted into a common policy platform document under an April 22 agreement by coalition parties as a prerequisite for launching the coalition government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. The document of policy coordination commitments said the coalition "recognizes the fact that the Japanese Constitution adopts as its ideal universal security (to be guaranteed) by the United Nations, while it allows Japan to actively join U.N. activities for peace and maintain the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty." The day's announcement defined the wording as "the whole framework of measures for maintaining peace and security to be taken by the United Nations." It said the coalition decided to use the adjective "universal," as the perception of such measures for maintaining the security of a country "is taken as a matter of course by the whole international community." The announcement also defined another disputed phrase, "collective security," the clarification of which has been demanded by opposition interpellators in House of Representatives sessions since May 11. It defined collective security as "appropriate measures taken in solidarity by the international community, in order to restore peace, against a country or group which invades another or destroys or threatens peace." It called attention to the U.N. Charter as the reference document that "stipulates concrete measures" for restoring peace. Hata earlier told a Diet session that the perception of universal security is identical to that of collective security. However, the announcement said Japan is under the constraints of its Constitution "when Japan participates in or cooperates with U.N. activities designed to restore peace and security." Article 9 of the Constitution bars Japan from using military forces to resolve international disputes.
