This morning the government delegation held a meeting, and the mediators met separately with the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] delegation in yet another attempt to persuade them to change their stand, which is distant from the mediators'proposal. The proposal, which is called the master document, follows a study by the observers on principles presented by each of the disputing sides. In the afternoon the sides held a face-to-face meeting which resulted in all doubts on general principles being dissipated. The sides overcame the general principles and are getting ready to attend the first debate on specific issues in the Mulungushi Conference Center tomorrow. As we mentioned yesterday, the master document contains about 12 points, five of which have already been discussed. The remaining points concern the police's judicial statute, that is, to whom the police are answerable in future, to a civilian or a military court, as well as the integration of UNITA elements in the police. There are rumors that Chief Beye intends to hold a meeting of the military leadership of the two sides in Sao Tome and Principe simultaneously with the Lusaka negotiating round, to possibly set a date for the cease-fire. However, both the government and UNITA reject the allegations on the supposed meeting as it has already been agreed that the military leadership's meeting will only be held 10 days after the signing of a formal agreement by the current Lusaka negotiating round.
