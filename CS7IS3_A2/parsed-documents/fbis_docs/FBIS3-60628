The U.S. delegate made insidious remarks that the United States would "not resume negotiations" with the DPRK unless the continuity of nuclear safeguards was ensured. And the director general of the IAEA groundlessly said "there is possibility of North Korea having transferred nuclear substances to other places as the regular lifespan of inspection cameras has come to an end". The outcry of the U.S. and IAEA sides that the continuity of safeguards on nuclear activities of the DPRK were undermined is a totally unfounded talk, and it is a dirty act reversing black and white. At present, the inspection cameras and seals of the IAEA remain attached to the nuclear facilities of the DPRK. It is a sheer distortion of fact, therefore, to say that the continuity of safeguards on nuclear activities is on the point of suspension and that nuclear substances might have been transferred to other places. The DPRK is ready to receive an inspection team for the readjustment or replacement of inspection cameras at any moment if the agency requests. This stand of the DPRK will remain invariable till the nuclear problem has been solved completely through DPRK-USA talks. Thus, inspection cameras are enough to ensure the continuity of safeguards. But the DPRK, taking the position of the U.S. side into consideration, manifested the lenient stand that the range of inspection may be further expanded, and had already informal contacts with the U.S. side and proposed working negotiation to the IAEA side, too. Nevertheless, the U.S. and IAEA sides contended that the DPRK should accept "wholesale inspection" by the agency in order to ensure the continuity of safeguards, setting it as one of the preconditions for the holding of the third round of DPRK-USA talks. This is an argument that cannot convince anyone. The United States should come out at an early date to the third- stage DPRK-USA talks with an honest attitude, instead of setting unreasonable "preconditions". And the IAEA side must refrain from despicable acts of throwing a wet blanket over the talks any longer.
