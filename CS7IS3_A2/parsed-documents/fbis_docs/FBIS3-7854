Sixty members of the Special Air Service (SAS) force, who are experts in mountain warfare and know the local languages, entered Bosnia secretly 11 days ago. British Prime Minister John Major gave permission for the operation after consulting United Nations officials, said the SUNDAY EXPRESS, as carried by REUTERS. The newspaper also said that initial reports by the commandoes had supported U.N. Protection Force Commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, British General Michael Rose in his request for several thousand more peace-keeping troops. Gen. Rose used to be a member of the SAS. He led an SAS regiment in the action to break the seige of the Iranian Embassy in London in 1980 and took part in a secret operation in the Falkland Islands during the war between Great Britain and Argentina in 1982.
