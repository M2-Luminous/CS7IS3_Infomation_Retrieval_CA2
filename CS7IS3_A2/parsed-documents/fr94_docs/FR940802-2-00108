FR940802-2-00108 FR940802-2-00059 Other commenters raised questions or concerns regarding the Model Specifications for Evidential Breath Testing Devices, last revised on September 17, 1993 (58 F.R. 48705), or the Model Specifications for Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Devices (BAIIDs), published on April 7, 1992 (57 F.R. 11772). Issues such as these are outside the scope of the notice published in February proposing Model Specifications for alcohol screening devices, and therefore have not been addressed in this notice adopting Model Specifications. Specific Comments on Model Specifications No comments were received regarding some portions of the proposed Model Specifications. These portions have been adopted without change. For further discussion regarding these portions, interested persons should review the February notice. Portions of the proposed Model Specifications that generated comment, and the issues raised in the comments, are discussed below. 1. Purpose, Scope, Classification and Definitions In its February 15, 1994 notice, NHTSA proposed to define an alcohol screening device as a device that is used to detect the presence of 0.020 or more BAC, and that indicates the test result by numerical read-out or by other means, such as by the use of lights or color changes. All comments addressing these aspects of the Model Specifications supported the definition. They have been adopted without change. The notice proposed that the Model Specifications would provide that devices may measure any bodily fluid (including blood, breath or saliva), but that the output must be in blood alcohol concentration (BAC) units. It explains that NHTSA believes the relationship between BAC and the bodily fluid being measured be properly established so that a means for evaluating the device can be devised, and that NHTSA considers use of a one-to-one conversion factor between blood and saliva to be appropriate. NHTSA requested comments in the February 15 notice on the proposed use of a one-to-one conversion factor for saliva, and on what may constitute acceptable criteria for bodily fluids other than saliva, blood and breath. All comments regarding the one-to-one conversion factor and the applicability of the proposed Model Specifications to blood, breath and saliva were supportive of NHTSA's proposal. These aspects of the Model Specifications have been adopted without change. Comments were received from the manufacturer of an alcohol screening device that uses ocular vapor analysis. The type of analysis used by this device measures alcohol using vapors from the surface of the eye. The commenter requested that the model specifications include the ocular vapor analysis technique as an acceptable and recognized method. The Model Specifications, as proposed in the agency's February 15 notice and as finally adopted in today's Federal Register notice, define an alcohol screening device as a device that may measure ``any bodily fluid'' for the purpose of detecting the presence of 0.020 or more BAC. This definition is clearly broad enough to include use of the ocular vapor analysis technology. NHTSA did not include in its proposal, however, testing procedures for all conceivable types of screening technologies. Rather, it proposed testing procedures for the types of screening technologies currently most commonly available. The notice explained that the agency would modify and improve the Model Specifications as new data and test procedures become available, and that it would alter the test procedures, if necessary, to meet unique design features of specific devices. If the test procedures need to be altered to test the ocular vapor analysis technology, NHTSA would make such alterations. Any needed alterations would be published in the Federal Register . One commenter, a manufacturer of alcohol breath testing devices, raised concerns about devices that are not capable of detecting ethyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol. The commenter stated that if devices cannot identify all three of these alcohols, they will produce false negative alcohol readings. The definition of alcohol included in the proposed Model Specifications permits alcohol screening devices to detect different types of alcohol (including ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol), but does not require that devices must be capable of distinguishing between each type. To determine compliance with the Model Specifications, the agency proposed that it would conduct tests using ethanol.
