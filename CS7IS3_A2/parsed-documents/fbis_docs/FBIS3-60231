Figures given by the Forestry Ministry today show that China's forest area has been increasing at an annual growth rate of 1.65 percent during the past five years. The afforested area, totalling 33.79 million hectares, is the biggest in the world, figures from China's fourth forest resources survey show. China set up its national forest resources monitoring network in the early 1970s, which has now undertaken four surveys. During this fourth one, from 1989-1993, the forest resources growth rate was over 400 million cubic meters annually, a quarter higher than the annual consumption rate of 320 million cubic meters. With progress in stopping destructive felling, Xu said, the present problem lay in the low quality and low productivity of the forests. He said that the socialist market economy required better capital management of the forestry resources which could be realized as more state-owned forest-related enterprises become joint-stock businesses. Meanwhile, he said, the state was making new laws to give the forests more effective and stricter protection.
