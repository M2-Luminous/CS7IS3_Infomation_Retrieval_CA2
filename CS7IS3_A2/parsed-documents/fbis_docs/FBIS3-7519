"No decision has been made on such a cancellation," the official said. In a dispatch from Seoul, the Japanese daily said Monday it appears South Korea scrapped a plan to resume the '94 Team Spirit military exercise, a plan which Seoul made following North Korea's rejection of overall nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. ASAHI said that a final decision on the withdrawal of the plan to resume the joint Korea-U.S. exercise would be made after South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, now accompanying President Kim Yong-sam to China, would fly to Washington following his Beijing visit and inform the U.S. of the Seoul decision.
