"We have reached agreement on further joint efforts to turn Sarajevo into a peaceful city. This is the most important task today," Churkin stated. The possibility of perpetuating the tranquility in Sarajevo, achieved in recent days, was stressed during the Russian diplomat's meetings with Yasushi Akashi, representative of the U.N. secretary- general in former Yugoslavia, and General Michael Rose, commander- in-chief of the U.N. forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. On the same day, Churkin told Alija Izetbegovic, chairman of the presidium of Bosnia and Herzegovina, that the Russian battalion, which arrived in Sarajevo on february 20, would honestly and objectively discharge its duties in accordance with the U.N. mandate. He urged the Bosnian leader to do everything possible to rule out any unfriendly actions against Russian servicemen. Churkin stated that the situation in Sarajevo was calm and that there were no reasons for its escalation. In the meantime, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic told local journalists in Sarajevo that the Bosnian Serb intelligence possessed information about a new spate of provocations that is now being hatched by the Muslim side. He said that some Muslim combatants, clad in Serbian uniforms, were planning to attack the "Blue Helmets". Several bodies, dressed like Serbs, are to be left on the spot of the clash so that responsibility for the attack could be blamed on the Serb side. "We can expect a series of terroristic acts in the near future, like the ones we have witnessed in the Lebanon," Karadzic noted. The Bosnian Serb government also noted in its statement the possibility of provocations "from the Muslim or some other third side". It urged foreign journalists "to avoid premature conclusions and instigatory calls against the Serbian side."
