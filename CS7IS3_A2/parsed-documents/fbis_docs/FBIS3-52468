Vivekanand] [Text] Amman--The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) Tuesday [4 January] announced the lifting of a ceiling on fresh credits that commercial banks could extend to exporters. In a statement carried by the Jordan News Agency, PETRA, CBJ Governor Muhammad Sa'id al-Nabulsi said the management of the commercial banks could determine the volume of fresh credits they could grant to exporters. The move, Dr. al-Nabulsi explained, means that the credits that banks may extend to exporters are not bound by the general ceiling on fresh credits during the year as agreed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the economic restructuring programme under way in Jordan. He said the move came as part of the government's efforts to encourage exports and was adopted in light of "the positive changes witnessed in the monetary sector to conform to the CBJ's tendency to have indirect controls over credits facilities through the use of new monetary means such as certificates of deposits in Jordanian dinars." Another recent move by the government to encourage exporters was the exemption of up to 70 per cent of exporters' profits from income tax. Banking officials said they had received a CBJ circular informing of the relaxed credit regulations, which took effect as of Jan. 1, 1994. Dr. al-Nabulsi said the new regulations also replace earlier standing rules which restricted banks from extending loans to not more than 10 times their capital and reserves. In the context of credits for exporters known as packing credit in banking terms, the total amount extended should not exceed 90 per cent of the bank's reserves. The general ceiling on fresh commercial credits set by the IMF for the year was JD 400 million--JD 335 million for the private sector and the rest for the public sector. But the ceiling was broken as a result of high demand--the total of fresh commercial credit extended hit JD 360 million in the first seven months of the year--prompting the CBJ to introduce a series of restrictive measures. The measures included the limits related to capital and reserves of commercial banks and the banks' involvement in trading in the Amman Financial Market. Subsequently, the CBJ sought a higher ceiling and got IMF approval for another JD 60 million that could be extended during the last quarter of 1993 at a rate of JD 20 million per month. Banks which had already broken the ceiling were excluded from the addition. However, bankers said the additional credit came too late for the market to utilise it since the financial year was drawing to a close. The ceiling is set as a percentatge of the gross domestic product for the previous year. The government has been trying to exclude credits extended for industrial investment from the ceiling, arguing that such investment had contributed to economic growth and would be reflected in terms of increase in the gross domestic product. But the IMF argued that it was too early for such an exemption since Jordan was in the early stages of implementing the economic restructuring programme. It was likely that the IMF would respond positively to the Jordanian request at a later stage in the second phase (1993-98) of the restructuring programme.
