Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos made this statement in response to a question on the issue of Skopje following the meeting Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg had yesterday with Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, who is presiding over the European Union. The spokesman stated that there are no secret talks on this issue. He reiterated that Greece's positions are well known, adding that Foreign Minister Papoulias will go to the United States, where he will outline Greek positions to international mediator Cyrus Vance, who has already been briefed by Andonios Exarkhos, Greece's permanent representative at the United Nations. The government spokesman also repeated that any development on the Skopje issue depends on practical signs of goodwill by Skopje since, as he stressed, [Macedonian President] Kiro Gligorov appears to recognize the importance of good relations with Greece. These positions, Venizelos added, are not the positions of the government, but those of the Greek Republic, which Prime Minister Papandreou outlined in Brussels last week at the highest and most critical level, the NATO Summit. As is known, U.S. President Bill Clinton, European Union Commission President Jacques Delors, and the Greek prime minister, who is presiding over the European Union, participated in this summit. The government spokesman was also asked to comment on the personal statement of Public Order Minister Stilianos Papathemelis, who advocated an offensive if Skopje insists on the name Macedonia. The spokesman stressed that the government positions are only expressed by the prime minister. He said the minister has made it clear that his remarks were personal views.
