FR941207-2-00030 FR941207-2-00023 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;411&hyph;001] Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company; Rate Filing December 1, 1994. Take notice that on November 23, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Fifth Revised Volume No. 1, Substitute Second Revised Sheet Nos. 126, 128, 129, Substitute Original Sheet No. 659D and Third Revised Sheet No. 125. Tennessee states that the purpose of this filing is to comply with the Commission's October 27, 1994 order in the above-referenced docket approving Tennessee's proposed PAT Rate Schedule. Tennessee requests an effective date for the above-referenced sheets of November 1, 1994. Tennessee states that in its October 27 Order, the Commission conditioned its acceptance on Tennessee responding to concerns that the Commission had with the filing. In response, the instant filing, eliminates the reference to ``Shipper's facilities'' in ยง3.2 of the PAT Rate Schedule at Sheet No. 125. Second, Tennessee has clarified at Sheet No. 125 that scheduling under Rate Schedule PAT is subject to the same scheduling provisions as all other rate schedules. Third, Tennessee made the changes requested by the New England Customer Group at Sheet No. 659D. In addition to the above-described changes, Tennessee states that it has modified the nominations procedures to allow shippers to nominate PAT Service on a monthly basis during the Winter Season instead of requiring them to nominate on a seasonal basis. Tennessee has agreed to make this change at the request of shippers because monthly nominations will provide shippers with additional flexibility. Tennessee also states that, in response to concerns that certain restrictions on PAT service might not be necessary or might be discriminatory, restricting PAT service to storage points is necessary at this time in order to avoid problems with Tennessee's nomination and allocation system. Tennessee is willing to reevaluate the need for this restriction, but does not feel that it can ensure smooth operations for this winter without it. Similarly, Tennessee states that because all of Tennessee's storage interconnection points are covered by balancing agreements, the balancing agreement requirement will not prevent anyone from using this service this winter. If, after one winter season of operations, Tennessee removes the storage restriction, it will also reevaluate the need for the balancing agreement requirement. While Tennessee does not believe any waivers are necessary, Tennessee respectfully requests that the Commission grant any waivers it deems necessary for acceptance of this filing. Tennessee states that copies of the filing have been mailed to all of its jurisdictional customers and affected state regulatory commission. Any person desiring to protest with reference to said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211. All such protests should be filed on or before December 8, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to this proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file and available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30070 Filed 12&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
