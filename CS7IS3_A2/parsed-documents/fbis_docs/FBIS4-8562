Kaminski and Lech Kosciuk: "The Polish Wedge; If Policies Vis-a-Vis the West Eliminate Chances in the East, That Means They Are Bad"] [Text] Lech Kosciuk is chief expert at the Defense Ministry's Department of Strategic Studies, while Antoni Z. Kaminski, a professor at Warsaw University, used to be a director at the same department. While writing about Poland's security, they are making unpopular arguments, the most important of which is the following: A position based on making claims is the worst way of conducting foreign policy. We do not share the authors' suppositions that Poland's joining NATO would be disadvantageous to the West. While making efforts to join NATO, one should remember that Poland is just an element of the European security arrangement. Such a perception of Poland was the foundation for the recent decisions made in Brussels. The collapse of the bipolar system has not resulted in an elimination of dangers. The scale and nature of the dangers have changed, and they have become less clear, but, nevertheless, they continue to exist and to be a challenge for individual countries of the continent, as well as for international institutions. These circumstances make it imperative to maintain a global perspective while thinking about the foundations of European security. The world order, including the European order, is based on the strength and efficiency of institutions that constitute its foundation, regardless of the fact that those institutions were established in the period of the Cold War. Careless manipulation with institutional structures creates the danger of destabilizing the international order, and, consequently, of destabilizing also the global arrangement of forces. In other words, the disappearance of the bipolar world did not eliminate the need for thinking along the lines of a global arrangement of forces, and also along the lines of a feeling of responsibility for the fate of the world. This has important implications for both our membership in NATO and Russia's place in the European security arrangement. In the eyes of the West, the problem of Russia is linked to the dangers that are a consequence of that country's huge nuclear potential and numerous nuclear power stations, whose disastrous condition may lead to results that could be similar to those after nuclear weapons are used. It is unacceptable for Russia to give up its cooperation with the West by taking a hostile position and by becoming, for instance, an ally to countries ruled by irresponsible leaders (Iraq, Libya, North Korea) or by involving itself openly on the Serbian side of the Yugoslav conflict. This becomes a global strategic imperative. A development of uncontrolled processes inside Russia may bring about different, although equally disastrous for the world, effects--for instance, as a result of extremist elements seizing control of nuclear weapons. It may also bring about the danger of an uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear technologies and of nuclear weapons themselves. Polish people must be aware of all these problems while developing their relationship with the West. From the standpoint of the degree of advancement of transformations of the political and economic system, and also from the standpoint of the degree of coming close to the Western world, postcommunist Europe may be divided into four groups: 1) The Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia, and Hungary; 2) The Baltic states, Bulgaria, Romania, and the Slovak Republic; 3) Russia; 4) Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova. The first four countries listed are the most advanced in the process of building democratic structures and market economies. With regard to those countries, one can assume that the processes are irreversible and that the countries' institutional integration with the West will be accomplished relatively soon, through which the area of stability on the European Continent will be widened. The second group of countries listed will also most probably go down the same road, even though the countries' starting point is less advantageous than in the case of the first group. In particular, the countries face a much bigger danger of involving themselves both in domestic and external conflicts. The remaining two groups constitute special cases. Russia at a Crossroads Russia continues to be facing the choice of its way of development. In comparison with Ukraine and Belarus, Russia is still more advanced in the process of market transformations. It also has reached a certain level of stabilization and of strengthening its state structures, which cannot be said of the other two countries. It is worth stressing that, with its experienced diplomats, clerical personnel, and various experts in the field of international relations and strategic issues, and also having been a member of the world configuration of forces for hundreds of years now, Russia, the widely accepted successor to the USSR, has been handling its sovereignty much better than the other post-Soviet republics. Unless Russia falls apart, it will definitely retain the status of a world superpower. The question arises: What will its nature be? Will it be a civilized power, characterized by restraint, or will it be an Eastern despotic country? So far, it can be seen that Russia strives at incorporating the big Slavic republics and also at making the Baltic states dependent on Finland, to say the least. Russia's protest against Lithuania's joining "Partnership for Peace" is a clear sign of the above. Political destabilization in Ukraine, caused by the state's weakness, economic collapse, or by both factors at the same time, may lead to the Yugoslav scenario repeating itself on a much bigger scale and in a much more strategic part of Europe, not to mention the fact that nuclear states will be involved in these events. So we are witnessing strife that may lead to a serious change in the arrangement of forces in this part of Europe, and that may also result in major political destabilization and a consequent threat to security. Russia's turn in the imperial direction being described here is not irreversible. There is an awareness visible in Russian political circles that a reconstruction of the empire and market transformations are two separate and contradictory options. Symptoms of that are visible in responses to the Belarusian affair [not further specified]. It is not the case that the West errs in principle by thinking that it has the power to influence events inside Russia. The influence is not of course determinant, but, in a situation where Russian reformers remain a significant political force, the factor should not be ignored. One can agree with the view that the reformers also want Russia's position as a superpower to be rebuilt, but there is no doubt that they want to achieve this through different means. Leading Russian reformers are aware of a dilemma that exists between implementing imperial goals through political and military means on the one hand, and a continuation of the process of rebuilding the Russian economy, using the free market as foundation, on the other. A strong response by the West, primarily by the United States, may perform a sobering function. Intentions and Costs Postcommunist countries undergoing reforms began, naturally, to look for ways of linking themselves to Western political, economic, and defense structures. The countries wanted to gain, first of all, support for the reform process, as well as a minimum degree of protection. So they addressed the EC--currently the European Union [EU]--and also NATO. Those efforts caused a number of serious dilemmas for both of these structures. One of the more popularly debated dilemmas was the issue of a possible widening of the Community, which dominated its meetings in 1991 and 1992. As a defense structure established in the Cold War period, NATO was suddenly faced with extremely complicated problems of adaptation. The decrease in international tensions led to a reduction--an excessive one, according to some--in defense expenditures. Political pressure is increasing in the United States, aimed at reducing the U.S. military presence in Europe. True enough, NATO did introduce a number of major changes in its functioning: A "New Strategic Concept" was elaborated, the defense system has been reorganized, and, most importantly, an effort was made to open up the alliance to its former enemies. But the issue of accepting new members into NATO is a qualitatively completely different kind of decision. Technical obstacles, which are being considered by NATO member states and which are impediments to widening the organization, require a serious approach. Trevor Taylor, a British security expert, can see the following obstacles: --First, a negative impact of the decision to widen NATO on the political situation in Russia. --Second, a disorganization in the area of NATO's doctrine, structure, and development of forces. --Third, under conditions of economic recession, tensions would increase in the area of assets that have been excessively reduced to begin with. --Fourth, even debates on the granting of observer status in NATO to countries of East and Central Europe caused sharp differences of opinion among the alliance's members. If the issue of membership were to be debated, these discrepancies would definitely increase even more. As a result, a weakening of NATO's coherency would follow. --Fifth, given that countries with unstabilized political and economic structures would become NATO members, one could fear that the alliance would not be able to effectively influence the countries' behavior. Another problem along the lines of the Greek-Turkish one would weaken NATO significantly. --Sixth, other postcommunist countries with even more troublesome legacies would line up to become NATO members, and that would put in question the credibility of NATO's security guarantees. Finally, along with the withdrawal of Russian troops from East and Central Europe, the military threat was radically reduced, which means that these countries do not need to be NATO members to increase their security level. Some of the above arguments, especially the first and the last, could be subjected to well-justified criticism. But on one fundamental issue, the arguments remain valid: One cannot weaken the institutional structures on which West Europe's stability is based. Maintenance of the structures' strength and coherency is also in Poland's interest. That is because it is beyond any doubt that acquiring membership in an alliance that has lost its identity and credibility will fail to increase our security to any significant extent. It was only in January that Poland, which has fought for NATO membership in the most vigorous manner, has attempted to evaluate the costs of its participation in Partnership. It was soon discovered that the necessary funds are lacking, and a conclusion was drawn from that: The West should bear at least part of the expense of our participation. It also turned out that we cannot afford to have more than one company participate in joint maneuvers. That is not serious, given statements by some politicians that Poland's participation in NATO would greatly strengthen its defense capabilities. So NATO was faced with a fundamental question--how to respond to this situation in a way that could contribute to an increase of European peace and security, while satisfying the needs of the new democracies, while not losing its positive elements at the same time. The maneuvering room is delineated by the following fundamental conditions: involving postcommunist countries in political and military cooperation and providing the European Continent with a minimum degree of security; stabilizing and making permanent political and economic transformations in the area, which make East and Central Europe occupy a special position; preventing of the establishment of new divisions in Europe and not allowing for an uncontrolled collapse of the Russian state. "Partnership for Peace" is exactly NATO's response to these challenges. Partnership does not result in security guarantees that are provided for by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty (allies' obligation to mutual armed assistance in cases of aggression from the outside), but what it does do is create an opportunity for partners to conduct consultations with NATO members, as provided for by Article 4 of the treaty. The partnership formula does not formally discriminate against any European country, but it provides for a de facto diversification, depending on the extent of real involvement of the partner countries in cooperation with NATO, and also depending on the capability of meeting expectations associated with that cooperation. In other words, the Partnership formula creates an opportunity to create a material and functional association of ties that would closely link those countries that have the will and the capabilities to meet NATO's expectations. According to some representatives of the U.S. Administration, the decision on achieving NATO member status will be of a purely formal nature once a certain stage of cooperation has been reached. Partnership Is Not Bad Russia adopted an ambiguous position on the initiative (in the end, it decided to join the Partnership on 21 April). On the one hand, there were numerous statements by Russian politicians concerning the country's will to participate in the Partnership, and even concerning a possible joining of NATO in the future, provided it undergoes deep transformations. But, on the other hand, Russia took a negative stand concerning a widening of NATO to include countries of East and Central Europe, and even concerning participation of the republics of the former USSR in the Partnership. At the same time, Russia is making efforts for a widening of military cooperation among the member states of CIS, and to have them join the Collective Defense Treaty signed in Tashkent in May 1992. This means the creation of a new political and military arrangement on the territory of the former USSR, which has far-reaching consequences for European security. The possibility cannot be ruled out that, by playing this double-standard game vis-a-vis the West, the Russian leadership is hoping for a chance to recreate the division of Europe on currently the most advantageous terms, from the standpoint of Russia's imperial interests. But, even given this scenario of events, the Partnership concept is not bad because it enables the West to flexibly adapt itself to the circumstances, while not blocking any options, including those expected by the countries of East and Central Europe. Even in the case of the Partnership, the maneuvering room for Russia, which uses military instruments of foreign policies, is limited. This has put Russia in a dilemma: to join the Partnership or not? From Poland's perspective, participation in the Partnership will not be an easy task, taking into account both the financial standpoint and institutional adaptations. A paradox became visible here. As John Roper, a famous expert on international security, has noted, an increase in a country's feeling of security should lead to a decrease in the country's defense expenditures. But, in the case of postcommunist countries making their cooperation with NATO closer, an increase in the feeling of security must be accompanied by costly adaptation measures. It is an unavoidable price for joining West European security structures. Plus, one has to be honest: The rate of our preparations for making cooperation with NATO closer is not at akk impressive. In the context of the issue of cooperation with NATO, we must, in Polish policies, draw a few fundamental conclusions. So let us stress the fact that seems to be ignored by a majority of participants of debates on the Polish Republic's security policies: Poland is a country of key importance for Europe's future shape and for the future balance of power on the continent. So its geographical location is Poland's asset--that is, if the development of events in Europe facilitates creation of a common political and economic order. It is not the case that we have no impact on these events, but, if the situation develops unfavorably from our standpoint, we will be the first to suffer as a result of a possible European conflict. Mutual coordination of measures undertaken in the East and the West is a test for the quality of Polish policies in the area of international security. If political activity vis-a-vis the West reduces our chances of implementing our interests in the East, that means that either the strategic concept is mistaken or it simply does not exist. One has a feeling that this is exactly what we are dealing with right now. It can be seen particularly saliently in our relations with Ukraine. Poland, because of its geographic location, must conduct an active policy in all directions. Establishment of European security on a continentwide basis is in our strategic interest. This implies a need to widen the area of stability and cooperation as far to the East as possible. The "Partnership for Peace" proposal creates precisely such an opportunity. Moreover, in case events in the East take a turn that would be disadvantageous to us, the Partnership creates a chance for gaining the necessary protection against possible dangers. We for Ourselves While striving to be integrated with the West, we must show our understanding for the complexity of the circumstances surrounding policies of the countries that make up the West, and also of some international coordinating mechanisms. The West will only be able to meet our expectations if it manages to maintain its coherency and identity. This applies to both the EU and NATO. So Polish people must have a lot of understanding when it comes to resistance from the Western countries on the issue of a too rapid granting of member status to new democracies, and they must overcome the resistance in a skillful and very thought-through manner. It is a fact that the West's position often has particular interests of individual countries hidden behind it, but the West's position also includes some arguments of a general nature that would be hard to dispute. So a strong and integrated West is in our interest, but also a West that would be flexible and open enough to widen the system of its institutions to cover countries that, while striving at making use of the opportunities that participation in these institutions creates, are ready to observe the required rules and to take upon themselves responsibility for the continent's fate. The scale of the transformations going on in Europe is comparable to those that took place after World Wars I and II. The fact that we are creating this order without having waged a war, in the strictest sense, before that creation is a distinguishing trait of the current situation. Careless political measures can make such a war likely. The establishment of the new order in Europe is taking place under conditions of a high degree of uncertainty that, among other things, is a consequence of a diversification or unclear definition of interests and of perception of problems by the participating parties, as well as of a high risk factor for global and European security. So, before we ask "What should the West do for us?," let us ask "What can we do for ourselves?" and also "What could we do or propose to our neighbors and to Europe?" In the long run, a position based on making claims, especially in the area of security, is the least efficient method of conducting foreign policy.
