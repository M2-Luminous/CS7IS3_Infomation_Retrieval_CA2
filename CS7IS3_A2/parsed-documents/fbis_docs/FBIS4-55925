For the Free Democrats, it will decide if they enjoy enough support to implement their programme, he said. Should the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) win an outright majority in parliament, there are minimal chances of a MSZP-SZDSZ coalition being formed, Kuncze said, adding that a final decision would be up to the SZDSZ delegates' assembly on June 5. If the Socialists won more than 50 percent of mandates, the SZDSZ would have no genuine weight in any coalition, Kuncze told MTI, saying the Free Democrats are not willing to be coalition "extras". If the MSZP won less than 50 percent and the SZDSZ won about 25 per cent of mandates, the Free Democrats could have a genuine influence on government, Kuncze said.
