"In connection with this and other issues, I resort to the widely spread practice in the West and am challenging the head of state Eduard Shevardnadze to live television debates. "As on the eve of the visit by the head of state to the United States, when it became physically possible to adopt hastily an unlawful resolution, then I consider that there will also be time to hold television debates between us, provided that the head of state, beside having arguments, has the wish to participate in debates."
