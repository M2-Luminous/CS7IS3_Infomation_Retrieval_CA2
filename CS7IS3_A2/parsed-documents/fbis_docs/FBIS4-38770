A plenary session of the Supreme Soviet of the Crimea is opening today to discuss questions relating to the present situation. The reaction of the Crimean parliamentarians will depend on what decisions the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet passes today, believes Chernyatevich. The Crimeans hold a wait-and-see position which can be described as the state of civil readiness, according to Chernyatevich. He expressed the confidence that the people would allow nobody to violate its Constitution. "Kiev must reckon with the fact that we have a nationally elected president and a nationally elected Supreme Soviet, and the will of the people is something that one has to reckon with," said the Crimean president's adviser. Right today Petr Chernyatevich intends to meet with the commander of the Ukrainian National Guard, Colonel Aleksandr Kostyukov in order to find out the reasons and aims of the continuing movements of the units subordinate to him.
