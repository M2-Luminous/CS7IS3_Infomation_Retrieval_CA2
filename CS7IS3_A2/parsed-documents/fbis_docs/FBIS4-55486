Majevica AU1605190294 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network in Serbo-Croatian 1700 GMT 16 May 94 AU1605190294 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network Serbo-Croatian BFN [Report by the Press Center of the 206th Chivalrous Brigade of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army from the Zvornik front] [Text] Since early morning the aggressor has been pounding the entire Zvornik free territory with tanks, howitzer batteries, and mortar batteries of all calibers. At the same time on the Mt. Majevica section of the front, the aggressor has been trying in vain with combined artillery and infantry attacks to break through our newly established defense lines. The brave fighters of the 206th Chivalrous Brigade of Zvornik, commanded by Commander Semsudin Muminovic, have rapidly and effectively repulsed a number of infantry attacks by Karadzic's cutthroats, defying a maelstrom of shells that has been raining down on them. The chetniks seem incapable of understanding that they have suffered a total defeat on the peaks of Mt. Majevica, and are constantly launching new infantry attacks, ignoring the bodies of dozens of their fellow fighters that will forever remain on these peaks.
