The average voter has not yet become interested (because he has not had the opportunity) what kind of choice is offered to him today, or why the future Supreme Council will be better than the current one in reality and not in theory. Starting last Monday, then, Channel Two of the Ukrainian television began to review all registered movements and individuals. The television offered voters live coverage of candidates in the Pryrichnyy election district No. 14. Let us state from the start that the candidates from that district (as well as their voters) struck out with this broadcast. First of all, because they were the first ones in this telemarathon. By the time the elections come around, the people (at least those who were able to see that broadcast) will have long forgotten their impressions of the candidates. Unfortunately, it fell to that district to go first. It missed out on the broadcast time, as well. On this subject, candidate Georgiy Andreev declared openly that for this extremely important broadcast the Ukrainian television had purposefully selected the hour in which the smallest possible number of viewers would see their candidates. What is surprising is that under pressure from voters the Ukrainian television changed its schedule for other districts. Finally, the organization of the broadcast also turned out to be the proverbial first try. The television not only failed to inform viewers about the candidates' platforms (even though the broadcast was called "Candidates' Platforms") but did not even make an effort to represent those respectable people as normal human beings. Instead of showing us individuals, the program was dominated by guesswork, having put to the candidates a question (which sounded more like an attempt to embarrass them): who is still watching and listening to you? If the goal of the Ukrainian television had been to discourage them, it achieved it fully.
