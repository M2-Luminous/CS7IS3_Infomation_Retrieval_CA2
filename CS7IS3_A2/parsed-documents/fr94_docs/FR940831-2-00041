FR940831-2-00041 FR940831-2-00030 The Department recognizes that these policies can be most effectively achieved for pending cases through the cooperation of the contractors and the law firms involved. The Department intends to work closely with the contractors to ensure a smooth implementation that will not compromise the defense of pending matters. III. Guidance These policies apply to reimbursement of present and former M&O contractors for amounts paid to outside law firms and consultants (``outside firms'') in connection with litigation to which the contractor is a party, except to the extent the contractor's own litigation procedures or current retainer agreements contain more cost-restrictive provisions. The Contracting Officer, or his or her designated representative (hereinafter ``Contracting Officer''), may, after consultation with Department counsel, authorize an exception to the policies described below based upon economy, the interests of the Government, or other good cause. These policies may be modified, from time to time, as the Department determines appropriate. The Contracting Officer has authority to exclude from these policies cases whose expected costs of defense are less than $25,000 and/or routine matters handled by outside counsel retained and supervised by an insurance carrier. A. Interim Policies Contracting Officers shall refer to and consider the following policies in determining the reasonableness of contractor litigation costs. The failure to specify or describe a particular category of cost in paragraphs III.A.1. through III.A.10. does not imply that such category of cost is either allowable or unallowable. 1. Terms Of Engagement In order for costs incurred by an M&O contractor for an outside firm to be considered reasonable, they shall be incurred in accordance with the terms of engagement between the contractor and the outside firm which have been approved by the Contracting Officer. The terms of engagement between the contractor and the outside firm shall incorporate and include the policies included in paragraphs III.A.1. through III.A.10. of this AL. The terms of engagement shall also provide that the outside firm will comply with the Department's Litigation Management Procedures, which, among other things, require a Staffing and Resource Plan (for significant cases), periodic case assessments and budgets, adequate audit provisions, and notification to the Department and the contractor of any significant change in the Staffing and Resource Plan. a. Bills and invoices. All bills and invoices shall reflect the information and contents set forth in the model format of Attachment A. Any bill or invoice shall also contain a certification signed by a representative of the outside law firm to the effect that: ``Under penalty of law, [the representative] acknowledges the expectation that the bill will be paid by the contractor and that the contractor will be reimbursed by the Federal Government through the U.S. Department of Energy, and, based on personal knowledge and a good faith belief, certifies that the bill is truthful and accurate, and that the services and charges set forth herein comply with the terms of engagement and the policies set forth in [this Acquisition Letter], and that the costs and charges set forth herein are necessary for the litigation.'' b. Audit. All terms of engagement must contain a provision for auditing expenditures under the terms of engagement to determine and ensure compliance with the terms of engagement and the provisions of the prime contract, and to determine the accuracy of any bill or invoice for the services of the outside firm. The provision shall include a statement that: •[The outside firm] expects that the costs of the services rendered under the terms of engagement will be paid by the contractor and that the contractor will be reimbursed by the Federal Government through the U.S. Department of Energy. •[The contractor] and the Department of Energy, its designated representative, and the General Accounting Office, have the right upon request, at reasonable times and at reasonable locations, to inspect, copy, and audit all records documenting billable fees and costs under the terms of engagement, the systems employed by [the outside firm] to capture, record, and bill the fees and costs, and any other records relevant to the representation by the outside firm under the terms of engagement. •[The outside firm] will retain all such records for a period of three (3) years after the final payment under the terms of engagement. •The provision does not constitute a waiver of any applicable legal privilege, protection, or immunity with respect to disclosure of these records to third parties. 2. Fees In determining whether fees or rates charged by an outside firm are reasonable for purposes of approving a contractor's terms of engagement with an outside firm, the Contracting Officer shall consider whether the contractor sought the lowest reasonably achievable fees or rates (including any currently available or possibly negotiable discounts) from the outside firm, whether the contractor considered rates available from other firms providing comparable services, and whether the contractor considered alternative rate structures such as flat, contingent, and other innovative proposals. 3.
