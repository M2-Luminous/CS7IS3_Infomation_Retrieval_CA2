This is how participants in the coordination conference on security that was held the day before yesterday [22 June] by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk assessed the present crime-breeding situation in our state. Our peace and harmony are in danger. Ukraine's citizens have found themselves defenseless before the onslaught of crime. Not just so-called rank-and-file citizens, but also those who have both money and power. The murder attempt on people's deputy V. Bortnyk and very recent cases of murdering Ukrainian businessmen confirm this. According to the statistics of Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs, the number of contract murders involving firearms has tripled. As asserted by deputy minister of internal affairs Yuriy Kravchenko, a black market of weapons has emerged in our country; a pistol can be procured for just $500, a submachinegun for $3,000, and a carbine -- for between $1,500 and $2,000. It looks like the criminal world is openly mocking us. A few days ago, the automobile of justice minister Vasyl Onopenko was stolen. Onopenko is now clutching at his head because the juridical nonsense according to which car thieves are still divided into those who actually steal the car and those who simply drive it away has not yet been abolished. The punishment for driving away an automobile is like patting the criminal on the back. The black market and black humor: Had the criminals stolen that automobile earlier, the minister would have started pondering the nonsense earlier. Leaders of power departments -- Ukraine's Security Service, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Procurator General's Office are again demanding that the struggle against crime be enhanced by legislation, in particular, preventive detention of suspects for 30 days, mandatory capital punishment for the murder of officers of law-enforcement bodies, state officials, and people's deputies, the creation of strong legal executive structures, and so on. The minister of justice also proposes that order be established in issuing quotas and licenses, that the right to register entrepreneurs be transferred from local bodies to his own department, and that people's and oblast judges be nominated by presidential edicts. At the same time, head of the Security Service Yevhen Marchuk also sees salvation from the revelry of crime in creating strong presidential power with an experienced president at the head and in adopting primarily those legislative acts that are aimed at protecting the individual, and believes that a situation may take shape when we will be compelled to resort, as he put it, to some elements of an emergency situation which, in his opinion, the people will support. We are not talking about an emergency situation, stressed Leonid Kravchuk, but about extraordinary measures for combating crime. Having just issued several edicts -- on the return of hard currency from abroad and on the struggle against speculation -- he is ready to come out, as soon as possible, with a corresponding legislative initiative before the parliament. The president is also convinced that the criminal world has declared war on us and that we, in turn, should also get organized and declare war on crime.
