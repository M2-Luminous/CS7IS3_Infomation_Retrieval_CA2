The Iranian foreign minister replied: "I firmly deny that there are Israeli MIA's on Iranian territory." This was the first time the Iranian foreign minister publicly answered an Israeli correspondent and reacted to the claim that Iran is holding Israeli MIA's or POW's. Commenting on Velayati's remark, an Israeli source said last night that, as far as Israel is concerned, Iran is responsible for the MIA's and POW's. The source said that Velayati's remarks "do not relieve Iran of its responsibility for the Israeli MIA's and POW's. It may well be that none are held on Iranian soil, but we hold Iran responsible for the affair." According to the Israeli source, Israel continues dealing with the issue of the MIA's and POW's on all levels, including a special effort in the international arena, in order to bring the affair to an end.
