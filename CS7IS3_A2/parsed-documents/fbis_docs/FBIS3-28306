The author, who specializes in using computers for evaluations of future events, did a simulation. Japan in a Global Context Estimates concerning the future of Japan's economy are being done using various techniques, but it is thought that the global modeling which the author is researching is particularly worthwhile. Global modeling is not a specialized knowledge that relates only to the specific field of economics, but has its greatest distinction in the fact that it is a super interdisciplinary field of study. For the purpose of taking countermeasures on and solving global problems that human society is confronted with, it is essential to supply information by future forecast simulations using global modeling. The FUGI (Futures of Global Interdependence) global model introduced here classifies the world into 80 countries or regions. It is a global model in which each country or regional group model is mutually dependent on a global scale. At present, the computer being used to calculate this model is the IBM-RISC 6000 workstation and the software used is the FGM/FUGI-GEMS, developed independently. Using this model, the results of a forecast based on reductions in income tax and increases in the consumption tax in the Japanese economy from 1993 to 2000 have been shown in the table. In making this forecast, a standard forecast was first performed. A standard forecast is one in which past data and structural parameters of a model inferred from that data is based on the assumption that there will not be drastic changes in the future. Herein, the economic countermeasures executed up to now by the Japanese Government have already been interwoven, and gradual removal of nontariff barriers due to loosening of import restrictions is also taken into consideration. Also, it anticipates that oil prices which were $17.3 per barrel in 1992 will be $21 per barrel in 2000.

The gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate is the actual calendar year growth rate at 1985 constant prices. 2. Income tax cuts will start one year from now in 1994, and the current 3 percent consumption tax rate will be raised in 1995. 3. This simulation is a policy scenario in which only tax rates are changed and the consumption tax system remains the same. Scenario A: 5 Trillion Yen Individual Income Tax Reduction and an Increase in the Consumption Tax to 5 Percent This forecast simulation of the Japanese economy is based on a policy scenario in which the government, grappling with economic countermeasures and modifications of indirect tax rates, decreases personal income taxes 5 trillion yen, aiming to reduce the ratio of indirect tax starting in fiscal year 1994. At the same time, utilizing the strong yen and easing import restrictions to prevent a drop in economic growth due to a hike in consumption taxes, it raises the consumption tax from 3 percent to 5 percent beginning in fiscal year 1995. According to this forecast simulation, the growth rate of Japan's economy will increase 0.30 percentage points (rounded to the nearest hundredth) in 1994 compared to the standard forecast, but by raising the consumption tax 2 percent there would be a 0.00 percentage point decline in 1995 and, further, a 0.20 percentage point decline in 1996. Beginning in 1997 until 2000 the growth rate would recover and an increase with respect to the standard forecast of an increase of 0.07 percent to 0.01 percent could be expected. The rate of increase in consumer prices would rise 1.10 percentage points in 1995 when the consumption tax is implemented compared to the standard forecast, and rise to between 1.8 percent and 2.9 percent, but after that it will converge with the 2-percent growth track of the standard forecast on into the year 2000. In 1995, due to the 2-percent increase in the consumption tax rate, 4.8 trillion yen in increased revenue from the consumption tax would be anticipated. Since the amount of expected revenue increase in 1996 would be 5.1 trillion yen; in 1997, 5.4 trillion yen; 1998, 5.7 trillion yen; 1999, 6.1 trillion yen; 2000, 6.6 trillion yen, the amount of increased consumption tax revenues would exceed the amount of reduction in income tax, and in 1999 the national finance would achieve a sound condition. Scenario B: 7.5 Trillion Yen Individual Income Tax Reduction and a Consumption Tax Increase to 6 Percent This forecast simulation of the Japanese economy is based on a policy in which the government attempts to reduce the ratio of indirect taxes by a reduction of the individual income tax of 7.5 trillion yen beginning in fiscal year 1994. At the same time, utilizing the strong yen and easing import restrictions to prevent a drop in economic growth due to a hike in consumption taxes, it would raise the consumption tax from 3 percent to 6 percent beginning in fiscal year 1995. According to this forecast simulation, although the growth rate of the Japanese economy will probably rise 0.45 percentage points in 1994 compared to the standard forecast, the 3-percent increase in the consumption tax rate will likely lead to a 0.01 percentage point decrease in 1995 and a 0.30 percentage point decrease in 1996. It is expected that there would be increases from 1997 until 2000 of 0.11 percent, 0.02 percent, 0.02 percent, and 0.01 percent. The consumer price rate would appear to increase 1.58 percentage points in 1995 when the consumption tax rate is hiked compared to the standard forecast, and would increase to between 1.8 percent to 3.4 percent, but later it would converge with a growth course of the standard forecast of about 2 percent. It is expected that there would be increased revenue of 7.2 trillion yen from consumption taxes due to the hike in the consumption tax in 1995. Since it could be expected that the increased revenue in 1996 would be 7.7 trillion yen; in 1997, 8.1 trillion yen; in 1998, 8.7 trillion yen; in 1999, 9.2 trillion yen; and in 2000, 9.9 trillion yen, the increased revenue from the consumption tax would exceed the amount of increased revenue from the income tax, so national finances would be converted to a sound condition in 1998. Scenario C: 10 Trillion Yen Individual Income Tax Reduction and a Consumption Tax Increase to 7 Percent This forecast simulation of the Japanese economy is based on a policy scenario in which the government attempts to reduce the ratio of indirect taxes by performing a reduction in individual income tax of 10 trillion yen beginning in fiscal year 1994. At the same time, utilizing the strong yen and easing import restrictions to prevent a drop in economic growth due to a hike in consumption taxes, it would raise the consumption tax from 3 percent to 7 percent beginning in fiscal year 1995. According to this forecast simulation, although the growth rate of the Japanese economy will probably rise 0.61 percentage points in 1994 compared to the standard forecast, the 4-percent increase in the consumption tax rate will likely lead to a 0.01 percent decrease in 1995 and a 0.40 percent decrease in 1996. It is expected that there would be increases from 1997 until 2000 of 0.14 percent, 0.02 percent, 0.03 percent, and 0.02 percent. The rate of increase in consumer prices would appear to increase 2.10 percent in 1995 when the consumption tax rate is hiked in 1995 compared to the standard forecast, and would increase to between 1.8 percent to 3.9 percent, but later it would converge with the growth track of the standard forecast of about 2 percent. It is expected that there would be increased revenue from consumption taxes of 9.7 trillion yen due to the 4-percent hike in the consumption tax in 1995. Since it could be expected that the amount of increased revenue in 1996 would be 10.3 trillion yen; in 1997, 10.9 trillion yen; in 1998, 11.6 trillion yen; in 1999, 12.3 trillion yen; and in 2000, 13.3 trillion yen, the increased revenue from consumption tax would exceed the amount of reduction in income tax, and in 1999 the national finance would achieve a sound condition. Scenario D: 7.5 Trillion Yen Individual Income Tax Reduction (5 Trillion Yen Cut in Individual Income Tax + 2.5 Trillion Yen Cut in Corporate Income Tax) and a Consumption Tax Increase to 6 Percent This forecast simulation of the Japanese economy is based on a policy scenario in which the government attempts to reduce the ratio of indirect taxes by implementing a reduction in individual income tax of 5 trillion yen and a reduction in corporate income tax of 2.5 trillion yen beginning in fiscal year 1994. At the same time, utilizing the strong yen and easing import restrictions to prevent a drop in economic growth due to a hike in consumption taxes, it would raise the consumption tax from 3 percent to 6 percent beginning in fiscal year 1995. According to this forecast simulation, although the growth rate of the Japanese economy will probably rise 0.46 percent in 1994 compared to the standard forecast, the 3-percent increase in the consumption tax rate will likely lead to a 0.01 percent decrease in 1995 and a 0.18 percent decrease in 1996. It is expected that there would be increases from 1997 until 1999 of 0.15 percent, 0.02 percent, and 0.00 percent, but a 0.02 percent decline in 2000. The rate of increase in consumer prices would appear to increase 1.57 percentage points in 1995 when the consumption tax rate is hiked in 1995 compared to the standard forecast, and would increase to between 1.8 percent to 3.4 percent, but later it would converge with a growth course of the standard forecast of about 2 percent. It is expected that there would be increased revenue from consumption taxes of 7.2 trillion yen due to the 3-percent hike in the consumption tax in 1995. It could be expected that the amount of increased revenue in 1996 would be 7.7 trillion yen; in 1997, 8.1 trillion yen; in 1998, 8.7 trillion yen; in 1999, 9.3 trillion yen; in 2000, 9.9 trillion yen; therefore, the increased revenue from consumption tax would exceed the amount of reduction in income tax, and in 1999 the national finance would achieve a sound condition. When one compares scenario B and scenario D, even though they both have the same 7.5 trillion yen decrease in income tax, one sees that scenario D's combination tax reduction of 5 trillion yen in individual income tax and 2.5 trillion yen in corporate income tax is preferable. The Optimum Combination Zone for Policy Numerous scenarios besides A, B, C, and D described above have been tried, and as a consequence it has been found that there exists an optimum zone among increases of the income tax reduction amount and the consumption tax rate. For instance, in scenario C if the consumption tax rate is increased from 7 percent to 8 or 10 percent, the economic growth rate drops, rendering useless the effects of an economic countermeasure consisting of a 10 trillion yen in income tax cuts. As an economic countermeasure, it is most effective to make income tax cuts as large as possible while keeping the consumption tax rate low. However, for instance, in scenario A the consumption tax rate is lowered from 5 percent to 4 percent, which would give rise to a situation of collecting insufficient revenue. Future simulations will be predicated on the current consumption tax exemption mechanism and structure remaining unchanged, so if this premise changes, the relationship between income tax cuts and consumption tax rate increases will also change. In particular, if they were to be based on the abolition of the limited exemption system that excludes a set amount of tax for businesses whose taxable sales amount to less than 50 million yen, the contraction of the applicable range for a simplified taxation system, the abolition of tax exemption measures for businesses whose taxable sales are 30 million yen or less, among others, it could be expected that the same consumption tax rate increase would yield further tax revenue. In this simulation of economic countermeasures we tried to keep the problem simple. We did not simulate taxation measures to control the global environment, tax cut measures for research and development (R&D) in science and technology, or domestic expansion measures via futuristic urban planning. Some of these would include expansion of park space, improvement of high-speed traffic and information and communication networks, construction of super high-rise residential buildings to let people be closer to their workplace due to easing of land and building restrictions in the metropolitan centers, etc., as development strategies for Japan's economy from a long-term range into the 21st century. Rather, I wanted to focus on pointing out the importance of the problem.
