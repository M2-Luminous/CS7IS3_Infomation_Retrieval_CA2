Therefore, the posts and telecommunications industry will soon build a market- and client-oriented business and service system to completely improve posts and telecommunications service focusing on improving the service style and solving crucial problems. According to the ministry's plan, problems in installing and relocating telephones will basically be solved within two or three years. Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, provincial capital cities, and coastal open cities should strive to create the necessary conditions for installing telephones in a timely manner; time for repairing problematic telephones should meet the standards set by the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry; the problem of inaccurate telephone billing should be solved within a specified period; the system of allowing telephone users to inquire about telephone billing should be strictly implemented; time for mail delivery should be shortened; mail should be delivered to all accessible buildings in urban areas; and letters and newspapers should be properly delivered to all villages. Wu Jichuan said: In addition to setting our eyes on the market and providing a series of regularized services, we should develop a service supervision mechanism that combines the efforts of posts and telecommunications departments and of our clients, and develop a system for feedback regarding our clients' complaints. Those who arbitrarily interrupt communications or retaliate against our clients must be severely punished on charges of sabotaging communications. Wu Jichuan stressed: From the perspective of safeguarding our clients' rights and interests, we should support our clients in filing complaints to higher authorities and in resorting to legal action. At the meeting, Wu Jichuan particularly demanded that the public's recent responses to the postal and telecommunication service be relayed to the meeting's attendees. These responses included motions on the postal and telecommunication service tabled by National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference members; and the masses' response to the postal and telecommunication service reported by national newspapers, such as RENMIN RIBAO, XINHUA DAILY DISPATCH, and GONGREN RIBAO. This was the first time that such responses were relayed to attendees of a national posts and telecommunications meeting.
