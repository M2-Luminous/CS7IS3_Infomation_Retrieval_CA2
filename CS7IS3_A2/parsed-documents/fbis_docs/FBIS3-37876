N. Nazarbayev's talks with B. Clinton -- at first one on one, then with the delegations -- lasted a total of three hours. In the estimation of the president of Kazakhstan, considering that this was his first meeting with the head of the present White House administration, the hopes that were being pinned on it fully justified themselves. The central place was occupied by a discussion of the problems of bilateral relations between Kazakhstan and the United States, of the situation in the CIS countries and in the Central Asian region, of politics in the world's "hot spots," and of questions of security. The chief document signed as a result was the "Charter of Democratic Partnership Between the Republic of Kazakhstan and the United States of America," embracing questions of politics, economics, defense, science, technology, ecology, and others. According to Nazarbayev, it contains guarantees of security accorded to Kazakhstan by the United States and also stipulates the conditions of multilateral cooperation within the NATO "Partnership for Peace" program -- which in itself, he elaborated, certainly does not constitute Kazakhstan's joining the North Atlantic bloc. Nazarbayev also reported that the U.S. President announced a significant increase in the size of financial aid for Kazakhstan -- to $311 million. The stopover made in Paris at the request of French President Francois Mitterrand developed into a discussion of the progress in implementing the French-Kazakhstani accords reached earlier. One of the new accords consists in the fact that a renowned top Parisian school of management will welcome a large group of students from Kazakhstan. "There have always been and will be Russian interests in Kazakhstan, just as there are Kazakhstani interests in Russia," Nursultan Nazarbayev said in reply to a question from REUTERS about consideration for these interests in the process of developing contacts with the United States. "Therefore we do not draw up a single large or small-scale international program without inviting the Russian side to participate in it." The journalists participating in the news conference showed a lively interest in the facts cited in IZVESTIYA correspondents' reports (IZVESTIYA Nos. 29 and 32) concerning the Kazakhstani president's position during his U.S. visit -- a position "emphatically independent of Moscow's policy." Nazarbayev deemed it necessary to make his elucidations on this score after asking your correspondent to reproduce in the newspaper everything he said with the utmost accuracy. The state of affairs in Russia is of interest to everyone, Nazarbayev said. Cadre reshuffles in the Russian Government are also of concern to the U.S. Administration -- what changes of political course might they lead to? I have always replied to these questions as follows: It is necessary to gamble not on names but on the process of democratization and economic reforms taking place in Russia. I do not consider V. Chernomyrdin's present government to be conservative -- first, because I know Chernomyrdin himself well; second, both Chubays and Shokhin remain in the government, while Gaydar and others can continue to exert effective influence and give assistance by working in parliament. Nobody will succeed in reversing the processes that have already been accomplished in Russia. It is essential to assist them, these processes -- I always emphasized this in America, Nazarbayev said. With regard to the allegation that "Kazakhstan sold Baykonur without taking Russia's interests into account," Nazarbayev reported that only a treaty on the protection of "know-how," providing for the nonproliferation to third countries of space technologies provided by the United States, was signed during his U.S. visit. It was signed by the leaders of three aerospace departments -- U.S., Kazakhstani, and Russian -- and Mr. Koptev, the head of the latter, accompanied Nazarbayev on his trip. Nor was the Semipalatinsk range "sold," Nazarbayev asseverated -- there was talk exclusively of U.S. technical assistance in conducting the necessary scientific research there into the consequences of nuclear tests and of giving assistance in rehabilitating the territory and the population affected by them. With regard to the strategic missiles which are to be dismantled Nazarbayev confirmed that Kazakhstan is reckoning only on compensation for the value of the highly enriched uranium which constitutes the main "filling" of nuclear warheads. According to the president of Kazakhstan, there was no need for Bill Clinton to convince his guest of the need to construct an oil pipeline from Tengiz to Novorossiysk, its construction is already close to completion, and Russia is one of the full participants in the construction. The planned capacity of the Novorossiysk oil pipeline, however, is just 17 million tonnes of oil a year, whereas, according to estimates, Kazakhstan intends to export 50-60 million tonnes from the North Caspian regions. If we look into the 21st century, Nazarbayev said, of course we cannot manage with this oil pipeline alone, and it is becoming simply essential to construct a large-capacity oil pipeline to the south, across Turkey and Iran, with an outlet not just to the Black Sea but also to the Persian Gulf. Nazarbayev particularly emphasized that no documents directed against any third countries were examined or signed during his visit -- they all concerned exclusively bilateral relations between Kazakhstan and the United States. He also asseverated that neither Kazakhstan's enforced departure from the ruble zone nor any other circumstances had made him betray the principles of integration among the former components of the USSR which he has upheld throughout recent years: "Nazarbayev has not changed and will not change. At least not in this life. Whatever the press might say, Russia remains our top-priority, chief partner." Just a little later he made a proviso: "True, it does take two to tango. For proper cooperation willingness on the part of the partner is also necessary."
