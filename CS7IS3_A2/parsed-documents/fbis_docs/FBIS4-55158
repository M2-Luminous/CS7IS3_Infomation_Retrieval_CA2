By this convention -- adopted on 4 November 1950 and signed or ratified by all member states of the Council of Europe -- as well as by the ten protocols added subsequently, several civil and political rights are guaranteed: the right to freedom and security of the individual, the right to an equitable civil and criminal trial, freedom of expression, the right to free elections and respect of property. The adopted draft provides however under the following reserve: "The adoption of the convention shall not prevent Romania from putting into application the legal provisions through which military discipline is regulated and neither shall it impose additional financial obligations related to the private education system, others than those set under the domestic law". The convention has been previously adopted by Romania's Senate.
