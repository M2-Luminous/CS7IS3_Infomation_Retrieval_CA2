All work now underway is due to be completed by the June 30 deadline. The Tsing Ma bridge, topped out on Monday, is slightly ahead of programme and well on course to be completed before June 1997. The airport site reclamation work is also ahead of schedule, while construction of other key core projects, including the West Kowloon reclamation and the North Lantau expressway, is well advanced. Trafalgar House, one of the companies in the Anglo-Japanese construction consortium building the Tsing Ma bridge, confirmed this. "As far as we are concerned, China's comments do not affect us, because the bridge will be handed over to the Hong Kong Government prior to June 1997," said Anthony Hasluck, a Trafalgar House spokesman in London. He said design and building firms working on the airport core projects were being paid by the Government as work progressed. What China's comments may do is to deter companies from bidding for work which overlaps the handover. This almost certainly includes the airport railway, which has been delayed by more than a year. It could also affect the airport terminal, although the Provisional Airport Authority has appointed several companies to advise on how construction can be speeded up. But firms will want to see proof that China is serious about canceling contracts before they take action. Many are aware that this is the second time the Chinese authorities have threatened to cancel orders which straddle the 1997 handover. China's statement also places a fresh question mark over the future of Container Terminal Nine. The Port Development Board has been waiting more than a year for the go-ahead from China to award the concession. Any further delay will place even more pressure on the existing facilities. Interest in several of Hong Kong's other major infrastructure projects could also be torpedoed. Among these are the Country Park section of the Route 3 highway to China which has just gone out to tender; the strategic sewage disposal strategy and plans by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation to extend its heavy rail network. But to what extent this happens depends on how companies interpret China's declaration, which said that only projects which had not been approved by the Chinese side would be revoked. So while the Central reclamation and Western Harbour Crossing are apparently unaffected by the Chinese threat, the position is less clear about Route 3 and the sewage disposal project, even though the Chinese authorities have given their tacit approval to both.
