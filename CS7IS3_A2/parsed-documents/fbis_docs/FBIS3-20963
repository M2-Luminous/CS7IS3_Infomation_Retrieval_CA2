This involves two adjacent facilities to be financed in different ways: one will be a joint project of German business to develop future technology for electronic semiconductors and the other a semiconductor factory which is being planned by Siemens in association with the Japanese electronics company Toshiba and the Center for Microelectronics in Dresden (ZMD). Experts say that the proximity of the research institute to the production facility is particularly interesting. Following the decision of the Daimler-Benz company to manufacture their products in Rastatt, this project is also regarded as further evidence from major industries that new production projects located in Germany are possible. With DM2.4 billion in investments spread over 10 years, this will be the largest microelectronics project in Europe. At the same time it is said to be the only production site in which the entire technology of chip manufacture will be employed in production. The project is to be presented this Thursday in Dresden by Siemens board chairman Heinrich von Pierer and Federal research minister Paul Krueger (CDU). Negotations on the project have been conducted in strict secrecy over the past three weeks. In Siemens' plan for chip manufacture, Toshiba is to acquire 25 percent of the shares and the Center for Microelectronics five percent. The Commerzbank AG and the Dresdner Bank AG are participants in the ZMD. The production center with 1,200 jobs in its final stage is to be constructed next to the ZMD research park. The companies can count on public subsidies of 35 percent of the investment total. These are not research budget funds. The principal chip production in Dresden will be of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for telecommunications and automotive electronics. The production of memory chips is possible, but is not to be of central importance. The plant is to embody the concept of the "mini-factory" for microelectronics. A modular structure is intended to ensure that the transition to the next semiconductor generation can be achieved at relatively low cost. The new factory is to begin with the 16-megabit technology and gradually widen its range to include up to 256 megabits. The research and development unit ("nested factory") is to consist of about 100 workers. Its task is to evaluate new chip manufacturing technologies and introduce them into production. The goal is to lower the wastage rate, which is sometimes 60 percent. The companies hope that an increase in profits will partially offset the cost disadvantage in comparison with semiconductor production in low-wage countries. The experience gained in the optimization of production technologies is to be made available to all German businesses. Besides Siemens, Daimler-Benz, IBM and Bosch also figure prominently here. These companies had already summed up their ideas over the summer after negotiations with the Federal government in a "consensus paper" on microelectronics. The Federal Research Ministry then agreed to support joint projects with other partners. The companies are reckoning on DM25 million. For example, a personnel exchange e.g. with Bosch or Daimler-Benz is anticipated. At the beginning of December, the research ministry invited businesses to participate in the "chip factory of the 21st century." Siemens also invited other companies to work with them. The project is considered the first concrete effect of the agreements which were made as early as the spring in the "microelectronics dialog" between the ministries of research and the economy on the one side and German industry on the other. German microelectronics manufacturers had agreed to support one another in the introduction of new technologies or in cases when difficulties arose with the technology so that valuable specialized knowledge would not have to be kept within each company. Bonn says that the conditional pledge of support does not mean an about-face in research policy. It is said to be important that Germany possess not only research institutes but also production plants for the newest chip technologies. Even within the government coalition there have been varying opinions over the past few years about the question of whether the state should support production plants for microelectronics. The construction of a Siemens factory for memory chips was already under discussion two years ago. But Siemens decided against making this investment and noted that these electronic components could also be produced in existing locations. According to the company, the decision about the plant now being planned was accelerated by the investment plans of Texas Instruments (TI) in Saxony. The company wanted to produce 64-megabit memory chips there.
