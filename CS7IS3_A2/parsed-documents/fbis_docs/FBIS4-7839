More than a month has passed since the new economic program was launched on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. At the same time, on the territory of the republic of Srpska [RS] and the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK], there has been virtually no money of any kind for three months now (except for the German mark, naturally), and so the economies of these areas have functioned without their own money. It is not necessary to talk about what kind of fatal consequences this has had for the state of fiscal discipline. It is interesting that that situation has been explained by the authorities, which in normal conditions would quite certainly have lost their position long ago because of the absence of money, wages, and taxes, in terms of the need to create the preconditions for union with Serbia and Yugoslavia, by failing to issue their own money. That logic would mean that the economy should be put in a difficult position so that inclusion in the FRY's monetary system would be a cheap solution. It is necessary to recall, however, that even at the moment that this article is being written, the dinar has not fully functioned in the areas west of the Drina, even though those in power have announced that several times. It seems that "Mother Serbia" is much more reserved toward her daughters, than the daughters' desire for their mother to take them back under her auspices. That is also demonstrated by several facts. First, the RS and the RSK do not appear in the program anywhere. All the balance-sheets for public and budget spending have been created for the FRY independently, and one of the tasks was reducing "aid" to the Krajinas to 5 percent of the social product. Second, not one economist from the countries west of the Drina participated in creating the program, nor was the state of the economy in those areas a subject of interest to the economists who worked on the program. Third, although the authorities in both countries west of the Drina adopted a decision a long time ago on inclusion in the monetary system, it is still not functioning, primarily because of fear in the FRY that inclusion of the Krajinas would disrupt the system's stability and jeopardize the program. We have already stated that after lengthy and arduous talks and numerous political problems, however, a decision was made (apparently reluctantly) that the new dinar would also function on the territories of the RS and the RSK. The precondition for that was that they would deposit foreign exchange funds in the National Bank's foreign exchange treasury. Faced with the lack of any other alternative, the authorities in these two republics agreed, and withdrew the last of the foreign exchange from their otherwise already empty foreign exchange reserves and sent it across the Drina. In the case of the RS, that is estimated to be about 20 million marks. Those funds, which were difficult to find, are not even enough for a month for all the budget beneficiaries. The Krajinas were not in a position to provide more, however, because they simply do not have it. Whether it is decent to demand foreign exchange from areas that are at war, even for an amount of dinars that will in any case remain in the Krajinas and thus not burden demand in Serbia, is a completely different question. One thing is certain: In a similar way the Krajinas "have already been" in Germany's monetary system, because they could have marks--by exchanging other foreign exchange or by exporting goods and services--just as is now the case with Yugoslavia and the dinar. After the initial purchase, the economy and the budget should secure the necessary dinars from regular transactions. For an economy laboring under the war and enormous public spending, and which is operating at 15-20 percent of capacity at most, that position is both theoretically and practically untenable. Therefore, and especially because of the situation with state finances, Avramovic's program will have very negative consequences for the economy of both Krajinas. Naturally, the program is not responsible for this, but rather the situation in the economy is such that it is fascinating how people have succeeded in financing the war so far. The program will lead to a more rapid collapse of the inflationary illusion that the economy is functioning. The concept for the RS's and RSK's inclusion in the monetary system provided for several control mechanisms by which the FRY tried to protect itself against a possible lack of financial discipline, which in a way could also be insulting to those in power in the countries west of the Drina. Thus, in practice, the national banks of these future "republics" of Yugoslavia are disappearing; the auditors of the federal payment transactions service are beginning to monitor the work of the local services; through the "unified record account" the influx and outflow of money from the Krajinas to Yugoslavia and vice versa will be monitored daily, weekly, and monthly. One can assume that the formula of a "unified record account" could also serve as a pretext for possibly blocking payment transactions in the event that the account is overdrawn. Furthermore, it has been realized in the Krajinas that the whole concept of the program has to be transferred consistently, and thus laws and decrees are being almost literally copied. To the best of the professional public's knowledge, not one of the members of the team or the state officials who are working on its implementation in the FRY has been present in these areas, or has suggested any sort of solutions. Even everything said so far would not be that much of a problem if the degree of economic unity were complete, and if the budgets of all the republics were prepared and supplied according to the same principles. In this way, the monetary system is unified; for the time being customs duties are still in operation; the fiscal system is different, with the income side, since the regulations have been adopted, dependent upon measures in the FRY and Serbia, while the expenditure side of the budget has been left to the local governments. All of this indicates that the implementation of the current program will have very difficult consequences for the economy and state in the RS and the RSK. Instead of a magic wand, the waving of which would ensure a miraculous leap into a society of abundance (which retirees, the army, education, and health care, which have not received wages for a long time now, are expecting anyway, under the influence of the media), these areas will be affected by a further decline in production and even more by an empty state treasury, with all of its repercussions for a country at war, whose expenditures are quite certainly twice as high as the available social product. Any other situation would be equivalent to a miracle.
