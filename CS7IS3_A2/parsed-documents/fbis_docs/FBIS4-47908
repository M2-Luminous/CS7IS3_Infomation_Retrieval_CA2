Our good will and patience during activities and negotiations are completely exhausted. Above all, the Zairian people is living in an inhumane situation. For this reason we decided to set up an Armed Branch of the Radical Opposition [Branche Armee de L'Opposition Radicale]. It seems the only way out of the crisis," said Jacques Matanda-ma-Mboyo, member of the executive committee of the USORAL [Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and Allies], a broad coalition of opposition parties, in an interview with DE STANDAARD. Matanda comes from Bandundu. He belongs to a generation of young politicians who have never served under President Mobutu Sese Seko and now "wants to make a new sound heard." He is president of the Confederation of Reformist Nationalists (CNR) [Confederation des Nationalistes Reformateurs], a political pressure party which is part of the USORAL. He played an important role in organizing the so-called "dead city" days of protest which entirely paralyzed urban life. On 22 March 1993, Matanda was offered the position of deputy interior minister in the transitional government of Etienne Tshisekedi, but he declined the offer. "I could not reconcile myself with the endless dirty tricks of men who are looking out mainly or exclusively for their own interests," he said. "Nearly all of them had eaten out of Mobutu's hand in the past and they are still under his influence. I decided to withdraw and leave the country to take a more effective path with some people thinking along the same lines," he said. For three months, Matanda lived in Angola and for another month and a half he lived in the turbulent Congo town of Brazzaville. There he realized "that you can only get some rulers on their knees and break through the suffering of inhumane situations under the pressure of armed action. The history of Israel, South Africa, Angola, and Zimbabwe provide abundant proof of that," he said. He then made contact with armed opposition groups in Uganda and Tanzania and took the South African ANC as an example. From Europe, he is now making the final preparations for his activities. "We are not planning a conventional war," Matanda explained. "Rather we are planning well prepared commando actions which can escape the reach of even a large and trained military apparatus like Mobutu's. It will make him mad and eventually make him surrender. We are hoping for a good deal of support from the diaspora and are counting ultimately on a mobilization from Kinshasa and inside the country." Matanda lost his belief in any political solution due to both the stubbornness and untrustworthiness of President Mobutu and the high- handed intervention of Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo as chairman first of the National Sovereign Conference and later of the High Council of the Republic and the extended transitional parliament. "Mobutu has never kept his word and will not do so tomorrow. It does not harm him that the people is starving. He is clever and knows how to turn every situation and every agreement to his advantage. Monsengwo became the victim of that and in turn the prelate did not hesitate, especially in his international contacts, to push aside the representatives of the Zairian people and follow his own path. Both men believe that they are above any law and that we must dance to their tune for ever. In fact, one is the other's hostage. We want to break this circle of power and suffering in the shortest possible time," Matanda said.
