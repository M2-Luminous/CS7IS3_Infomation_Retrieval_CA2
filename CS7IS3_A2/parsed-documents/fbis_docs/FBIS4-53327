The nine bills, likely to be approved by the cabinet Friday, are in line with the government's emergency economic stimulus packages announced in September last year and February this year, MITI said. Among other things, the bills are aimed at the scrapping of obligatory reporting by companies of the formation of export associations, the removal of mandatory antidecay treatment for lumber to allow for more efficient lumber use, and freer creation of chambers of commerce and industry. The bills will be submitted to the current Diet sitting along with 31 other deregulation bills drawn up by other ministries, MITI said. In a related move, MITI said Tuesday it will set up next Monday offices to receive public complaints, requests and opinions on MITI's deregulation steps. The offices, to be created in MITI's Tokyo headquarters and its local units in Sapporo, Sendai, Nagoya and six other major cities, will be open from Monday through Friday each week, MITI said.
