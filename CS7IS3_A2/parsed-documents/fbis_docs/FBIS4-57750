From left to right, they are Panamanian Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero; Salvadoran Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria; Belizean Foreign Minister Dean Barrow; Guatemalan Foreign Minister Gladys Maritza Ruiz de Vielman, spokesperson for the Central American foreign ministers; Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo; and Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal Sanchez. I will now pass the microphone to the Guatemalan foreign minister, who will be the spokesperson for this meeting. [Ruiz de Vielman] Good afternoon. As spokesperson for the Central American foreign ministers, I welcome the members of the media and thank you for your coverage of this event, which is very important for the region. We have held a special meeting in Tegucigalpa, Honduras to discuss matters of interest for Central America. We have also taken this opportunity to discuss subjects we will present tomorrow when the Central American presidents meet with U.S. Vice President Al Gore in Tegucigalpa. We have discussed topics of special interest for all our countries. Specifically, we have discussed an alliance for sustainable development. This is a novel and very important concept for the region because sustainable development can be the axis around which the policies of the governments of the region revolve so our countries and the Central American region become a pilot plan for sustainable development. We have also discussed trade issues in preparation for tomorrow's presidential meeting. We reviewed the possibility of receiving the same benefits Mexico receives from the United States. This initiative has been discussed in our region, and our ambassadors have also reviewed the subject in Washington. Another important point on the agenda is the induction of the United States as an extraregional member of the Central American Development Bank. The fourth subject was the international conference for peace and development to be held in Tegucigalpa in October. Those are basically the points we discussed, and as always, the discussion took place in the usual climate of cordiality and cooperation, as is the case with all Central American meetings. [Reporter] I would like to know if you have discussed whether Central America will have a unified stand on Haiti. [Ruiz de Vielman] The topic of Haiti was not addressed. We did not consider it in our agenda because it is not a regional topic. These are topics that would have to be addressed at the bilateral level by each country. [Reporter] Could you expand on the issue of commercial relations with the United States? What will Honduras' position be? [Ruiz de Vielman] The Central American region's position is one of requesting that the advantages we have under the Caribbean Basin Initiative not be harmed in any way by NAFTA. For some time, we have been asking the U.S. Government to give us the same benefits that Mexico enjoys. This is an initiative that has been promoted for some time. These efforts will take several months, but we are confident that at some time, we, as a region, will enjoy treatment equal to that of Mexico. [Reporter] Do you have any specific data on this U.S.-Central American alliance? [Ruiz de Vielman] Last November, the Central American presidents proposed the Alliance for Sustainable Development Initiative to President Clinton. We hope to discuss it tomorrow with Vice President Gore, as he is well aware of this matter. He is even the author of an important book on the subject. Sustainable development is a very innovative concept which allows governments to streamline their policies for fighting poverty, undertake democratization, and deal with other state issues within the general context of protecting the environment. [Reporter] What will happen to Salvadorans in the United States? There is some concern that the Trifinio Plan will create difficult situations for Guatemala and Honduras, as the over one million Salvadorans who have to return to the country may be relocated there. [Ruiz de Vielman] The foreign ministers' meeting held today did not deal with bilateral problems or situations of particular states. The Salvadoran immigrant problem is a bilateral issue between the United States and El Salvador. [Reporter] Costa Rican President Jose Figueres Olsen has [words indistinct] countries which help clean the air must receive some benefit for this service to humankind. The proposal basically states that countries like the United States and Canada, which has pollution-producing companies, must compensate countries that favor [words indistinct]. Will you discuss this proposal tomorrow? [Ruiz de Vielman] We believe that some aspects of sustainable development policy are technical. In this foreign ministers' meeting, we have expressed our government's commitment to adopt the philosophy of sustainable development as a guiding policy principle. For the time being, we will not refer to specific projects or cooperation accords. [Reporter] What should Central America expect from Al Gore's visit? [Ruiz de Vielman] Central America should expect a [word indistinct] dialogue, a dialogue within the framework of cooperation and friendship. [Reporter] Central Americans have great expectations for the arrival of the U.S. vice president. [Words indistinct] sustainable development, but these countries, with an enormous foreign debt, earmark large portions of their budget for debt payments. [Words indistinct] being taken to make sustainable development a reality. [Ruiz de Vielman] Given our limited time tomorrow, some important points, such as the one you addressed, will be deferred for discussion by technical groups. The issue is important, but all our governments will deal with it bilaterally. [Reporter] Will the foreign debt issue be raised with Mr. Gore? [Ruiz de Vielman] The foreign ministers have not yet reached a decision on that. I do not know if the presidents will discuss it later. [Reporter] First, will there be any request for special treatment for Central America regarding foreign debt payments and negotiations with international credit organizations? Second, how united is Central America in light of the fact that Costa Rica has already begun bilateral negotiations with Mexico? [Ruiz de Vielman] Regarding foreign debt negotiations, I reiterate [words indistinct] thus far during this meeting, we have not decided to discuss this topic. Regarding Central American unity, we believe that following recent elections in the area, Central America is being strengthened by new leaders who favor regional integration and cooperation. We think Central America is advancing along the path of integration and full cooperation. [Reporter] What about the foreign debt Central American countries have with the United States? Would it be possible to [words indistinct] with the U.S. vice president to reach a solution? Could you tell us more about the peace and development plans that will be discussed during the meeting [words indistinct] in our country? [Ruiz de Vielman] I reiterate: The foreign debt is not on the foreign ministers' agenda, but we will consider the many questions that have been raised on the matter. As for the peace and development meeting in Tegucigalpa, we think it is very important because we will discuss topics of great interest to everyone. All foreign ministers are making a special effort to contribute ideas and work toward the conference. [Reporter] Who prepared the agenda for this meeting with the U.S. vice president? Considering Central America's huge foreign debt problem, it is inconceivable that this issue was not included. [Ruiz de Vielman] The agenda was drafted by the Central American technical groups, which arrived in Tegucigalpa two days ago. These groups chose regional topics and outlined the agenda while taking into account the limited time available on 24 May. [Reporter] Will there be any proposals to reduce the size of Central American armed forces since the area is no longer plagued by war? [Ruiz de Vielman] I reiterate: That topic is not on the agenda. We have tried to focus on regional topics excluding those issues involving bilateral or individual interests. [Reporter] Since the topics that interest us most are not on the agenda, could you be more specific about the Central American proposal to the U.S. vice president and sustainable growth? What specifically is this proposal about, and what can we expect from this meeting with the U.S. vice president? [Ruiz de Vielman] The idea of this meeting is not to make specific requests concerning the way issues are focused on. The idea with regard to sustainable growth is to express to the U.S. Government the willingness of the states, individually and as a region, to accept the concept of sustainable growth as a government objective, which will guide our policies in that direction. In addition, we want to tell the United States that we are already organizing at the technical level the adequate mechanisms that will lay the groundwork for advancing in that direction as a region. That will be one of the topics we would like to address in the Summit of the Americas at the end of the year. For the time being, we want to express our political willingness to direct our actions along this path. Above all, we will also request parity for area countries within the framework of the benefits the United States granted Mexico and, at a given time, joining or becoming cosignatories of NAFTA. Joining NAFTA would be our second initiative in the commercial area. [Reporter] Considering the U.S. vice president's environmental background and [words indistinct] in the past years of U.S. companies dumping toxic waste in Central America or establishing industries that pollute the environment, will this issue be discussed with the U.S. vice president? [Ruiz de Vielman] Of course. The fact that Central America is embracing a philosophy related to sustainable growth necessitates a position that will not allow any other country to bring polluting industries to the area. This is part of the general concept we will discuss as the initiative and as the guideline for government policies we will implement. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] total parity or only in a few areas? [Ruiz de Vielman] We do not know exactly what will be open to the region, but we believe it will be partial. We do not know what eligibility criteria will be used for such a parity. We only have general information, but tomorrow when we make the request we are going to try to get the U.S. Government to define more clearly the extent of the coverage and the eligibility criteria. [Announcer] The news conference held by the foreign ministers has just ended. Guatemalan Foreign Minister Gladys Maritza Ruiz de Vielman has just finished speaking.
