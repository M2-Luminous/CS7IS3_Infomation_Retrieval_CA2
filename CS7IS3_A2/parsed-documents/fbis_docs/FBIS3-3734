He stressed: With regard to development in Gansu and the western region, you must keep a cool head in acknowledging existing gaps, must not be outdone, must seize favorable opportunities, must march courageously, and must speed up development. While meeting with the deputies from our province, Jiang Zemin made an enthusiastic speech. He said: Due to the shortage of time, I was not able to take part in your group discussion, which is why I have come to call on you today. We all know that we are, in the final analysis, making concerted efforts for the prosperity, flourishing, and development of the entire Chinese nation and the People's Republic of China regardless of our different nationalities, religions, or convictions. I often stress that he who has wealth speaks louder than others. This must not be interpreted as everyone being incumbent to make a fortune. This is not what I mean. The people's standard of living must be increased, but this does not mean that everyone must make a fortune. We must make our country's economic power strong. In my view, becoming wealthy means the development of our national economy as a whole and the overall national power of our country. Jiang Zemin pointed out: I have visited Gansu twice. My general impression is that there is a certain gap between the western region and the coastal areas in economic development. Gaps have existed among various countries in the world. This is also the case with the developed capitalist countries. Even in the United States, there are differences between the east and west coasts and between the southern and northern regions. Gaps among them exist. There are definitely gaps among our 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, and such gaps cannot be narrowed within a short period of time. Jiang Zemin urged the Gansu people's deputies to keep a cool head in acknowledging such gaps and to never remain content with lagging behind because of a poor foundation and meager heritage. They must march forward courageously to attain the economic development target. In a word, they must reach this target. With regard to the speed of economic development throughout the country, the more proper the speed is, the better the results that can be achieved. If the speed of economic development is excessive, it will ultimately be slowed down. We will then suffer great losses. If we fail to develop our economy at a speed which is obviously achievable through hard work, this also means losing the favorable opportunity for development. Therefore, we must seize the favorable opportunity to promote our economic construction as soon as possible. Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat, accompanied Jiang Zemin to meet with the Gansu people's deputies.
