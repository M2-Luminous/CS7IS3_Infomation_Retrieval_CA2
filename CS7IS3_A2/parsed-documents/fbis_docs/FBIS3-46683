"There is no time for dissolution," said Watanabe, leader of the third largest faction in the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, citing domestic economic factors. "If (general) elections take place, Diet approval of the state budget for the next fiscal year would be in may, and pump priming measures will be postponed further." Rather than concentrate now on the divisive issue of political reform, Watanabe again urged that four pending reform bills be carried over to the next regular Diet session, which convenes in late January. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on December 24 apologized to the public for failing to achieve political reform by his self-imposed yearend deadline, and vowed anew to pass the reform legislation by the time the current Diet session ends January 29. A special political reform committee of the House of Councillors only began deliberations on the government's four political reform bills on December 24, 36 days after the House of Representatives passed the package. Remarking on another contentious issue during a lecture here Sunday, Watanabe said the consumption tax should not be raised two or three years after a planned income tax cut is carried out. Rather the consumption tax rate, now standing at 3 percent, should be raised once signs of economic recovery are evident, Watanabe said.
