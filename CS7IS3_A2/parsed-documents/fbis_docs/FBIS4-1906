The total length of the roads has reached 35,359 km. Although it is rich in natural resources, 50 percent of Henan is mountainous, and transportation problems have hampered rural economic development. In the drive for reform and opening to the outside world, the provincial government has worked out a strategy for the development of transportation by collecting funds from various channels. In the past eight years the province's Luanchuan County alone has invested over 14.9 million yuan (about 1.5 million U.S. dollars) in rural highway construction.
