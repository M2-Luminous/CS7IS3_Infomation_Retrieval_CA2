During the meeting, Birkavs acquainted the NAA delegation with the signed Latvian-Russian agreements on troop withdrawal and the beginning of their implementation. Birkavs thanked NAA for support to the Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia and urged NATO countries to monitor the implementing of the signed agreements, especially what regards the continued operation of the Skrunda radar facility. Birkavs reiterated that Latvia's security policy was unambiguously oriented toward joining the North Atlantic alliance. Latvia views any form of military cooperation with Russia as unacceptable, Birkavs added. The officials also touched on NAA assistance in the formation of the Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion. Corterier and Bouvard also met Friday [20 May] with Latvian Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis, parliament Chairman Anatolijs Gorbunovs and government officials. NAA is an interparliamentary organization that acts as a legislative forum of the North Atlantic Assembly member states. It aims at promoting mutual understanding and information exchange. The three Baltic states and nine other former Communist bloc countries are NAA associate members. It means they may participate in the assembly work and debate but may not vote.
