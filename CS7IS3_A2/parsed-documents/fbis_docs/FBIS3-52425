The Palestinian leadership and the PLO Executive Committee have instructed the delegation to act in a way that serves and reinforces the interests of both sisterly peoples. There is no doubt that we do not want to see any crack in the Jordanian-Palestinian relationship. In fact, we are keen to further strengthen this relationship, particularly at this time, during which Israeli is trying to evade its commitments to the peace process. The Palestinian leadership noted, in its recent meeting, that coordination with Jordan is inevitable and necessary. [Samawi] Your Excellency the Ambassador, his majesty the king reiterated in his recent speech the special nature of the Jordanian-Palestinian relationship. In light of the inevitability of coordination in this stage on the highest levels, how did the Palestinian leadership in Tunis receive the king's speech? ['Abd-al-Rahim] The Palestinian leadership discussed his majesty's speech in its recent meeting. It read the bright side of the speech, which expressed concern for holding coordination with the PLO, for crystallizing the independent national Palestinian identity, and for highlighting the PLO's role. It also highlighted the national Jordanian concern for reinforcing coordination in all fields to serve the Palestinian people's steadfastness and to ease their suffering inside the occupied Arab territory. Therefore, we received the speech differently from the way others seem to have received it. We made a sound assessment of its content. We found that, as in the recent meeting and before that, his majesty has kept his pledge and was concerned about all these objectives. This strengthens our negotiating stand in this stage in which Israel is trying to weaken our negotiating stand.
