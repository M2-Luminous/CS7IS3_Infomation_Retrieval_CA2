He said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE that political parties should realign by this summer to allow time to hammer out policies and prepare candidates for the House of Representatives elections. "The elections for the House of Councillors are planned for next summer and general elections (for the lower house) under the new electoral system could take place anytime after January next year," Ouchi said. The DSP chief said the biggest challenge facing Japanese politics today is to lay the foundation for one or two political parties that could take over the reins of government from the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The LDP ruled for 38 years until Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, head of the fledgling Japan New Party, launched a seven-party coalition last summer. Ouchi praised Hosokawa for making a "courageous decision" not to reshuffle his cabinet, a move aimed chiefly at getting rid of Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, the head of new party Sakigake. He said in the interview that the Hosokawa administration would have fallen apart if it had proceeded with a 7 percent national welfare tax program and a cabinet shake-up. Ouchi blamed Shinseito secretary general Ichiro Ozawa and his Komeito counterpart Yuichi Ichikawa for the ill-fated scenarios, and said such high-handed politicking could lead to a collapse of the coalition government.
