Watanabe, a former deputy prime minister and former foreign minister, hit a snag as he apparently failed to garner enough supporters within the LDP for his bid to run for the top government post, the leading business daily said. Two major forces in the ruling alliance -- Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito (Clean Government) -- had been backing Watanabe as a replacement for Hosokawa under the assumption that the Social Democratic Party, the largest contingent in the coalition, and the new party Sakigake (Harbinger) be ousted from the coalition and Watanabe and his followers join the coalition. However, Shinseito and Komeito seemed to have reached the conclusion that they could hardly push ahead with their Watanabe campaign in view of the slim possibility of his bolting from the LDP with his followers to team up with them, news reports said, quoting sources close to the two parties.
