FBIS4-35092 "drlat125_h_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-125 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 Honduras Army Chief Admits Discussion of U.S. Air Units Army Chief Admits Discussion of U.S. Air Units PA2806192394 Tegucigalpa LA TRIBUNA in Spanish 28 Jun 94 p 12 PA2806192394 Tegucigalpa LA TRIBUNA Spanish BFN [Text] General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, chief of the Armed Forces, admitted yesterday that U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry hinted at the deployment of U.S. troops from Panama to support Honduras' drug interdiction efforts. The officer then immediately pointed out that it would not be the first time such deployments have been carried out. "I have nothing against the democratic spirit, but at the meeting only generalities concerning cooperation and support were discussed." The U.S. Government plan envisions deploying U.S. Air Force units stationed in Panama to Honduras to support the country's efforts against drug trafficking. Honduran civilian authorities were informed of this on 25 June at the Enrique Soto Cano Base in Palmerola, Comayagua. Discua Elvir avoided commenting on the conflict that took place between Defense Secretary Perry and Honduran Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar, arguing that "President Carlos Roberto Reina is the one who establishes guidelines, courses of action, and foreign policy for the Armed Forces." "They (the Americans) are trying to implement preventive measures and operate in areas where drug trafficking takes place, locating sea, air, and land routes," Discua reiterated in reference to the drug issue. He added that this would make it possible to exchange community projects, resolve the housing problem, and deal with individual security. Discua explained that the expense of handling aerial equipment for this operation would be paid by the United States. Discua also spoke about the groups that are trying to divide the civilian population from the military. He said they are known because "we are a small country." He said, however, that the Armed Forces are trying to rediscover the path to convergence from which Honduras strayed because of imposed missions or because of a poor concept of national security. Gen. Discua Elvir yesterday spoke extensively about various issues -- including changes within the military -- admitting that the eighth graduating class is taking over the leadership that the sixth class, of which he is a member, is about to leave. Nevertheless, his demeanor and tone changed when he was asked about the alleged anonymous threats reported by the Committee of Relatives of Missing Detainees in Honduras (COFADEH), which has directly blamed him. "It bothers me. Yes, it bothers me to discuss that because I do not know who is carrying out such pranks or campaigns that prevent people from working," he said. Discua Elvir said that a certain person who wants to create confusion is behind this situation. "The Armed Forces are not involved in that. Please, I believe that will be enough! he concluded.
