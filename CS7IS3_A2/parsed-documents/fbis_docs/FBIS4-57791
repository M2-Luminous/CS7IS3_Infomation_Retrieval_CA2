Legislator Alonso Fernandez acknowledged that the treaty should undergo certain amendments because it was not discussed by the people. Meanwhile, Legislator Mario Boyd Galindo said anything that tends to ease the transition of the Panama Canal to the Panamanians is appropriate. It can be pointed out that, according to Legislator Alonso Fernandez, the amendments to the Torrijos-Carter Treaty should be negotiated between the Panamanian president and the U.S. President. Meanwhile, Legislator Mario Boyd Galindo believes President Bill Clinton is giving Panama the importance it deserves because it is of vital importance for U.S. trade. "Clinton's statements are very forceful because he knows very well that many Panamanians want the treaties to be amended, Legislator Alonso Fernandez indicated. Legislator Mario Boyd Galindo said: "The proposals made by President Bill Clinton to Congress to reorganize the Canal Commission's corps are fitting and necessary."
