Tsai] [Text] Taipei, May 24 (CNA) -- The state-run China Steel Corp. on Tuesday [24 May] entered into a shareholders agreement with the MEMC Co. of the United States, with both sides pledging to form a joint venture to produce wafers for use in integrated circuits (IC). MEMC, a subsidiary of Germany's Huls Group, is the world's second largest wafer manufacturer. Inking the document were MEMC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert M. Sandfort, China Steel's chairman Wang Chung-Yu, President Hu Ting-wu of the China Development Corp. and Vice President Li Ming-chi of Chiao Tung Bank. Under the agreement, the proposed joint business will have an aggregate investment of NT [New Taiwan] $4.85 billion (U.S.$180.29 million), of which a 45 percent stake will go to MEMC, 35 percent to China Steel, and 10 percent each to the China Development Corp. and Chiao Tung Bank. Paid-in capital will amount to NT$2 billion (U.S.$74.34 million), and the remaining NT$2.85 billion (U.S.$105.95 million) will come from a bank loan. Speaking at the signing ceremony, Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang said that the agreement will usher in a new era for the development of Taiwan's IC industry, whose key material -- wafers -- are all imported. Taiwan imports about NT$3 billion (U.S.$111.52 million) worth of wafers annually, of which MEMC accounts for a 30 percent market share, Chiang noted. The planned investment by the Missouri-based company will certainly help upgrade the industrial base here and sharpen Taiwan's competitive edge in worldwide markets, he pointed out. Construction of the proposed wafer factory, to be located at the Hsinchu science-based industrial park, is expected to be completed in two years, while commercialized production is scheduled to begin in 1997. The factory's annual output is set at 40 million square inches in the initial stage and could expand to 60 million square inches to meet growing market demand.
