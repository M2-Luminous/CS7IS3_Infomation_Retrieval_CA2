There occurred far-reaching interference by the legislative branch with the powers of the executive branch. That is unacceptable. If the [defense] ministry's chief is supposed to bear constitutional responsibility for the Armed Forces' readiness and the readiness of the country's defense system, one must not tie his hands with decisions on where and how money should be spent because this way one will not succeed in creating anything that would make sense or be a logical whole. Under the situation that has emerged, I will submit a complaint before the Constitutional Tribunal. [passage omitted] We are not so conservative as to refuse to give up anything--we can see the need ourselves. The Army is smaller; personnel policies have changed; there is a different concept, generally speaking; there are fewer officers who are better educated; there are more ensigns and noncommissioned officers; the size of forces on contract and over-the-time service has increased, following the example of other armies; and there is also an increased level of professionalism, but not necessarily through increases in the size of the officer corps. As a result of the last, we also have a process of integration with regard to military education, but that is a process the rate of which, unfortunately, is also dependent on the budget. [Wilecki] I think that in 1995--and I am saying this officially--we are making efforts to make it possible to introduce a 12-month service term. [Kolodziejczyk] If I may, I would like to elaborate on that issue in a couple or more sentences. It used to be that one had to serve three years in the Navy, and training of a naval expert using equipment that was not that complicated lasted six months. So that meant six months of training and two and a half years of service itself. Right now, training a radio-telegraphic operator to a decent level by using the equipment the regiment has at its disposal, takes seven to eight months. Now, if service takes 12 months, its real, actual length will be only four months. So the question is: What kind of implementation has to take place to secure the servicing of equipment at a decent level? That is the main problem here. And there is no other way to cut short the length of military service except to professionalize the service, which means over-the-time and contract service when, after a cycle of training, there follows a four-year period of service--that is to say, four years at the minimum. Except that, in order to introduce that kind of service, just as General Wilecki said, there must be legislative regulations that would eliminate all waivers of military service due to cultivating a hectare of land, having this or that number of children, and so forth. This is a citizen's duty, and we are all equal in the eyes of the law and the Constitution. That is the first thing. As a second issue, we come back to the issue because one must invest resources in the establishment of a corps of cadre of the over-the-time service and contract service, as I mentioned. [passage omitted] [Wilecki] Generally speaking, the Armed Forces are in bad shape. It is my moral duty--and I have been fulfilling this for two years now--to make the supreme authorities in the state aware of things because it is those authorities who bear responsibility for the country's security. As chief of the Polish Army's General Staff, I am responsible for certain things, I feel it is my duty to bring them to light, and I think the country's supreme authorities are being made aware of these issues. The fact that you [addressing the journalists] do not know all of the details--forgive me, but the special services of our various potential friends and enemies are working around the clock and are following various events. So it would be hard to expect the mass media to publish details on the Armed Forces' protection systems and functioning. One must realize that some things are discussed behind closed doors. I am hoping that the parliamentary debate, which Sejm Speaker Oleksy announced during his meeting with the General Staff's leadership a few weeks back, will be a closed-door debate and that it will lead to some details being cleared up. It is true that not all members of parliament feel comfortable with defense matters. [Kolodziejczyk] Sejm Speaker Mr. Jozef Oleksy has said publicly that the debate will indeed take place in the month of April. Practically speaking, the Army and the Defense Ministry have been ready for it for a long time now. What do we expect from the debate? We expect no miracles because tea does not get sweet simply by stirring it. But there is a very significant issue: putting in order the legal framework for the Defense Ministry's functioning, and also of the General Staff and all structures of the Army. This requires great effort and is a very urgent issue. In fact, in the eyes of the West, we may well be perceived as an Army that failed to accomplish anything in terms of reform because it continues to be headed by a minister with powers provided for by a 1967 law, so, despite the fact that the minister wears civilian clothes, he has a right to command the forces, in accordance with the law I mentioned and that is in force. Incidentally, I want to explain something with regard to the West's perception of these issues. As far as I can figure out, it is of no interest to them who is in charge of the ministry and what kind of uniform he used to wear, be it a railway uniform, a military one, or some other type. What is important to them is precisely what we are talking about--that is to say, power. So the minister can be a civilian if he has the power to exert administrative and political supervision over the Army. And there is the Armed Forces' commander, who, in our case, is known as chief of the General Staff and who is charged with statutory responsibility for the defense readiness of military units--that is, of the Armed Forces. That is the first necessary step and there are very many others to follow. That is the first thing we expect from the Sejm debate. We expect it will be a new incentive for putting these things in order, including the Small Constitution, the powers of the Security Council, SORM [expansion unknown], and so forth. Another thing we expect is that the Sejm will make a decision on reaching a certain fixed level of GDP within a set time limit, to be spent on the defense budget, and that, thanks to that, we will be able to arrange our implementation potential in a way that would make sense, taking into account our financial capabilities. These are the two issues that can bring a vast improvement to the entire ministry, particularly the Armed Forces, without additional resources. [passage omitted] The optimism I sense is over the fact that West Europe's two largest countries--with the greatest economic and military potential--made a decision to recommend us for associate membership in the Western European Union [WEU]. That means introductory integration into European security structures. It also brings results in the form of a promise of openness to technological and technical cooperation. We have been fighting for that kind of openness for several years now, with a complete lack of success, I might add. The intention of implementing both the Partnership for Peace initiative and the most recent initiative regarding cooperation with the WEU countries is to collect experiences precisely at the level of basic units, which means platoons and companies. Then we will find out what is the relationship between our communications and command systems, training techniques, signal methods, and so forth, and then, on the basis of these conclusions, we will have an opportunity to correct our own programs and move to a higher level of cooperation or joint exercises in the following year. To have the best possible relations with our neighbors is the primary principle of our security policy. Second, it is regional cooperation; third, European structures; and, finally, arms reduction. So the first item requires two parties to participate. My sense is that Western countries have matured enough so as not to be alarmed by every move of President Yeltsin's or Minister Kozyrev's eyelids, and to instead implement what is rational at a given point. Integrating Poland and other countries into European security structures, which means eliminating the gray area--that is rational. Gray areas always bring to mind potential possibilities of destabilization. I think the trend should be spread over and cover the remaining countries. It is a process, but, for the moment, let us focus on what pertains to Poland. So there is a chance for Poland, and we shall see what will happen in May. I am optimistic, and I have faith that Poland will be an associate member of the WEU.
