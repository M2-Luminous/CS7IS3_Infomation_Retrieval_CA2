The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] did try for a new postponement, but UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye did fall for it and he made the two delegations attend a face-to-face meeting. Joao Ligio, the People's Television of Angola correspondent in the Zambian capital, reports: [Begin Ligio recording] Sources close to the Lusaka peace talks have admitted the possibility that significant progress may have been made during a plenary meeting on the issue of the national police. The reason for that opinion is that this morning UN Special Representative Blondin Beye turned down a new UNITA request for the ad hoc commission's proceedings to go into recess yet again. When it was thought that the commission would be discussing the clarifications the government team made yesterday concerning the organizational law of the national police, the UNITA team once again proceeded to take up the rest of the working hours this morning with new clarification demands. This time, though, the UN special representative did not fall for it. He hardened his stance and invited the Black Cockerel negotiating team to turn up in the afternoon with logical documents concerning defense principles and an analysis of the first point. Blondin Beye expressed his belief that the clarifications had been adequate, so he decided to continue proceedings with the documents (?being viewed as finished). The two sides have already begun discussing the general principles of the document on the police force. That document contains some 12 points, of which four have already been dealt with. The meeting is to resume tomorrow with a discussion of Point 5, whose content [words indistinct]. [end recording]
