Today he will meet with the leadership of Azerbaijan. Questions of cooperation in oil exploration, and specifically AMOCO's participation in the oil field exploration in the Caspian will be discussed during the sessions. More than three years have passed since the Azeri Government declared its in?ent to begin exploration of oil fields with participation of foreign companies. But political instability and the frequent change in political regimes prevented the signing of the contracts. A representative of one of the oil companies told TURAN that a few weeks ago the members of the oil consortium appealed to the Azeri Government for a final answer concerning the contract. Also, it became known that the companies have given an ultimatum: They will leave Azerbaijan should if they do not have a clear answer by that spring. [sentence as received] A few days ago, Tim Hartnet, AMOCO's representative in Baku told TURAN that "we are on the eve of signing a contract. We think it will be signed in the near future." The so-called "Russian factor" prevents an earlier signing of the contract. Russia, which has neither technology nor capital to offer Azerbaijan, nevertheless wants to participate in the distribution of Azeri oil. In November 1993, after the most recent successful offensive of t?e Armenian army, President Geydar Aliyev invited R?ssian Secretary for Energy Yuriy Shafranik to Baku to sign an agreement allowing Russian participation in exploration of Azeri oil fields. Baku agreed to give 10 percent of Azerbaijan's s?are in the exploration project of the Azeri-Chirag oil field to the Russian LUKOIL company. This gave Azerbaijan a needed break at the front. But the planned December final signing of the contract with LUKOIL did not take place. At this time, Aliyev visited Paris where he proposed to President Mitterrand that France use its capital in reinvigorating the Azerbaijani economy. At present, representatives of the French Elf oil company is looking into possibilities for participation in the exploration of Azeri oil. Meanwhile, AZADLIG newspaper writes, citing the well-informed sources, that a massive transportation of arms and ammunition from Russia to Armenia is taking place with the intent of further transport to Karabakh. Evidently, on the eve of the signing the contract with the Western oil consortium, the world will soon hear about the next large-scale offensive by the Armenian Army into Azerbaijani territory. Practice has already proved this more than once.
