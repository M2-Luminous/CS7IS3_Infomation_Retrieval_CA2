Sobchak Become Russia's Ambassador in the United States?"] [Text] Last year the St. Petersburg branch of the State Tax Inspectorate become one of the top ones in the Russian Federation, and unquestionably the top in terms of hard currency revenue for the treasury. From the moment the tax inspectorate was set up three years ago until October 1993, the St. Petersburg branch was headed by Dmitriy Nikolayevich Filippov. Why, despite such obvious successes, was he dismissed from the job? How could St. Petersburg Mayor A. Sobchak allow this to happen? One would think that the city's first person would have the greatest stake of all in replenishing the treasury, because this is what pays for social programs, on which in turn the city head's reputation among the population rests. He did, though. And now St. Petersburg is unlikely to be as deficit-free as it was last year. The most disfranchised among city residents already feel it. As long as the tax inspectorate was busy collecting underpayments from Russian enterprises, nothing marred the relationship between its leadership and the mayoralty. Their interests clashed when the audit extended to activities of joint and foreign structures. One must say that the conditions for their existence in St. Petersburg are more favorable than anywhere in Russia. Foreign banks' branches here have absolutely no obligation to perform operations currently needed for the development of the Russian economy. At the same time, the rent charged their representations is frequently much lower than what domestic organizations have to pay to the city. Such are the laws of hospitality of the Neva banks. The Russo-Swedish enterprise Europa-Hotel, for instance, found itself in an extremely privileged position. Most of the money--60 percent to be precise--for the hotel's reconstruction was provided by Intourist. And only 40 percent was comprised of foreign credit--also borrowed against the collateral of domestic property. Europa-Hotel is flourishing. And no wonder: The enterprise owes the treasury $7 million in taxes, while to this day it keeps the money earned in its operations in foreign banks. For the sake of improving the world economy, one has to assume. Alas, this charitable gesture did not impress St. Petersburg tax inspectors, who slapped the SP [joint enterprise] with $24 million in fines. Simple arithmetics shows that if converted into rubles, this amount could cover all the needs of Russia's nuclear industry and keep nuclear scientists and their production side colleagues from picketing the White House. Moscow, however, at St. Petersburg's prompting, found it expedient to exempt the SP from paying the fines. Another object of the inspectors' audit was the joint Russo-Finnish enterprise Lenrautamebel. It uses our cheap timber; the labor also is, as they say, aborigine, undemanding. This labor force produces a nice output, however, since up to 94 percent of it is exported abroad. The earnings also are kept out there, away from domestic needs. This enterprise, too, was fined $10 million. The Russo-Finnish SP Pizza-Express did not even bother to deposit foreign currency revenue. Sanctions in the amount of 10 million Finnish markka were applied to it. Attempts to call foreign businessmen to elementary order greatly surprised the Finnish consul in St. Petersburg. He tried to convince D. Filippov that the State Tax Inspectorate's activities undermine the Russian Federation president's efforts to attract foreign business to Russia. When Filippov cited as an example Finland, where such violations bring not only fines but also prison sentences, the consul was sincerely bewildered: "Why compare Russia with our civilized country?" The main difficulties for the tax inspectorate headed by Dmitriy Nikolayevich began, however, after the decision was made to audit the activities of the St. Petersburg Property Fund. Some time in the past this fund was headed personally by Mr. Chubays who, upon his departure for Moscow, recommended a certain Bure as his replacement. The audit revealed gross violations in the fund's operations. For instance, in the protocol dated 22 September 1993 the tax inspectors put on record that 44,981 vouchers were unaccounted for. The fund had not even opened a special account to keep the money received from privatization: it was kept--at 2 percent (?!) annual interest, like in a Soviet savings bank--in the privately owned Vitabank, which used this money at its discretion. I think there is no need to explain what this all means. Let us take note of the date of the protocol: 22 September 1993. We remember what a nervous, chaotic time this was. Nevertheless, only five days later the mayor of St. Petersburg personally visited the State Tax Inspectorate and went out of his way to highly praise its personnel and leadership professionalism. It turned out later, however, that on the eve of this visit Sobchak sent a letter to Moscow in which, quoting L. Filippov's nomenklatura past, he demanded that the latter be relieved of his duties as chief of the State Tax Inspectorate for St. Petersburg. That is, the democrat Sobchak proposed to start a witch hunt on political grounds. Soon thereafter Filippov was informed from Moscow that he had been dismissed from the job. Then he received an insulting offer--to take charge of the Taymyr Autonomous Okrug tax inspectorate. And while the capital brandished the stick, Sobchak tempted Filippov with a carrot, offering a different prospect--to go to one of the American countries as a trade representative. Dmitriy Nikolayevich refused both offers. The logic of his action is clear: By removing him, attempts were being made to scare the rest, everyone who defends the interests of the state, those who serve the cause rather than persons. Filippov decided to hold firm to the end. I remember how at the dawn of perestroyka chatty democrats, searching for cozy jobs for themselves in the power structures, delivered quite a few speeches on the need to appraise people solely by their business qualities, their professional competency. Well, in his time as second secretary of the Leningrad Oblast Party Committee D. Filippov was not in charge of ideology (as many current administrators were)--his responsibility was industry and economics. Apparently it is as a specialist in this area that he suddenly fell into disfavor among militant "reformers..." We will learn the outcome of this conflict very soon: The matter is under consideration in the State Duma. Sobchak's letter demanding the removal of Filippov, however, turned out to be just one of a series. For instance, a demand was sent to the minister of internal affairs to replace Anatoliy Kramarev, chief of the city internal affairs administration. He lost Sobchak's confidence after he initiated investigative action with respect to some individuals in the mayor's inner circle. The recent visit to St. Petersburg of Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] chief Stepashin gave rise to rumors of the possible removal of another professional--Viktor Cherkesov, chief of the FCS's regional administration. A. Sobchak's reluctance to have next to him authoritative officials, especially in the "enforcement" area, is quite indicative: It is not accidental that the St. Petersburg mayor is asking emergency powers for himself from the Russian Federation president. Any emergency situation is profitable for whoever imposes it, because anything at all may be written off under this pretext. Looking at what is happening in the city on the Neva, I unwittingly wonder that it is probably not accidental that Sobchak's old book had an evasive title "Pilgrimage to Power." A 'pilgrimage' relieves one of the burden of responsibility imposed by power: Well, so I made this trip, it happens to anyone. You sort it out later, dear voters... Was this not the yardstick the mayor applied to Filippov, offering him a foreign assignment? And does the mayor have enough tempting carrots for everyone he may be unhappy with? Hardly. Such "generosity" betrays the "benefactor's" own inclinations. Favorites just love to keep reshuffling personnel: In the confusion it is easier to mask one's own lack of ability and easier to make arrangements for one's own future by shifting from the "front line" to comfortable rear positions. Information we have received from a trusted source is proof of this. As is known, a new Russian ambassador to the United States still has not been appointed. The information is that Anatoliy Sobchak is under consideration for this post--the idea that suits him just fine but does not elicit the needed support among professional diplomats. If the appointment does indeed go through, I assume we will get to read about A.A. Sobchak's next creation--another "pilgrimage." This time across the seven seas.
