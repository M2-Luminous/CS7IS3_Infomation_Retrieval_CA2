He spent several hours of interviews with the various media summoned on Independence Day, and the report on the attack came in the middle of them, in the middle of Memorial Day. Prime Minister Rabin said that this was yet another attack by fanatics trying to sabotage the peace process. We, however, will stay the course and continue implementing the peace process, thus foiling their intentions to harm it. Rabin spoke about the announcement by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], stating that after the Hebron massacre and again today Hamas announced it will carry out five harsh retaliatory attacks inside Israel's territory to revenge the massacre. According to Hamas, it has carried out two of those attacks: the grave attack last week in 'Afula and today's serious attack in Hadera. Prime Minister Rabin said Hamas and the Islamic Jihad decided to focus on their activity inside the Green Line boundaries with a political aim of diverting Israeli public opinion against the peace process. [Begin Rabin recording] I am primarily responsible for the security of sovereign Israel, including united Jerusalem. There are some 4.2 million Jews and over 900,000 Arabs inside sovereign Israel. Some 120,000 Jews live in the territories, I mean Judaea, Samaria and Gaza. They must be protected too, but 'Afula, Hadera, Netanya, and everywhere else should take precedence over all that is in the Judaea and Samaria. In 1994, 23 Israelis in uniform and civilians were killed, murdered -- some 20 of them were killed inside the boundaries of sovereign Israel. The Hamas and Islamic Jihad organizations have reached the conclusion that they should attack not only settlers -- although they are included -- but primarily they decided to focus on attacks inside Israel. They realized that they gain political profit from the reactions of the Israeli opposition against the peace process -- which is their main political aim. It earns them more. Anyone who today calls for an end to the negotiations is giving Hamas and Islamic Jihad an additional incentive to continue their acts of terror. The true answer we -- together with the PLO -- should give them is proof that we can reach an agreement, that it can be implemented, and that our reality changes as a result of the implementation. If we succeed in doing this, it would be the answer to the murderers of 'Afula and Hadera, and to most of the terror activity that resulted in the deaths of Jews. [end recording] The prime minister also spoke today of operative steps which will be taken in view of the Hadera attack. He will soon instruct the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to move forces from inside the territories and deploy them between the Green Line and the territories thereby reinforcing the closure. This will create a thicker barrier between the territories and the area inside the Green Line. Forces will be moved out from areas densely populated by Arabs, the city centers, and create a barrier, for example, between Janin and 'Afula and between Tulkarm and Hadera. Rabin admitted that the closure does not provide an absolute solution. Anyone who really wants to, can get out. [Begin recording] [Rabin] The closure is not hermetic. It is effective in preventing laborers from carrying out individual attacks. It does place some burden on the terror organizations, but does not prevent their activity altogether. Some 10,000 Israeli cars cross daily from Judaea and Samaria alone into Israel. No one can expect soldiers at checkpoints to be able to discern whether a car bearing a yellow [Israeli] license plate is not driven by an Israeli civilian and is getting across. Unless we introduce a more serious separation, there would be no certainty that a bomb is not placed in an Israeli car stolen in Israel, or that an individual does not cross the lines and reach 'Afula or Hadera on foot. All he has to do is cross a certain line, catch a ride, or walk. Most of them speak Hebrew and are able to do this. We must invest more in this and, as I said before, we will move out troops currently engaged in the protection of settlements. After all, Elon More [Jewish settlement] does not protect 'Afula! It is protected by the IDF, the Israel Police, and the Shin Bet. [Segal] Mr. Prime Minister, you spoke of the wave of terror striking at us now. Do you believe that after the Gaza and Jericho agreement is implemented the situation will improve? [Rabin] The test will be in Gaza and Jericho. I cannot demand that an Arab leader in Tunisia be able to have a bigger impact on Judaea and Samaria than the IDF has while in control of the territory. Can the PLO influence Hamas or the Islamic Jihad which carry out most of the terror acts? Here and there are some who quit the PLO and take to terror, but we have such people everywhere. Therefore, the real test will be when they assume responsibility, after we reach an agreement. Then, they will have to meet the commitments they made in the agreement. That is why we insist on reaching an agreement that would provide us with the utmost security. [end recording] Another question posed to Rabin was on the recent decline in the public's support for the government's moves. Rabin said in response that the opposition does not have an alternative. What they are suggesting is a political freeze which will lead to an escalation. This, in fact, is exactly the aim of the Palestinian factions which carry out the terror attacks. Rabin was asked for his view of the public opinion polls showing this decline in public support. [Begin Rabin recording] I became prime minister of my own free will. I struggled through Labor primaries and the Knesset elections. I did not seek this chair just to sit there. I believed that I should do things differently from the previous governments, also on domestic issues, but let us leave this for the moment. Primarily, I wished to give new meaning to negotiations on the basis of the Madrid conference. I acknowledged that there is only one Palestinian partner, if we stop the masquerade -- the PLO. The Palestinians are split: Some support the PLO, and there are those who opt for terror, but the bulk of the Palestinians support the PLO and opt for negotiations. The other half, the other part, are the supporters of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad who want to continue the war, terror, and violence against us, and reject any political arrangement. We must find a partner for the agreement. Past hopes that Palestinians from the territories could do this were proven absolutely unreal. I know that I am facing a decline in the Israeli public support for the move -- because of the terrorism, not because of the nature of the political solution. I will not change my policies in view of a certain public opinion poll held on a certain day, week, or month. As long as I have a Knesset majority, I will carry on in this way. I wish to exhaust the chance to attain peace. As I have said before, the alternative is a freeze and escalation with all that entails. Let us not forget, the signing of the Declaration of Principles had an impact on the Arab world. Otherwise Israeli delegations could not have gone to Oman to prepare a meeting of a multilateral committee there, or in Qatar. Did anyone believe such things and others which will follow could happen? Many in the Arab world and outside it had believed that the heart of the conflict is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- and I am not saying that this is correct or incorrect. The fact that we dared to deal with it has opened new horizons for us. [end recording]
