It includes concerns and corporations which produce basic types of arms and military equipment (the "SMM" Joint-Stock Company -- armored equipment and artillery systems; the "Aviaprom" Joint-Stock Company -- combat aircraft; the "Metallkhim" Joint-Stock Company -- ammunition and gunpowder; the "Nord-Vest" Joint-Stock Company -- surface ships and submarines; the "Optomprom" Joint-Stock Company -- electro-optical instruments; the "Vityaz" Joint-Stock Company -- small arms, antitank guided missiles, and portable surface-to-air missile systems; the "Antey" Science and Production Association -- S-300V, "Tor," and "Buk" surface-to-air missile systems; and the "Rosobshchemash" Joint-Stock Company -- space systems and missiles), and also the "Voyentekh" State Company for the Sale of Arms and Military Equipment and others. The Council of Directors is headed by Stanislav Chernov, formerly general director of the Kirov Plant and USSR first deputy minister of the defense industry, now president of the "Spetsialnoye Mashinostroyeniye i Metallurgiya" Concern. Aleksandr Temerko, formerly head of the Committee for the Social Welfare of Military Servicemen, has been elected president of the "Russkoye Oruzhiye" Special Corporation. [Rudenko] Aleksandr Viktorovich, as is well known, the idea of financial-industrial groups is not new. They form the basis of industrial might in most economically developed countries. A number of large industrial enterprises in Russia have now decided to set up something similar here. But do the objective conditions for this exist? [Temerko] The conditions have existed for some time. Moreover, I am convinced that setting up financial-industrial groups will become a priority aspect in the structural reorganization of Russia's entire economy, as it perhaps offers the only possibility at present to preserve our national scientific, technical, and industrial potential, including at enterprises, design bureaus, and scientific research institutes in the defense complex. Whereas previously the military-industrial complex worked virtually 100 percent for the state and, naturally, was fully financed from the budget, the situation now is drastically different. At best, the defense order does not exceed 40-45 percent of total output, although it is generally 5-15 percent with regard to aircraft firms, for example. Moreover, as a rule, money is only allocated for this purpose after long delays and is eaten up to a considerable extent by galloping inflation. Tell me, is it possible in these conditions to supply the Armed Forces in full with the weapons systems they need and at the same time produce competitive export models of combat equipment? Of course not. The absence of budget finance has prompted large defense firms to set up financial-industrial groups, which incorporate financial structures -- banks, investment and insurance companies, management firms, and so forth -- in addition to leading design bureaus, series production plants, and enterprises supplying components. This process was spontaneous at first, but now it has a normative base: The Russian Presidential Edict on the Formation of Financial-Industrial Groups. The essence of this edict can briefly be summed up as follows: It gives the right to attract nonbudgetary resources -- both one's own and those of commercial structures incorporated in financial-industrial groups -- to solve tasks, including tasks relating to the defense complex, and creates the conditions for these groups to work in practice. For example, the good idea of forming mobile forces has been put forward, but there is no money in the budget to supply them with the latest combat equipment. Financial-industrial groups could find the money. But only on the condition that money spent on the production of defense equipment will be regarded as direct investments to meet state needs, will be exempt from tax, and will be given the necessary government preference. The Defense Ministry must coordinate all work connected with ordering weapons systems, regardless of whether they are paid for from the budget or not. Given the obvious inadequacy of the state defense order, financial structures' participation in investments will allow industrial enterprises to keep their cadres, continue their present specialization, and manufacture competitive defense equipment for the domestic and foreign markets. For commercial banks which are past the formative period and eager for large-scale activity, including the possibility of direct competition with foreign banks, an alliance with industry also signifies a qualitatively new evolutionary step. [Rudenko] Tell me, how do you envisage the mechanism for combining financial and industrial capital, and what function will the "Russkoye Oruzhiye" Special Corporation assume in this process? [Temerko] Our corporation, whose founders and partners include leading producers of arms and combat equipment and large financial structures, has a highly skilled apparatus, so it sees its main task as being able to secure investment in production programs within the framework of financial-industrial groups, and also to monitor the management of financial resources so that a complete cycle of cooperation can be established as far as possible. Another important aspect of our activity will be to create the right conditions in the market of sale. Moreover, in some cases, the special corporation may fulfill the functions of a controlling company within financial-industrial groups being set up. But in any case the financial-industrial group will remain a closed, independent finance and production structure. Although financial-industrial groups have been discussed for some time, unfortunately none have been legally registered so far. There are prototypes, but they are not proper financial-industrial groups, so all the work to set them up still lies ahead. In our view, financial-industrial groups must not simply be a focus of powerful scientific and industrial potential; they must also actively market their products on the domestic and foreign markets. They will have considerably more favorable opportunities to present and promote their products in the broadest sense at international exhibitions and simply in direct competition with foreign firms. That is why financial-industrial groups must have the right to engage in independent foreign economic activity relating to products they create with resources they attract. [Rudenko] But how does this tie in with the state monopoly on arms sales and with the current restructuring of military-technical cooperation? [Temerko] You mean the reduction in specialist exporters and the formation of "Rosvooruzheniye" on the basis of three large Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations foreign trade state companies which export and import arms and military equipment and, at the same time, duplicate one another? In principle, we feel this is the right step to take -- particularly now, when our industry and economy are undergoing reform. On the basis of last year's results, military-technical cooperation amounts to something in the region of $2.2 billion, if you count money received for technical assistance. But there are fears that this figure could be substantially lower by the end of the year. Heaven forbid that it should fall below the critical 1 billion mark. The main task facing "Rosvooruzheniye" now is to prevent a possible massive slump, hold on to the main markets, and thereby support industry, for which export orders have recently acquired very serious significance. Our special corporation is not a direct arms exporter, but we intend to do our utmost to promote the sale of our country's arms and combat equipment abroad and to extend technical assistance through investment and by lobbying in favor of various decisions both here and abroad. As far as the state monopoly on arms sales is concerned, this must, of course, continue. But, as Western countries' experience shows, it certainly must not only take the form of reducing the number of specialist exporters, but must also be reflected in strict regulation of military-technical cooperation by means of legal conditions and arms export laws. In the United States, for example, more than 100 firms are authorized to sell military defense products. Approximately the same system operates in France, Germany, and a number of other countries which have a large share in the sale of arms and combat equipment. In turn, involving more structures in the export of goods intended for military-technical purposes helps to expand markets. Unfortunately, we still do not have a law on military-technical cooperation. In short, the system of selling arms must be more flexible, particularly now, when defense enterprises are being denationalized and turned into joint-stock companies. Not only specialist exporters, but also other state structures should concentrate on winning new markets. So far, there has been a regrouping at the level of "trading" organizations. There were three specialist exporters, now there is one. This must be followed by structural changes in state bodies of administration. [Rudenko] You mean the creation of a special body of administration which could rapidly respond to any change in the situation and monitor and coordinate military-technical cooperation? [Temerko] Exactly. At present, these functions are, to a certain extent, the responsibility of the Commission for Military-Technical Cooperation. For all its pluses, this commission does not have an adequate apparatus. For objective reasons, it cannot embrace the whole range of problems. In the interests of government regulation and monitoring of military-technical cooperation in accordance with the Russian Federation presidential edict of 12 May 1992, it would be advisable to form a Russian Federation committee for military-technical cooperation with foreign countries within the structure of federal bodies of executive power. This committee would ensure balanced export orders by means of both centralized allocations and nonbudgetary resources; fulfill the functions of licensing arms exports (and imports); coordinate the activity of financial-industrial groups both here and on the foreign market; and promote Russian producers' inclusion in the system of international integration relating to the defense industry, which would, of course, help to give our arms and military-technical goods access to world markets. In addition, in my view, greater powers to fulfill these functions must be given to the Defense Ministry, as a general buyer of arms and military equipment. The military department has all the structures for this. The Defense Ministry is in a better position than anyone to influence regional policy through its developed network of military missions. This does not mean that military attaches must become traders. But they can do a perfectly professional job of selecting clients, checking out their honesty and ability to pay, and analyzing in which markets we are threatened with losing our positions and which weapons are needed by which country at any given point in time. More vigorous, bold efforts must be made to sell combat equipment from Defense Ministry stocks. It is cheaper and is snapped up in markets where we have influence. As is right and proper, 70 percent of the profits would be used to tackle social problems, and the remaining 30 percent to update arms and finance the defense order. It is estimated that 30 percent of the proceeds from the sale of one tank would be sufficient to build three or four new tanks. As is well known, the "Voyentekh" State Company, set up on the Defense Ministry's initiative and approved by the Russian president, is responsible for selling combat equipment and arms from military department stocks. [Rudenko] Aleksandr Viktorovich, the various directions in which the economic reforms could continue are currently being debated in the press. I would like to hear your point of view on the subject. [Temerko] As far as defense production is concerned, strictly speaking, no reforms are being undertaken at present. There is just an ad hoc response to the various situations that arise. A situation arose with bad debts and mutual nonpayments, to which there was a response. But even that was half-hearted. The defense industry can and wants to produce modern weapons systems, but the appropriate conditions must be created for it to do this, instead of forcing it to engage in nonspecialized conversion. The Defense Ministry and the government have already taken some strategic steps in this direction. The basic principles of a military doctrine and an arms program have been drawn up and adopted. In this particular case, military-technical cooperation should be regarded as an inalienable part of the government's economic reforms. If we are really concerned about preserving the unique scientific and technical potential of the defense complex and restoring its former glory and might, all opportunities must be taken at all levels. There are no ready-made solutions for extricating the defense industry from crisis, and there never will be.
