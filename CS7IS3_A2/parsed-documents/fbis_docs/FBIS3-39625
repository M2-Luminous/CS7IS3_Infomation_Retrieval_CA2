Gonzalez believes that the level of cooperation achieved with the nationalists makes it possible to ensure governability, and interprets the lack of deadlines in this relationship as indicating that it will continue indefinitely, without ruling out the possibility that there could be some "minor hitch" or even a "fundamental disagreement," which would have to be examined, if it occurs, "at the proper time." But in any event, Felipe Gonzalez said that he feels "perfectly comfortable" from the viewpoint of "the government's initiative and stability in decisionmaking. My stance has not changed on what could be a hypothetical coalition government" with CiU, Gonzalez stated, adding immediately that he did not raise this Thursday [10 February] with Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] premier Jordi Pujol, "because it was unnecessary since it was constantly implicit in the conversation." The prime minister explained -- as Pujol did on the previous day -- the agreement in analysis with the CiU leader, especially on the issue of the economy, with respect to the need to support the country's productive economy. "It is assumed," Gonzalez said, "that when you back stability, you do so throughout a legislative term. This does not mean that there cannot be a slight hitch or disagreement which is deemed substantial in the legislative term, but until it arises, I would not consider in any event -- and this is what I told Mr. Pujol -- this idea of setting dates, because it is rather absurd." Gonzalez described his conversation with Pujol Thursday as "extremely interesting." During it, "we found that an attempt is being made to create a wrong impression of what this effort at understanding between the government and CiU means," when "our bid goes beyond pure parliamentary arithmetic. This is a bid to involve CiU with the nation's government, and hence with the policies which affect the state as a whole." The prime minister stressed that there is no "blackmail or pressure" in this relationship, and everything that has been negotiated has been put forward "clearly." On the issue of autonomy, he said that he regards as a "necessity" an agreement on new transfers [of powers from the central government to the autonomous communities], a matter which must be negotiated with all the "fast-track" communities, not forgetting that there are always "nuances" based on their respective distinctive features. Hence there will be bilateral negotiations with each of these communities, without excluding political dialogue between parties, which directly concerns the People's Party. Nevertheless, the prime minister detected in the People's Party's stances contradictions which must be surmounted. This is the case -- he added -- when the People's Party demands a single administration one day and deplores "slimming down" the state's peripheral administration the following day. This latter administration "will be simplified" without this entailing any relinquishment of its always being represented in all the country's territories. Gonzalez mentioned his meeting with Chaves, Fraga, and Lerma in order to conclude that many communities are demanding "substantially the same" things, which facilitates the dialogue on the impetus to autonomy. This process is not taking place owing to "strictly nationalist" demands but as a result of a "different view of the functioning of a state organized on the basis of political decentralization." Gonzalez expressed his desire to continue the dialogue with the People's Party and for the contacts on the democratic impetus to bear fruit soon.
