In a statement following the conclusion of the Mubarak-'Arafat talks this evening, Musa said the two presidents also discussed the issues of settlements and Palestinian security in the occupied territories. Musa said the security issue concerns not only the Israelis but both the Arabs and Israelis. Therefore, from now on we cannot speak about Israeli security without talking about Palestinian security on an equal footing. Musa explained that the demonstrations that were staged in Jerusalem today to protest the al-Ibrahimi Mosque incident supported peace. They definitely encourage and give the impression that forces desiring peace from the Palestinian and Israeli sides can play a role in encouraging an agreement. Musa said: We have never said that all Israelis are settlers. But we have spoken about these extremist and aggressive gunmen who commit crimes against the Palestinians in the occupied territories. This is why we have spoken about disarming the outlaw elements in some organizations. Asked if the Palestinians insist that the UN Security Council issue a resolution providing protection for the Palestinian people, Musa said the Security Council resolution should refer to the security and protection of the Palestinians. Moreover, the Israeli Government is dutybound to take measures to protect the Palestinians from the settlers' attacks and the terrorist organizations inside the settlements. On whether Israel is prepared to accept the presence of international observers in the occupied territories, Musa said there is a basis for this in the Declaration of Principles, in which Israel accepted a foreign presence between them and the Palestinians. This indicates that this idea is not ruled out. However, what is being discussed now at the Security Council is the protection of the Palestinians in the rest of the occupied territories, that is in the West Bank as well. Musa added that we are speaking about a framework during the next two weeks envisaging the disarming of the settlements, protecting the Palestinians, and disbanding the terrorist organizations. There must be decisive Israeli measures because, under international law, Israel is responsible for the territories under its military occupation. Asked about the statements by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher following his meeting with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, and whether these statements indicate a U.S. conviction for the need to provide protection for the Palestinians, Musa expressed his appreciation of the stands of the United States and Europe and of their awareness of these considerations. He stressed that there is a worldwide understanding of this issue. On the date of the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian talks, Musa said setting a date is not being discussed now although the negotiating track still exists. Asked if the al-Ibrahimi Mosque incident will make it difficult to convince the Arab people to continue the peace process, Musa said that the crime that was committed in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque provoked Arab people everywhere, including the Egyptian people and Government. We are all together in this and are angry over what happened.
