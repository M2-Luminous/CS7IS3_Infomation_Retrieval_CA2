Brazil, as an emerging power, wanted to exert its influence over the Portuguese-speaking countries that had recently become independent from Portugal. Almost 20 years later, Itamaraty and a group of Brazilian businessmen are playing their cards on a South Africa governed by the African National Congress (ANC) of Nelson Mandela. But the priorities are different: There is no longer the idea of projecting Brazilian political influence, but rather that of doing good business. From 13 to 20 March, just over one month before the first South African elections in which the black population will vote, a delegation of 34 Brazilian businessmen headed by Celso Marcos Vieira, chief of the Trade Promotion Department of the Foreign Ministry, made a commercial visit to that country. The Brazilian companies were represented by large companies such as Andrade Gutierrez, Norberto Odebrecht, Mendes Junior, NEC of Brazil, Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company], Varig Airline, Furnas [Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc.], and Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation]. Vieira said: "The time could have not been better: With this initiative we showed confidence in the South African electoral process." The South African elections, which will put an end to 46 years of white minority government, will be held on 26, 27, and 28 April. Even with the growing political violence of the last few months, the inauguration of Nelson Mandela on 10 May is considered a sure thing by analysts, including those of Itamaraty. The Brazilian delegation got ahead of possible missions from Europe, the United States, and Japan. According to Otavio Cardoso Pontes, director-superintendent of Poliolefinas and one of the members of the Brazilian delegation, Brazilian businessmen see many possibilities for bilateral trade with South Africa, which is a country with a high level of consumption and a well-developed infrastructure. Mandela's representatives guaranteed the Brazilian businessmen that an eventual ANC government would not implement a policy promoting government intervention in the economy, as planned in the party program. The Brazilians met with heads of the ANC economic departments and with representatives of five different sectors (including the National Federation of Africa Chamber of Commerce, which includes only black businessmen) interested in joint ventures and consultant services. The future for prospective Brazilian deals in South Africa lies in the reconstruction and development project that Mandela and his team have drafted. Vieira commented that "the ANC intends to build 1 million low cost houses and to expand its electricity supply system. There is lots of room for Brazilian companies in these areas." Mandela's supporters, moreover, are willing to review the energy policy implemented so far by the government. The ANC intends to minimize the African nuclear program which, it is believed, includes nuclear bombs. The ANC leaders are also quite interested in the establishment of an economic bloc including Mercosur [Common Market of the South] -- Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay -- and South Africa, Angola, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and Botswana. According to Minister Vieira, Brazil regards South Africa as a doorway for the entry of Brazilian products into the African markets. He added: "They know how to negotiate with the region, and this could be useful to the Brazilian businessmen." Although the ANC has asserted it does not have any nationalization program in mind, it has asked to consult Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] to determine whether or not it is feasible to maintain the state monopoly in the oil field. The Bank of Brazil has already opened credit lines with the purpose of promoting bilateral trade. But the Brazilians' visit to Mandela's country does not boil down to promises only. At least one deal worth $3 million has already been closed: The petrochemical industry Poliolefinas will buy raw material from a South African company to manufacture polyethylene. Minister Vieira exclaimed: "We have discovered South Africa." What remains to be seen is whether Mandela's virtual election will be enough to guarantee political stability in that country. After all, Brazil's initiatives in all the Portuguese-speaking African countries failed because they all were drowned by endless civil wars.
