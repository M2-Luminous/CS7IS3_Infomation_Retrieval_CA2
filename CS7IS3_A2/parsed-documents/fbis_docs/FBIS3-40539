Precision machining, unlike ordinary machining, generates virtually no noise. The beauty of the new system is that it transforms resistance to cutting into artificial noise in response to the degree of strength used. The operator feels as if he has entered and is working in a micro-world which makes his work easier. Assistant Professor Teruishi mentioned plans for applying the technology to ``micromachine production, computer board wiring modification, and micro-surgery such as connecting nerves.'' This system can be used to detect strength when a strength sensor is attached to a tool used in micro-work. It does parallel processing by computer of output from the tool's movement and strength sensor. There are two types of methods of converting degree of strength into noise. The first is to amplify directly the output of the strength sensor into noise. The other is to create man-made sound in proportion to strength. Either method produces a man-made sound similar to that produced when large objects are machined. In experiments, paint was removed that had been painted on an aluminum alloy surface of several millimeters angle. The tool had a long narrow chisel of 0.15 millimeters in diameter. Paint was cut away as the operator watched tool's tip displayed enlarged on a monitor screen by a charge coupled device (CCD) camera. Human hand movements were conveyed through a computer to the manipulator moving the chisel. It was difficult to work with steady strength by relying on the monitor image, so strength changed greatly. However, when man-made noise was generated simultaneously, pushing was almost steadily controlled at optimal value. Operators who machine metals, woods, and other materials make use not only of sight, but also of hearing and of sensations felt from the tool. Sound provides very valuable information for machining. The strength and the highs and lows of the sound generated by the contact between the tool and the machined material is important for controlling the strength of the tool. However, although reflected information can be collected by microscope and CCD cameras and strength information can be collected by strength sensors, it was difficult to make the noise emitted by micro-machining loud enough for humans to hear because it is lower than the noise level picked up by a microphone.
