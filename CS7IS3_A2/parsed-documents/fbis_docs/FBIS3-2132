After today's meeting, Chinese representative Hu Houcheng said that China has always backed the idea of building a new airport in Hong Kong. China puts emphasis on efficiency and cost for the project, which should cause no financial burden on the future special administrative region of Hong Kong, Hu said, adding that the Chinese side had made suggestions for the British latest proposal. The British representative said that the common ground between the two sides is quite considerable, but they have to make a bit more efforts in order to resolve the remaining technical issues. In answer to media questions on this afternoon's session, a government spokesman described the meeting as "friendly and positive". "This afternoon the Chinese side asked various questions about our fourth financing proposal, and we will be providing them with answers as soon as possible," the spokesman added.
