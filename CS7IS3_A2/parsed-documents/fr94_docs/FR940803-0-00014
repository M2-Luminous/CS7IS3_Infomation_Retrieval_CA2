FR940803-0-00014 FR940803-0-00005 Also pursuant to Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, this rule will establish that non-signatory handlers pay their administrative assessment to the Secretary. The Secretary will bill non-signatory handlers on a periodic basis determined by the Secretary. The non-signatory handler will be responsible for remitting payment by the date specified. Payment in the form of a personal check, cashier's check or money order will be remitted to the Department. Audits of each handler's account may be conducted by the Department to reconcile incoming, farmers stock volume received or acquired and assessments paid. Violation of the non-signer regulations may result in a penalty in the form of an assessment by the Secretary equal to 140 percent of the support price for quota peanuts. The support price for quota peanuts is determined under 7 U.S.C. 1445c&hyph;3 for the crop year during which the violation occurs. The established administrative assessment rate will impose some additional costs on non-signatory handlers. However, the costs will be in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers who are not signatory to the Agreement. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1988 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35), the information collection requirements that are contained in this rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been assigned OMB No. 0581&hyph;0163. Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this interim final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that, upon good cause, it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) Public Law 103&hyph;66 requires the Department to impose an administrative assessment on peanuts received or acquired for the account of handlers who are not signatory (non-signatory handlers) to Peanut Marketing Agreement No. 146 (Agreement); (2) the peanut crop year begins July 1, and to achieve the intended purpose of the law this action should be taken promptly; and (3) this rule provides a 30-day comment period and any comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this rule.
