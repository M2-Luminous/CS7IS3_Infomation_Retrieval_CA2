However, it will likely issue them during the time the IAEA Board of Governors meeting is held--the meeting begins on 21 February--so that the inspection team begins its activities." Minister Han also stated that "North Korea is delaying the issuance of visas because it needs to clarify the procedures of the agreement it reached with the United States during a working-level contact last 29 December." Minister Han said he understands that "the scope of inspection agreed between North Korea and the IAEA includes the extraction of sample materials from the five-megawatt atomic reactor, and this means that North Korea fully accepted the scope of inspection demanded by the IAEA in the past." He pointed out that IAEA's inspection activities and analysis of the inspection results would require about four weeks. Therefore, in the event that the inspection begins next week and proceeds satisfactorily, the third round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks would be resumed in late March. Since the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South is a precondition for the third round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks, the talks on this issue will be held before late March. Commenting on the report that there is difference in views between the ROK and the United States on the deployment of Patriot missiles, Minister Han said that "in view of the sensitive time of the nuclear negotiations, the ROK and the United States agreed to withhold the decision on deployment until the IAEA Board of Governors meeting is held." He added that "the two nations will consult the issue of deployment and time by taking into account the judgment of commander of U.S. Forces in the ROK and changes in the situation." Minister Han pointed out that "if North Korea possesses nuclear materials, the detection of their exact amount and location is important. If sanctions against North Korea are pushed because it possesses nuclear materials alone, North Korea will not allow anyone to confirm the contents of the nuclear materials it possesses. Therefore, sanctions under this condition are not desirable."
