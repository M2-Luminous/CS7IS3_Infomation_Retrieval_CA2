FR940404-0-00011 FR940404-0-00004 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;36] Amendment of Class E Airspace; Lakeview, OR AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action amends the Lakeview, Oregon, Class E airspace. Controlled airspace extending from 700 feet above ground level (AGL) is necessary for a new instrument approach procedure to Lakeview County Airport, Lakeview, Oregon. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition area,'' replacing it with the designation ``Class E airspace.'' The airspace will be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bob Brown, ANM&hyph;535, Federal Aviation Administration, Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;36, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056, Telephone: (206) 227&hyph;2535 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On January 12, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by amending the Lakeview, Oregon, Class E airspace (59 FR 1681). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition area,'' and airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth is now Class E airspace. This amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice except the docket number of this action is corrected to read 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;36 vice 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;39, and that airspace extending upward from 10,500 feet MSL, which previously existed, is added to the description in this document. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the Class E airspace at Lakeview, Oregon, to provide controlled airspace for aircraft executing a new instrument approach procedure at Lakeview County Airport, Lakeview, Oregon. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
