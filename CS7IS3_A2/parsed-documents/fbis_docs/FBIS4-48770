FBIS4-48770 "drafr102_c_94019" FBIS-AFR-94-102 Daily Report 26 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 26 May South African Press Review for 26 May MB2605130494 MB2605130494 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Approval for Defense Minister -- An editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 26 May on page 20 voices approval for Defense Minister Joe Modise's appointment of General Georg Meiring as head of the South African National Defense Force, SANDF: "We applaud this move; we salute Defence Minister Joe Modise for choosing the best man for the job. His vision is clear: a legitimate, credible, balanced, modern and technologically advanced military force with internationally accepted professional norms, also fully representative." Turning to related issues, the editorial notes: "Three other points in the Minister's announcement need to be noted: the realistic pegging of the force at about 70,000 men, the preference for a voluntary system of enlistment and the emphasis on a positive internal role for the SANDF. All this augurs well for the future." BUSINESS DAY Concern Over `ANC Militarists' -- "The arms embargo against South Africa is about to be lifted. Perhaps it would be better for us all if it remained in force." Such is the sentiment an editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 26 May on page 8. Noting that ANC hawks and doves are beginning to divide over the questions affecting the South African military, the paper states: "We have a situation where Minister Jay Naidoo repeatedly said the reconstruction and development programme would be paid for predominantly through defence cuts. Now Modise, preceded by some advance guard intellectuals and intelligence operatives such as Rocky Williams and Abba Omar, are fighting tooth and nail to preserve and perhaps even enlarge the military establishment." The editorial rejects as "self-serving nonsense" all arguments that the arms industry creates needed jobs, and then it continues: "Modise also seeks to make South Africa the policeman of the subcontinent, but simultaneously and disingenuously asks neighboring countries not to fear our huge military capability." After pointing out that "ANC militarists are not having it all their own way," the editorial concludes: "If the SANDF needs funding for the integration of the various armed forces it should be provided -- but only on the understanding that it is to be spent purely on demobilisation. The public will accept no more than that." RAPPORT Peacekeeping Force Called "Exercise in Futility" -- "A pathetic chapter in the history of the birth of the new South Africa comes to a close when the so-called Peacekeeping Force is disbanded. Seldom, if ever, in South Africa's proud military tradition has there ever been such an exercise in futility at a such a high price," begins a page-20 editorial in the Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 22 May. "As a spectacle it even dwarfs the disastrous task by the now defunct Department of Development Aid, concerning the provision of hundreds of unused toilets, which served as a great source of amusement to antigovernment agents. Since the shoe is on the other foot -- the Peace Force was the creation of the ANC-dominated Transitional Executive Council -- the laughter is considerably more subdued. Even for this laughter the South African taxpayer will eventually have to foot the bill....May such experiments never be repeated so hastily again. May the Peacekeeping Force rest in peace." BEELD Black American Investors Welcomed -- "The fact that black American businessmen and investors are streaming to South Africa to take advantage of new opportunities here should be welcomed," notes a page-6 editorial in the Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 23 May. "America's own success story can be partly attributed to the fact that it succeeded in attracting investors and experts from around the world because it is regarded as the land of opportunity. South Africa's developed infrastructure, financial sectors, and communication systems are assets that will also hopefully attract foreign investors. Black Americans returning to their roots in Africa come from a western and capitalist society. They have the necessary knowledge required to reconcile the Africa culture with a democratic and capitalist system....They are also aware of minority issues. Their participation in South Africa could help to establish a democratic culture based on a firm capitalist, economic foundation, but one with its own unique Africa flavor."
