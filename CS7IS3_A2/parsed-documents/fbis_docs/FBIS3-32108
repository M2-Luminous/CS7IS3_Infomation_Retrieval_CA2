Cuba has shown an interest in purchasing paper pulp, paper for manufacturing bags, and cartons manufactured by the Papel Misionero Enterprise, and mate leaf [ilex paraguayensis]; the island also might be interested in wooden prefabricated houses, several varieties of lumber, and soybean flour and oil. Misiones, in turn, might send to that country people who need a very highly developed medical system, and Cuban professionals would advise the province's doctors. The aspects of the agreement are being studied by Cuban officials and a Misiones Province delegation headed by provincial Health Minister Victor Hugo Martinez. During his stay in Cuba, which will last one week, Puerta plans to meet President Fidel Castro.
