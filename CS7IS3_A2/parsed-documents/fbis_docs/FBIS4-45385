Deputy Prime Minister Michel al-Murr chaired a meeting for the ministerial Antinarcotics Committee. The meeting was attended by Ministers Michel Samahah, Marwan Hamadah, and 'Adil Qirtas; representatives of the Army Command, the Internal Security Forces, and the Social Affairs Ministry; and a delegation from the UN antidrugs bureau [name as received]. Al-Murr explained the importance and details of the meeting: [begin recording] al-Murr: In the latest 1993 report published by U.S media and cited by some Arab press, Lebanon was considered first in the world in exporting, producing, and growing drugs. The report specified the amount produced as 65,000 tons of hashish, opium, and others. In that report Lebanon was given a leading place in this dirty international activity. We stressed Lebanon's position to the UN representatives concerned with the drug issue. We told them that the figures mentioned in the report are incorrect, unrealistic, and baseless. We asked the United Nations, through its representatives who met with us today, to give us the information they have about Lebanon. They were here a year ago and we gave them accurate information and figures indicating that all rumors about Lebanon, disseminated to serve certain international objectives, are false. There are no more opium or hashish plants in al-Biqa'. If security agencies occasionally seize some smuggled drugs, these are from old stock--more than three years old--hidden in secret places. The plants were destroyed and they no longer exist. The UN officials told me that they have evidence that these plants no longer exist in Lebanon and that Lebanon is being wronged by media rumors that it is the primary exporter of drugs to the world. In the name of the government, I stressed our demand for a clear UN report telling the truth. We do not want a favor; we want them to tell the truth that Lebanon is no longer a producer or exporter of drugs. They promised that at the end of their visit to Lebanon this week--we gave them a chance to visit all concerned ministries and departments to collect facts and figures--they will forward a report. They became convinced after the documents we presented in the meeting. But this is not enough; we insisted that they present a report to the United Nations so that it, in its annual report, can say that Lebanon does not plant, produce, or export drugs.
