Sections 612.2190 Through 612.2250 The sections regarding devotion of time to official duties, political activity, nepotism, gifts or favors, and improper use of official property are removed as proposed and the topics are required to be addressed in the institution's policy established pursuant to §612.2165. No comments were received regarding the removal of these sections. Section 612.2260_Standards of Conduct for Agents No comments were received regarding this section and it is adopted as proposed. Section 612.2270_Prohibited Purchase of System Obligations One commenter questioned the prohibition in existing regulations on bank presidents' purchasing obligations of the Farm Credit banks and the proposed extension of this prohibition to all employees who may participate in any manner in funding activities of their institution. The Board concurs that the potential for conflict in a director's or employee's purchase of System obligations that are available for purchase by the general public through members of the selling group or in the secondary market is small. Therefore, the final regulations permit such purchases under the conditions listed in §612.2270. List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 612 Agriculture, Banks, banking, Conflicts of interest, Rural areas.
