There has been the Ames espionage "affair," the embarrassment over the Moscow visit of ex-President Nixon, Washington's emissary, and the different readings of ways to settle the Bosnian crisis. Let us add to this the tragedy in the Arab mosque in Hebron, which interrupted the process which had begun of settling the Arab-Israeli conflict; the problems of the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic countries.... As we see, there are quite a few topics to analyze. Therefore the latest meeting between the heads of the Russian and U.S. foreign policy departments, which took place in Vladivostok yesterday, resembled the work of restorers filling cracks in the walls of an ancient building. International problems were also discussed in passing. Particularly as Andrey Kozyrev has just visited the Near East, where he held talks with the leaders of Israel and the PLO, while Warren Christopher has visited a number of countries in the Asia and Pacific region. At Vnukovo Airport, from where the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs flew to Vladivostok, Andrey Kozyrev remarked in conversation with journalists that there are certain circles both in the United States and in Russia which dislike cooperation between the two countries, particularly when it takes on a strategic nature. Nevertheless, the minister believes that Russian-U.S. relations will continue to be based on the principles of the Moscow Declaration. "It is a strategic, mature partnership, indications of which are a commonality of interests and a close level of contacts," he emphasized.
