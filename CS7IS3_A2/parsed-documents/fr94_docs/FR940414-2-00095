FR940414-2-00095 FR940414-2-00068 Conforming changes are made to sections 5(a), 5(b), 5(c), 5(d), 5(e), and 5(h), 6, 7, and 8 of Article VIII of OCC's By-Laws and to Rule 1106(e). A technical amendment to Section 5(h) also is made to correctly identify paragraph (b), in the place of paragraph (d), as a paragraph pertaining to certain applications of clearing fund contributions. A technical amendment also is made to Section 1 of Article VIII to identify correctly Chapter XI in place of Chapter VI as the Chapter of OCC's Rules where OCC's protective transaction provisions may be found. II. Discussion The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the purposes and requirements of section 17A of the Act. 4 Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act requires that the rules of a clearing agency provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among participants. 5 The proposed rule change provides a more equitable formula by which OCC may assess the clearing fund contributions of clearing members. Under the previous formula, clearing members depositing the minimum $75,000 clearing fund requirement were subject to proportionately greater assessments than clearing members whose clearing fund requirements were based on their computed contributions because the assessments were based upon a pro rata charge of required clearing fund contributions. By basing clearing fund assessments on a proportionate basis against the computed contributions of all clearing members, even those who have deposited the minimum requirement, the assessments will be linked more closely to the open interests and market activities of clearing members. 4 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). 5 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(D) (1988). Section 17A(b)(3)(F) requires that the rules of a clearing agency assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible. 6 The proposed amendments will not affect the total size of the clearing funds. It is possible that as a result of the new assessment formula more than one round of charges to the clearing fund contributions of clearing members could be required to assess all of a clearing member's minimum contribution. However, OCC has provided in Article VIII, section 6 of its Bylaws that should a clearing member seek to withdraw from OCC membership, any portion of that clearing member's clearing funds that are unavailable for the first charge will be available to OCC in a second assessment. 7 6 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(F) (1988). 7 Supra note 3. III. Conclusion For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that OCC's proposal is consistent with section 17A of the Act. 8 8 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 9 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;91&hyph;03) be, and hereby is, approved. 9 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 10 10 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
