It is to be expected that a small community living in exile with little hope of returning soon to its home should be overwhelmed in equal measure by anger and sorrow. The squalor and humiliation of life in ramshackled refugee camps, the break-up of families, the loss of jobs and property and the abiding fear about the disappearance of their culture must all evoke widespread sympathy for the Kashmiri Pandits. What is remarkable about the gathering is that in the midst of so many depressing circumstances the true spirit of `Kashmiryat' survives. Many delegates were able to rise above their pain and anguish to urge the restoration of communal harmony and a multi-ethnic, multi-religious society in Kashmir. Let there be no mistake about it. It takes exceptional courage and wisdom on the part of those who have suffered most since the ascendancy of militancy in Kashmir to cling to such a vision of the future. There were those, of course, who demanded a separate homeland where Kashmiri Pandits could feel secure. No one will want to blame them for this after what they have been through. The sense of betrayal they experienced as a result of the Central government's bungling on Kashmir over the years is also a major impetus for the feeling of separateness that has spread through the community. It must be hoped that in time and with the redressal of many of their grievances in exile and an improvement in the situation within Kashmir, all Kashmiris will learn to put their faith once again in a multi-cultural state. Some may, for political reasons, pander to the feeling of Kashmiri Pandit separateness but such counsel should be rejected as dangerous and self-defeating. As is evident from many parts of the world where ethnic conflict rages, the effort to create separate entities out of communities which have intermingled for centuries ends in terrible tragedy and the most inhuman suffering for all. Initiatives like the World Kashmiri Pandit conference are important. Not only do they provide a forum to bring scattered Pandits together to air their problems and anxieties, but they are necessary to draw national and international attention to the plight of the exiles. Little is known, for example, about how much Pandit women have suffered in the last few years. There is much work to be done on the world stage. One can think of no better mechanism than a standing committee of World Kashmiri Pandits to inform the outside world about conditions in Kashmir under rampant militancy aided by Pakistan. A more important role would be in broadcasting to a largely ignorant western world the Kashmiri Pandit version of Kashmir as a harmonious, multi-ethnic society which Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Gujjars and many other communities can call their home. *
