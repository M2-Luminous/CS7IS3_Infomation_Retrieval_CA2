Cross-Border Hungarians Office President Geza Entz said their talks covered a proposal for ethnic Hungarian organizations to receive certain contribution to their budgets. Agoston said the VMDK's re-elected leadership maintains its demand for autonomy, and has already talked unofficially to Serbia's prime minister. Settling the position of Hungarians in Vojvodina is closely connected with international circumstances. "An agreement with Serbia will work if it also serves Serb interests," he added. He quoted President Clinton's special emissary's call for autonomy for Croatian Serbs and Albanians in rump Yugoslavia. With a precedent for ethnic minority autonomy, Hungarians in Vojvodina would have more chance for their own demands, Agoston said.
