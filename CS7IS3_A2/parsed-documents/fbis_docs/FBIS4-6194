Chu made the announcement one day after Seoul said it had decided to accept all escapees from North Korean logging camps in Siberia wishing to settle in South Korea. "As a result, the government will bring to South Korea more than 100 North Korean loggers who have applied for settlement in South Korea at the South Korean Embassy in Moscow," Chu said. Chu also said the government expects more escapees from North Korean logging camps to seek refuge in the South "since we have decided to accept them." "Even in that situation, the government will accept all North Korean loggers with the exception of those with serious problems," he said. Chu clarified that "those with serious problems" include criminals such as "infamous offenders." The Seoul government understands, however, that most of the "infamous" offenders committed "crimes" because they were hungry and tried to steal food, he said. The South Korean Embassy in Moscow has conducted an initial screening of the North Korean loggers seeking refuge in the South and found almost no "infamous offenders," Chu said.
