The topic of the meeting was the program of work of the Ministry for Private Enterprise. Vesna Tenjovic reports: [Begin recording] [Tenjovic] The first task of the Ministry for Private Enterprise will be above all the revision of the taxation laws and the creation of a long-term tax system, Minister Radoje Djukic said. Our goal will be, Djukic emphasized, to reorganize all departments selectively to facilitate work for as many people as possible. The rationalization of the state administration is under way as the economic program also envisages the reconstruction of the state. Minister Djukic said that three sectors will function within the ministry -- a sector for singular, private, and individual enterprise, a sector for development and promotion of this department, and a powerful legal sector. There are approximately 400,000 private entrepreneurs in Serbia. For this reason we must create a more favorable climate for their work and then the foreign investors will come by themselves. Promising that the government will persist in the implementation of the economic recovery, by which the economy will after the abolition of sanctions integrate easier into the world economy, Minister Djukic had the following message for the entrepreneurs: [Djukic] As I have said, until we have dealt with the problem of fundamental and system solutions -- decrees and law -- in case of excessive situations I am always free for you to call me to resolve them ad hoc. President of the EU entrepreneurial community Mr. (Jeanrou), who was a guest of the Serbian Government, replied when asked by reporters what he would do had he been in Djukic's shoes, that he would call upon all the entrepreneurs to violate sanctions. Therefore, I also call to violate sanctions just as you have done so far. [end recording]
