The paper stresses in its editorial today that Egypt does not want to add a new crisis to those already experienced by the Arabs or erupting in their faces occasionally. Egypt believes that the Sudanese measures, although tactless, are too small and trivial to cause a serious crisis between Cairo and Khartoum. This being so, the paper adds, the Sudanese Government should realize that Egypt's silence does not stem from weakness, its patience does not reflect a lack of will, and its failure to retaliate does not proceed from fear. AL-AHRAM calls on the Sudanese Government to return to logic and understand the truth of Egypt's position and policy so that it may not take similar unwise and shortsighted measures in future. The paper also urges the government in Khartoum to learn from the experience of insensible people here and there in the Arab world, which suffers the consequences of the foolish policies pursued by some of its leaders.
