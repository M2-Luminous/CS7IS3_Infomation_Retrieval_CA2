Provisional Senate head Eduardo Menem pledged that the government will respect the Olivos Pact on reform signed by President Menem and Radical Party Chairman Raul Alfonsin after FG head Deputy Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez suggested that the agreement should be set aside. Democratic Progressive Party Deputy Alberto Natale also urged the Radicals to "open up the Olivos Pact package." Alfonsin warned that a campaign to "distort" the contents of constitutional reform had been launched and said that it would be "disappointing if Alvarez joins in." Alfonsin described Alvarez' call on the Radicals to abandon the points agreed on by the Olivos Pact "absurd." Menem, who denied cabinet changes, told a local radio station that the government was "on the alert" for a possible alliance between the FG and the Radicals and accused Deputy Jesus Rodriguez -- who is promoting the idea within Alfonsin's party -- of having an "ancestral hatred for Peronism." But Menem defended Alfonsin, who has come under fire from anti- reform sector's within his party. "Alfonsin stood up in what is a difficult moment for Radicalism," Menem said. The head of state said that the Justicialist Party will stick to the Olivos Pact and that it would only seek agreements with the pro-reform provincial parties and not with the centre-left Frente Grande. On the same day the President denied that the Peronist defeat at the hands of the FG in the Federal Capital could trigger a Cabinet reshuffle, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo told a local radio station that Sunday's election result should be seen as a triumph for the government.
