The platform they approved says that this is a new political party, uniting all social strata of the republic population on the side of cardinal changes in the state-administrative economy and the establishment of a law-governed state. Members of the initiating group, President Aleksandr Kisherin of Kisherin & Co., an agroindustrial firm, Moldovan People's Deputy Anatoliy Konoplin, Moldovan Savings Bank branch manager Vladimir Chekin, KPP Director Aleksandr Sukhostavskiy, and other prominent administrators of enterprises in Belt, had this to say about the need for this new party in a political statement they issued during the preparations for the constituent assembly: "Just yesterday we still expected the republic parliament and government to lead the economy out of crisis. We believed that the political confrontation would come to an end.... We anticipated the start of genuine, effective economic reform in Moldova. "Today we can see that these hopes and other expectations were unjustified. The social and economic conditions of our life are particularly disturbing and are growing worse each day.... "The reason, in our opinion, is that the politicians in power care more about their group interests and ambitions than about the actual standard of living. "The PEVM intends to fight for the interests of the laboring public, for social justice in our society, and for the territorial integrity of Moldova. The new party advocates the restoration of ruined technical and intellectual potential and favors stronger ties with the republics of the former USSR, the developed capitalist countries, and the dissolved socialist camp." The new political party which was founded in Belt has already been joined by more than 600 people and supports the development of collective and private businesses, entrepreneurship, and a flexible tax policy. As speakers remarked at the constituent assembly, the PEVM cannot participate autonomously in the current parliamentary elections, but this does not mean that it will stay out of politics. Its members include many respected industrialists and entrepreneurs whose opinions are certain to influence the government and president of Moldova. Many of Moldova's northern regions support the PEVM platform and the charter adopted at the constituent assembly and sent representatives to the gathering.
