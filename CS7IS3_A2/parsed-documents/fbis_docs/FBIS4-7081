Hata, who is certain to become the next prime minister, told a press conference he believes Japan and the U.S. could solve the trade row because he and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor were able to understand "what the problems are" when they met last week in Marrakech, Morocco. Japan will hammer out the second package of market-opening measures by June and the U.S. also has been making efforts to create products meeting Japanese demands, he said. Hata said Japan must spontaneously take steps to open its markets because this will not only reduce its huge surplus with the U.S. but will also contribute to the improvement of people's lives and inject dynamism into the domestic economy. Tokyo and Washington have been unable to resume the trade "framework" that broke down in February over failure to iron out differences on the "objective criteria" for foreign access to Japanese markets.
