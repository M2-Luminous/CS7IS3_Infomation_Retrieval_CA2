Only by unfailingly overcoming the danger of being left behind further economically can we achieve firm sociopolitical stability, strengthen national security and defense, and further develop our foreign relations on the basis of independence and sovereignty. In this spirit, I would like to further elaborate on some major issues with which we are experiencing difficulties and on which we must revamp our policies so as to satisfactorily implement the tasks for 1994 and prepare for 1995: 1. Continue to ameloriate and stabilize the financial and monetary market: A. How to balance the budget? The report of the Finance Ministry points out difficulties encountered in balancing the budget. Compared with the figures in the first four months of the year, the average monthly figures achieved in the last six months of the year show that our revenue and expenses increased 1.5 fold and 1.66 fold respectively. The fact that the National Assembly has ratified a request to increase revenue collection to meet our budget demands is a guarantee for the implementation of socioeconomic and national defense tasks and for helping contain inflation. The conference held by the entire tax sector in mid-May decided that we are capable of a 10-percent increase in tax collection compared with the total tax and fee collection budgeted for the first half of the year. If we take into account the possibility of increasing tariff collection by the customs sector, we may exceed the collection target by 15 percent. The feasibility of this target relies on our potential for developing production and expanding commercial exchange, along with efforts to enforce various tax laws and the discipline on budget contributions. We must overcome the tax collection shortfall, which is still great, in the state business sector, in individual and private ventures, and in those joint ventures with foreign countries. This shortfall also results from a failure to turn in the tax money obtained from home sales and land use. The enforcement of important laws and regulations is the most important task in which administrative and financial organs at various levels must closely cooperate with various mass organizations, professional associations, and the people in ensuring scrupulous and fair enforcement. We must exploit the potential for increased tax collection in the following directions: -- The export-import tax is not only a huge source of revenue for our budget -- accounting for one-fourth of our total revenue -- but also an important means of ensuring domestic production. Along with readjusting the tax table for exports and imports in accordance with the resolution adopted in late March by the National Assembly Standing Committee, we must intensify our anti-smuggling activities at various border gates and conduct inspections to obtain delinquent taxes on those products which have already been illicitly imported, especially those goods that may diminish domestic production. This task must be closely organized, directed, and undertaken with specific targets. To implement it, we must have cooperation between various sectors and we must win the sympathy and support of the people. -- The leasing of land or the transfer of the land-use right and the use of state-owned houses for business purposes will not only generate huge amounts of revenue but also ensure better management and use of these properties. Although in practice this task is very complex, the more we procrastinate or adopt a wait-and-see attitude, the more state property will be gnawed off and abused. The government advocates undertaking this task resolutely and openly in a way suitable to the actual conditions so the people can oversee it. -- We must scrutinize and sternly deal with those cases of illegal land allocation or land sales in which proceeds are not turned in to the government. -- The prices of certain kinds of goods, which are either fixed or controlled by the state and are not suitable to the relations of supply and demand, such as gasoline and oil, electricity, cement, and the like, must be readjusted rationally so as to help economize on consumption and to achieve a balance between supply and demand and, at the same time, increase revenue for the budget. Increased revenue should be coupled with reducced expenditure as stipulated by the National Assembly resolutions, with the goal of reducing budgetary strain. In implementing the National Assembly resolutions and the government decisions on practicing thrift, by mid-May there have been 47 ministries and central level agencies and 17 provinces and cities to actually draw up plans to practice thrift. According to the plans of the 10 ministries that have been inspected, the amount of the projected expenditure reduction is 1.357 trillion dong, including 382 billion in capital construction, 943 billion in production and trade, and 32 billion in administrative expenditures. The government urges all sectors and localities to complete their plans to practice thrift. The plans need to be calculated carefully and be concretely feasible. The Ministry of Finance will have to study the accounting and set up guidelines for using the money saved in its role of helping to ensure a balanced budget. The major expenditures, especially those for capital construction projects, must be allocated reasonably in accordance with the real-life situation of budget revenue. In the current situation, we are not allowed to consider expenditures for out-of-plan projects. Expenditures for new policies, new positions, and so forth should depend on actual revenue increases. We should actively try to expand our borrowing ability, either from foreign sources or from the people, to cover our investment and development needs. We should develop medium- and long-term borrowing plans with interest rates which can attract people's savings and which are in good accordance with bank loan interest rates. B. Continue to maintain the fiscal stability and single-digit inflation rate: The value of the dong is influenced by two things. On the one hand there are reasons for prices to go up and the purchasing power of the dong to go down. Increase expenditure in the coming months will cause demand to increase during the last several months of the year. A large inflow of foreign currency from various sources will increase the circulating money supply and push demand for goods up, thus creating more pressure for higher prices. On the other hand, the difficulties caused by the lack of a consuming market and from the competition of goods smuggled from overseas can also cause prices of agricultural products and some consumer goods to drop significantly. The large foreign currency inflow will also make the value of the dong increase slightly, thus weakening production and export activities. We need to accelerate our production activities and increase domestic and international trade. At the same time, we need to be well aware of keeping supply and demand balanced, intervening as necessary to maintain inflation at the single-digit level. We should try to avoid any sudden fluctuations in prices of goods, services, gold, and the dollar, either increases or decreases. The unreasonable disparity in prices between agricultural products and industrial ones should be overcome. The government is in the process of adjusting foreign currency management policy aiming at stabilizing the realistic exchange rates on one hand, and on the other limiting the large use of the dollar domestically, first in credit and payment transactions between business establishments and banks. Conditions should be created for the gradual implementation of the principle that the should dong only be used in Vietnam. [end recording]
