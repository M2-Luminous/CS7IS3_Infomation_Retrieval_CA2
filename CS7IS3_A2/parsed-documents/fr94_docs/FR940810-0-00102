FR940810-0-00102 FR940810-0-00021 The question of whether a negative pressure enclosure should be required for floor tile removal, was considered during the rulemaking. Some participants, including asbestos abatement consultant, Marshall Marcus recommended negative pressure enclosures as a matter of course for asbestos containing flooring removal (See e.g., Tr. 3796 and Ex. 7&hyph;37, 7&hyph;92). OSHA notes that its final rule now requires bystander protection, when excessive exposure levels are measured or expected. The questionable benefits to flooring removal employees of working within a enclosure are discussed in the general discussion on NPEs in this preamble. OSHA also notes that some exposure data submitted concerning flooring removal exposure levels, contained relatively high exposures for work within enclosures (see e.g., Ex. 7&hyph;134A) and that removing flooring using dry ice in a negative pressure enclosure can result in toxic buildups within the enclosure (see Tr. 202). Therefore OSHA is not generally requiring flooring removal to be done within NPEs. However, where flooring material is removed using ``aggressive methods,'' higher fiber levels have been reported, at least as measured by TEM (see Ex 11, # 22 and 9&hyph;18). The Agency concludes that the use of aggressive floor removal techniques in which the material is not removed intact, such as mechanical chipping of floor tile and shot-blast removal of mastic, are likely to result in the release of larger amounts of fibers and must be performed within negative-pressure enclosures or the equivalent. EPA has concluded similarly: Removal of VAT (or other known or assumed ACM flooring or its adhesive) which involves sanding, grinding, mechanical chipping, drilling, cutting or abrading the material has a high probability of rendering the material friable and capable of releasing asbestos fibers. Therefore, removal projects which employ any of these techniques (other than small-scale-short-duration) must be conducted as response actions, including use of a project designer, accredited persons, and air clearance (55 FR 48409). In response to concerns that the RFCI work practices will not be followed, it should be pointed out that the alternate to their use is full enclosure of the operation which is likely to be considered more burdensome than the work practices. Transite Removal Removal of transite panels is considered a Class II activity in this revised standard. As such, they are required to be removed using certain practices and controls. These are: the intact removal of transite panels; the use of wet methods followed by wrapping of the panels in plastic; and the lowering of panels to the ground without breakage. These provisions are in essence the same one proposed by OSHA in 1990 when allowing an exemption from the NPE requirements. The 1990 proposal presented the comments of OSHA field personnel which suggested that removal of transite panels, without regard to quantity, should be exempt from the negative-pressure enclosure requirement as long as the transite is removed without cutting or otherwise abrading the material (Ex. 1&hyph;59). This suggestion was supported by numerous participants (Ex. 7&hyph;6, 7&hyph;9, 7&hyph;23, 7&hyph;42, 7&hyph;43, 7&hyph;47, 7&hyph;52, 7&hyph;62, 7&hyph;63, 7&hyph;74, 7&hyph;79, 7&hyph;86, 7&hyph;95, 7&hyph;99, 7&hyph;103, 7&hyph;106, 7&hyph;108, 7&hyph;111, 7&hyph;112, 7&hyph;125, 7&hyph;128, 7&hyph;134, 7&hyph;144, 7&hyph;146, 7&hyph;140). Additional work practices such as wrapping panels and lowering them intact, were suggested in this proceeding and are incorporated in the revised standards [see comments of Robert Welch of Columbia Gas System who recommended wrapping intact transite panels in sheeting and lowering them intact to the ground avoiding breakage (Ex. 7&hyph;23); and, comments of Edward Karpetian of the Los Angeles Department of Power and Water, who recommended that in addition, the material be HEPA vacuumed and wrapped (Ex. 7&hyph;42)]. As noted in prior discussion of the general provisions covering construction activities, negative pressure enclosures are not required for Class II activities, unless they are performed along with a Class I activity for which an NPE is required. The rulemaking record contains strong evidence showing low exposures resulting from transite panel removal when appropriate work practices are followed. The submission of the American Paper Institute and the National Forest Products Association contained sampling data taken during the removal of transite panels from paper machine hoods (Ex. 7&hyph;74). Wet methods were used and the area was regulated. Personal and area samples were well below 0.1 f/cc, with the 23 personal samples having an average of 0.012 f/cc (not time-weighted). Rose Simpson of Lubrizol stated that ``area monitoring samples taken during transite removal operations at our facilities indicate exposure levels well below the current 0.2 f/cc and the proposed 0.1 f/cc limits'' (Ex. 7&hyph;86). OSHA witness David Kirby of Oak Ridge National Laboratory stated in his comments that personal air monitoring during transite panel removal resulted in average fiber level of 0.008 f/cc (8 hr. TWA) (Ex. 7&hyph;111). And in a post-hearing submission (Ex. 105), he presented the fiber levels (measured by PCM) generated during non-enclosed transite removal performed wet at ORNL, which ranged from <0.031 to <0.082 f/cc (mean=0.058 f/cc) (see also Ex. 140, where the Dow Chemical Company claimed transite removal real time levels did not exceed 0.07 f/c). As described above, most data show that if performed intact, transite removal will result in exposures well below the PELs. Some evidence, however, was presented showing exceedances. Paul Heffernan of Kaselaan & D'Angelo Associates, Inc. stated: *␣*␣*␣removal of transite panels which are not cut or broken should not be generically allowed. Many transite panels used in interior wall construction consist of very rough inner surfaces from which asbestos fiber is readily released into the air. Kaselaan & D'Angelo Associates has monitored the removal of 18 ’ ’ by 36 ’ ’ transite panels which were held in place with screws. The transite panels were removed intact by removing the screws and lifting the relatively small panels to the floor where they were placed in boxes. The exposed surface of each panel was first wet with amended water before removing the screws. The job was performed within negative pressure containment. Airborne fiber levels exceeding 1.0 f/cc were measured. Transite panel removal has potential for fiber release even when the panels are not broken (Ex. 7&hyph;36).
