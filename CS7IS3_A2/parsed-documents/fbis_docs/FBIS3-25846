The projects, involving a total investment of more than six billion yuan (about 690 million U.S. dollars), are helping improve Tibet's investment conditions and exploiting the abundant local resources. So far, some of the key projects managed by the state and local authorities have been put into use. The Gongkar Airport in southern Tibet, upgraded by the state to the tune of 273 million yuan, is now the only airport linking Tibet with the outside world with its advanced runway, communication facilities and passenger lounge. A comprehensive agricultural development project is providing water to another 22,000 ha [hectare] of farmland, pasture and woodland in Tibet with the completion of reservoirs and diversion works last year. As a result, Tibet will increase its production of grain by 5,000 tons and of vegetables by 500 tons a year. China's largest chromite base is also taking shape in Tibet, capable of turning out 110,200 tons of ore a year. In addition, some other key projects, including telephone services, a hydropower station and a highway, are all making progress.
