Shokhin, deputy general director of the Moscow Municipal State Industrial Railroad Transport Enterprise, chief inspector for Traffic Safety: "Without Accident or Injury: Work at the Moscow Promzheldortrans Enterprise"] [Text] A year ago, on 30 March, GUDOK published an appeal from the collective of the Moscow State Promzheldortrans Enterprise to the railroad workers and to all workers, calling for transport work to be performed in 1993 without wrecks, accidents or injuries. The year passed, and it was revealed that Promzheldortrans did not take the words as just idle talk: during the past year and the first quarter of this one, it did not permit a single wreck nor production injury. How did they succeed in achieving these results? We asked B. Shokhin, deputy general director of the Moscow Municipal State Industrial Railroad Transport Enterprise, chief inspector for Traffic Safety, to tell us. Our proposal may have seemed adventurous to some people, but all our production subdivisions took it very seriously and responsibly. We have been working toward this goal for several years, realizing that you can't eliminate defects by waving a magic wand, you need solid organizational and technological running time. Therefore we first prepared a bridgehead from which we could assume the offensive. For example, we were the first on the railroad network to introduce a system of accident-free work: "Foresight is a pledge of safety." Having become familiar with this, the specialists most likely would not find any innovations for themselves which would not be known to our colleagues from other enterprises and roads. It is my firm conviction that this is not required. One thing is necessary when working with rolling stock: impeccable adherence to the rules for technical operation and instructions and orders, for the slightest deviation from them is fraught with peril -- and commanders of all ranks must establish rigid monitoring of the entire technological chain. At selector conferences, when the question of traffic safety would come up, we most often heard complaints that the rails were extremely worn (especially on the enterprise track spurs, where we have to do our main amount of work), that railcars needing repair are in operation everywhere, and that loading-unloading mechanisms often get out of order, and indeed, are often of an obsolete design. All this is true. For some reason, though, in discussing the problems of safety, increasingly fewer people have paid attention to the human factor. When an accident happens, then as a rule, we find out: It was not the equipment that let us down, but the person controlling it. Therefore, having begun to introduce an accident-free system, we waged a most decisive battle against those who violated work discipline. A drunken person is dangerous at any production facility, but especially at a transport facility: after all, in this case, he risks not only his own life, but also the lives of other people. We must remember what tremendous material damage an accident on the railroad incurs. It is not by chance that medical monitoring is compulsory for locomotive crews and yardmasters before they go on for their shift. We decided among ourselves at the enterprise to make this more severe: we perform it not only before a team goes to work, but after the shift. A foreman who conceals a violation of discipline or lets an engineer (yardmaster) go to work when he is drunk will be fired from the enterprise, rather than the violator. Even before, we were forced to apply these strict sanctions. They proved to be effective -- we have not encountered drunkenness at the work place for three years now. We were forced to let go the ones who could not take themselves in hand, but those who were inclined to go on drinking bouts, but valued their work at our enterprise had to combat the unhealthy habit for themselves. Having got rid of our drunks, we are strictly adhering to our rules -- not to accept for work people who have been dismissed from other enterprises for the same reason. Every quarter, I personally take to the road administration lists of engineers who have been deprived of the right to drive locomotives for some specific reason. We send these lists to all the subdivisions: not a single violator who has been fired from the railroad will find any sympathy from our staff members. To this kind of person we state: Before you take on the control of equipment, you will learn to control yourself. In introducing the accident-free work system, we certified all the workers and regularly conduct recertification. This is a very serious examination for everyone. Let us say, an engineer and a yardmaster should have an impeccable knowledge not only of the rules of technical operation and safety, but of all the special features of the sections which they handle. We handle, as you know, the enterprises of the capital. The line within the city limits has an abundance of curves, grades and upgrades. An engineer who does shunting work should, of course, as they say, know with his eyes closed where the downgrade or ascending grade begins and be particularly attentive at sections with small radius curves. As should, by the way, yardmasters. An engineer is categorically forbidden to put a locomotive into motion until he is certain (visually or by radio) where the yardmaster is at the given moment. We have also resorted to a number of additional measures. Considering the present technical condition of the track and the rolling stock, we have restricted speeds in order to eliminate damage. For example, when a locomotive approaches a consist, the norm-set speed should not exceed 5 kilometers an hour, but we have restricted it to 1.5 kilometers an hour, and when a consist is fed under a trestle or when it is removed after loading or unloading, from 15 to 3 kilometers an hour. With movement along a curve with a radius of less than 120 meters, we have reduced it from 15 to 5 kilometers a hour. One often hears today that, with the transition to new economic relations, the need for monitoring adherence to discipline and the rules of safety has disappeared. People interested in the end result of work, on which their wages depend, will of themselves, without prodding, perform their duties conscientiously. They will not tolerate being alongside those who violate discipline or are sloppy workers. It is possible that when the market economy, moreover a civilized one, not the one that we have, becomes firmly established, it will be this way. For the time being, though, monitoring is necessary. Incidentally, it exists, and much more strictly than in our country, in the highly developed capitalist states. We also attribute paramount importance to monitoring functions. All the divisions, enterprises and sections have been assigned a command staff. Nor have we given up holding the "Safety and Labor Safety Practice Days." In preparing for them, we organize surprise checks, and moreover, on both the day and night shifts. I emphasize the word, surprise. It is no secret that we most often have occasion to encounter violations on paydays. With the approval of the work collectives, we issue wages once a month (formerly, as at most enterprises, we paid them twice a month). On those days we step up the monitoring at all the subdivisions. There is one more innovation which we are striving to comply with without delay. Our production commanders are obliged to check the working ability of all their subordinates every one-and-half hours in the course of a work shift. How to get to the work places, whether to call a subordinate to their offices by radio or through public safety inspectors -- that is for them to decide. The main thing is to put in place a covering force to avert violations of labor safety practices, and thus sub-standard work or an accident. Incidentally, with a staff of 800 people, over 250 of them are public traffic safety inspectors. The introduction of an accident-free work system also made us correct the regulations on material incentive. The criteria for a favorable evaluation of the work of each brigade are the absence of sub-standard work, injury, outbreak of fire and damage to rolling stock, and after that, labor productivity and the profit obtained. None of what I have said means that the problems of introducing new equipment, advanced technology and the technical state of transport developments have, as it were, been pushed into the background. In this respect we have been lucky, since the leading transport institutes are located in Moscow, and we have the opportunity of being the first to test their scientific developments and put them into operation. In conclusion, I wish to say that the accident-free work system that we introduced will prove itself as effective only when the entire set of measures is applied, from organizational to technological. The experience that we have accumulated shows that, even in the present difficult economic situation, one can work without accidents and injuries, or at least reduce them to a minimum. We have called upon and still call upon all railroad workers to do this.
