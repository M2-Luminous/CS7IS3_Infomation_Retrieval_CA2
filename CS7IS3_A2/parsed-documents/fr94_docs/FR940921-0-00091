FR940921-0-00091 FR940921-0-00016 (b) *␣*␣* (4) Evaporative emissions from 1998 and later model year heavy-duty vehicles equipped with natural gas-fueled or liquefied petroleum gas-fueled heavy-duty engines shall not exceed the following standards. The standards apply equally to certification and in-use vehicles. (i) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of up to 14,000 pounds for the full three-diurnal test sequence described in §86.1230&hyph;96, diurnal plus hot soak measurements: 3.0 grams per test. (ii) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of greater than 14,000 pounds for the full three-diurnal test sequence described in §86.1230&hyph;96, diurnal plus hot soak measurements: 4.0 grams per test. (iii)(A) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of up to 26,000 pounds, the standards set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section refer to a composite sample of evaporative emissions collected under the conditions set forth in subpart M of this part and measured in accordance with those procedures. (B) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating greater than 26,000 lbs, the standards set forth in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (b)(4)(ii) of this section refer to the manufacturer's engineering design evaluation using good engineering practice (a statement of which is required in §86.091&hyph;23(b)(4)(ii)). (c) No crankcase emissions shall be discharged into the ambient atmosphere from any new 1998 or later model year methanol-, natural gas-, or liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel, or any naturally-aspirated diesel heavy-duty engine. For petroleum-fueled engines only, this provision does not apply to engines using turbochargers, pumps, blowers, or superchargers for air induction. * * * * * 36. Section 86.098&hyph;28 of subpart A is amended by adding a new paragraph (h) to read as follows: §86.098&hyph;28 Compliance with emission standards. * * * * * (h) Fixed liquid level gauge waiver. Liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles which contain fixed liquid level gauges or other gauges or valves which can be opened to release fuel or fuel vapor during refueling, and which are being tested for refueling emissions, are not required to be tested with such gauges or valves open, as outlined in §86.157&hyph;98(d)(2), provided the manufacturer can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that such gauges or valves would not be opened during refueling in-use due to inaccessibility or other design features that would prevent or make it very unlikely that such gauges or valves could be opened. 37. Section 86.099&hyph;8 of subpart A is amended by revising paragraph (b)(1), and adding new paragraphs (d)(1)(iii) and (d)(1)(iv), to read as follows: §86.099&hyph;8 Emission standards for 1999 and later model year light-duty vehicles. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (1) Hydrocarbons (for gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles). (i)(A) For the full three-diurnal test sequence described in §86.130&hyph;96, diurnal plus hot soak measurements: 2.0 grams per test. (B) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence described in §86.130&hyph;96, diurnal plus hot soak emissions (gasoline-fueled vehicles only): 2.5 grams per test. (ii) Running loss test (gasoline-fueled vehicles only): 0.05 grams per mile. (iii) Fuel dispensing spitback test (gasoline-fueled vehicles only): 1.0 grams per test. * * * * * (d) *␣*␣* (1) *␣*␣* (iii) Hydrocarbons (for liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles). 0.15 gram per gallon (0.04 gram per liter) of fuel dispensed. (iv) Refueling receptacle (for natural gas-fueled vehicles). Refueling receptacles on natural gas-fueled vehicles shall comply with the receptacle provisions of the ANSI/AGA NGV1&hyph;1994 standard (as incorporated by reference in §86.1). * * * * *
