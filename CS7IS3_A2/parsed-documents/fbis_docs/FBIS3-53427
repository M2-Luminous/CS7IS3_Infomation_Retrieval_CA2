In 1993, conditions were not the same in all countries of the region, but there were some common denominators. In light of the Gaza-Jericho accord, the face of the Middle East will undergo a transformation in 1994 as the United States gains its objectives based on the trend toward compromise. Most of the countries will relinquish part of their geopolitical positions, and countries that are emulating the U.S. model will gain from this situation. It is an immutable fact that a large part of the world's oil resources are concentrated in the Middle East, but there is no sign of any development patterns in the region. If, in 1993, the Middle East witnessed Clinton's hosting Rabin and 'Arafat in the White House, it was solely because during the eighties, a country by the name of Iraq had embarked on an extensive war and opened the path for the West to enter Islamic countries in the nineties. This is the beginning of the end of an era in which resistance took on a different connotation. In the current year, the United States is contemplating the manifestation of another Gaza-Jericho accord so that it can make the region subservient and calm. The region should at the same time be a center for harboring a potential crisis that can be escalated into a war when the need arises. If those countries that are on the U.S. blacklist do not react, they will not get a chance to defend themselves. International economic conditions have transformed the Middle East into an oil-producing area and at the same time a consumer of goods. By the end of 1993, the Middle East oil prices had reached an unimaginable all-time low, despite the onset of the cold winter season. The hue and cry for human rights is also heard and most Middle East leaders have not yet understood the meaning of unity, of ending their differences, and may perhaps never do so. What makes the difficult days of the nineties bearable for the free nations of the region, however, is the cry of the intifadah. In any case, the Americans will step up their pressure on the progressive and independent countries of the region in order to eliminate the last vestiges of resistance. They will certainly adopt an independent approach toward each country so that the others do not wake up to it and are not aware of the danger. The Middle East of 1994 will be replete with compromising plans and levers of pressure for the United States so that a new picture may be drawn up.
