A total of 180 warheads had been removed from Ukraine to the Russian Federation by now, said Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk in an interview with ITAR-TASS at an opening ceremony of the Kiev spring fair on Friday. "It is no secret for anyone that combat nuclear missiles stationed on the Ukrainian territory were not under Ukraine's control since the `nuclear button' was in Moscow. Besides, Ukraine never sought to take possession of such dangerous weapons," the Ukrainian president said. He confirmed Ukraine's intention to implement in full a tripartite agreement signed by the Russian, Ukrainian and the U.S. presidents at the beginning of 1994. "We signed the agreement, hoping that other nuclear countries would take adequate measures and begin disarmament," Kravchuk said. He pointed out that according to information at his disposal the United States intends to make large-scale cuts of their nuclear arsenals, fulfilling agreements reached during the Moscow meeting. He went on to say that by the end of May all American missiles targeted at Ukraine would be re-coded. "The time comes when our countries will really switch over from words of friendship and cooperation to concrete deeds," he said.
