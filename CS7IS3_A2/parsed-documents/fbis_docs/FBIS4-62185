Grigoryan: "Who Is Who -- Was Clearly Shown by the Meeting in Bishkek"] [Text] As we know, on Saturday a news conference was held by the speaker of the Armenian parliament, B. Ararktsyan, where he told journalists about the meeting in Bishkek of parliamentary delegations of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, but the press center of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Armenia, for incomprehensible reasons, did not consider it necessary to invite a correspondent from GOLOS ARMENII to it. We asked a member of the Armenian delegation and chairman of the special commission of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Armenia on Artsakh, Seyran Bagdasaryan, to share his impressions. The meeting in Bishkek, which by stretching things a great deal might be called negotiations, was planned back last fall during a meeting on the Aland Islands, whose delegation, incidentally, also came to the capital of Kyrgyzstan. A fair amount of weight was added to the Bishkek meeting by the participation in it of the chairman of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS, V. Shumeyko. Since it was planned for the top people of all three countries -- the Azerbaijan Republic, the Republic of Armenia, and the Nagorno- Karabakh Republic -- to participate, it was suggested that the range of issues be broad and significant, the more so since the meeting was preceded, as we know, by a trip to Moscow by the chairman of the Azerbaijan parliament, Guliyev, during the course of which an agreement was signed for interparliamentary cooperation of the two countries. All this showed that the groundwork for Bishkek had been done fairly well. But expectations were not met from the very beginning: Instead of Guliyev, Azerbaijan "jokingly" sent his deputy Dzhalilov. And this was when the night before Shumeyko had personally received Aliyev's assurances that the chairman of the Assembly would arrive in Bishkek the next morning. For Shumeyko and Shirinkulov this was, one might say, a "cold shower," exacerbated even more by the personality and behavior of Dzhalilov, who came as the leader of the delegation from the Republic of Azerbaijan. The explanation that Aliyev was in Brussels and therefore, Guliyev could not come was not taken seriously. All this showed that the Azeris certainly did not come with serious intentions and were merely trying to take advantage of the meeting for their own irritating propaganda statements and tricks. Predicting this, the delegation from Armenia prepared a number of statements and documents in response. Unfortunately, our misgivings were confirmed: Instead of a greeting, the Azeris offered worn-out cliches about aggression, seizure of territory, etc., etc. In my view, this more likely produced the opposite reaction. B. Ararktsyan, conversely, in his speech suggested discussing all possible approaches in the most serious way. A document prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia headed by V. Kazimirov was distributed. It was called the "Bishkek Protocol" which essentially in the style of appeals presented suggestions to participants in the meeting. I consider a key feature of the document as well, incidentally, as of the whole meeting, to be the appeal to the heads of the CIS states to immediately discuss and resolve the issue of creating a contingent of peacekeeping forces in the CIS. But from the very beginning of the negotiations there was a fairly heated "dialogue" between the representatives of Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh, in which the delegation from Armenia was fairly restrained, thus emphasizing that the main problems lie on the plane of mutual relations of these two parties. Incidentally, there is no truth to the rumors that the Karabakh delegation was not allowed into the negotiation hall on the first day. The Karabakh delegation consisting of K. Babulyan and A. Gukasyan was very active, demonstrating their natural right to be called leaders of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and to represent it. As for the Azeri parliamentarians, they basically used the same old cliches they used two years ago and a similar primitive approach could not but surprise the other participants in the meeting. Be that as it may, work was started on Kazimirov's document, and if the delegation from Armenia fully supported it with small corrections, Azerbaijan from the very beginning started to demand that representatives from the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic be excluded from those who signed it. In my view, their behavior was based primarily on their refusal to accept the point about the creation of peacekeeping forces in the CIS. Such a "work style" on the part of the Azeri delegation forced Shumeyko and Shirinkulov to get together for a couple of hours with the leaders of the delegations. Essentially Shumeyko's authority was on the line and his desire to bring the two sides to common ground was quite understandable. But this looked rather strange if not ridiculous: Almost every hour Dzhalilov ran out of the office and disappeared into the corridor, after which he was almost forced to return (even, excuse me, from the toilet). And he would disappear at precisely those moments when it seemed that everything was ready for signing. After his return everything would begin all over again. Dzhalilov wasted time and, if I may say so, simply made fools out of all the participants, stating that he had to coordinate the text with Baku. Unfortunately, as a result, changes were made in the document that weaken it a fair amount. Dzhalilov demanded that a point be included concerning occupation of 20 percent of the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan, to which K. Baburin responded that he would agree under the condition that they specified precisely who would occupy it: troops of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Toward the end of the meeting the leader of the Azerbaijan delegation stated that in general, he was not authorized to sign anything at all. In his concluding speech, Shumeyko clearly summed everything up, stating, in particular, that Nagorno-Karabakh had to be recognized as a party both to the conflict and to the negotiations -- without this, no solution would be found. The Azeri delegation ended up in simply an odious position and this, incidentally, was felt by its members themselves, with whom we had numerous meetings. Our opponents accused us of causing Russia to return to the region and this could lead to an encroachment on the independence of our states. They also suggested direct bilateral negotiations, but we know quite well what attempts at such contacts can lead to. I think that now Aliyev is playing out the Western "part" of his policy, trying to straddle the fence. But his game is so transparent that only naive people could fail to see through it, and the response, it seems to me, will be appropriate for his policy. As for the Bishkek Protocol, it is so weak on the plane of concrete content that even in Baku they considered it necessary to announce its signing. Nonetheless one can say simply that the Azeris lost in Bishkek--and mainly in terms of their political image in the world. And, conversely, the Karabakh representatives, who signed the document and committed themselves to a unilateral cease-fire, took the political initiative in the region to a certain degree. At the last hour, speaking at a session of the Armenian parliament on 9 May, speaker B. Ararktsyan announced that the night before he was told by telephone from Baku that Azerbaijan had agreed to sign the Bishkek protocol.
