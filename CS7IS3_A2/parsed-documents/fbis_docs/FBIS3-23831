Ostrovskiy: "Yes, You and I Are Rich Men!"] [Text] As of the first of February, indexation of Russian citizens' personal savings has begun: savings deposits have increased threefold since 1 January 1992. However, the old familiar lines outside savings banks made up of people anxious to be personally convinced that their account was properly indexed are no more. The general indifference is not surprising. Three years ago a pensioner who had accumulated a thousand rubles in his passbook felt reassured. He knew he had enough money for several months of normal existence or, God forbid, for a decent funeral. Today, the same deposit, even threefold, would barely get him an extra bottle of vodka, and not even one from the famous Kristall factory. In previous, pre-reform years, each person who had even a few rubles in his savings passbook became a creditor of the state and its economy. There was a time when citizens' savings equalled 80 percent of the domestic national product. The state used this huge sum of money freely, boldly, and carelessly to extend credit to industry and agriculture. At first glance, we were being robbed openly and impudently; no other country in the world would have paid such a tiny rate of interest on deposits. Only now does one realize that in many ways the uncontrolled utilization of our money made it possible for prices for most consumer goods to be kept virtually unchanged for many long years. In January 1992, price liberalization came crashing in. Worker savings quickly evaporated. It was the lightning robbery of millions of law-abiding citizens. This event predetermined both the enormous losses for the economy and the impossibility of establishing social peace and calm in the country for many years to come, above all because people lost faith in the state and the course toward democratization and reforms, to which millions upon millions linked their impoverishment. The state itself, deprived of huge free credits, began to search for other sources that would keep the economy functioning at least minimally. Since the former billions were no longer on deposit, the state was forced to resort to unrestrained credit emission. Today many specialists feel that high rates of inflation, rising prices, and the impoverishment of millions are the consequence not so much of price liberalization as of the unrestricted credit emissions they are attempting to use to replace the old "private" credit. Right now the chairman of the government and the vice premier talk about the need to repay their indebtedness to certain branches of the economy, to supporting their preferential loans. They are talking about 5-6 trillion rubles [R] already in the first quarter of this year. Obviously those trillions are not in the state treasury. If they are to give them out to miners, oil workers, defense workers, and agriculture, money will have to be printed, plain and simple. Monetary emission that is not reinforced by a growth in production and services, however, is the direct route to accelerated inflation and price increases, to poverty for some and excessive wealth for others. Let us ask ourselves a question, though. Is our state truly so poor, is it so catastrophically short of money? The state, that is the government, the Central Bank, and the Ministry of Finance, may not have money. But you and I have "free" money. Quite a lot of it. You don't believe it? Goskomstat (State Committee for Statistics) publishes a survey, The Socio-Economic Status of the Russian Federation. In issue 11, in a chapter entitled "Standard of Living," on page 61, highly eloquent figures are published confirming what is at first glance a debatable assertion about the unprecedented wealth you and I possess. Between January and November of last year the population held cash used to purchase hard currency and bank deposits that amounted to nearly 22 percent of all income received. Is that a lot or a little? Let us calculate: according to the same survey, the population's income for those 11 months totaled R42.2 trillion. This means that the free money--that is, the cash in our pockets, hard currency acquired, and bank deposits--for you and me came to about R9 trillion. We can assume that in three months the population accumulates more than R10 trillion in free funds. If the government had the opportunity to utilize some of this money, to put it into economic circulation, there would not be such a need for emission, preferential credits, inflation, and further price increases. All that remains for us is to bring it to the savings banks and place it in our personal accounts. Why aren't we doing that? Why do we prefer to buy hard currency and securities, to make deposits in commercial bank deposit accounts? For one simple reason. Hard currency and commercial banks protect our money better from inflation. In order to be convinced of this, a simple calculation will suffice. Last year, the value of the dollar rose threefold. This means, the sum which someone at the beginning of the year put into the purchase of "greenbacks" grew by that much. This, of course, is not full compensation for the devaluation of money, but it is still at least some protection. The exact same effect could be derived in a bank account, given a 200-percent rate of interest. As we know, savings banks are not offering their depositors these kinds of conditions. Commercial banks, though, are taking money from the population at 300-350 percent. Unfortunately, neither deposits in commercial banks nor the purchase of hard cash can have as restorative an effect on the economy as "private" credit. Last year, 95-97 percent of all loans made by commercial banks were short-term loans for no more than three months. Normal goods production requires loans for at least half a year. The hard cash, the billions of dollars acquired by the population at exchange points, cannot work either because they lie like a dead weight in citizens' apartments or in the accounts of those same commercial banks. So there is much more free money in the country than before, but for the government, the economy, and society as a whole, it is useless. Is it possible to put those R9-10 trillion that remain with the population in the first quarter to work? Undoubtedly. For instance, it is worthwhile interesting commercial banks in long-term loan extensions for production. How? With the help of tax benefits or the transfer of property or real estate. Interest on savings bank deposits can be raised significantly. If rates exceed at least 200 percent, then many would prefer a savings bank to other financial structures. Despite all the upheavals and disappointments, many have retained their traditional trust in state guarantees. If the conditions for keeping money come even a little closer to what the commercials are promising, millions of people may again go to the savings banks. Although voucher privatization is proceeding at a speedy rate, the state still retains a significant share of property. Here it is, especially after recalculating the value of basic funds: this could become a guarantee for the repayment of debts to tens of millions of citizens. The state could transfer to the Savings Bank shares or debt obligations with right of sale at auction. The earnings would yield money for the fair compensation of deposits. Not by a pitiful and ridiculous factor of 3, threefold, but by a hefty and tangible factor of 50-70. This would return to the state its citizens' confidence and sympathy. Confidence will return. No one will be afraid to give his money up, and the state will receive a powerful financial source for reforming the economy without emissions or inflation. This year the country's population is going to have approximately R35-40 trillion. The possibility of utilizing even half of this sum would mean the return of our hopes for the economy's stabilization. Isn't this prospect worth making a decision, after having thought it all over and weighed everything, that would satisfy tens of millions of people?
