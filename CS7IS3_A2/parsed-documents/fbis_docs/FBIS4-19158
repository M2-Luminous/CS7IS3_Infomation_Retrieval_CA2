In the letter, the Greek Government rejects Albania's unfounded and suspicious claims surrounding the incident in Episkopi. The letter stresses that the great haste with which Tirana moved to blame the Greek Government is unacceptable and that [Albanian President Sali] Berisha's government remains negative although Greece has repeatedly asked for cooperation to resolve the issue. Papoulias' letter refers to Albania's suspicious intentions and motives in taking an unresolved issue and turning it into a bilateral dispute. It also accuses the Albanian Government of linking the incident with Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] and Kosovo. UN diplomatic circles consider Tirana's behavior as a desperate effort to disorientate the common view away from the serious domestic, economic, political, minority, and human rights issues the country is facing. It is believed that the Security Council will take no further step but will only suggest that the two sides cooperate to resolve the issue.
