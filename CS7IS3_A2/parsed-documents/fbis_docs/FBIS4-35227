The leader president, may God preserve him, chaired the first meeting of the new Council of Ministers which lasted approximately four and a half hours. During this meeting, his excellency delivered the following valuable and important speech: First, we would like to thank brother Ahmad Husayn for assuming the tasks of the prime minister over the past period. He exerted his utmost in this field. The statement of the Revolution Command Council was very clear. Our assessment was that our circumstances require this formula in terms of the presidency's relationship with the Council of Ministers, despite the fact that it will increase our burdens and cost us extra time. This, however, is required. You will continue to assume your ministerial posts, except the agriculture minister, who was previously a minister. Now, he is a comrade in the party and a governor and knows our course. The new thing, however, is the new situation. The new thing is that, as you recall, we addressed the Iraqis on one occasion and told them: You are in the last 10 days of Ramadan. Some people interpreted this by saying that these are the last 10 days and that the blockade will be lifted on 'Id al-Fitr. They also said that something would happen. I heard these interpretations from some people. Meanwhile, what we meant by the last 10 days is the fact that the largest period of time has passed and that the reward of the whole month will be gained during the last 10 days. In other words, man will either succeed or fail. The last 10 days need additional patience and efforts so that man will gain the reward of fasting during the month of Ramadan. Addressing the members of the Council of Ministers, his excellency said: In the past, ministers might have taken their time and read the newspapers before beginning work. But, now, the first thing I will do is read the newspapers after dealing with the basic components of the morning mail. As of now, every minister should be in his office at 0800. This is the first measure to be carried out by all, except the sick person, who should telephone Dr. Khalil al-Ma'muri, secretary of the Council of Ministers, to inform him that he cannot report to work at his ministry. This will help us know that he is sick, to be reassured about him, to wish him good health, and to follow up his medical situation. Those who are not sick should be present in their ministry at 0800. I do not want any other excuses. [passage omitted] What we want to discuss in this meeting -- which has no agenda -- is the living conditions of our people and some phenomena which I noticed in the state departments in general so that the brother ministers will work toward overcoming these phenomena once we reach agreement on them. Regarding the people's standard of living, I will explain to you how I see the prices so that you will not imagine that I am not aware of the minor details and that I am not aware of minor things in the life of the people, and consequently, I would ask you for things that would appear illogical. [passage omitted] I want to say to you that I follow up things and think them over as much as I can. Do not imagine that I am unaware of things. I follow up people's life. I want to say that we can do something, but what is it? I prefer that we hold a dialogue about this and that each of you makes his suggestions. I hope that you make these suggestions as brief and concise as possible. The deputy prime ministers and the ministers presented a number of ideas and proposals which were discussed. The leader president then said: The blockade will end just as any other issue. Wars have ended and there are still other wars. The blockade started on a certain day, and there must be a day when it will end. It is clear that the remaining time is less than the time which has elapsed. I believe that the expression we used before is accurate. However, the basis which will end the blockade, keep Iraq just as its sons want it to be, and end any strong storm with the fewest losses or sacrifices, with the continuation of the basic constants wished by its sons, the people of the country, lies in the people of the country themselves. The basis lies in the people of the country. The responsibility increases gradually in accordance with the level of influence and center of influence among the people of the country. It is natural that the minister's responsibility of steadfastness differs from the responsibility of others. This means that the minister's sense of responsibility and the level and size of influence differs from that of the ordinary employee or citizen in the state of Iraq. Thus, this includes members of the leadership, beginning with the ministry's under secretary, the director general, and ends with the end of the job scale. From the beginning we said that the basis that will fragment or lift the blockade is you. Why you? Because the more you increase your people's patience and ability to stand fast, the more this will be in your favor to end the blockade in an honorable way. Praise be to God that the country's capabilities, its sons' capacity, and the level of their awareness have remained as they are regardless of some exceptions which occur as a result of a quick assessment or a quick or hasty stand. I know the national essence of the people of the country. They understand that they have no other choice. This is how the situation can be decided the way we wish. The ministers, when they increase their activity in their offices and make their mental and organizational ability more efficient and more effective, will play a role in increasing the patience of the citizen, whether he is an employee or something else. It seems that some sides mobilized the people in a way which was interpreted as if the Iraqis should wait for good news, in a dramatic sense, after the UN Security Council's meeting which was held in May. This is wrong and is contrary to our policy. Our policy says that we are working in the international arena with all our capabilities and mental abilities. However, the basis which changes the international approach is the Iraqis' position. The Iraqis weaken their position in the international arena when they grumble too much and when their balance of patience is disrupted. They weaken their position in the international community, which has a purpose. Even he who has no purpose will no longer be enthusiastic about insisting on shortening the time for lifting the blockade when he sees the people's resistance against the blockade has become weak. [passage omitted] Our citizens have a nationalist nature. They can hear facts, and therefore, we must clarify facts to them in order to be balanced. They have been used to this issue since 1969. When onions, potatoes, or tomatoes become scarce, they make an issue out of this, and when we give them a solution by the available means, all of them will stand in the right position. So, let's do so and rely on God. At the end of the meeting, specialized committees were formed to study some urgent issues. The results of their actions will be presented to the Council of Ministers soon.
