In the speech, he dwelled on Sino-Uzbekistan relations, China's basic policy for developing ties with Central Asia, its position on establishing a new world political and economic order, and other major issues. He also gave a brief account of China's domestic situation and foreign policy. President Karimov of Uzbekistan was present. Li Peng said: President Karimov and leaders of other Central Asian nations have visited China in the past two years or so. I have now embarked on a tour of our good neighbors Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan at the invitation of the leaders of these Central Asian nations, bringing with me the friendship of the Chinese people. Such frequent exchanges of visits between the leaders of China and the Central Asian nations is unprecedented in history and signifies that relations between China and the Central Asian nations have entered a new era. China and Uzbekistan are good neighbors. The two countries shared many similarities in the past and do so today. The ancient silk road once linked the two nations closely together. Today, both of our nations are concentrating on building their own countries; they both want a long-term stable international environment; and they both want to develop equal and mutually beneficial cooperation and establish long-term, stable good-neighborly relations. I believe that through this visit, the two nations will certainly enhance mutual understanding and step up cooperation. This will undoubtedly further boost the ongoing friendship between the two nations. Li Peng said: The friendship between the Chinese people and their counterparts in Central Asia dates back to ancient times. Today, with increasing contact with the rest of the world, the Central Asian nations are writing new chapters in promoting common development and friendly exchanges between Asia and Europe. China attaches great importance to its relations with the Central Asian countries and with them, we are willing to work to build a new silk-road, with a perspective toward the future and the next century. China's basic policy on developing relations with the Central Asian nations can be summarized in the following four points: First, maintaining good-neighborly relations and peaceful coexistence. China and the Central Asian nations are close neighbors, some sharing common borders. It is the shared desire of the Chinese and Central Asian peoples to be friendly neighbors, for it serves our fundamental interests. As the Chinese people are concentrating on building their own country, they need a long-term stable and peaceful international environment, a good surrounding environment in particular. We have always cherished good will toward the Central Asian peoples, and will remain your good friends and neighbors forever. China seeks no self-interest or sphere of influence in the world, including this region. Even when China becomes more developed or prosperous in the future, it will never seek hegemonism or power politics. Instead, China will always maintain equal and friendly relations with its neighbors. You can be fully confident that no matter what happens in the world, China will not change this policy. We keep our word. Second, promoting equality and mutually beneficial cooperation and seeking common prosperity. Economic cooperation and trade are an important aspect of our bilateral relations. A good beginning has already been made in this regard, but there is still a lot that can and should be done. In developing economic cooperation with the Central Asian nations, China strictly abides by the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and attaches no political conditions. We would like to work with all the Central Asian countries to constantly improve the environment, expand the scope and enhance the quality and level of cooperation, and with mutual benefit, march along the path of common development. Third, respecting the independent choice of the Central Asian peoples and never interfering in their internal affairs. As the world is diversified, the national conditions of the Central Asian nations differ from each other. There has never been and can never be a unified mode of development that suits the realities of all countries. We believe that the Central Asian nations, just like China and other countries in the world, are entitled to independently choose the social system, concept of values, and path of development compatible with their national conditions. It is our conviction that the Central Asian nations are fully capable of and have the wisdom to handle their own matters well. Fourth, respecting other countries' independence and sovereignty, and contributing to regional stability. China sincerely hopes to see the maintenance of long-term peace and stability in central Asia. We appreciate and support all efforts made by central Asian countries to safeguard their independence and sovereignty, promote regional peace and stability, and enhance friendship and cooperation among nations. The development of our relations with any Central Asian nation is not directed against any third country, and we are willing to see the Central Asian countries living in harmony with each other. China is also ready to develop friendly relations with all countries in the world, particularly neighboring nations, including Russia and other CIS countries. The development of Central Asian nations depends on world peace and stability, while the world needs a stable and prosperous Central Asia. Speaking of the world situation today, Li Peng said: On the whole, the world is still locked in complicated and profound changes. Therefore, the establishment of a new international political and economic order represents the urgent desire of all the peoples in the world. The new international political and economic order we advocate is different in essence from the old order which was marked by hegemonism and power politics. We believe such a new order includes many contents, but its core is as follows: -- In handling international relations, the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence should be strictly followed. -- The right of different nations to choose the social system and mode of development compatible with their national conditions should be respected. -- All nations, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are entitled to participate in international affairs, which should not be determined by one or several big countries. -- Disputes between nations should be settled in a fair and reasonable way through peaceful negotiations, in the spirit of equal consultation, mutual understanding, and mutual accommodation. When conditions are not ripe, disputes can be shelved temporarily, in an effort to seek common ground while reserving differences. Disputes over some issues should not hamper the development of normal nation-to-nation relations. -- Trade and economic cooperation should be conducted in line with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and exchange of equal values. Developed nations face unshirkable responsibilities for gradually reducing the gap between the North and South. Li pointed out: The establishment of a new political and economic order of the world is a long-term and arduous task. We are ready to work unremittingly toward that, along with all countries in the world. In his speech, Li Peng also gave a brief account of China's domestic situation. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's -- the chief architect of China's reform and opening up -- theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, China has made remarkable progress in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive since the late seventies. From 1979 to 1993, China's economy grew at an average annual rate of 9 percent or more. As living standards improved in both urban and rural areas, our cause has gained the general and whole-hearted support of the people. China is now enjoying economic growth, political stability, national unity, and social progress. Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core, the whole nation, full of confidence, is marching continuously along the path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In conclusion, Li Peng said: China's development requires a lasting stable domestic environment and an international environment of long-term peace and stability, especially a good environment in its neighborhood. Today, mankind is marching toward a new century. For the bright future of China and the world at large, China will make every effort to manage its own affairs well; unswervingly pursue an independent foreign policy of peace; develop friendly relations and cooperation with all countries, especially neighboring nations, on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence; and make a new contribution to peace, stability, and development in Asia and the world as a whole.
