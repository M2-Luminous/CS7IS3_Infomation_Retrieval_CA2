It has been ascertained that the TWPLA militants have wounded one of PKK's leading members, Muslim Durgun alias Dr. Baran, and captured two PKK commanders. The TWPLA, which is the armed wing of the Turkish Communist Party -- Marxist-Leninist Organization [TCP--MLO], adopted a decision to move against the PKK after it declared Tunceli the "Dersim Province." In an extraordinary party meeting in the Mercan valley in the Munzur mountains, the TCP--MLO decided to wage a struggle to obstruct the PKK's effort to gain the upper hand in Tunceli. Moving in light of that decision, the TWPLA strengthened its armed mountain groups. TCP--MLO Secretary General Yusuf Kose and TWPLA Commander Hakki Alpan decided that PKK's strength in Tunceli must be weakened, TWPLA's militants must maintain their training on the Munzur mountains winter and summer, and the number of TWPLA's militants must be increased. It has been ascertained that the PKK has failed to achieve its objectives in Tunceli and has been forced by the consecutive defeats it has suffered to try to reach an agreement with the TWPLA. However, the TWPLA has refused to reach an agreement with that organization. It has also been ascertained that the TWPLA, which has adopted an aggressive stand against the PKK, has contacted Armenia and asked to be allowed to establish a camp in that republic.
