Boezi, WX2 From: MIC/AM WSFO PHI Subject: Evaluation of Office Move Reference: WX21 memorandum 1/21/94 In reference to the above memorandum, the responses are as follows: (1) The move was from downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Federal Building, 600 Arch Street), to Westampton township, New Jersey, just west of the town of Mount Holly. The distance is 21 road miles. (2) User notification was handled by our office and Eastern Region Headquarters. Over three thousand notifications were mailed to radio, television, cable, newspapers, cooperative observers and spotters. (3) Full service backup was accomplished by NWSFO PIT and NYC for sixty hours (60) from 7am edt August 23, 1993 to 7pm edt August 25, 1993. (4) Telephone lines were moved across state boundaries. This created numerous difficulties with the RDC/SDC AFOS circuits, the asynchronous circuits, NWR, and general telephone lines. The NWR circuit problems took the longest to resolve. The DMARC was moved from the old location to the new location. A new DMARC should have been constructed at the new facility. The old DMARC caused numerous circuit restructuring problems. All cabling and connections were installed and checked at the new facility prior to the move. (5) & (6) The furniture and equipment move was handled poorly. The ``A'' side of AFOS was dropped. SWIS was dropped and severely damaged. The equipment was loaded first and off-loaded last which was opposite to our instructions. The damage and delay in off-loading equipment contributed to lengthening operational down time of the new facility_requiring a longer full service backup. The RDA, RPG, and PUP installation went smoothly. The new facility environmental control was seriously faulty and took several weeks to fully rectify. (7) The WSR&hyph;88D was accepted approximately two weeks later than target date (early October 1993). The building was conditionally (with faults noted with suggested corrections) accepted just prior to the move. User reaction was strongly negative toward the poor communication systems or lack of proper operating communication systems prior to resolution. Current reaction of the users is highly positive. In short, the major problem was communications. The damage to the computer equipment and SWIS further delayed the restoration of full service capability. In the long run, the systems were repaired, re-routed, restructured, and stabilized to the full satisfaction of all users. Attachments: memorandum 9/21/93; memorandum WX21, 1/21/94 cc: W/ER Susan F.
