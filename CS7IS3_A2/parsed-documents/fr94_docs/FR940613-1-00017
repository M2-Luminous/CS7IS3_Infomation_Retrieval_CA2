FR940613-1-00017 FR940613-1-00003 The FDIC is particularly concerned about the appraisals of converting institutions. The FDIC believes that under the current process it may be difficult to prepare an appraisal of a well capitalized mutual institution which accurately reflects ``pro forma value'' while at the same time reflecting the appraised value cogently in a business plan of the institution. The incidence of significant appreciation in the stock price immediately after the initial public offering, which tends to exceed the stock appreciation of initial public offerings in other industries, suggests that appraisals may be too low. As a possible consequence of underpricing the institution, insiders may be able to acquire more shares than they are entitled to; moreover, a low appraisal may deprive an institution of the additional capital it should receive in the sale of conversion stock. To address the possible need for fundamental changes to the mutual-to-stock conversions process, concurrently with the publication of this proposed rule, the Board also is publishing a request for comments on ways to address concerns about the overall conversion process (Request For Comments). The Request For Comments is a separate notice contained elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . V. Explanation of the Proposed Rule 1. Overview The proposed rule would impose several specific requirements upon State Savings Banks that propose to undergo mutual-to-stock conversions. The proposed requirements are similar to the OTS Revisions. Currently and during the pendency of this proposed rulemaking, the FDIC intends to continue to use the case-by-case methodology explained in the Interim Rule in reviewing notices of proposed conversions of State Savings Banks. As noted above and in the Interim Rule, this FDIC review includes an analysis of whether the proposed conversion would comply with current OTS mutual-to-stock conversions rules. Subsequent to the adoption of a final rule, the FDIC intends to continue to use a case-by-case approach in reviewing aspects of proposed conversions that are outside the scope of the specific requirements in the proposed rule. Among other things, the proposed rule also would indicate that the requirements thereof apply, to the extent appropriate, to the reorganization of State Savings banks to the mutual holding company form of ownership. The FDIC also is involved in the mutual holding company reorganizations of federal and state savings associations. That involvement entails FDIC action on the application for deposit insurance required to be filed with the FDIC in such transactions for the de novo stock depository institution organized to facilitate the reorganization. In acting on applications for deposit insurance the FDIC must consider the factors listed in section 6 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1816), one of which is the ``general character and fitness of the management of the depository institution.'' In the course of that review the FDIC considers, among other things, the same issues of fiduciary duty that it considers in reviewing proposed mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks. As discussed below, preliminarily, the FDIC believes that each of the requirements in the proposed rule is necessary to satisfy specific FDIC concerns about safety and soundness and/or breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with mutual-to-stock conversions. At the same time, the FDIC believes that it is essential to consider the existence of state regulation and supervision in determining the proper role in the conversion process for the FDIC as the primary federal regulator of State Savings Banks. As discussed below, many of the comments that the FDIC received on the Proposed Policy Statement and the Interim Rule expressed agreement with the FDIC's federal oversight role in mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks, but several also suggested that deference be paid to states' rights on issues outside the FDIC's areas of concern. With the issuance of the proposed rule, the Board is attempting to strike the proper balance in this regard. In particular, the proposed rule includes a provision stating that, in the event that a State Savings Bank proposing to convert determines that compliance with any provision of the proposed rule would be inconsistent or in conflict with applicable state law, the bank may file with the FDIC a written request for waiver of compliance with the provision. The request would have to demonstrate that the requested waiver would not be detrimental to the safety and soundness of the bank, entail a breach of fiduciary duty by the bank's management, or otherwise be detrimental or inequitable to the bank, its depositors, any other insured depository institution(s), the federal deposit insurance funds or the public interest. As noted above, recently the OTS revised its regulations on mutual-to-stock conversions of savings associations. OTS' concerns about avoiding insider abuses in mutual-to-stock conversions of federal and state savings associations are the same as the FDIC's concerns about insider abuses in conversions of State Savings Banks. Thus, as noted above, to the extent necessary and appropriate, the proposed rule incorporates most of the same requirements recently adopted by the OTS.
