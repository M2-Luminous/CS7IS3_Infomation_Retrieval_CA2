In accordance with these, Azerbaijan's oilmen are to perform engineering-survey and seismo-exploratory operations in the Southeast Caspian that total more than $3 million. As Khoshbakht Yusuf-zade, doctor of geological and mineralogical sciences and vice president of the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan, announced, business relations with the National Oil Company of the neighboring state began to take shape by the end of the 1960's, when Azerbaijani geophysicists conducted research on a study of the geological structure of the mineral resources in the Southern Caspian that the Iranian side needed. Our specialists presented Iran with even fuller information on the geological section of the shelf in accordance with contracts for 1987 and 1991. It made possible the adoption of a decision on the need for the drilling of the first offshore well off the southern shores of the Caspian. The sinking of a parametric well in the geologically complex structure was accomplished successfully by our Khazar-2 drilling ship. The presence of hydrocarbon raw material in the said area was confirmed. The specialized ships Zokhrab Veliyev and Rezonans equipped with everything necessary for the performance of a whole set of operations ensuing from the new contracts between the oil companies of the two neighboring Caspian states will be setting off shortly for the southern shores of the Caspian.
