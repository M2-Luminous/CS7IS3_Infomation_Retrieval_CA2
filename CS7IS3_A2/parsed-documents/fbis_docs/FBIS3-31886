[Mazowiecki] To be really able to assess how far they have placed their weapons under UN control, one would have to study the situation on the spot. Undoubtedly, however, the development proves that resolute pressure can force decisions. The point is now that the things that have been achieved are not lost. [Hirsch] Will the Russian UN contingent really be neutral? [Mazowiecki] As part of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], the Russians have to observe its rules. On the other hand, Russia has, of course, achieved a political success. [Hirsch] In the West, many opposed any military intervention by saying that the political objective of the war is unclear. Might the West not be involved in intricate fights for an incalculable period? [Mazowiecki] Conversely, I am asking: What would happen without intervention? Is the alternative supposed to be: Let them bleed to death...?! Helplessness is outrageous in the event of such serious human rights violations. As early as August 1992, President Alija Izetbegovic told me that bombs have to be dropped if the heavy weapons are not withdrawn. At that time, this also seemed to be exaggerated to me. However, I am convinced that it would have been possible to get the weapons under control by strong political pressure as early as one and a half years ago. [Hirsch] How much is the West also to blame for the escalation of the conflict? [Mazowiecki] It started with the absence of any ideas for a global solution in the former Yugoslavia: How the rights of nations and nationalities could be preserved if Yugoslavia disintegrates. Slovenia and Croatia were recognized without clarifying what would be done with small Bosnia. The second mistake was made with the London conference or the lack of preparedness to implement its resolutions. At that time, in August 1992, all committed themselves to refrain from further "ethnic cleansing," to dissolve the prison camps, and not to prevent humanitarian help any longer. And what happened? None of the resolutions was adhered to, but the negotiations continued. When the monitoring of the embargo really began on the border between Bosnia and Serbia in the spring of 1993, the Serbs threatened to shell Rome or Paris or Vienna -- and the West yielded to the threats. All the time it was like this: First the West announced a resolute course of action and then it stated that it could not be implemented. Undoubtedly, the hesitation spurred the warring parties on. [Hirsch] How do you explain the helplessness of the West? [Mazowiecki] There is the fear that, for example, the death of every English soldier will lead to troubles in Great Britain: "We will not die for Sarajevo." I understand this fear. But can criminals be tolerated without any consequences? The situation was certainly different in 1939. But there is a parallel to that time, when nobody wanted to die for Gdansk. In addition, the "Vietnam complex" continues to be felt. On the other hand, let us not forget that the man in the street in Paris, Bonn, Warsaw, or London asks the justified question: If it was possible to intervene in Iraq, why can this not also be done in Bosnia? [Hirsch] The longer the war lasts, the more every side will make itself guilty.... [Mazowiecki] Unfortunately. [Hirsch] ....and therefore the West is increasingly justified in talking of a fratricidal war. Do you still see clear differences in the guilt of the warring parties? [Mazowiecki] Certainly. The policy of "ethnic cleansing," with all its brutality, was applied by the Bosnian Serbs. Then it was again revived in the Croatian-Muslim conflict -- above all by the Croatian side. In view of such a cruel policy, the respective other side -- also the Muslims -- carried out reprisals. [Hirsch] Do you know of cases where Muslims shot at their own people to force the West to intervene? [Mazowiecki] I have heard of such cases, but I can neither confirm nor deny them because I did not investigate them myself. However, one should bear in mind that the Bosnian Government has the greatest difficulties in controlling its irregular troops. A desperate act of an individual or a unit cannot be completely ruled out. I think that such a course of action is unlikely as a deliberate tactic of the government. If this became known, it would be completely compromised and would have to expect even greater pressure from the West to sign a peace treaty. [Hirsch] What is known about the situation of the raped women? How many prisoners and how many camps are still there? [Mazowiecki] According to the International Red Cross, there are still 4,000 people in prisons and camps. The number of rapes has apparently decreased. However, they still occur on all sides. The children also deserve particular attention: According to experts' estimates, 280,000 children have been indirectly or directly involved in the war. Some 16,000 have probably died. [Hirsch] What political solution is realistic after these horrors? [Mazowiecki] The pressure for the settlement of the basic problems has to continue resolutely: All prisoners have to be released and all camps have to be dissolved. Unhindered access has to be ensured for the convoys providing humanitarian help. It is extremely difficult to negotiate a solution. On the one hand, certain realities and, on the other, law and justice have to be taken into account. In my opinion, however, a peace process that makes a pluralist coexistence gradually possible is feasible after the demilitarization of the territory. But the presence of international forces and institutions will be required for a long time.
