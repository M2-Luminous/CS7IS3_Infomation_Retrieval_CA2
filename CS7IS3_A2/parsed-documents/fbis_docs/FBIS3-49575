Bosnian Croat units (HVO) [Croatian Defense Council] stopped the Moslem advance on the Novi Travnik-Nova Bila road south of Vitez, the ministry said. Over the past two days, eight people were killed and 35 civilians wounded in the region of Vitez. Another 35 people are missing and the Croat authorities believe that 14 Croat women have been taken prisoners. Fighting continued unabated despite talks on Sunday and Monday between President of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia Franjo Tudjman and Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic in Bonn and efforts of Western leaders to reconcile the former allies in the war against the Serbs. Over the past few days, Moslem forces were persistently opening fire from all weapons on Vitez, Novi Travnik, Novi Seher, Zepce and Zavidovici in central Bosnia, the strategically important region because most of former Yugoslavia's military industry is situated there. Moslem-controlled Sarajevo Radio, however, claimed on Tuesday that HVO troops were shelling the old part of Vitez and using poisonous gases in attacks on Dubravica. The situation in the area of Gornji Vakuf is more or less the same and the usual 500 shells again on Monday fell on the town and the nearby Moslem villages, said Sarajevo Radio. Bosnian Serb Army sources said Moslem forces had continued persistent attacks on all Serb positions in the area of Doboj in northern Bosnia, where the re-grouping of Moslem troops for a possible attack on Brcko was also observed. During the night, Moslem units in the region of the River Brka some eight kilometres south-west of Brcko received reinforcement from Tuzla and Zvornik, the sources said. The arrival of fresh Moslem troops was accompanied by the re-grouping of those already on the spot as well as by intensive reconnaissance of Serb positions south of Brcko with the aim of preparing a new offensive and cutting off the Bosnian Serb Republic into two parts.
