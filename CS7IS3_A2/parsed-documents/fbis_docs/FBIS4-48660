The RPF president talks about the subject of the meeting: [Unidentified correspondent] You have just met members of a UN delegation. What was the purpose of the meeting? [Kanyarengwe] As you heard recently, the UN Security Council recently resolved to send troops to Rwanda to assist the war- affected people. Today we were discussing the modalities of the coming of the force, on whether we accept its arrival and facilitate its mission. [Correspondent] What was the outcome of the discussions? [Kanyarengwe] Concerning how the force will come, we reached an understanding, but the countries composing the force will have to be agreed upon first. The other thing we agreed on is that the force will only deal with humanitarian assistance. It will help the relief organizations which are feeding people, and will stand guard due to the uncertainty related to the Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development militias] who (?are killing) innocent people. The force will rescue such endangered people by taking them to safe places where it can protect them.
