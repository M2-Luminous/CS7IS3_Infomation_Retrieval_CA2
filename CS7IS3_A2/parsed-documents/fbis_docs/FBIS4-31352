Only eight out of 137 witnesses brought their testimonies before the court on June 3. Their testimonies were related with the "incident" in the Russian Embassy, an event for which the communist government executed without trial 22 intellectuals and imprisoned scores of others unjustly. They also spoke about the way the commissions for deportions and concentration camps functioned. The first to be interrogated from the witnesses was the former attorney general in 1951, Siri Carcani. "I have only signed what was brought to me from above, without knowing anything concretely," Carcani declared. The other witness, Rasim Dedja, former deputy chairman of the Second Interior Branch, said that the lists of those to be executed or imprisoned for the "incident" in the embassy were formulated by the premier of that time, Mehmet Shehu. Former judge of the Supreme Military Court of that time, Vangjel Kocani, in the capacity of a witness, declared in the court that under instructions from senior bodies he had only signed the court decision after the 22 intellectuals had been executed. Notes from the meeting on the incident held by the government at that time, Qemal Ceka, former stenographer, said at the court, are not mine but they are notes taken by the former secretary general of the Council of Ministers, Adil Carcani himself. Former member of the CC [Central Committee] of the PLA [Albanian Workers Party] and former general director of the radio and television and later editor-in-chief of the newspaper ZERI I POPULLIT, Todi Lubonja, sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment by the communist regime for his liberal viewpoints, expressed his regret for the arrest of defendant Ramiz Alia. He said in his testimony that on the instruction of Alia, former reporter Xhelil Gjoni had written the first article against religion in Albania. (this article opened the way to anti-religious move in Albania in 1967.) Due to their grave health problems, defendants Adil Carcani and Manush Myftiu asked through their attorneys to leave the courtroom, and their request was accepted. The next session of the trial will continue on June 4 with the questioning of other witnesses.
