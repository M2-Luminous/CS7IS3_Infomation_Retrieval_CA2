Q.: Minister, which are Bulgaria's foreign policy priorities now, in view of the changes which have taken place in this country? A.: Bulgaria pursues a sovereign foreign policy, proceeding from its national interests and based on the universal standards of international law. Our efforts are directed towards the attainment of two strategic objectives: identifying an optimum national security framework and creating foreign political conditions for this country's transition to a market economy and mitigation of any adverse external factors in this field. These strategic objectives determine Bulgaria's specific priorities, and above all the integration into the European political, economic and military organizations and the Euro-Atlantic security structures. The entry into force of Bulgaria's Europe agreement will bring us considerably closer to the European Union. At the same time, we will persist in our efforts to promote economic contacts with the EFTA countries. Bulgaria joined NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative and will take an active part in it; will probably be granted special status within the framework of the Western European Union. Bulgaria will be the first postcommunist state to preside over the Council of Europe. Other priorities include promoting dialogue and updating the contractual and legal framework of Bulgaria's relations with the industrialized nations. At the same time, Bulgaria will also seek to maintain active cooperation with the countries of Eastern Europe, with Russia, Ukraine and the other countries of the former Soviet Union. It is our task to assist the creation of an external environment that would guarantee our national security and economic development. And this task is closely related to Bulgaria's activities in the Balkans. Bulgaria will continue to pursue balanced contacts with its next-door neighbours. Q.: What are the objectives of Bulgarian diplomacy in Black Sea Economic Cooperation? A.: Bulgaria has supported the idea for Black Sea Economic Cooperation from the very beginning and has substantially contributed to the drafting and adoption of the documents on its establishment. Bulgaria believes that Black Sea Economic Cooperation need not turn into a closed integration community but should rather continue developing as an open form of regional economic cooperation, allowing its members to integrate into the European structures. Bulgarian diplomacy is also seeking to expedite work on specific projects and on the achievement of concrete results mainly in transport, communications, trade, power engineering, environmental protection, science and technology, agriculture and tourism. Q.: How does Bulgarian diplomacy intend to help Bulgaria regain and expand its market positions in the former Soviet Union? A.: Bulgarian-Russian relations are gradually entering the stage of practical solution of outstanding problems, especially in the trade and economic field. Our principal aim is clear: To restore and strengthen the positions which Bulgaria has lost in this boundless market. The Bulgarian-Russian Mixed Commission will hold its second session in March to discuss mainly economic issues such as debt settlement, payments system, facilitating Bulgarian imports, and transport connections, including the idea of a ferry service between Varna and Novorossiysk. Bulgaria believes that trilateral talks should be held with Russia and Ukraine to make efficient use of the existing transport infrastructure. The foundations of trade and economic cooperation with states of Central Asia and the Caucasus are being laid on the initiative of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry. This is a difficult and slow process, but concrete results have already been achieved. A protocol on the establishment of a joint Balkan Credit Bank was signed with Kazakhstan in 1993. Trade, financial and transport agreements are expected to be signed this year with Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. Q.: To what extent are the priorities of Bulgarian diplomacy determined by this country's economic interests? A.: Bulgarian diplomacy still attaches primary importance to seeking solutions and assisting various international institutions and advanced countries for compensation of Bulgaria's embargo- related losses and alleviating their burden on its economy. I believe there is broad political consensus in this country on the invariability of the policy line towards Bulgaria's full integration into the European economic area. You have witnessed Bulgarian diplomatic activity over the past few years which resulted in the signing of a Europe Agreement and an Interim Trade Agreement between Bulgaria and the European Union. An free trade agreement with the EFTA countries has already entered into force. We intend to make still more active use of the European Union's cooperation programmes and maximize the funds provided within the framework of the PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] programme. Bulgaria's full integration into the European Union is a long-term target of this country's foreign policy. I would like to stress the special importance we attach to our relations with GATT. The negotiations have reached a decisive stage. Bulgaria's accession to that organization would guarantee this country equal participation in world economy and trade, upgrade its international prestige and encourage foreign investment. Q.: Minister, thank you for this interview.
