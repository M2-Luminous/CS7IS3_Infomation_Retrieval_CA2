The statement by the Chechen Foreign Ministry spread in Groznyy on Friday describes as a flagrant interference into the affairs of an independent state the Russian Federal Assembly's decision "On the Political Settlement of Relations between the Federal Bodies of Power and the authorities in the Chechen Republic." The decision envisages the holding of free elections to the top power bodies of the Chechen Republic as a condition for the continuation of the talks aimed at signing a Russian-Chechen Treaty. The actions of different power bodies of the Russian Federation point to a new stage in aggravating the situation around the Chechen Republic, says the statement. It expresses readiness to continue the talks aimed at settling the relations with Russia on a civilized basis and in accordance with the principles of international law.
