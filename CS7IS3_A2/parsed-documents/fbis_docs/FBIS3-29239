Hosokawa will call top bureaucrats to his official residence Thursday afternoon to discuss the market-opening measures, including those to boost government procurements and further relax government regulations. Earlier this week, the premier expressed readiness to do more to balance bilateral trade, 50 billion dollars in favor of Japan, after talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton over the "framework" trade talks broke down last week. Apparently frustrated with the stalemate in the framework talks, the U.S. Government announced steps to impose sanctions against Japan for what it sees as a closed market for foreign cellular phones. Koichiro Matsuura, vice foreign minister for international affairs, Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice international trade and industry minister for international affairs, and Kosuke Nakahira, vice finance minister for international affairs, will attend the meeting Thursday. The sources said the measures to be worked out by the meeting will include a step to make the procedures required for government procurements of telecommunications and medical equipment faster and more transparent. Government procurements are one of the focuses covered by the framework trade talks. A pact has almost been completed over the issue, except for a disagreement over a U.S. demand that "objective criteria" be set to gauge Japan's efforts to slim its trade surplus. The government plans to implement what the two countries have so far agreed upon on the matter. Also envisaged are further deregulations aimed at narrowing the price gap between home and abroad and a quick enactment of the budget plan for fiscal 1994, starting in April. The government is also likely to ask the car and other key industries to voluntarily make efforts to open their markets to foreign products. The sources said Japan will explain its efforts at the upcoming meeting in Germany on February 26 of finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven economic powers. The government will also have consultations with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, due to visit Tokyo shortly, over how to unblock the bilateral trade negotiations. On the U.S. sanctions, the sources said the government plans to file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if the U.S. actually imposes them. Hosokawa said earlier in the day that the government "will seek a settlement of unilateral sanctions in accordance with international rules." The government will also protest a U.S. decision to withdraw its offer to lower tariffs on electronics parts. In addition, Tokyo will tell Washington to refrain from making remarks alluding to its tolerance of a higher yen. Speculation that the U.S. desires a stronger yen to help cut the bilateral trade gap has driven the Japanese currency above 5 yen in the last three sessions.
