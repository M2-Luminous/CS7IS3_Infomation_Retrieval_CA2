According to Hasanov, initially they plan to establish durable contacts with 60 countries. This is one-third of all the U.N. member states. The head of the Azeri Foreign Affairs Department attributed special places in this list to contacts with the United States, Russia, Great Britain, France and China, the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and arbiters in world politics. According to Hasan Hasanov, stable working ties have currently been established with four of the countries, excluding the U.S., and documents regulating bilateral relations on a normative-legal basis have been signed. The minister emphasised that "in relations with Russia, an end has been put to the policy of mutual reproaches and accusations". He said to that, thanks to measures adopted by the republic's new leadership, faults and instability in the relationship have been removed, old ties are being revived and new ones, especially trade and economic ones, are being established. The second most important feature of the Azeri foreign policy, according to Hasan Hasanov, is the need to reassess his country's ties with the two neighbouring states of Turkey and Iran. Although membership in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is approved in the republic, as relations with the CIS are relegated to third place Azerbaijan's foreign policy. Membership in the CIS, which is considered here as one of the most authoritative interstate regional organizations, has helped the republic restore its ties with traditional economic partners, and has politically helped it ensure the protection of the republic's national interests.
