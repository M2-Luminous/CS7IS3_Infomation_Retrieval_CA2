Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry], the manufacturer's association, and the three major trade federations CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor], CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions] and UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions], met today with Prime Minister Ciampi, Treasury Minister Piero Barucci and Labor Minister Gino Giugni in preparation for that international meeting on employment scheduled for March 14-15. "We think last July's agreement should be highlighted as a model for a bargaining agreement that involves labor, management and the government," said Confindustria director general Innocenzo Cipolletta. Cipolletta, who attended today's meeting along with the vice president of the association Carlo Callieri, asked the government to urge the G-7 to focus on the following issues: stimulation of demand, development policy, training policy, and a more flexible labor market. Antonio Lettieri, in charge of international relations for CGIL, the largest of Italy's three trade union federations, asked the government to press for "the introduction of a `social clause' in international trade accords that would provide a floor of protection for workers rights" in those G-7 talks.
