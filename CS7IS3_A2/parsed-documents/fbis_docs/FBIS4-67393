According to the METLA report, the amount of toxic cadmium in moss samples has decreased by one-fourth over the past five years. Cadmium and nickel emissions into the air have decreased because the fertilizer industry has changed its production methods. According to an earlier Environment Ministry study, discharges into the ground increased during the late 1980's, but emissions into the air and water decreased. Cadmium is one of the most toxic elements. As an environmental toxin, it accumulates in tissue, especially the kidneys and liver, and it may cause serious intoxication. Not all of cadmium's injurious effects are known. Most in Harjhavalta and Kokkola According to the METLA study, high cadmium content was still measured in the moss samples collected in Harjavalta and Kokkola. There were also increased concentrations in the environments of the biggest population centers in southern and southwestern Finland. METLA studied heavy metal discharges in moss. In the study that was just completed, they compared the results obtained in 1985 with the moss samples collected in 1990. About 5,000 samples were collected from 3,009 different sites in Finland in the selected test area. "I'm particularly pleased with the drop in cadmium and lead discharges since they spread easily to wide areas. For example, cadmium reaches Finland as remote fallout from Central Europe," Assistant Professor Eero Kubin of METLA said. Cadmium gets into the environment from the fertilizer industry and from combustion gases produced by the burning of waste, among other sources. There is also a certain amount of cadmium in phosphate fertilizers and substances used for coating products. There was over 0.5 microgram of cadmium per gram of moss sample in Kokkola and Harjavalta. Concentrations of as much as 2 micrograms per gram were found in moss in studies made in Poland, Romania, and Hungary. According to the foreign substance statute, there may be up to 0.1-0.5 milligrams of cadmium per kilogram in foodstuffs. "The order of magnitude is the same if the guideline figure is compared with the results of the moss studies, although moss is not eaten. It is, nevertheless, hard to say whether the Kokkola or Harjavalta discharges are affecting people's health," METLA chemist Harri Lippo said. Study To Be Repeated Next Year "We get a good picture of heavy metal emissions in Finland and how they are changing with the aid of samples. Impurities in the atmosphere like heavy metals reach the ground along with rainwater. The metals accumulate in the tissues of the moss since they get their nourishment from rainwater," Lippo said. The extensive moss study will be repeated next year. The study is part of an international follow-up study that was begun as a joint Nordic effort in 1985. From the results it is apparent that the volume of lead, which is damaging to people and the environment, has decreased by one-third over the past five years. The switch to unleaded gasoline has done the most for reducing lead emissions. The volume of vanadium in the environment has also decreased since the oil refineries have abandoned the use of heavy fuel oil and switched to natural gas. Chromium, copper, iron, and zinc concentrations have remained at the same levels or increased slightly. Tornio's large chromium emissions have, however, decreased since the Outokumpu steel mill improved its cleaning equipment. Chromium is known to cause allergies.
