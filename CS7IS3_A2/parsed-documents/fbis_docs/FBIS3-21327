He said this had become necessary as with the Janata Dal in crisis everywhere, the Mulayam Singh government in Uttar Pradesh had become dependent on the Congress. In the circumstances, one could not expect the Mulayam Singh government to oppose the Congress government at the Centre on major issues, like the new economic policy. At the national plane also, the CPI(M-L) would work unitedly with the Left parties to oppose the "anti-people" policies of the Rao government at the Centre. The party would participate in the proposed rally by the Left parties in Delhi on April 5 against the Dunkel proposal, he added. Mr Mishra, however, made it clear that while trying to work unitedly with the CPM and the CPI elsewhere, the CPI(M-L) would continue to oppose the "anti-people" activities of the CPM-led Left Front government in West Bengal. Mr Mishra regretted that corruption had become institutionalised in West Bengal during the 17-year rule of the Left Front government. Asked if they wanted the Left Front government in West Bengal to go, he replied that they would never like it to be replaced by a Congress or the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] government. They will support the Left Front government in the event of any attack on the government by the Centre or communal forces. But they would in no case agree to the CPM's demand that they should give up their criticism of the Left Front government if they wanted to be an ally of the Front. Mr Mishra said that the CPI(M-L), which held its central committee meeting for three days ending on January 10, had decided that henceforth the Indian People's Front (IPF) an associate body of the party, would no longer be an electoral platform. Supporters of their cause would henceforth fight the elections under the banner of the CPI(M-L). Efforts were on to form a national level platform with the IPF and organisation, like Narmada Bachao Andolan, Lal Nishan Samiti of Maharashtra and Rajasthan Kishan Sangathan, to fight unitedly major issues like communalism and the new economic policy. Ms Medha Patkar was scheduled to visit Patna next month for holding preliminary talks in this regard. Asked to comment about the emergence of the Bahujan Samaj Party, Mr Mishra said that a particular political situation had brought the party to the forefront in Uttar Pradesh.
