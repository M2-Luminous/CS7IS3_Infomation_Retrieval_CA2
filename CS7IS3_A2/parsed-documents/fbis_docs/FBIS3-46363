This was stated at a municipal comprehensive economic working meeting held recently. Efforts will be made from now to improve the investment environment of Beijing, shift investment directions and diversify the forms of utilizing foreign funds. The municipal government will attach much importance to investment from transnational corporations and investments to be used for urban infrastructure construction, major national projects and high-tech projects. Profit-earning and efficiency will be stressed in utilizing foreign funds, instead of merely asking for increased numbers of projects and expansion in the amount of investment. Diversified and more flexible forms will be adopted in utilizing foreign funds, such as introducing share-holding systems, contacts with overseas investment funds and issuing of "b"-shares -- shares which companies in China issue solely for foreigners to buy. A more authoritative and sensitive information network offering latest information to foreign investors will be established soon. Approval procedures for foreign-funded projects will be simplified and different procedures will be followed for different kinds of projects. Implementation of related laws and regulations will be strengthened to protect the interests of all sides involved. Fifteen years of reform and opening-up of the country has brought about establishment of 7,500 overseas-funded enterprises in Beijing and an imported investment totalling ten billion U.S. dollars. The opening drive reached its zenith last year with newly approved foreign-funded enterprises reaching 3,752 in number, almost equalling that for all the previous 14 years put together. Last year's batch included 49 large-scale projects involving foreign funds of at least 50 million u.s. dollars each. Among foreign investors in Beijing, the number of world-renowned transnational corporations has reached 60.
