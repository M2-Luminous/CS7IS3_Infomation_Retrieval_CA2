Thirty-two percent of the polled are in favor of liberal values, including 24 percent who recognize the values in conjunction with simultaneous social protection by the state. Even the mere notion of "liberalism" arouses negative responses by a majority of the polled. From among citizens' rights, the right to social protection turned out the most important one to our society (97 percent of citizens said it is important). Among others, the right to freedom of speech (85 percent) and electoral rights (78 percent) were listed as less important. As far as fulfilling citizens' duties is concerned, caring for one's elderly parents is the most important duty (96 percent), according to those polled. Fewer people talked about the need to observe the law (95 percent), the need to pay taxes (73 percent), or about military service duty (57 percent). People in favor of economic liberalism not accompanied by the state's social protection (8 percent of those polled) are mainly young people with higher educations. Poles are a conservative nation that bases its values on authorities. Eighty-eight percent of those polled think that children should be taught obedience vis-a-vis their parents and that one should listen to older and more experienced people (75 percent). Liberal principles are approved by Polish people on an ad hoc basis; the majority are in favor of state intervention and strong state power. On the other hand, we agree with the separation of church and state (69 percent). A majority of Polish people (77 percent) are convinced that the market economy will make the rich even richer while the poor will get poorer. Those polled approve of such principles of economic transformations as privatization, the lifting of price controls, and free trade, but, at the same time, they take a suspicious view of people involved in independent economic activities. Even the mere notions of "liberalism" and "liberal" bring negative images to the respondents' minds. Despite this, Polish people are of the view that enterprises run by private owners are the most efficient. This view was expressed by 67 percent of those polled. * * * The poll was conducted last January for the Friedrich Naumann Foundation by PENTOR, using a 1,000-person sample of adult Poles.
