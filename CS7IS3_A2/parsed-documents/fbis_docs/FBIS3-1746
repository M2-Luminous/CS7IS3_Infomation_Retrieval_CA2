The Implementation of the 1993 Plan In 1993, the national economy of the whole province, on the basis of the relatively fast growth of the previous year, continued to maintain a good momentum. After the implementation of Document No 6 of the Central Committee in particular, the increasingly tense economic environment was improved, the pace of economic construction was accelerated, the strength of reform and opening up increased, various social undertakings were vigorously developed, and the annual plan of the main sectors of the national economy was basically fulfilled or overfulfilled. The domestic gross output value of the whole year was 186.6 billion yuan, an increase of 12.8 percent, of which the tertiary industry increased by 12.3 percent. The gross output value of the industrial and agricultural production was 366.53 billion yuan (334.07 billion yuan as calculated according to the constant prices in 1990), an increase of 26.8 percent. They were respectively 3.8, 0.3, and 15.4 percentage points higher than the requirements of the annual plan. 1. The rural economy developed steadily and township and town enterprises grew at a high speed. Last year, despite natural disasters, a relatively good harvest was reaped in agriculture through the common efforts of the whole province. The total grain output of the whole province was 43 million tonnes, 1.311 million tonnes less than the previous year. The number of hogs marketed was 67.38 million, 1.38 million more than the previous year. Trees were satisfactorily planted over 5.34 million mu of land, which greatly exceeded the targeted area of the plan. The situation of a higher rate of tree-felling than tree-planting began to change. Some 3.15 million mu of medium- and low-yield fields were transformed, 5.1 percent more than the requirement of the annual plan. The township and town enterprises developed at a high speed. Their total annual output value was 191.87 billion yuan, 95 percent over the previous year. The income from sales and profits and taxes increased simultaneously. The momentum of rural laborers going out of the province was good. The annual gross output value of agriculture was 84.59 billion yuan (81.1 billion yuan as calculated according to the constant prices in 1990), 1.5 percent over the previous year. 2. The reform of enterprises was continuously deepened, industrial production grew at a high speed, and the economic results were improving. Our province thoroughly implemented the "Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations on Changing the Operational Mechanism of Enterprises Under the Ownership of the Whole People," emphatically grasped the work of changing the operational mechanisms of 2,000 enterprises, and selected 22 large and medium-sized state enterprises for carrying out experiments on the establishment of the modern enterprise system. Industrial production maintained rapid growth throughout the whole year. The gross output value of industry of the whole province was 281.94 billion yuan (252.97 billion yuan as calculated according to the constant prices in 1990), an increase of 37.8 percent, of which industries at or above the township level accounted for 212.61 billion yuan (181.39 billion yuan as calculated according to the constant prices in 1990), an increase of 20.9 percent. They were respectively 22.8 and 8.9 percentage points higher than the requirements of the annual plan. The output of major industrial products increased by varying degrees and the annual plans for them were overfulfilled. Production was basically in keeping with marketing and the annual marketing rate of products reached 96.1 percent. The economic results of enterprises were improving. The total amount of profits of local state-run industrial enterprises included in the provincial budget was 77 percent higher than the previous year and the growth of profits and taxes was 43.7 percent. 3. The investment structure was readjusted to some extent and the construction of key projects was strengthened. Last year the increase in the investment in fixed assets of our province was relative big, the number of newly started projects was reduced, the investment structure was further readjusted, and the work of key construction projects was carried out in a down-to-earth manner. It is estimated that 50.6 billion yuan of investment in fixed assets of the whole society in the whole year was completed, 24.8 percent over the previous year. In accordance with the requirements of the central authorities on strengthening macroregulation and control in investment in fixed assets, our province seriously checked up on invested projects under construction and arranged them into different categories. We ensured the construction of the most important ones and increased the speed of construction of key projects. With efforts during the past year, most of the key construction projects in Sichuan progressed smoothly and some of them were completed and put into operation. 4. Great efforts were made to strengthen market building and urban and rural markets were stable and tended to become brisk. Last year, emphasis was made on grasping the reform of the circulation structure and the building of the market system and markets of various kinds developed to a varying degrees. Efforts were made to develop urban and rural markets and to meet the purchase demands of the residents. The supply of consumers' commodities was abundant across the province. The annual social commodity retail sale volume amounted to 85.46 billion yuan, 18.8 percent over the previous year and exceeding the requirement of the annual plan. Following reforms in housing, medical service, education, and the social security system, the noncommodity consumption of the residents increased to a relatively great extent. 5. The province was opened wider to the outside world and progress of a breakthrough nature was made in attracting foreign businessmen and capital. The annual import and export volume was $2.916 billion, 32.6 percent over the previous year, of which the export volume was $1.65 billion, an increase by 11 percent. The total volume of border trade was 750 million yuan, 74.4 percent over the previous year. The establishment of 1,910 additional foreign- invested enterprises were approved in the whole year and agreements involving the introduction of $2.4 billion were signed. The direction of foreign investment also began to shift from ordinary industries to capital-intensive and technology-intensive industries, basic industries such as power industry, transportation, and telecommunication, and technical transformation of large and medium-sized enterprises. 6. The work related to financial revenue was satisfactorily carried out and the financial order was improved to some extent. The annual revenue amounted to 20.14 billion yuan, an increase of 37.1 percent. In view of the drastic fall in bank savings and abnormal cash inputs in the first half of the year, governments at all levels seriously implemented various measures concerning the strengthening of macroregulation control put forward by the central authorities and the province, resolutely consolidated the financial order, made great efforts to pool funds, seized the opportunity to grant more loans, readjusted the credit structure, and ensured the needs of economic development and key construction projects of our province are met. 7. The science, education, and other social sectors were strengthened and the living standard of the people was further improved. Last year, with the support of state departments concerned, our province undertook 180 key state projects and 55 key projects included in the provincial plan to turn achievements in science and technology into productive forces. Good results were made in different stages in most of the projects and they produced good economic results in production. Through making great efforts to enhance technical progress, the ability of enterprises to develop technology with their own resources and to digest and absorb technology was greatly increased. Greater importance was attached to education, the input into education by the whole society continued to increase, the quality of education was improved, and benefits from running schools also increased to some extent. The speed of the development of ordinary middle school education and tertiary education increased markedly and the scale of enrollment was enlarged. People's living standards continuously improved and their living conditions also improved to some extent. Urban and rural construction developed steadily. Medical service and public health work further developed and, in particular, the rural sanitary conditions were improved to some extent. Family planning was considerably strengthened and the rate of the annual natural population growth was 9.57 per thousand. At the same time, various social undertakings such as culture, arts, radio, television, the press, publication, employment, tourism, and sports, developed by varying degrees. 8. The economy and society of areas inhabited by minority nationalities developed comprehensively. Last year, areas inhabited by minority nationalities in our province further emancipated their minds, made greater efforts in reform and opening up, overcame various difficulties in economic life, and maintained a good situation of a relatively fast development of the national economy and social stability. The domestic gross output value of areas inhabited by minority nationalities of the whole province is expected to be 9.6 percent over the previous year. The total grain output was higher than the previous year. In the pastoral areas, the rate of cattle marketed and the commodity rate increased. The annual gross output value of agriculture increased by 5.5 percent. Mainstay industries characteristic of the strong points of resources in areas inhabited by minority nationalities continued to take shape and the speed of construction of transportation, telecommunication, and other infrastructure was accelerated. The living standard of the people continued to improve and the annual per capita net income of the peasants and herdsmen is expected to reach 500 yuan. However, some conspicuous contradictions and problems also cropped up in the course of the implementation of the plan. The first is that last year, the prices of the means of agricultural production rose too fast and the efficiency of agriculture declined. The second was that the contradiction between the supply and demand of funds was too sharp. The third was that the coordination in development between heavy and light industry, and between the state- owned large and medium-sized enterprises on the one hand and the state-owned small enterprises on the other, was not good enough. The fourth was that commodity prices rose too fast. Besides, there were other problems such as inefficient macroregulation and control and funds were too widely spread. In making economic plans this year, we must pay great attention to these contradictions and problems and have them properly resolved. II. Arrangements of the 1994 Plan This year is a crucial year in promoting reform to establish the socialist market economy structure. It is also an important year to promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhen 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the national economy. Therefore, planning arrangements should have new ways of thinking and should meet the needs of the new economic structure. According to the guiding ideology for the economic work of the whole province put forward by the provincial government, we should lay stress on grasping the four principles in planning arrangements this year: The first is to maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. The second is to ensure the smooth implementation of various reformative measures. The third is to properly readjust the economic structure of our province in accordance with the needs of building the socialist market economy structure. The fourth is to effectively control the range of the rise of the general level of commodity prices to maintain social stability. According to the above principles, the arrangements for the main targets of the national economy and social development plan of the whole province this year are: The domestic gross output value is to be 220.8 billion yuan, an increase of 9.6 percent; of which the increased value of the tertiary industry is to be 60.7 billion yuan, an increase of 11.3 percent. The gross output value of industry and agriculture is to be (as calculated according to the constant prices in 1990) 376.8 billion yuan, an increase of 12.8 percent. The financial revenue is to be 12.24 billion yuan, an increase of 9.7 percent. The total retail volume of commodities of the society is to be 100.8 to 102.6 billion yuan, an increase of 18 to 20 percent. The total index of retail prices of the whole society is to be controlled around 110 percent. The local investment in fixed assets of the whole society is to be 30.786 billion yuan, 70.8 percent over the beginning of last year. The per capita net income of the peasants is to exceed 775 yuan, an increase of more than 80 yuan, and efforts are to be made to increase their income by 100 yuan. The rate of natural growth of the population is to be 11.66 per thousand and the population at the end of the year is to reach 112.456 million. The main aspects of the planning arrangements are: 1. Continue to put agriculture in the most important position of economic work. The gross output value of agriculture is planned to reach 84.3 billion yuan, an increase of 4 percent; and the total grain output is planned to reach 43 million tonnes, which is expected to be the same as that of last year. The gross output value of township and town enterprises is to reach 250 billion yuan, an increase of 30 percent. Stabilizing grain output, increasing income, and structural readjustment are regarded to be the main targets and guiding ideology of rural work. Striving to become relatively well-off is to be in command of all rural work. Reform is to be deepened, structural readjustment is to be made, circulation is to be invigorated, the first, second, and third industries in rural areas are to be developed in a coordinated manner, and great efforts are to be made to achieve breakthroughs in increasing the agricultural output, increasing the peasants' income, and developing township and town enterprises. 2. Seize the opportunity to deepen reform of enterprises and to maintain a rapid and efficient growth of industrial production. According to this year's plan, the gross output value of the whole province is to reach 292.5 billion yuan, 15.6 percent more than the previous year. The gross output value of industries at and above the township level is to reach 203.2 billion yuan, an increase of 12 percent. A certain growth rate is to be maintained in the output of main industrial products. According to the plan, it is necessary to create good external conditions for deepening the reform of enterprises and for improving state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. It is necessary to speed up the reform of enterprises and structural readjustment, regarding the improvement of state- owned large and medium-sized enterprises as the center and the establishment of the modern enterprise system as the target. It is necessary to, through deepening the reform of enterprises, strengthen management, reduce consumption, lower production costs, and energetically increase the economic results of industry. 3. Maintain a rational scale of investment and make great efforts to readjust the investment structure. This year, the scale of local investment in the fixed assets of the whole society is 30.786 billion yuan, of which the investment local state-owned units accounts for 23.036 billion yuan, and that of collective investment, 7.75 billion yuan. It is necessary to widen the investment and fund-raising channels for basic projects and key construction projects and to support the development of bottle-neck industries and the exploitation of resources. It is necessary to make greater efforts to readjust the investment structure. In making investment, the province is to give priority to projects for transportation, agriculture, water conservation, telecommunication, energy, and important raw materials, projects jointly constructed by the state and the province, winding-up projects, projects whose products are required to meet targeted quotas, and projects whose construction is resumed. The focus of technical transformation is to optimize the structure, save energy consumption, do a good job in the transformation of state-owned large and medium-sized old enterprises and old industrial bases, and raise the level of key industries centering round industries with strong points and best-selling products. 4. Do a good job in the planning, layout, and construction of various key markets in our province and make great efforts to develop and expand the markets; deepen the reform of the operational structure and make great efforts to raise funds. A number of big markets are to be developed in our province in important places where commodities are produced, marketed, collected, and distributed and stress is to be laid on the construction of a number of large and multifunctional wholesale markets which can have a positive impact on a wide range of neighboring localities. The uneven development of the market system in our province is to be changed. The nurturing and development of the funds, stock, technology, information, qualified personnel, labor power, and other essentials markets are to be speeded up and the gradual formation of the market system is to be promoted. On the basis of consolidating the order last year, the reform of the financial structure in our province is to be properly carried out and the macroregulation and control of the people's banks are to be strengthened. At the same time, various specialized banks are to be gradually changed into commercial banks. Efforts are to be made to encourage people to keep more bank savings, to properly run various kinds of social security undertakings, and to pool up funds to meet the needs of economic development. 5. Make great efforts to open up wider to the outside world, to expand foreign economic relations and trade, and to attract foreign businessmen and introduce foreign capital. According to the plan, the total import and export volume in the foreign trade of whole province is $3.15 billion, an increase by 8 percent, of which the export accounts for $1.815 billion, and efforts are to be made to make it $2 billion. In the whole year, $3 billion of foreign capital involved in agreements is to be used and the amount of foreign capital to be actually used, $1 billion. Efforts are to be actively made to keep abreast with the reform of the foreign trade and foreign exchanges structure and various enterprises with necessary conditions are to be encouraged to increase export to earn more foreign exchange. Continued efforts are to be made to readjust the export product mix of our province, to earnestly strengthen quality control and supervision, and to strive to bring about a marked improvement of the quality of the export commodities of our province. The investment environment is to be further improved to attract more foreign capital for foreign-invested enterprises in Sichuan. Efforts are to be made to have more than 2,000 additional foreign-invested enterprises. Industrial policy guidance for foreign businessmen to make investment is to be strengthened and foreign businessmen are to be encouraged to continue to make investment in infrastructure, basic industries, high-technology and new-technology industries, and the technical transformation of old enterprises. 6. Implement the strategy of "revitalizing Sichuan with education" and the "Law on the Progress of Science and Technology," and make great efforts to turn science and technology achievements in science and technology into realistic productive forces; implement the "Education Reform and Development Program" and the "Teachers Law" and train various kinds of qualified personnel to meet the needs of economic construction. The reform of the science and technology management structure is to be pushed further forward and the focus is to be put on turning achievements into productive forces. Efforts are to be concentrated on a number of science and technology projects which have good market prospects, high added-values, a major role in the development of the national economy of our province, and a role in promoting the development of relevant trades and of the regional economy. At the same time, various ways are to be adopted to extensively carry out science and technology consultation, technology exchanges, and other activities in a bid to apply faster more achievements in science and technology to production and construction. Education is to be earnestly put in a strategic position and priority is to be given to its development. To meet the needs of qualified personnel for reform, opening up, and economic development, the readjustment of courses, levels, and speciality structure of colleges, universities, and post-secondary institutes is to be speeded up. The issue of personnel needed by border and remote areas, poor mountain areas, areas inhabited by minority nationalities, sectors whose work is difficult to do, and township and town enterprises is to be solved through expanding the enrollment of students whose assignments after graduation are fixed, students trained on behalf of departments and organizations, and students who paid for their tuition. The structure of running schools is to be further reformed to meet the needs of the social and economic development. Various channels are to be used to raise funds for running schools, conditions for running schools are to be improved, and the quality and benefits of running schools are to be improved and increased. 7. Meet the needs of economic development, promote the coordinated development of various social undertakings, and strive to improve the people's living standard. Public health undertakings, cultural undertakings, and social security undertakings are indispensable factors for the assessment of the goal of being relatively well-off. While grasping economic development, governments at all levels must make unified planning with due consideration for all concerned to ensure coordinated development. In a bid to meet the needs of and keep abreast with the progress of the general reform, the speed of reform in the social security system and the housing system is to be accelerated, and the comprehensive progress of the social undertakings of the whole province is to be promoted. On the basis of developing the economy and increasing benefits, the living standard of the urban and rural residents are to be further improved. 8. Have a foothold on the strong point of resources, and speed up the economic development of areas inhabited by minority nationalities. The "Nationality Regional Autonomy Law" is to be comprehensively implemented, various policies to help areas inhabited by minority nationalities issued by the state and the province are to be fully utilized, and flexible opening up strategies are to be adopted to speed up the economic development of areas inhabited by minority nationalities and to narrow the gap between these areas and the hinterland. A foothold is to be planted on the strong point of resources in areas inhabited by minority nationalities and the construction of agriculture, power industry, nonferrous metal industry, gold industry, transportation, telecommunication, and other basic industries and infrastructure is to be further stressed. Great efforts are to be made to exploit tourism resources and to develop tourism and tourism is to be used to promote the development of the tertiary industry in areas inhabited by minority nationalities in our province. Greater efforts are to be made to develop social undertakings in areas inhabited by minority nationalities and the cultural, science, technology, and health levels of the peasants and herdsmen are to be constantly raised. Great efforts are to be made to comprehensively fulfill the Eighth 5-Year Plan a year ahead of schedule. 9. Do a good job in regional planning and promote regional economic development. The two center cities of Chengdu and Chongqing are to be used as a support, the preferential policies for opening up the two cities are to be fully used and extended, and the developed areas and the backward areas are to be linked up in order to attain common prosperity. "The two lines" are to be developed with great effort, on the basis of continuously developing agriculture, township and town enterprises, to speed up the development of the second and tertiary industries, and to promote the process of industrializing the rural areas and integrating the urban and rural areas in a bid to become relatively well-off earlier. The three gorges economic zone is to seize the opportunity, to combine the resettlement of people with the economic development of the reservoir zone, to make unified planning with due consideration for all concerned, and to speed up the economic development of the entire reservoir zone. While properly grasping the construction of a number of existing major projects for the exploitation of resources, the Panxi Chuannan Economic Zone is to grasp firmly the early-stage work of a number of projects. Great efforts are to be made to introduce foreign capital and technology and to promote the exploitation of resources and economic development of the entire economic zone. The hilly areas in central Sichuan is to energetically cooperate with the construction of the Daxian-Chengdu railway. The Guangan Bazhong prefecture is to take advantage of its new establishment to grasp firmly planning work and to speed up its development. 10. Enthusiastically and carefully grasp well the construction of existing development zones of the whole province. Macroguidance to the development zones is to be strengthened and the principle of making unified planning with due consideration for all concerned, making rational layouts, acting according to one's capability, doing one's best, starting within a smaller area, and developing in a rolling manner, is to be upheld. An operational mechanism for development zones which conforms with the socialist market economy structure is to be enthusiastically explored and the construction and management of the development zones are to be gradually put on the orbits of standardization and legalization so that the development zones can truly become new growing points and supporting points of the economic development of our province.
