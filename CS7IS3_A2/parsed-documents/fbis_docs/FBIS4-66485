FBIS4-66485 "jpjst025__l94002" JPRS-JST-94-025L JPRS Science & Technology Japan 26 April 1994 Advanced Manufacturing Industrywide Project To Improve Photoforming Technology Industrywide Project To Improve Photoforming Technology 94P60231B Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO in Japanese 26 Apr 94 p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94P60231B Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO Japanese CSO [Text] Plans for a joint R&D project intended to promote the commercialization of photoforming equipment and photo sensitive polymers are under way. Photoforming system and polymer manufacturers will join with photoforming equipment users to conduct research designed to improve photoforming and to lower the cost of photoforming systems. The project is a part of the `R&D Program for Basic Technology To Aid Knowledge Collection for Small To Medium Sized Enterprises' run by the Small to Medium Sized Enterprise Corporation. Official selection of participants is scheduled for June. Candidates from polymer manufacturers include Japan Synthetic Rubber Co., Ltd., Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd., Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., DuPont, and Ciba-Geigy. Photoforming equipment is designed to build thin plastic parts from photosensitive liquid polymers using CAD data derived from three-dimensional models. Horizontal layers of the parts are formed one on top of another while solidification through laser irradiation takes place to finally form three-dimensional objects. Photoforming equipment has the advantage of not requiring dies to make three-dimensional objects. However, because of the high cost of equipment and poor strength and precision of polymers, the applications are limited at present to industrial design models. The equipment currently costs about 500 million yen. Only 2-3 units have been sold in Japan in FY93. The project, which is supposed to take off soon, will include research and development intended to lower the cost of photoforming equipment and to improve the performance of polymers. Developers will try to reduce costs to about 200 million yen per unit including the cost of lasers, an important component of theequipment, and software that slices the CAD data just like CT scanning. On the other hand, R&D on photosensitive ploymers will include better understanding of photosetting mechanism theory and high performance polymers with high shock resistance and high prescision. Development of high performance polymers is the key to wide marketability and general purpose photoforming equipment. Candidates for participation in the project other than polymer makers include NEC Corporation. Toshiba Corporation, and Ushio Inc. for development of lasers, Teijin Seiki Co., Ltd. and Sony for scanner development, and Seamet [phonetic] and Deemec [phonetic] for photoforming equipment. Among equipement users, small to medium sized plastic works companies intend soon to form a consortium before joining the project. The project is scheduled to last four years. The Small to Medium Sized Enterprise Corporation has allocated it Â¥180 million under the FY94 budget.
