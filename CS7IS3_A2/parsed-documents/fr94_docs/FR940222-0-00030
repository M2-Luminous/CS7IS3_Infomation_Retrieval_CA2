FR940222-0-00030 FR940222-0-00011 Response: In order to remain in keeping with nationally recognized breast cancer screening frequencies which recommend that annual mammograms should be allowed for all women age 50 and over, we have added clarifying language to the final rule. The new language allows women between the ages of 50 and 64 years of age to have annual mammography screening. Comment: Because of greater risk, annual screening mammography is important for women 65 and over. Additionally, the proposed rule which allowed coverage for screening PAP tests on an annual basis is inconsistent with the consensus of the scientific community, which suggests that following three consecutive annual PAP tests with negative findings, and in the absence of risk factors, screening may safely be decreased to every two (2) to (3) years. Response: We have amended language in the final rule to allow coverage of screening PAP tests every two (2) years after three consecutive annual exams with normal findings and in the absence of risk factors. 2. Certified Marriage and Family Therapists We received twelve (12) public comments from five (5) interested professional organizations and three (3) comments from the Government agencies which by law we are required to consult with during the rulemaking process in response to the proposed rule to remove the requirement for physician supervision and referral for certified marriage and family therapists and require all certified marriage and family therapists to accept CHAMPUS payment as payment in full. Three (3) of the professional organizations provided similar comments. A summary of the comments and our responses to them are listed below: Comment: One commentor expressed great concern that the proposed rule contained no provision to address the need for either medical differential diagnosis by a physician or evaluation by a mental health professional of the level of clinical psychologist or clinical social worker. The commenter strongly urged that OCHAMPUS require that patients being seen by any of these various categories of nonphysician mental health practitioners be evaluated by physicians, including psychiatrists, to assure that appropriate medical care will be provided. Response: We, too, share the concerns of this professional organization. However, based upon the provisions of the FY 1991 Defense Authorization Act, as cited above, we can no longer require physician referral and supervision. We have added language which states that patients with medical conditions must receive appropriate concurrent management by a physician. Additionally, claims for services by certified marriage and family therapists shall continue to be reviewed in accord with appropriate medical concepts. Comment: One commenter questioned by OCHAMPUS would forward with this proposal, knowing assuredly that costs will inevitably increase. Even with the ``payment in full'' requirements for this proposed regulation, the expansion to independent practice and billing will be costly. Response: As previously stated, this change was mandated by Congress. Program costs associated with this final amendment are not expected to be substantial, since this amendment will eliminate administrative requirements for CHAMPUS, the beneficiary, and the provider population.
