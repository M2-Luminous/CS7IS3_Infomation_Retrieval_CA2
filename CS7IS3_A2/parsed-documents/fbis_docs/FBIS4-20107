The IAEA had set a series of conditions to the sending of inspectors to monitor the replacement of spent nuclear fuel rods at a five megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, a plant which the United States suspects of being used to produce nuclear weapons. The North Korean "response is currently being examined by the IAEA services and we are in consultation with Agency member states," IAEA spokesman David Kyd said. A diplomatic source close to the Agency said however that "the North Korean response might not be entirely satisfactory and it is practically ruled out that inspectors [will] leave (for Korea) before the end of the week." Differences reportedly centred on how the spent fuel rods should be controlled, the source said. "It is essential for the IAEA, that our inspectors be allowed to take samples of some of the spent fuel to prove that the North Koreans have not diverted any nuclear material for military ends. We want to be present during the whole period of the unloading of the reactor and we demand that all the spent fuel from the reactor be placed under the Agency's control," Kyd said. The North Koreans have said they want to start unloading the reactor at the beginning of May and have consequently asked that the IAEA send inspectors as soon as possible. The whole operation should last about two months, Kyd said.
