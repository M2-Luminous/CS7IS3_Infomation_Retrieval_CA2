We have proof that the Information Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its chief, Ante Babic, participated in it. Kilograms of material intended to undermine confidence in the present HSS leadership were sent from the fax machine in Mr. Babic's office and in envelopes belonging to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Some material was sent from fax machines in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and we have other proof of the involvement of government bodies about which we do not wish to speak." This is what the head of the HSS, Drago Stipac, said after 16 days of silence regarding the events in the HSS, the Kasinski [Kasina, a town near Zagreb] meeting, and the open letter of Mirko Madjor. HSS Political Secretary Mirko Glokovic and vice president of the party's Presidency Stjepan Radic also spoke at a news conference held on Monday at HSS headquarters. Drago Stipac admits that, due to a rapid increase in HSS membership, organizational, personnel, and financial problems occurred, but he claims that they are not nearly as drastic as Madjor and Stojanovic are trying to portray them. Stipac believes that the claims that Madjor and Stojanovic have presented in the open letter and in the media are lies and half-truths. The HSS, he states, is not some kind of a peasant trade union. Only 27 percent of its members are peasants; the rest have other occupations. Certain communications problems with the field branches also exist, but they are gradually being resolved. [passage omitted] Stipac informed the journalists that a closed meeting of the HSS Executive Council was held on 12 March at which the documents of the Kasinski meeting were discussed in detail. It was established that 51 HSS members were present in Kasina and that some of them had been misled and falsely informed about the content of the documents they had signed. The HSS Executive Council assessed that the Kasinski meeting was convoked in an illegal manner and that the claims in the Kasinski documents are not true. Mirko Madjor and Dr. Stojanovic were removed from all their party functions with 90 votes for and only four against. Thus, the decision on their suspension made earlier by the HSS Presidency was confirmed. The HSS leaders repeated several times that there is no rift in the HSS and that the rebellion of Madjor and Stojanovic stems from their dissatisfaction with their own positions in the HSS. It was heard at the conference that "Madjor became dissatisfied from the moment when he was not elected president of the HSS." [passage omitted]
