Especially in the fields of active safety design and human-machine interface, remarkable progress has been made by utilizing advanced electronics and other technologies. The technologies expected for providing vehicles with further intelligence in response to the social demands should cover a very wide range including materials, semiconductors, control methods, information communication and ergonomics. In other words, we must develop vehicles that are kind to people, society and the earth by making effective use of the fruits of the research and development activities in these fields. 1. Introduction Development of automotive technologies in the history of automobiles over 100 years can be referred to as steps toward realization of intelligent vehicles. Driving vehicles may be considered a combination of high-grade complicated physical and mental (intellectual) activities. Technologies for supporting and executing these activities can be called intelligent technologies in a wide sense. Some examples of intelligent technologies introduced in the past are checking the driver's operation, unit operation, meter indications and driving environment as well as information exchange with external systems. Vehicles today are based on technologies in a very wide range. In the process of providing vehicles with further intelligence in the future, the results of scientific and technological research and development activities in a wider range calling for interdisciplinary and interindustrial cooperation will be incorporated. In this paper, we will introduce the technologies which will contribute to the attainment and satisfaction of the existing and expected needs and functions concerning vehicles. 2. Assignments and Orientation for Developing Automotive Technologies The most important assignment for automotive technologies is to satisfy various requirements in the fields of environmental protection, energy resources and safety. Major environmental issues are exhaust emission control, improvement of fuel economy leading to reduction of CO[.sub]2[/], substitution of CFC and recycling of materials. Examples of exhaust emission control technologies are the three-way catalytic converter that reduces HC, CO and NO[.sub]x[/] at the same time, knock control system (KCS) that optimizes the thermal efficiency of the engine for better fuel economy and idle speed control (ISC) system that controls the engine speed at idle. Since improvement of safety, on the other hand, involves human factors such as drivers and pedestrians, results of future research activities in the fields of ergonomics, psychology and physiology are required to be incorporated. Implementation of active safety technologies for appropriate coverage of such human characteristics as fatigue, forgetfulness and mistake are expected especially. Furthermore, improvement of the human-machine interface and development of a traffic system that organically links roads and vehicles are desired in preparation for expected increases in traffic density, vehicle speeds and aged population. 3. Active Safety Technologies As the concept of active safety is relatively abstract and may be interpreted in many ways, we have tried classification in terms of the method for avoiding danger, type of danger and situation involving danger. First, the active safety technology can be referred to as the technology for avoiding human errors by substituting the operating functions of the driver. The operating functions performed by the driver may roughly be divided into the seven following steps: (1) Perceiving the present traveling state of the vehicle being driven and the surrounding situation. (2) Predicting the state in the next moment on the basis of past experience and knowledge. (3) Estimating the difference between the target (expected) state and predicted state to judge (determine) the necessary operation. (4) Performing appropriate operations according to the result of judgment. (5) Checking if the change resulting from the operations has brought about the optimum (target) state and performing correcting operation as required. (6) Memorizing (or physically mastering) the result for future use in the same situation. (7) Returning to step (5) or (1) again. Though the time period for steps (1) to (7) is generally extremely short, much dispersion or an error will arise depending on the driving conditions (time zone, weather, road environment, etc.) at the moment and driver's characteristics (driving experience, age, degree of fatigue, etc.). In substituting a part of driver's operating functions that can be divided into steps (1) to (7) above, the active safety devices should perform the following functions: (1) Supporting the driver's perceiving activities (a) Indication of objective physical values by meters (b) Environmental recognition systems (radar system, external pattern recognition system for perceiving obstacles, road signs and road shape, etc.) (c) Systems for ensuring field of vision and improving visibility (automatic wiper, anti-glare mirror, monitor camera, etc.) (d) Guidance for appropriate driving operation (2) Alarm and warning by knowledge base (a) Prediction and detection of inappropriate or wrong driving operation (b) Indication of limits for driving (c) Detection of abnormal vehicle state (3) Emergency intervention When the driver operates incorrectly to generate an emergency state for which simple alarming may be too late to avoid a danger, the manual input portion is isolated from the man-machine system and changed over to be driven by the wire system for forced braking or steering, for example. In this case, forced intervention of the machine side requires matching with the reaction and feeling of the driver. (4) Partially automatic operation This means autonomous driving by recognizing the external situation and calculating the path by the image recognition system and expert system during traveling in a fixed environment with relatively little external variation (noise) as on an expressway or traveling at low speeds as at the time of garaging. The second type of active safety technology is for warning and alarming the driver by predicting and detecting physiological and mental states such as fatigue and drowsiness of the driver. Technologies of this type have been studied in the fields of labor science and ergonomics, but study in the automotive field has just started. Development of technologies for measuring driver's facial expression, heart rate and brain waves, for analyzing the correlation with fatigue and for warning is necessary. The third type is the technology for realizing comfortable driving environment gentle to the driver to cause little fatigue. It means to quantitatively grasp the conditions likely to cause fatigue of the driver and the environment comfortable or disagreeable to the driver so as to determine the vehicle dimensions and control the interior conditions accordingly. Some examples are enhancing the ride comfort, controllability and stability, upgrading the air conditioner, improving NVH (noise, vibration and harshness), and improving the visibility of display and meters. Especially in the field of display, long focal-length instruments (virtual image meters) and HUD (heads-up display) for reducing change in the line of sight and focal adjustment have been developed. Further upgrading by introduction of advanced holography, CG (computer graphics) and VR (virtual reality) is expected in the future. Table 1 shows the examples of active safety systems. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Human Interface Human interface is closely related to the active safety technologies explained in the previous chapter. The speech recognition technology aims at reducing the operation load. Applications to mobile telephone (hands-free telephone), audio system and air conditioner operation, and destination input to the navigation system have been reported. The specific speaker recognition system was mostly used in the early stage, but unspecific speaker recognition system will be introduced in the future. These should be used selectively according to each application system. The speech synthesis technology began with Toyota Speak Monitor in 1980, and has been inherited in the voice navigation system. It will be necessary to eliminate unnaturalness in speech generation timing, message repetition and tone felt by the listener for accurate understanding of the meaning. As regards the display technology, it will become important to study the method for communicating an increasing amount of information generated both inside and outside of the vehicle accurately for easy understanding by the driver. It is therefore important to develop the display method (software) matching the characteristic of human sense of vision and the hardware for realizing it with good coordination. The display system in the cockpit of the airplane has optimized the priority of displayed information and selective use of colors in good coordination with the buzzer, synthesized speech and vibration. The instrument panel in vehicles will develop into an intellectual interface incorporating the knowledge in visual psychology and sonics. 5. Control Methods The term ``nonlinear technology'' has made its appearance only recently. It is a generic term for neural networks, fuzzy systems, fluctuative control, chaos and fractal. Application of this new technical thought to the field of engineering has been proposed. The fuzzy control has already been applied to cruise control, AT (automatic transmission) shift change control and air conditioning control, and pattern recognition by neural networks and nonlinear adaptive control system making use of parallel distributed processing and learning function have been reported. The fluctuative control is based on the experimental result showing that fluctuation frequency f and the intensity of fluctuation (power spectrum) are distributed inversely proportional to each other in phenomena (such as breeze, vibration of vehicles and classical music) agreeable to human beings. (This is called l/f fluctuation.) The heartbeat cycle and alpha brain wave are also said to have the characteristic of l/f fluctuation. Chaos and fractal theorems are said to be able to find out a certain kind of regularity in seemingly irregular events. It is possible that these theorems may be applied to the analysis of human body measurement data. 6. Information Communication System Adaptation of vehicles to the information age is an extremely important task. Mobile telephone and portable telephone have already been put into service as members of mobile communication systems and the demand is predicted to increase greatly in the future. Information communication is confronting a turning point as represented by implementation of the vehicle mounted portable telephone system and digital mobile telephone system as well as freeing of using radio equipment and antennas. Communication networks surrounding vehicles with the public telephone network application system including vehicle mounted facsimile as the core are being enriched. In addition to the conventional running turning and stopping functions, vehicles can be said to have obtained the communicating and speaking functions. Future development to cover the satellite broadcasting, communication system, new cordless telephone (PHP: personal handy phone) system and future public land mobile telecommunication system (FPLMTS) is also expected. Figure 1 [not reproduced] shows the communication networks surrounding vehicles. The navigation system, on the other hand, will develop from the initial dead reckoning system to the map matching and GPS applied systems. In the near future, it will be integrated with the traffic information system for communication with the infrastructure as the VICS (vehicle information and communication system) for example. It is also expected that an intelligent vehicle/road traffic system with the road vehicle communication technology as the core will be implemented in the future. Table 2 shows the examples of future road traffic systems. Table 2.

Elementary Technologies Electronics has contributed much toward realization of intelligent vehicles. Especially, the development of semiconductor technology has been keeping pace with the development in the intelligence of vehicles. Various intelligent sensors and actuators provided with excellent precision and response as well as many special microcomputers capable of processing high-grade control logics with sufficient durability to severe operating environment on vehicles have been introduced to combine electronic means to the conventional mechanical structure effectively so as to create characteristics and functions that are difficult to be realized simply by improving mechanisms. Development of high level programming language for automotive control system and implementation of the development environment for testing and debugging prototype programs are also important tasks for adaptation to diversification and upgrading of microcomputer systems in the future. In the field of sensors, intelligent sensors with high precision in small sizes by high-precision microstructure fabrication called micromachining have been put into practical use. Some examples are the manifold pressure sensor for lean burn system, semiconductor G sensor for air bag and semiconductor negative pressure sensor for EFI. Heat resistant elements, pressure resistant elements, power devices (contactless relays) and high density packaging technology or surface mount device technology have been developed in addition. Development of applications of the EEPROM and flash memory as memory elements is also expected. High-performance glass, functional film, electro-chromic (EC) and electro-luminescence (EL) devices, LCF (light control filter), high-output laser diode and radio-frequency oscillator are expected to be developed as display devices and new sensors. 8. Systematization Technology The fault diagnosis systems have been put into practical use in the forms of both on-board and off-board. It is considered to be improved further, but standardization in the industry is desired. Effectiveness of the ECU network in suppressing the increase in the wire harness size has been confirmed. Standardization of the network protocol is being studied. Power circuit control will add to its importance for counteracting increases in the current consumption and engine load resulting from increase in electronic devices. 9. Conclusion We have roughly explained the examples of technologies for providing vehicles with further intelligence and the technologies for supporting realization of such technologies. In addition to the approach for providing intelligence by selecting intelligent behaviors of personified vehicles, we have also described the intelligence from the viewpoint of convenience of vehicles for people who use the vehicles. In providing vehicles with further intelligence, it is necessary to understand drivers as men and to study ergonomic design and human-machine interface further. In the future, we would like to form the desirable image of intelligent vehicle convenient for the people after fully understanding the difference between men and machines. The environment surrounding vehicles is expected to continue quick changes but the necessity of producing safer and comfortable vehicles that are kind to people and the earth will remain unchanged.
