Reacting to the U.S. President's latest statements reported by THE NEW YORK TIMES on 6 January, Professor Hubert De Ronceray congratulates himself on the fact that the State Department could finally admit to President Aristide's psychological instability. In any case, the MDN leader requires a type of relations more in conformity with the requirements of the international community's new world economic order. [Begin De Ronceray recording] The MDN deems President Clinton's decision to reconsider the Haitian file, in light of facts accumulated over the past two years, realistic and encouraging. The U.S. Administration's open-mindedness must correspond with Haiti's political willingness in order to manage and harmonize the requirements of national reconciliation with the new international power struggles. In this respect, the Haitian people consider themselves entitled to expect from the United Nations, the OAS, and the four countries called the Friends of Haiti a type of relations more concerned with effective solidarity and more in conformity with the requirements of a new international economic order. MDN invites the UN Security Council, the OAS, Venezuela, France, and Canada to commit themselves, alongside President Clinton, to the definitive closing of the Aristide file which is too heavy with incoherence, violence, destruction, human rights violations, and calls for foreign military invasion.
