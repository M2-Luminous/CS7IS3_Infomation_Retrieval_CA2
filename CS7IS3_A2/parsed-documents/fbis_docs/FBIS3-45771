Total output reached 1.3 million tons last year, up 60 percent over 1992. This accounts for one-seventh of the country's total and lifts the province as the second largest apple grower. Most parts of Shaanxi are situated on the loess plateau, which is blessed by ample sunshine and has wide difference in temperature between day and night. The location and the climate make the site ideal for apple growing. Since 1984, more than 20 counties have been converted into apple growing centers. The acreage soared from the 123,500 acres in 1985 to around 823,500 acres last year. Quality stock make up over 80 percent of all the fruit trees planted. Some counties have set up factories to produce apple juice for other countries. The development of the fruit orchards has greatly helped farmers to improve their lives. Most of the apple growers now live in newly-built brick-and-wood houses instead of the earth caves where they used to dwell. Eight out of ten families own TV sets and 70 percent of homes have motorcycles and tractors. The income from the apples enabled the local people to increase input in grain production too.
