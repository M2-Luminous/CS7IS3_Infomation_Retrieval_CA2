Tello, however, admitted that the purchase could be viewed as untimely "because society is very sensitive about it; it has exaggerated the issue." The two officials spoke with reporters briefly at El Zocalo, following the ceremony to mark the 132d anniversary of the Battle of Puebla. [passage omitted] [Gallegos] What do you think about the purchase of riot gear? [Ruano] I see nothing wrong with this. It is not unusual. [Lomas] How much equipment does the Navy purchase annually? [Ruano] I have no idea. Do you know who can tell you? A high-ranking officer, like Admiral Perez Elias. [Gallegos] What do you think of the presence of U.S. military personnel at the border? [Ruano] Which border? Ours or theirs? If it is their border, it is their territory; should they be in Chihuahua or Coahuila, it would be wrong. [Gallegos] Is this a provocation? [Ruano] No, it is not. Am I provoking you when I am hammering a nail inside my home? I think not, but anyway... [Gallegos, interrupting] Are they harassing us? [Ruano] They have no need to harass us. You know that. There are many ways to harass.... Well, there is something we must take into account: By allowing illegal aliens to cross the border, we are causing trouble for them. Of course I agree with my fellow countrymen, but they (the Americans) have their own problems. Therefore, I believe the presence along the border is not affecting us. Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello said in other countries, like France -- where he served as ambassador -- it is common to purchase riot gear. He insisted that society is very touchy today, and, in turn, people have exaggerated this issue.
