The reason is perfectly clear: After months and months of excuses and stalling for time, of yielding to aggression and genocide, the peace process has faced the very reason for its existence -- the aspiration of the creator of Greater Serbia for the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. There can be no progress in reaching a peace agreement until Serbian President Milosevic orders the withdrawal from the minimum of territory that used to be the majority Muslim regions. Karadzic, leader of the Serb extremists, reiterated again this evening that he would not give those territories back, while Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia- Herzegovina Presidency, stressed that there could be no peace without that. Our delegation came under great pressure to sign a very vague peace plan. In fact, this is a trick by which the sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia would be lifted if an agreement was signed that would not guarantee us what we must have. The Bosnian state delegation, Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said, cannot separate the organization of the state from the territory, since we are forced to speak of the minimum. In other words, the two create a whole, which we will not and cannot give up. Even though there were meaningless calls for signing not only a cease-fire but a lasting peace as well, Owen himself rejected that, saying that we had had hundreds of cease-fire agreements and that there was no need to waste time on them any more until something is done on the maps. Owen had a proposal in which he presented 15 disputed towns. These are: Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi, Brcko, Bugojno, Busovaca, Donji Vakuf, Kiseljak, Kresevo, Novi Travnik, Sanski Most, Ustikolina, Visegrad, Vitez, and Zvornik. The cochairman's proposal was to reduce that number as much as possible so as to reduce the number of disputed issues if the international arbitration commission is formed, which is supposed to solve each problem on its own. It was also proposed for acceptance that the Bosnian republic has to have 33.33 percent of the present territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian republic 17.5 percent but not at the detriment of the Bosnian republic. Even though no solution is visible from this position -- although we keep talking about minor concessions on the side of the Serb extremists -- cochairman Owen demanded that the peace conference continue until at least another round of bilateral talks between the Bosnia-Herzegovina state delegation and the Serbian and the Croatian sides be held. The Bosnian state delegation is expecting the first meeting with the Serbs.
