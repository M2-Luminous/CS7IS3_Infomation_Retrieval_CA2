The proposal was submitted by a Vietnam war veteran and prisoner of war, and supported by other senators who are also Vietnam war veterans. Because the resolution was a mere recommendation, it was believed that it would be merely another step in the process of normalizing U.S.-Vietnamese ties, which has been dragging since 1991. Extremely propitious conditions -- particularly the insignificant opposition of groups demanding the identification and location of those soldiers missing in action in Vietnam -- allowed President Bill Clinton a few days later to lift to commercial embargo in force for 19 years. In fact, the timetable established by the Bush administration to normalize U.S.-Vietnamese diplomatic ties is being fulfilled. One year ago, Vietnamese authorities helped to locate those missing in action and as a result of the Vietnamese troops withdrawal, Cambodia was able to hold elections. Thus the international and domestic prerequisites the U.S. Government announced as essential for normalizing its ties with Vietnam were met. The process was delayed because of the action of outspoken veteran groups, which have important electoral clout, that were dissatisfied with the almost insignificant progress to locate the almost 2,300 soldiers missing in action. One of the remaining myths of the war is that U.S. prisoners are still kept in concentration camps, which is like saying that the fictitious Rambo films are true. Once the precautions of election year were left behind, reason and business prevailed. Vietnam is a rapidly growing market of 70 million people offering good business opportunities that were previously denied to U.S. manufacturers. The Vietnamese market grows 8 percent per year and the socialist rigors applied to the economy have almost been nonexistent since the end of the 1980's. These considerations weighed heavily on President Bill Clinton's decision. It is true that Clinton can only lift the embargo now that the painful "Vietnam drama" -- the feeling of self-inflicted defeat that undermined U.S. pride for two decades -- is already part of the past. By allowing the normalization of business ties -- diplomatic ties will be restored shortly through which Vietnam will have a more favorable status which in turn will promote trade -- President Clinton ends a stage in history that enables the world to know the true limits of power and force and opens a stage of business cooperation that will benefit all involved nations.
