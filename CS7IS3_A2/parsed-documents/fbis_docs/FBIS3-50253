[Pal] In the coming period, our party is preparing for crisis management, because the decreased gross national product, the negative processes in foreign trade and agriculture, the very high deficit of the balance of payments, and the domestic budget deficit all point to a very difficult next period, whoever is in government. In our view, it is at the end of 1995 or the beginning of 1996 when a stable situation can turn into an economic upswing, providing that we have a balancing economic policy. I am talking about balancing because, all at the same time, we have to ensure that inflation does not suddenly increase, the balance of payments does not get into a much worse situation, social tensions do not increase more than bearable, and unemployment does not again start to increase, while the country becomes competitive thus ensuring economic growth. Naturally, in the current situation, without any basis, the MSZP cannot promise higher welfare spending or an immediate improvement in living standards. We feel that the essence of our politics manifests itself in the fact that we want to establish a much more equitable process in the distribution of the social product. Even in this period of crisis management, we must restrain the polarization of the population, the extremely rapid impoverishment of certain strata of society, and the increasing uncertainty of the middle classes. We have said, many times, that the reform of state administration cannot be delayed. [passage omitted] Attila Karoly Soos: Privatization With Foreign Capital [PESTI HIRLAP] If the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] gets into government after the elections, how do you plan to solve the stability of pensions and keep them in line with with inflation? [Soos] The SZDSZ's economic program, in which we seek answers to important social policy questions, has been drawn up, but the National Council has not yet discussed it. Regarding pensions, two major problems have to be taken into consideration. The first is handling the position of pensioners. In our view, we must adhere strictly to the provision in the law that prescribes that pensions have to be adjusted to the average wages. As for the future of the pension system, a general minimum has to be ensured that facilitates decent living standards for elderly people. People who do not receive enough for this from the social security fund will have to have their monthly income supplemented from the state budget. [passage omitted] [PESTI HIRLAP] Would the SZDSZ increase or decrease the amount of tax payable if it changes the tax system? [Soos] As an option, we want to introduce the lump sum tax in retail trade and services that functioned well in the past. This would reduce administration. It makes the speculation of expenses unnecessary. According to our surveys, this form of taxation is very popular with the entrepreneurs. This would retrieve the tax lost through abolishing the minimum tax in a way that is voluntarily chosen. Therefore, our proposal to reduce taxes also takes the not- too-rosy budget situation into consideration. [passage omitted] Gyula Takacsy: The Future Belongs to Private Ownership [PESTI HIRLAP] The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] is the biggest party of the current government coalition. Which tax laws would you change after the 1994 elections? [Takacsy] Hungary is in the process of major changes. In 1988, a new tax system was drawn up that resulted in a tremendously increased number of enterprises, together with incomes from the gray and black economies, which are not taxed. These have to be terminated. A very long time is needed for us to reach the level of stability that exists in Germany for example, where tax discipline and control are highly developed. When this is achieved, we can start thinking about abolishing the minimum tax, which is a necessary evil in the current situation. Realistically, we can think about a slow lowering of taxes and making taxation more balanced. We can mainly expect the reduction of company tax, which is a revenue type tax. I cannot foresee the reduction of taxes linked to turnover. [passage omitted] Naturally, it is a very important part of our program that we do not plan radical tax decreases, rather, we say that balance can basically be restored through launching growth. [passage omitted] [PESTI HIRLAP] To what extent would you be able to reduce the country's foreign debts in the coming four years? [Takacsy] I do not think that this is our most important task; at the moment, the Hungarian economy is in a situation in which it has to draw on foreign resources because we have too little capital, which is necessary for development. In my view, the debt has to be managed rather than reduced, which essentially means that the repayment of capital amounts can be resolved through taking on new loans, which, in a favorable case, changes the structure of loans, namely turns into longer-term loans, and the interest payments will have to be born out of the Hungarian economy's current balance of payments. In my view, this is not our primary task, because there are very many indebted countries in the world, including the United States. [passage omitted]
