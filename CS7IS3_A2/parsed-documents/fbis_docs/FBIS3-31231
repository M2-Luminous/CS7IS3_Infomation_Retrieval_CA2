In that it has a historical importance, politically unsurpassed in post-Cold-War Europe. The military importance of the ultimatum, however, is much clearer, especially as it has been presented in a relatively precise way, so it seems that this component completely determines the limits of political engagement, that is, that the matter concerns a military ultimatum, a decisive threat saying that the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina should end. This interpretation of the ultimatum is based on the justified wishes of the Croats and Muslims, but it is not contained in the text of the ultimatum. This is a fact, and we can expect some more ultimatums of the same content until the Croats (in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina) and the Muslims (in Bosnia-Herzegovina and elsewhere) establish joint political, military, intellectual, and all other fronts against the aggressor. Only that could be the basis of a politically clearer and more substantial ultimatum of the Western Alliance, and, what is more important, of a clear account with Moscow. These are only some of the reasons for the Croats and Muslims not to expect allied air strikes on Serb targets in Bosnia-Herzegovina or Serbia too soon. It is quite certain that this will not happen, because the Bosnian Serbs have decided to withdraw, as was the case with the Serb rebels in Croatia, when most of the Serbian troops withdrew from Croatia. The artillery-missile troops of the Bosnian Serbs are therefore withdrawing from the positions from which they have been stifling Sarajevo, and it is to be expected that they will not offer armed resistance to the opening of Tuzla airport and the Muslim enclaves in the Drina River valley. Their military adventures elsewhere in Bosnia-Herzegovina have thus been significantly weakened, and so have those in Croatia. However, the Serb offensive potential has not been disabled or destroyed, which, intimately, each of us wishes, as do the countries bordering with Serbia, as can be discerned from their Geneva meeting regarding the balance of military power on the Balkans and reducing them to an acceptable defense level. Considering all this, we can conclude that the NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs is at the same time an indirect message to the Serb rebels in Croatia and to the military-police regime that is in power in Serbia. The content of the message is that they should put a time limit on their military actions on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, that they should limit the use of certain kinds of weapons, and even limit the targets. Croatia received a similar message in late 1992. It accepted it and started creating the conditions for resolving the war by political means. Serbia and the so-called Srpska republic should not be expected to accept the NATO message-ultimatum from such prudent positions. They will accept it simply because they must accept it, and will observe it until they have to, and where they have to. This has been happening so far. During the past two years, the Serb armed forces were limited by time, space, and means, by which they were forced into a defensive, a strategic defense of the conquered territories. The first such limit was imposed on the sea front -- thanks to the activities of the Croatian Navy and the naval forces of the Western alliance. The strategy of Croatian defense and the liberation of the occupied territories was thus simplified. The significance of this at present is the inability of the Serb policy of conquest to indirectly improve the position in Bosnia-Herzegovina by threatening Croatia from the sea, that is, the all of southern Croatian and Herzegovina. The following such limit was imposed on the use of Serb air forces. It was also imposed toward the end of the war against Croatia, and supported during the war against Bosnia-Herzegovina by ultimatums and patrols by the allied air forces. Thus, the Serbian aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina lost its second important strategic support. The third, most important strategic support of the aggression have been the land forces. Following the bad experience in Croatia, where they attempted to fight the classical way, these forces -- the only remaining ones -- could carry out the strategy of conquest only using ways and means employed in stifling Sarajevo or conquering the territory along the Drina River. The methods are familiar. They boil down to the expression "genocidal cleansing of desired territory." This -- and the NATO ultimatum does not mention it because it is not within its jurisdiction -- displays all the weakness of the ultimatum-like political position of the West toward Serbia. The means are also familiar. They boil down to artillery-missile strikes, taking dominant positions, and destroying everything that is not Serb or that will not be useful. This -- though it is within the NATO jurisdiction -- also does not comprise as much as the meaning of the word "ultimatum" does. The truth is that it does relate to those means also, but only on one or two territories and in certain situations, and it leaves them in the hands of the aggressor, failing to threaten the aggressor's strong negotiating position, which is the worst thing. The limits imposed through the ultimatum on the use of the Serb armed forces -- primarily naval, then air forces, and now also the ground forces -- introduces the new quality described above into the war for Bosnia-Herzegovina; a gradual and increasingly decisive pushing out of the Serb armed forces from the conquered territories. The humanitarian "intervention" can now only count on success. Their combination is, however, a sure failure without political intervention, which will not occur with the attitudes current in Russia and Greece. This is what Serbia relies on, withdrawing and not having withdrawn for three years.
