Passing orders today after the five-month-long pre-trial proceedings about the involvement of the LTTE and the 26 accused in the assassination, the judge, Mr. S.M. Siddickk, said that after going through the materials submitted by the Special Investigation (SIT) he was satisfied that sufficient grounds existed to proceed against the accused. The court also framed charges against the accused. All the accused, barring Murugan and three others, heard the charges with rapt attention as the Bench clerk read the charges against each of the accused. While all of them pleaded not guilty, Shanti, wife of another accused, Jayakumar, said she did not follow the charges against her. When the clerk repeated the charges she also pleaded not guilty and said there was no connection between the assassination and her. "I am being kept in the prison without any justification," she told the judge. The 250-odd charges framed by the court broadly confirmed to the charges listed by the prosecution in the chargesheet. In the 62-page order Mr. Siddickk held that "under the law, charges can be framed even on "strong suspicion" and here in this case there is "overwhelming material of very determinative character clearly indicating the offence complained against the accused." Applicability of TADA: The judge, while framing charges, also answered all the legal questions that figured in the lengthy arguments between the prosecution and the defence lawyers. They included applicability of the TADA to the case, validity of confessional statements, splitting of the case between those arrested and absconding, the CBI's legal standing in investigating the case and appointment of the Jain Commission. The framing of the charges by the court might not immediately lead to the commencement of the trial as the defence lawyer, Mr. S. Doraisamy, informed the reporters at the court that he would soon go on appeal to the Madras High Court. He said that though the TADA stipulated that only the Supreme Court was authorised to take up appeals, he would request the Madras High Court to invoke special powers to take up the case. The trial might resume only after the disposal of the appeals by the High Court. In his orders, Mr. Siddickk dismissed the defence arguments that the TADA was not applicable to the case as the offences alleged to have been committed were only against the individuals for personal reasons and not against the Government. 'Common intention': He also dismissed as factually and legally unsustainable, Mr. Doraisamy's argument that there was no evidence to suggest that key accused, Nalini, and others had any knowledge of the conspiracy or at any point of time they had agreed to participate in the conspiracy. "Common intention" was a rule of evidence and the charge under that Section could always be framed if the fact and circumstances warrant that, he said. On Mr. Doraisamy's argument that the LTTE's intelligence chief, Pottu Amman, and women's wing leader, Akhila, were non-existing members, and therefore, there could not be any conspiracy between the accused and non-existing persons, the judge said that it was "frivolous and unwarranted" in view of the materials placed before the court along with the charge sheet and it did not merit any consideration. The judge also dismissed the defence plea that the alleged conspiracy by the LTTE was only to assassinate Rajiv Gandhi and there was no conspiracy to kill other persons. If anyone had died it was only incidental or accidental and not in pursuance of the conspiracy, the defence argued. Sixteen persons, including Rajiv Gandhi, died in the Sriperumbudur blast on May 21, 1991. Seventeen persons received grievous injuries and 27 simple injuries. On defence counsel's argument that the CBI had no locus standi to investigate the assassination case as the Centre did not notify in the G.O. that CBI could take up TADA cases, when the Act came into force in 1987, the judge said the Madras High Court already dismissed this argument in 1992 and held that the CBI was empowered to investigate cases under the TADA. Therefore, it was futile to conclude that the CBI had no statutory power to investigate the Rajiv Gandhi case. Jain panel findings 'not binding': The court held that the observations and findings of the Jain Commission are not binding on the trial court proceedings. Mr. S.M. Siddick, said, "The Jain Commission could not do what the regular criminal court was already doing or might do in due course."--PTI
