Listen to what General Cot had to say about this in an interview granted to Radio France Internationale this morning. The line is not very good, but his comments are important: [Cot] One cannot retaliate with weapons as an answer to anything, but there is no doubt that the rules of our mission not only allow us to retaliate, but they demand that we retaliate. I have often repeated this to my men, when we are attacked directly and when the attacker has been identified beyond doubt. Believe me, even if we do not shout it on the rooftops every time it happens, we have retaliated on numerous occasions. [Unidentified correspondent] Do you confirm that a French Blue Helmet killed a Serbian sniper on Christmas night? [Cot] I do not wish to give much publicity to these actions that, you will understand, must remain discreet. We have indeed, however, set up an anti-sniper device that should allow us--which already allows us--to make cowards think, those cowards who shoot at women, children, and also at soldiers [words indistinct]. I would like sniper alley--which in the end reinforces hope a little--to be called bastards alley. [passage omitted]
