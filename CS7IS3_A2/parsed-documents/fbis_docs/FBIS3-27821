"There will be no final transfer of power to Kim Chong-il as long as Kim Il-song lives," the president's younger brother, Kim Yong-chu, reportedly said, according to an East European source. The source also said the youngest Kim will remain a "crown prince" until his father's death. Such a scenario contradicts predictions by foreign watchers who believe that Kim Chong-il, also chairman of the National Defense Commission, will soon take over his 82-year-old father's duties as president and general secretary of the Korean Workers' Party. Kim Yong-chu, however, confirmed that the youngest Kim is already handling all domestic affairs while his father remains responsible for foreign policy decisions, the source said. According to the source, Kim Yong-chu, 72, made the statements in a surprisingly open conversation with a Third World diplomat in Pyongyang last week, where he denied "any differences" between himself and Kim Chong-il. Disputing rumors that he poses a threat to the "model of succession," Kim Yong-chu said he "firmly supports the dear leader Kim Chong-il" and denounced speculation that China, North Korea's strongest ally, would prefer to see him instead of Kim Chong-il as future leader of North Korea. Kim Yong-chu, who was appointed a member of the Central Committee of the Politburo of the party and vice president last December after nearly 17 years out of the public eye, has been the center of rumors concerning North Korea's future leadership. During the hour-long conversation, Kim Yong-chu did not explain his political decline during the 1970s, which, according to official versions, was due to a "serious illness," the source said.
