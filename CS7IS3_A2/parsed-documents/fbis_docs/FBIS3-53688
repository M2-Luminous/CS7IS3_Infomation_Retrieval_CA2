In statements he made today at the end of the first day of meetings of the Gaza-Jericho Committee's current round of talks, he added that we must wait until tomorrow to find out the extent of the progress that can be made in this round. He noted that no tangible progress was made today due to lack of time. He said that the Israeli side still rejects the idea of raising the Palestinian flag over the crossings because it is a symbol of the Palestinian state. However, he adds, we call on the Israelis to adopt a new mode of thinking that befits the peace atmosphere. At this stage, this flag is a symbol of the Palestinian identity and not a symbol of the state. Dr. Nabil Sha'th clarified that there were some differences over the crossings into Gaza and Jericho, as well as over the border points from Egypt, Gaza, Jordan, and the Jericho area, and defining the method of control over these crossings. He noted the importance of cooperation and coordination regarding the control over the crossings between the two sides. He said the Palestinian side did not present any new proposals on the subject of the crossings. But the Palestinian paper that was presented during the previous round and the Israeli paper submitted today constitute the two stances that need to be agreed on. He added that the Palestinian side accepts the Israeli electronic supervision of the crossings because it preserves the dignity of people and is secure at the same time. It also prevents weapons from being smuggled across the crossings, as well as catching people who carry out acts of aggression. Dr. Sha'th said that some progress was made in Civil Affairs Committee's activities, which specializes in the transfer of authority, services, and facilities from the Israeli side to the Palestinian side. He noted that some progress could be made in issuing the personal identity cards and residence permits, the historic sites, and various other subjects. He affirmed that he expects the Civil Affairs Committee to end its work next week through written texts. He affirmed that the Palestinian-Jordanian economic and security agreement, which was recently signed, has improved and bolstered the atmosphere of the Gaza-Jericho Committee negotiations. He added that the political determination to find an agreement is what determines how long the Gaza-Jericho negotiations will continue. He noted that in the case where this determination is available, three weeks is enough to reach an agreement between the two sides. Otherwise, the negotiations will take much longer.
