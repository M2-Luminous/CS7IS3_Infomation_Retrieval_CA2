In the first international tender for major road building projects in Vietnam, not one Australian company has been successful in getting past the first round and being invited to submit a formal tender. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank projects to rebuild Vietnam's Highway 1, worth $US355 million, mark the first instalment of an expected $US10 billion to be spent over the decade on major capital works. Ministerial documents show that out of a field of 150 companies, about 75 were asked to tender for both projects. They include companies from South Korea, Malaysia, China, Europe, Japan and the US. The results of the tender are yet to be made public. Leighton Asia has confirmed that it failed to prequalify for the tender, although the company has established a presence in Vietnam only recently. John Holland's application, made in conjunction with the Japanese firm Itochu, has also missed out. Thiess decided not to enter because the tender was considered too competitive. A spokesman for Transfield declined to confirm whether the company had applied to tender, although one company source had earlier said it would take part. To qualify, the companies were asked to submit detailed data about their financial position, the amount of current work they had on their books and the projects they had worked on in the past. The results of this major international tender raise questions about federal government efforts to showcase Australian construction companies in Asia. The recently opened Friendship Bridge between Thailand and Laos, and a proposed $100 million bridge over the Mekong in Vietnam, are in part aimed at putting Australian engineering on show in Asia. Thiess Contractors' general manager for South-East Asia, Mr Robert Logan, denied the company had lodged an expression of interest in the Highway One project and pointed to the large number of applicants the project had attracted. Describing the tender process as a "free-for-all", Mr Logan said that with 200 or more companies bidding for the project "the competition was too great and too intense". The general manager of Transfield's international division, Mr John McGarry, said he was not aware of any unsuccessful tender made by the company in Vietnam. Mr Ross Baldwin, director of John Holland's Asian operations, confirmed that an expression of interest had been lodged for some of Highway One's bridge work, and said that the company was still waiting on news of the outcome.
