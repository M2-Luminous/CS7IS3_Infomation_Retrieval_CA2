Your ITAR-TASS correspondent met with Doctor of Economic Sciences, Professor Nikolay Shmelev. [Correspondent] What is your assessment of the package of "economic" edicts that the president has signed? [Shmelev] I do not know about the "mini economic revolution" that some newspapers have been talking about, but the very fact that these edicts have appeared attests to the desire of the country's leadership to move forward and not merely stand still. Take taxation policy, for example. Perhaps I am oversimplifying things but for a long time I have wondered why our leadership just cannot understand that the lower a tax is, the higher the tax yield to the treasury is, and not vice versa? But our age-old tradition is to live by "jacking up prices" rather than by increasing turnover, a practice which we did not change in the period of liberalization. Let us recall, for example, the fuss that the first congress of people's deputies made about the progressive tax on personal incomes but the result was that if you earned just slightly more than a nurse there was no point in working, you had to resort to theft... Gaydar introduced some incredible taxes, which he justified with a single moral argument: I know that this is bad, he said, but the budget has to be balanced somehow and the gaps have to be plugged: Just as soon as things get a little easier we will have a normal taxation system. In our country, however, everyone has known for a long time that there are no difficulties more permanent than the temporary ones. These edicts seem to reflect the philosophy that President Reagan pursued with such success: He cut taxes to a little over 30 percent, freed investments from tax, and as a result the treasury received more than it had done beforehand. If we really start to be guided by the same principles -- if we reduce the infamous value-added tax, finally exempt investments from tax, give tax breaks to new investors, including foreigners, cut the rate of profits tax, and so forth -- the situation will be encouraging. In the final analysis there is a political interest to all this. Just look at the pressure from taxation in Russia on industrial enterprises and on private business, in particular. The tax system drives private initiative out onto the street, into "back alleys," into street stalls, or at best into commercial banks -- fine, just so long as that doesn't mean into mafia structures. There are not many people who want to engage in the business of production because that is known to be a loss-making venture. And if we are finally beginning to overcome this tendency, it means there is the likelihood that the Russian economy will become more efficient. Second, even though there is a certain naivety in these documents -- they contain all sorts of fines and penalties for nonpayment and so forth -- an attempt by the state to take control of the tax sphere can only be welcomed. [Correspondent] But how do you regard the idea of creating a new category of production units in state ownership -- the so-called "treasury-funded [kazennyy] enterprises"? [Shmelev] In principle this is a good attempt to begin the scrapping of production units that are not viable by means of direct adinistrative pressure on them. We have not yet made up our minds to resort to the normal and natural market method of bankruptcy even though it is clear that in the end we cannot avoid this. But you can understand this indecision. It is due to the fear of unemployment, the next social catastrophe after the confiscation of savings and the fall in the living standard. "Treasury-funded enterprises" are the means whereby we hope to soften the blow. [Correspondent] What about the edict on abolishing export licenses and quotas? [Shmelev] I know that some businessmen do not see this as a particular improvement because the export sales outlets have still been carved up by monopolists. Nevertheless, we should consider the fact that Russia is still virtually the only country in the world which pursued the absurd policy of curbing its own exports. Not encouraging them, but curbing them! Of course, there were objective reasons for that, the main one being that domestic prices, primarily for raw materials, lag behind world prices. Now prices are evening out and the potential for making a fortune through export speculation is being nullified. Another reason is the massive exodus of capital abroad. Nevertheless, restrictions on the export of non-strategic goods, not MiG's or nuclear technologies but the most ordinary goods, is the height of absurdity. The fact that we are doing away with it, that we are moving in our economic philosophy away from the absurd ("Beware! They Are Selling Russia Off!") toward common sense is an undoubted blessing.
