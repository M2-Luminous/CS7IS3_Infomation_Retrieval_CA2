An agreement was reached at the meeting of ASEAN senior economic officials in Indonesia on the setting up by ASEAN of a department to study group cooperation in telecommunications and transportation; a proposal on this is to be forwarded to the ministerial meeting in Thailand around September. The project will be treated as urgent. The meeting also agreed to have the Philippines study the framework of ASEAN cooperation in the service sector. Karun Kittisathaphon, deputy permanent secretary of the Commerce Ministry, reported that the senior officials' meeting in Indonesia on 6-8 June studied Thailand's proposal for group cooperation in service trading. Although this does not mean there is a need to open up markets for the service trade, the cooperation will support and stimulate the implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area, or AFTA. Thailand's proposal was accepted at the meeting, which assigned the Philippines to take the lead in studying the framework of cooperation. The meeting also agreed to conduct a survey on tariffs on service goods in telecommunications and transportation in order to contribute to the AFTA plan. Each country will appoint a delegation to attend a meeting on this subject. A proposal will be made to the ASEAN ministers' meeting for study after which it will be forwarded to the ASEAN summit, which is scheduled to be held in Bangkok early next year. The deputy permanent secretary for commerce added that the meeting of the senior officials in Indonesia reviewed the implementation of the AFTA plan and proposed that efforts be made to shorten the span of tariff reduction from 8 to 5 years and also to include unprocessed farm products in the AFTA plan.
