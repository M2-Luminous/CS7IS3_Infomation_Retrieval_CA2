The outcomes of the social affairs council meeting on Wednesday [22 June], and the Corfu heads of government summit at the weekend will show whether Europe's policymaking institutions are capable of meeting the needs of European business, and of Europe's 18 million unemployed. On Wednesday the Commission will once again ask social affairs ministers of the 11 (excluding Britain) to agree the European Committee, nee works council directive. (Like companies in trouble, this directive changes its name quite frequently.) It is unanimously opposed by Europe's employers, on the ground that it will not, as it purports to do, improve information and consultation procedures. Rather, it will impose a rigid bureaucratic structure on a range of diverse practices across Europe, which, by and large, work well. David Hunt will be sent to mix the ouzos while this item is discussed, but there are signs that the other ministers are not as united as they once were, now that they have registered the strength of business opinion. The Portuguese and Italian governments are openly doubtful about the wisdom of going forward, and the French have suggested a more leisurely progress. UNICE, the European employers' body to which the CBI [Confederation of British Industry] belongs, has put forward a compromise. The social affairs council should pass an outline directive requiring large, Europe-wide companies to agree information and consultation procedures with their workforces, where they do not already have them, but without specifying any particular structures. In five years' time, the Commission should review the position. If then many companies have still failed to agree a consultation mechanism with their employees, the Commission would be justified in proposing minimum requirements. Commissioner Padraig Flynn should advise the Council that that is the best way forward. It will avoid a damaging row with employers, for whom this is a touchstone by which to judge the Community's social policy. He should also tell the ministers that the consultations on his Green Paper have achieved no consensus in favour of another ambitious social action programme, so that the White Paper he brings forward shortly will be a modest document, focusing on areas in which progress across Europe is very mixed (such as equal opportunities). A radical new social action programme would, of course, be quite inconsistent with the Delors White Paper of last December. Indeed, some of us have been puzzled by the relationship between Jacques Delors's White Paper and the Flynn Green Paper, which seem to differ in a lot more than colour. The heads of government meeting should make it clear that the Delors' paper is predominant. And the summit should concentrate on pushing forward some useful initiatives which have emerged from discussions of it. Specifically, the heads of government should endorse the proposal for a business-led group to review the scope for deregulation. It should be an independent body, able to publish its evidence and proposals. The Commission would prefer a creature of its own to do the job; that would be a mistake. The summit should also endorse the conclusions of the "high level group" set up under Commissioner Martin Bangemann on what is mysteriously known as "European information society." Their report, to which Peter Bonfield of ICL [International Computers Limited] and Peter Davis of Reed Elsevier -- the British representatives on the group -- have contributed a lot is a good one. It endorses the principle of market liberalisation of telecommunications across Europe, sketches out the exciting possibilities thrown up by information superhighways and describes a modest but important role for the Community, focusing on creating the right regulatory environment. The report does not support the case for Commission-directed investment. Indeed, the Corfu summit would do well to bury the "union bonds" idea in the sand. It is not relevant to the European information society and should not be needed to promote trans- European networks, the subject of a second working group under Commissioner Henning Christopherson, which has not yet reported. Lastly, of course, the summit should address the leadership question. There is no doubt that, on their merits, both Sir Leon Brittan and Peter Sutherland are very strong candidates to succeed Jacques Delors. But we are told that Jean-Luc Dehaene or Ruud Lubbers is more likely to secure majority backing (though the French may now feel that Jimmy Goldsmith would do less damage in Brussels than in France). Whoever is chosen should be told to take a bottle of retsina and the OECD jobs study to the nearest taverna before he begins to speak about Europe's new social agenda.
