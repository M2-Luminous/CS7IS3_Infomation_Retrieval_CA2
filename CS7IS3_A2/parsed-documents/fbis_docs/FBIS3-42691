This work, which is still not being published, has given rise to such a storm of enmity that the last names of L. Abalkin, N. Petrakov and S. Shatalin are beginning to frighten the average citizen and they are being labelled in the spirit of the old agitprop practice. "Without ceremony they are calling us enemies of the people," Stanislav Shatalin lamented bitterly. If one reads the commentaries and listens to the television oracles, one gets the impression that a regular campaign like the Burbulis "RF-politics" is beginning: find the enemy, stigmatize him and destroy him. The aim of this outbreak of "political cholera" is to distract society from this serious, thoughtful and competent analysis of the reasons for the failure of the policies of "shock therapy" which we call monetarism, and to split the government and the regions into "ours" and "not ours," and the whole country into two camps who do not trust one another. To defame these competent, sober and democraticly-minded academicians and through them the Chernomyrdin-Soskovets government while it is trying to correct the course which failed. In a word, they are ostracizing these three well-know academicians and aiming at those sober reformers in the government who reject the shock therapy against the people. This is evident to anyone who is acquainted with the handwriting of the masters of behind the scene deals. That is how they broke up the team and perhaps God will judge them as a team. But we have decided to acquaint the broad reading public with almost the complete text of this serious, and in our view, promising work of the Economic Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the International "Reforma" Fund, having published its chapters in three issues of RT [RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA]. Let the readers themselves evaluate the views of the academicians, their analysis of the reforms, and their suggestions as to how to correct the fateful situation, led by monetarism to socio-economic absurdity, and in fact to a dead end. We have singled out and are publishing with insignificant cuts this chapter from the comprehensive program "Socio-Economic Transformation in Russia: the Current Situation and New Approaches" (see page 3). We are doing this not only because the essence of the publication is organically intertwined with RT's policy of a newspaper of social protection, but also because we are talking here about material which can be understood by each person. It is namely the social side of the reforms being carried out which the population of Russia has categorically rejected, and which is the reason for the crushing defeat of the "Russia's Choice" party at the recent parliamentary elections. In civilized countries such a party, having lost the elections, would either go away or else seriously correct its course. Our monetarists, counting themselves among the civilized, not only do not want to recognize the loss of the people's trust, but are trying to pin on others their fault for the country's impoverisment. And it is namely this chapter of the program that is convincing: the welfare of working people and their social security has been thrown to the side of the road of the "reforms" of the stubborn and hard-headed monetarists.
