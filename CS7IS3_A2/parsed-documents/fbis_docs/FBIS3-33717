In an editorial, the newspaper said U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher described the negotiations as "very promising," because "he noted how serious the Syrian position was." The bilateral talks resumed Monday after a four-month break following the signing of the PLO-Israeli autonomy accord in September, which Syria condemned, arguing that separate deals undermined the Arab negotiating position. "The negotiations will make progress if Israel conforms to the requirements of peace, but the search for a settlement will go back to square one if the Jewish state continues to stand by its previous positions," the newspaper said. On Wednesday Christopher described as "very promising" the new format for the negotiations, with meetings restricted to the heads of the Israeli, Jordanian, Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian delegations.
