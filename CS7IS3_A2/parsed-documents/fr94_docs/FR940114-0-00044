ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: HUD is amending the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (FMHCSS) to improve the resistance of manufactured homes to wind forces in areas prone to hurricanes. Under this rule, manufactured homes will have to be designed to withstand wind speeds of up to 110 miles an hour in hurricane-prone areas, in accordance with design provisions of the American Society of Civil Engineers Standard ANSI/ASCE 7&hyph;88. Also, the Department is making certain other changes to the standards to ensure that structural assemblies, components, windows, connectors, and fasteners will be adequate for the area in which the home is to be placed. The revised standard also requires exterior roof and wall coverings to be fastened adequately to sheathing and framing members, to resist higher design wind pressures. The purpose of this rule is to increase the safety of manufactured homes, thereby reducing deaths and injuries and extensive property damage losses in areas where wind-induced damage is a particular hazard and risk. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 13, 1994, except that §§3280.403(b) and (e) and 3280.404(b) and (e) will become effective January 17, 1995. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 13, 1994, except that the incorporation by reference of publications listed in §§3280.403(b) and (e) and 3280.404(b) and (e) will become effective January 17, 1995.

Background Developmental History The purpose of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5401&hyph;5426, at 5401) (the Act) is to reduce the number of personal injuries and deaths and the amount of insurance costs and property damage resulting from manufactured home accidents, and to improve the quality and durability of manufactured homes. Section 604 of the Act confers authority on the Secretary of HUD to issue, amend, or revoke any Federal manufactured home construction or safety standard. Following Hurricane Andrew, the Department conducted field investigations of the damage experienced in the hurricane by manufactured housing units, as part of a full-scale review of the Federal manufactured home standards. The goal of these investigations and the review of materials and recommendations was to ensure that the Federal standards provide adequate protection to manufactured home occupants during high wind conditions. On April 14, 1993, the Department published a proposed rule (58 FR 19536) that reported the preliminary conclusions of the Department's efforts, and sought public comment on changes that the Department was considering for the Federal standards. The Department also contacted each of the members of the National Manufactured Home Advisory Council (Advisory Council), individually, in order to solicit their individual comments on the proposed wind standards rule, because the proposed timetable for final publication did not permit convening the Advisory Council. The individual responses of the Advisory Council members have been considered as public comments and included in the docket file for this rule. On June 9, 1993, the Department announced (58 FR 32316) that the comment period would be extended to July 9, 1993. The Department has continued to receive and consider comments well after that date, while this final rule was being developed. Because the timeframe originally proposed for the implementation of standard changes was postponed as a result of public comments and the extension of the comment deadline, the Department consulted with the National Manufactured Home Commission and convened the Advisory Council for consultation and to seek recommendations from the Advisory Council as a whole (see the notice published at 58 FR 34586 (June 28, 1993)). The Advisory Council met in Washington, DC, on July 13 and 14, 1993, to discuss wind standards and other proposals for changes to the standards for manufactured housing.
