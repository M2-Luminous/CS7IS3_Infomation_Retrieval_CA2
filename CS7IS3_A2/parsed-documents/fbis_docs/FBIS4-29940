The government has decided to do so in response to the prospect of the resumption of high-level U.S.-DPRK talks and the DPRK's proposal to hold North-South summit talks. The government intends to speedily set itineraries for Prime Minister Hata to visit South Korea and Foreign Minister Kakizawa to visit the United States. They will seek to shape a consensus with the United States and South Korea in dealing with the issue of the past developments in North Korea's nuclear program. With regard to the DPRK nuclear issue, the United States has set as a condition of the resumption of the stalled U.S.-North Korean high-level talks the DPRK's acceptance of special inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to determine whether Pyongyang has in the past diverted plutonium to build nuclear weapons. During his meeting with former U.S. President Carter, North Korean President Kim Il-song said that as conditions for resuming the stalled U.S.-North Korean high-level talks, the DPRK will allow IAEA inspectors to remain at the North's nuclear facilities and that North Korea will return completely to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). In response, Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci indicated that the U.S. Government would accept the proposal put forward by the DPRK president for resuming the high-level talks, saying, "If North Korea is found to have promised to freeze major elements of its nuclear program when we pursue another round of high-level talks between the United States and North Korea, this would be a constructive step." In this way, the United States has softened its preconditions for resuming the stalled U.S.-DPRK high-level talks. The IAEA has said that following North Korea's complete removal of fuel rods at an experimental nuclear reactor, it is be unable to verify developments in the DPRK's nuclear program. The same government source said, "The U.S. Government intends to leave the issue of verifying past developments of North Korea's nuclear program to the North-South summit talks, in anticipation of the impossibility of verifying them."
