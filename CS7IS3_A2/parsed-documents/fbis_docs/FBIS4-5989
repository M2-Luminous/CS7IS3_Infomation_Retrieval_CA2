"Such argument is aimed at intensifying the hostile policy toward the DPRK. It can never be overlooked," he said. Expressing resentment at the fact that the Japanese reactionaries are joining the United States in the criminal act of breaking international faith, and pursuing a hostile policy toward the DPRK through a strengthened "international cooperation system" of the United States, Japan and South Korea, he said: "It is very dangerous that some quarters of the ruling coalition are crying for the 'establishment of a crisis control system' to cope with 'a case of contingency in Korea' and even 'an amendment of the law' for the dispatch of the 'self-defence forces' to Korea, while describing 'North's nuclear development' as a fait accompli. "It is noted in Asian countries, too, that such attitude of the Japanese reactionaries means involvement in the increase of tension in northeast Asia. "We strongly demand that a next regime of Japan, whatever it may be, bear full responsibility for the past colonial rule over Korea and rectify the unjust hostile policy toward the DPRK and the repressive policy against the Koreans in Japan."
