The two church officials were sent by Teoctist, patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church, to deliver a pastoral letter through which the patriarch comforts and blesses the prisoners, as well as a medal on behalf of the Holy Synod. According to a statement by Teofan Sinaitul broadcast by Radio Chisinau, after they had persisted for almost eight hours, the authorities of the self-styled Dniester Republic did not authorize their meeting. We hope that in a few days' or weeks' time, when the authorities see fit to allow it, we will be able to pray for a few moments together with the five prisoners, Teofan said among other things, according to our Chisinau correspondent, Mircea Dascaliuc.
