From among those irregularities, the list of which has been faxed to us, we mention the following: the broadcasting, on the eve of elections, of two speeches made by President Mircea Snegur, as the speeches doubtlessly had an electoral character; a number of cases in which votes were cast while more than one person was present in the ballot booths; a number of cases when votes were cast outside ballot booths; attempts made at certain polling stations to influence the voters; and the nonregistering of persons who had already voted, which allowed for the same persons to cast two or even more votes.
