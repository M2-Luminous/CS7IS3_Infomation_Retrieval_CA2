A small consignment (not more than several hundred weapons) of Polish-made 7.62mm-calibre collapsible Kalashnikov automatic guns has been imported from Poland, while 7.62mm-calibre submachine guns have been imported from Czeckoslovakia and distributed among security officers guarding government buildings. The largest number of Kalashnikov automatic guns arrived in Georgia from Romania. (It must be noted that Romanian-made Kalashnikovs are of rather poor quality.) The first consignment of (7.62-calibre) automatic guns came in two marine cargo containers aboard a Romanian ship and was unloaded near Batumi in 1992. Since no one appeared to have ordered the weapons, it was assumed that they had been ordered by the government of ex-Georgian president Gamsakhurdia. In 1993, Shevardnadze's government imported up to 8,000 5.45mm-calibre Romanian-made Kalashnikov automatic guns (for the price of about $120 each).
