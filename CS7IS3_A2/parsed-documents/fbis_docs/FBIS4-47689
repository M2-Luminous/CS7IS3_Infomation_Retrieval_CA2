FBIS4-47689 "drafr084_cs94012" FBIS-AFR-94-084-S Daily Report 1 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Counting Problems Highlighted Counting Problems Highlighted MB0105203794 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1929 GMT 1 May 94 MB0105203794 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Tect] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- Election tallies from the crucial Nasrec [National Exhibition Center] counting centre from which the main PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] result is expected would probably not be completed until midnight on Monday [2 May], IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] Commissioner Helen Suzman, predicted on Sunday. She said the task was huge, had started under chaotic circumstances and now faced the problem that many counters were teachers who had to be back at school on Monday. Permission would be sought, particularly from the DET [Department of Education and Training], for these teachers to continue counting. Asked about the chances of the election being declared free and fair, she said she would like to quote Prime Minister John Vorster to say the alternative was too ghastly to contemplate. "But we have a useful adjective," she said. It was the word "substantially". "I don't know whether anybody knows what it really means but its a useful word."
