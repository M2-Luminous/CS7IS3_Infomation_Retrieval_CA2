Welcoming the appointment of the Independent Media Commission [IMC], DP Spokesman Peter Soal said it is going to be very interesting to see how the IMC will react to what he calls the increasing partiality of the SABC toward the ANC: [Begin Soal recording] Firstly, the chairperson of the board, Mrs. Matsepe-Casaburri, has said that she is a member of the ANC, and I believe that she should resign, either from the SABC Board or from the ANC. Senior persons at the SABC have been nominated to be on the ANC list for election, but they remain in their positions at the SABC. So I think that they should either resign from the SABC, or declare that they are not ANC candidates. [end recording]
