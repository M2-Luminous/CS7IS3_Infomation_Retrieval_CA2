A settlement of the financial issue will help speed up construction on the airport projects, said Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the XINHUA News Agency Hong Kong branch, after attending the opening ceremony of a Chinese trade fair here today. The Chinese side has stated its opinion at the Sino-British Airport Committee meeting last week and expected the British side to give it a careful consideration, he said. Both sides should accord with the memorandum of understanding on the construction of the Hong Kong new airport and reach an agreement on the financial plan, he added. China has always supported the construction of an airport in Hong Kong and hopes to see it completed in time and up to quality, he said, adding that China is not responsible for the delay of the airport construction.
