FR940527-0-00021 FR940527-0-00006 This action also revises the Class E4 airspace area at Point Mugu NAWS, CA, to show it as part-time airspace associated with the Pt. Mugu part-time Class D airspace area, the Class E4 airspace area at Hilo International, General Lyman Field, HI, and Lihue Airport, HI, to indicate the full-time status, and the Class E3 airspace area at Santa Barbara Municipal Airport, CA, to show is full time status. As noted in the Airspace Reclassification Final Rule, published in the Federal Register on December 17, 1991, airspace at an airport with a part-time control tower should be designated as a Class D airspace area when the control tower is in operation, and as a Class E airspace area when the control tower is closed (56 FR 65645). The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as surface areas for airports, extensions to a Class C surface area and extensions to a Class D surface area are published, respectively, in Paragraphs 6002, 6003 and 6004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need to establish these Class E airspace areas in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
