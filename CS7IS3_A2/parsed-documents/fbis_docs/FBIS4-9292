Milosevic made the following statement for journalists: "A complete agreement was reached on the total normalization of relations between the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] and the republic of Srpska as a prerequisite for normal cooperation in the interest of the peace process. This means that both sides are expected to fulfill the obligations they have taken upon themselves." According to the the Serbian president, the second point took longest to discuss. It concerned an agreement on the solution to the crisis hotbed in Gorazde. "We discussed a possibility for reaching a general agreement on the cessation of hostilities in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina territory," said Milosevic, and added: "Full agreement was reached on this and support was given to the proposal that Mr. Akashi put forward to the Serb Republic representatives." "It was all about three major issues, and agreement was reached on all of them. This is a very big step in the direction of peace, and I hope it will be very successful," the Serbian president said. The UN secretary general's envoy, Yasushi Akashi, expressed satisfaction with today's talks and described them as positive, recalling Slobodan Milosevic's statement on full accord regarding three key issues. Yasushi Akashi put a particular stress on the importance of the agreement on Gorazde. "We agreed on the principles of an immediate and complete cease-fire, and Mr. Karadzic agreed with it. The cease-fire will come into effect tomorrow at 1000 gmt." "We will try to deploy UN protection forces in Gorazde as soon as possible, and soon thereafter we will try to withdraw heavy artillery to a distance from which the town will not be threatened." Akashi went on to say that an agreement had been reached on the full freedom of movement for UN protection forces, the evacuation of the wounded, and the free work of humanitarian organizations. "I would like to express satisfaction with the agreement on the complete normalization of relations between UNPROFOR and the Serb side in Bosnia. Today we exchanged opinions on the future of the peace process when this crisis is over, as well as about efforts that will lead towards a global cease-fire, aiming at reaching an overall political solution later," Akashi said. He told journalists the talks would resume tomorrow morning. Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic of Srpska, reminded the journalists of the beginning of the mission of UN secretary general's special envoy, drawing attention to "very successful meetings with him and very significant achievements in the Sarajevo zone." "Unfortunate events around Gorazde, especially the bombing of Serb positions, have to a certain extent slowed down the previously positive process," said Karadzic and added, "Since 1000 GMT today we have regained our mutual trust and cooperation with the UNPROFOR, which is promising." "In our opinion the results of today's meeting are very similar to those we had achieved on 6 February regarding the Sarajevo crisis. We hope the series of our successful meetings and achievements will continue. We positively responded to the initiative on the general cessation of hostilities," said Karadzic. "If we draw a lesson from the Gorazde crisis, as we have done from the Sarajevo crisis, and if Muslim forces do not continue with their offensive from the direction of Tuzla or some other areas, we can expect all sides in the conflict and the international community to work on what was agreed here today -- the general cessation of hostilities in the entire former Bosnia-Herzegovina territory," said Radovan Karadzic in conclusion.
