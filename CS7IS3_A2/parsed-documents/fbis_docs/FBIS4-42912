France can make its voice heard in Brussels, he said, citing the example of GATT. He reaffirmed the objective of a single currency and called for a return to narrow fluctuation bands within the EMS [European Monetary System]. With a view to the reform of Community institutions planned for 1996, he proposed, among other things, extending the term of the presidency of the European Council. With regard to the major issue of enlargement to include the countries of the East, the minister pleaded for a plan for the gradual integration of candidate members, which he listed. Alain Juppe clearly opted for a more efficient and more democratic European Union [EU], rejecting the possibility of Europe becoming a mere free trade area. [Lamy] Is Europe not starting on a downhill slope? [Juppe] The impression of "Europessimism" that seems to prevail in Europe is not shared abroad. The EU maintains a strong power of attraction, since numerous states want to join it. It is respected not only by the United States but also by Russia and Japan. And the image of it in Third World countries is that of a fortress rather than of a ship adrift. This being so, what is the source of the skepticism that is being expressed, especially in connection with the campaign for the election of the European Parliament? First, from the feeling that successive enlargements of the Community have taken place to the detriment of its coherence. Second, from the fact that the complexity and weight of EU institutions are now so great as to paralyze them. Last, Europe is accused of having failed to provide a convincing response to the concerns of Europeans: the struggle against unemployment and both internal and external security. These criticisms, often justified, must be answered. There is no shortage of ideas. [Lamy] How would you evaluate the functioning of the Council of Ministers in Brussels? Can France make its voice heard in them? [Juppe] My evaluation is clear. Yes, France can make its voice heard, as is shown by GATT and Bosnia. But we can do better. After 15 months' experience, I think that two kinds of improvement can be made. The first is the more simple one: It concerns working methods. Everyone can see that the practice of systematic "roundtables" consumes a great deal of time -- at least two hours among Twelve, perhaps four or five hours if the Union some day has 25 members. Some measures of a practical nature can be envisaged: to settle more issues at the level of the Council of Permanent Representatives (senior officials representing France in Brussels), to increase written procedures, and also, as the French Government has suggested, to organize more frequent meetings of the ministers responsible for European affairs. The second class of reforms must aim to improve the efficiency of the decisionmaking process. To this end we should consider extending the term of the presidencies, creating one or more deputy presidencies, or increasing the personnel or resources of the Secretariat General of the Council (and thus also extending the services of the Commission). We will have these suggestions in mind during preparations for the intergovernmental conference in 1996. [Lamy] According to the public, Bosnia illustrates Europe's impotence to a grotesque degree. What is France's role? [Juppe] Before talking about Europe's impotence, let us recall first that it provides the largest share of humanitarian aid, which has made it possible to save hundreds of thousands of lives over the past two years. This is by no means negligible! It is also the Europeans who have deployed the most blue helmets in Bosnia. Last, it is Europe that has proposed the only plan for a political settlement of the conflict, and this plan, having been almost accepted by all sides in December, still remains on the table. [Lamy] France has always performed a guiding role among the Twelve: It is by far the largest contributor of troops, ahead of Britain; it was the initiator, with Germany, of the EU peace plan; and it was behind all the political and military measures that made it possible to drive back the Serbs: the sanctions against the Belgrade regime, the establishment of safe havens, and the ultimatum to Sarajevo. In other words, we have no cause to feel ashamed about what we have done, and we must not relax our efforts to achieve a political settlement, which is the only possible solution to this conflict. During President Clinton's recent visit to Paris, I noted that the Americans and French now hold the same stance: We must do our utmost to persuade the three communities to conclude a peace agreement before the summer, on the basis of the 13 May Geneva declaration. This is a considerable accomplishment for French diplomacy! [Lamy] What role do you envisage for the WEU [Western European Union], the body responsible for defense? Could we envisage the Eurocorps, as it is now, intervening in the medium term? [Juppe] It is the destiny of the WEU to merge with the EU sooner or later. European defense depends both on a strengthening of the effort made by the Europeans themselves ands on maintaining a strong trans-Atlantic link. This is why France pleaded successfully at the latest NATO summit for the latter to be able, in some instances, to place its resources under WEU command. France and Germany are determined to pursue this path, as shown by the latest Franco-German summit, which achieved in particular a very notable advance on the issue of space observation satellites, which Europe will need in order to have its own strategic analysis capability. The increased strength of the Eurocorps, to which Belgium, Spain, and Luxembourg also contribute, is a priority. If, as I hope, Germany succeeds in resolving the constitutional problem associated with troop deployment abroad, the Eurocorps will grant Europe the military wing that it now lacks. There are other major projects under way, such as the establishment of an aeronaval force with Spain and Italy, which will contribute to the same objective. [Lamy] How are we to deal with an increasingly pressing demand on the part of the countries of the East to join the EU? How do you intend to handle it? [Juppe] This is a major challenge for Europe in the years ahead. We cannot act as though nothing had happened in 1989, as though the countries of Central and East Europe had not carried out a peaceful revolution, restored democracy, and opened up to the market economy. For almost five years France has argued for an enlarged Europe at last free from the divisions of the Cold War. If we disappoint those countries' expectations, we risk both casting them back toward nationalist temptations and prompting them to return to their former options. This is why the French Government, in full agreement with Germany, believes that the EU must be extended to the countries of East Europe. This, moreover, was the conclusion reached by the European Council in Copenhagen in June 1993. So it is not the principle of enlargement that is in dispute, but the means of achieving it. It is necessary, first, to draw up a list limiting the number of countries involved: These are the countries of Central and East Europe and the three Baltic countries, to which Slovenia could be added. Second, the adherence of new member states must not entail a dilution of European building. As Chancellor Kohl clearly stated at the news conference after the Franco-German summit at Mulhouse, we refuse to allow Europe to become a mere free trade area. So before moving ahead, we must work, with a view to the intergovernmental conference in 1996, for a thorough revision of the institutions, to make the Union more efficient and more democratic. Furthermore, an enlarged Europe must enjoy stability; its members must settle their disputes like good neighbors: The stability pact, work on which is due to finish at the beginning of 1995, provides them with a suitable framework for doing so. Last, imagination will have to be displayed to bring together within the same Union countries whose levels of development and economic conditions are still very different. This is why we are considering a plan for the gradual integration of the candidates for membership. We have started to work in this direction by associating the countries of central and East Europe in terms of foreign and security policy and by granting them, on the basis of a Franco-German proposal, the status of associate membership in the WEU. This organization's council spoke out favorably in this regard at its 9 May session. [Lamy] The other major anxiety concerns Europe's inability to create jobs and to defend itself commercially. Is the record of GATT negotiations a positive one, on balance? [Juppe] Europe has created fewer jobs in recent years than the United States or Japan. The first reason for this has to do with the weak growth -- actually negative in 1993 -- that we have experienced since 1990. Some degree of optimism in this regard is justified by the fact that all the institutes forecast growth of 1.6 percent for 1994 and growth above 2 percent in 1995. Second, there are structural obstacles in Europe to the creation of jobs. Brussels last December embarked, on the basis of the Commission's white paper and of the national contributions that it received, on a very extensive program designed to stimulate job creation. It involves on the one hand facilitating major infrastructure networks such as the new eastern high-speed train service, which is one of the 10 priority projects that will be approved at the European Council in Corfu. The other objective is to establish EU actions in the field of education, increased flexibility of labor, and the development of proximity services. As for the GATT negotiations, I think, as I have had occasion to say several times, that it is extremely positive. Without going back over it in detail, I will mention its crucial achievements -- increased openness to third markets, the safeguarding of the Common Agricultural Policy, which was threatened by the draft Blair House agreement; the recognition of cultural exception; the establishment of the World Trade Organization [WTO]; and the broaching of new issues, such as the environment or different levels of social protection. Of course, we must remain vigilant with regard to the implementation of the GATT agreement, which must be ratified by all sides before their implementation in 1995. France believes that the establishment of the WTO offers real chances of combating the unilateral trade policies which profoundly affect international trade. Moreover, we are now better equipped to respond in the event of a continuation of such practices. On our initiative, on 15 December 1993, at the same time as it approved the results of the Uruguay round, the EU strengthened its own instruments of trade policy. [Lamy] Do you think that the credibility of the objective of a single European currency has been enhanced now? [Juppe] This remains the objective. In order to achieve it we must first strengthen the convergence of the European economies. In 1993 we succeeded in surmounting a serious monetary crisis thanks to close cooperation with Germany. We must now make the best use of the second stage of economic and monetary union [EMU], which began on 1 January 1994 with the establishment of the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt. This stage must be marked in particular by a strengthening of coordination between central banks, further development of the public and private use of the ECU and a coordinated reduction of interest rates. We must also establish narrower fluctuation bands among European currencies. If these objectives are achieved, the transition to the third stage of EMU, that is, the single currency, will be within our reach. [Lamy] You mentioned a Europe of "variable solidarity". Is it enough? Is it not necessary to envisage a proper reform of EU institutions, a new founding act among the real advocates of political union? [Juppe] First, I would like to point out that "variable solidarity" is not a new idea. It is the principle adopted within the framework of the EMS, in connection with industrial cooperation (the Airbus and Arianespace are two examples), but also in the field of research, where some programs -- such as JET [Joint European Torus], which has permitted considerable progress to be made in thermonuclear fusion -- do not involve all members states and are conducted in association with third states. The WEU, whose task it is to formulate a common defense policy, does not comprise all the members of the EU. And the Eurocorps, which is the precursor of common armed forces, permits those who so wish to associate their efforts on a voluntary basis. The larger the EU grows, the more this kind of process will be necessary, because in a community of 20-25 members not everyone can do everything together, nor at the same pace. This is by no means incompatible with the idea of a "tough kernel" of member states wanting to establish together a very advanced union. This is the main significance of Franco-German cooperation, the vitality of which has just been demonstrated again by the Mulhouse summit. Let us not labor under any delusions: The 1996 intergovernmental conference cannot content itself with what I would call technical superficial adjustments; it must examine matters in depth and, to use your expression, result in a new founding pact guided by our vision of the Europe of the year 2000. A Europe determined to meet the two great challenges that face our societies -- employment and peace. France is ready to proceed further along this path.
