FBIS4-15367 "drsov068_t_94014" FBIS-SOV-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 BALTIC STATES Estonia ETA Chief To Act as Editor-in-Chief ETA Chief To Act as Editor-in-Chief WS0804082894 Tallinn ETA in English 1823 GMT 7 Apr 94 WS0804082894 Tallinn ETA English BFN ["News Release"] [Text] Chairman of the board of the scandalous Rahva Haal newspaper Veiko Jurisson told ETA that starting Friday [8 April], the present editor-in-chief of Estonian News Agency Peeter Tali will fulfill the responsibilities of the acting editor-in-chief of the paper. Tali will continue working at ETA as a consultant. As an acting editor-in-chief of Rahva Haal he has all authorities to put together the new staff of Rahva Haal, Jurisson said. Peeter Tali (29) has graduated from Tartu University department of journalism and has worked for the Edasi\Postimees daily and as an editor-in-chief of ETA since last summer. Scandal over the second biggest Estonian daily Rahva Haal started already in May last year when Estonian Privatization Agency decided to privatize the state-owned newspaper, the results of which were disputed at court and the privatization of the daily stopped. In October last year the board of the daily was changed with majority given to representatives of the government coalition. On March 18, the board adopted a decision to change the statutes of the company, abolishing the institution of editor-in-chief and creating a new institution of publisher-in-chief. Majority of the staff of the paper, in protest to the decision, resigned and decided to join AS RH, formed by the Rahva Haal staff last year to participate at the privatization. Editor-in-chief Toomas Leito was dismissed by the board "for loss of trust" and not preserving "political balance" of the paper. Toomas Leito told ETA that the decisions of the board of RAS Rahva Haal had been of "purely political" nature. The former staff of Rahva Haal started to publish their own paper Eesti Sunumid. Rahva Haal is published, at present, by RAS Rahva Haal in cooperation with AS Hommikuleht, another Estonian daily. On Monday, Estonian Ministry of Culture and Education sent a letter to the managing director of AS Ajakirjandusmaja, that administers the Tallinn Press Building where most of the biggest newspapers are located, demanding that in 24 hours "outsiders" (meaning the former staff) leave the 5th floor rooms rented to RAS Rahva Haal. Phones were cut off and the staff let into the rooms only in twos to fetch their private things. World Press Freedom Committee, which includes 36 leading journalistic organisations on five continents, sent a letter to Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar on Thursday, saying that the Committee was dismayed over Estonian government's "forcible eviction" from their premises of the editor and staff of the newspaper Rahva Haal. "This attack on the journalistic independence of a newspaper critical of your administration can only harm the hard won image of the new Estonia as a working democracy," Ronald Koven, the European representative of the Committee, stated on behalf of the organization, adding that it is particularly distressing to those who have seen Estonia as a "leading exponent of free speech and press freedom in East and Central Europe". The notion of "political balance" invoked to attempt to justify governmental dismissal of the editor, cutting off the newspaper's telephone lines and threats to prosecute the editor, all violate the principles of press freedom, the letter stresses. The committee urges Estonian Prime Minister to refrain from placing further obstacles in the way of the staff's publication of their newspaper (i.e. Eesti Sunumid) and to proceed with speedy privatization of the paper without attempting to maintain control indirectly. "The steps taken so far plainly demonstrate the threat to a free press of state ownership," the letter says, adding that Estonia's democratic credentials are threatened by these actions against the press.
