Thailand will stick to its positions concerning the third and fourth airline freedoms, that is, at least 55 percent of through passenger traffic load and 70 percent of cargo as conditions for the fifth freedom. The matter was discussed at the negotiation two years ago. He said it is difficult to anticipate the U.S. position in the forthcoming negotiation. According to a most recent report, the U.S. Congress was not happy with its delegation in the previous talks, which gave in too much to the countries involved in the negotiations. Thailand therefore expects that this forthcoming round of talks will be tough, with the United States taking a tougher stand there being a possibility that Thailand's conditions will not be accepted. The Thai delegation will be led by Sisuk Chantharangsu, director general of the Commercial Aviation Department. In the previous round, both sides discussed the matter of principles, and reportedly the United States adopted a sincere and amicable position. The upcoming negotiations will deal with the details and Thailand will seek to know the U.S. response to its proposals. Thailand does not expect any discussions about flight routes or flight increases because this area should be dealt with only when an agreement has been reached in principle.
