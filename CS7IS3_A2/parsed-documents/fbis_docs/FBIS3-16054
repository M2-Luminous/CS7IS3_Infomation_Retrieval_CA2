Despite the fact the document was signed by all the sides, the Azeri side considered its fulfilment impossible and is making new terms. In the opinion of Mamikonyan, Azerbaijan keeps to the force solution of the Karabakh conflict, which will claim more human lives. The representative linked recent foreign visits of Heydar Aliyev after signing of the Moscow protocol with an attempt to "distance from Russia". He refuted Azeri mass media reports claiming the protocol was signed under the pressure of Pavel Grachev and described the Russian stand in the Karabakh conflict as "restraint and well-balanced". Asked by ITAR-TASS whether the Armenian side agrees to all items of the protocol, Mamikonyan said it is a compromise document but one shall fulfill it. He did not specify what items are meant referring to the confidential character of the protocol. A day before Azeri Ambassador Plenipotentiary and Extraordinary to Russia Ramiz Rizayev told a news conference in Moscow about the Azeri stand on troops pullback at 15 kilometers. In the opinion of the Azeri side, the initial pullback line should be the Karabakh administrative border instead of the line of the sides' contact. Mamikonyan said in this case Azerbaijan will bring its troops to the Karabakh border and Karabakh populated localities will be in danger again due to the absence of the "security and confidence mechanism". Speaking of the Armenian troops withdrawal from seized lands, whose temporary control was explained by the representative with military-strategic goals, Mamikonyan said this is impossible to be done without political settlement. "If it is so easy to do the Jews would have left the Golan Heights within a day", he said. Armenia stands for the introduction of peace-makers into the conflict zone, however, it is more psychologically ready for the introduction of Russian peace-makers, said the representative. Speaking of the upcoming meeting of the Armenian and Azeri presidents with the mediation of Boris Yeltsin, he said the meeting should be well-prepared, but its date has not been specified. He confirmed that delegations of the Armenian and Azeri parliaments will meet on the border on Saturday.
