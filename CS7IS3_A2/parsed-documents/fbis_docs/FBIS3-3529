The county, once a revolutionary base noted for its remote location, signed more than 80 contracts for joint-venture or cooperative projects in 1993, involving more than 1.1 billion Hong Kong dollars. The amount of overseas investment in the county last year was equivalent to the total for the previous 10 years. County official Wang Jingji said that the harsh geographical conditions and backward communications used to hold back potential investors. The influx of overseas funds in other parts of this booming province made the county officials aware that they must spare no effort to bolster local infrastructure. Since 1991 the county has mobilized more than 200,000 people to upgrade 760 km of highways and build another 270 km of new roads to link it up with neighboring counties. It opened automatic switch boards in 1990 and installed 6,000 program-controlled telephones in 1992. Eighteen of its 23 towns have been brought into the county's network of program-controlled telephones. In addition, pagers and mobile cellular phones have also been introduced into the county. A power plant has been built with an installed capacity of 30,000 kw to ensure a stable supply of energy. Meanwhile the county has promulgated a set of preferential policies to encourage overseas investment. It now holds an annual trade and investment fair. The county is currently building an express highway to connect it up with the ongoing Beijing-Kowloon railway, five km away.
