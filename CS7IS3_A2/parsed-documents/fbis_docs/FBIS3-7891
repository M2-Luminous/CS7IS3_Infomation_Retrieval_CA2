According to Mr. Durmov such a document is vital as Serbia has not signed the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. Belgrade showed readiness to start immediate discussion of confidence building measures, Gen. Miodrag Terzic of Serbia's Defence Ministry said, quoted by the daily. [passage omitted] Within a year at the latest Bulgaria could lay territory claims to the present state of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], demanding first official protection for the Bulgarian population there, NOVINAR says today, quoting a high-ranking diplomat of the Foreign Ministry in Sofia. This dramatic reversal of Bulgaria's position towards Macedonia would be a consequence of Russia's increased activity in the Balkans, the paper adds.
