FBIS4-32354 "dreeu121__a94009" FBIS-EEU-94-121-A Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria SDS, BSP `Anxious' About FYROM Census SDS, BSP `Anxious' About FYROM Census AU2106152294 Sofia BTA in English 1352 GMT 21 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2106152294 Sofia BTA English BFN [Text] Sofia, June 21 (BTA) -- Representatives of the two major political forces in Bulgaria: The Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP, the former Communists) and the opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) elaborated on their parties' stands on the census in the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. "SDS is anxious about the census. Despite the large number of foreign observers, we are apprehensive that the population of the Republic of Macedonia lacks the democratic psychological and political environment required for free expression," said Mr. Asparukh Panov, deputy chairman of the National Coordinating Council of SDS and member of the parliamentary Foreign Policy Committee. SDS is skeptical mainly because of the considerable politicization of the ruling Macedonian Socialist Party which organizes the census taking and because of the fuelling of anti-Bulgarian attitudes, evidently to be used in the forthcoming election campaign. "As a political force we have always maintained an explicit and resolute stand on Macedonia, which we took in 1992 when the SDS government recognized that country's independence," Mr. Panov pointed out. He added that SDS firmly believes that a sovereign, independent Macedonia is a guarantor of balance and stability in the Balkans. "The Bulgarian Socialist Party is the only political force which two years ago refused to applaud the recognition of the Republic of Macedonia which was no doubt a hasty action, said BSP leader Zhan Videnov in response to a reporter's question about the census in Macedonia. According to Mr. Videnov, the problems with the language, the historical inheritance and the `Bulgarian' option in the census forms were bound to arise. ``We shall always defend the Bulgarian history, the Bulgarian national spirit, Bulgarian cultural and historical sites and we hope that Macedonia would respond to our open and democratic policy in a similar manner,'' Mr. Panov pointed out. Mr. Videnov is apprehensive about possible territorial claims and arguments between Bulgaria and Macedonia. The two states have a profoundly different concept of national security. "To Skopje national security is guaranteed by the presence of foreign military forces on the republic's territory, while Bulgaria seeks to achieve it through balanced and peaceful relations with its neighbours and integration with the European and world security structures," he explained. In his opinion, many chances for preventive settlement of problems between Bulgaria and Macedonia have been missed in the past two years and it is the respective state institutions that are to be held responsible and not the ones who were warning against the complications threatening to ensue from the involved configurations in the Balkans.
