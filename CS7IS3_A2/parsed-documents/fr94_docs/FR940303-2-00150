FR940303-2-00150 FR940303-2-00082 [Release No. 34&hyph;33673 ; File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;42] Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Approved Proposed Rule Change Relating to Asset-Based Sales Charge Disclosures by Money Market Mutual Funds February 24, 1994. On December 3, 1993, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change 1 pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 2 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder. 3 The rule change amends Article III, Section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice (``Rules'') to exempt certain money market mutual funds from the disclosure required by Section 26(d)(4) of the Rules. In particular, the rule change exempts funds with annual asset-based sales charges equal to or less than .25 of 1% (25 basis points) of average net assets from the requirement to disclose in its prospectus that long-term shareholders may pay more than the economic equivalent of the permitted maximum frontend sales charges. 1 The NASD originally filed the proposed rule change on August 3, 1993. On December 3, 1993, the NASD filed Amendment No. 1 in response to concerns raised by the Commission. Amendment No. 1 was reflected in the Commission's Notice of Filing. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33352 (Dec. 16, 1993), 58 FR 67884 (Dec. 22, 1993). On February 9, 1994, the NASD submitted Amendment No. 2 which included a response to the comment letters received by the Commission and the results of the membership vote on the proposed rule change. The membership approved the rule change with 1,874 approving, 242 disapproving and 9 not voting, of all valid ballots received. 2 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 3 17 CFR 240.19b-4 (1993). Notice of the proposed rule change together with its terms of substance was provided by issuance of a Commission release and by publication in the Federal Register. 4 Three comments were received in response to the Commission release. This order approves the proposed rule change. 4 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33352 (Dec. 16, 1993), 58 FR 67884 (Dec. 22, 1993). I. Introduction On July 7, 1992, the Commission approved an NASD rule change concerning investment company sales charges. 5 As currently drafted, section 26(d)(4) of these new rules require any investment company assessing asset-based sales charges to disclose in its prospectus that ``long-term shareholders may pay more than the economic equivalent of the maximum front-end sales charges permitted by this section.'' 6 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30897 (July 7, 1992), 57 FR 30985 (July 13, 1992) (approving SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;90&hyph;69); NASD Manual, Rules of Fair Practice, Art. III, Sec. 26(d), (CCH) ¶ 2176. 6 NASD Manual, Rules of Fair Practice, Art. III, Sec. 26(d)(4), (CCH) ¶ 2176. As the July 7, 1993 effective date for the NASD's new rule approached, the NASD received several applications for exemption from section 26(d)(4)'s disclosure requirement. The applicants sought the exemption based on their assessment that section 26(d)(4) requires the disclosure even if the statement may not be true for a particular mutual fund. According to the NASD, the applicants pointed out that in the case of a money market mutual fund, a high probability exists that the statement will be inaccurate because such funds generally have very low asset-based sales charges, and an investor would have to be a shareholder for an extremely long time before the disclosure would be accurate. II. Description of the Rule Change The NASD agreed with the arguments of the applicants and concluded that requiring funds to include disclosure statements in the situations identified by the applicants does not serve any identifiable purpose and does not advance any recognizable regulatory interest. Accordingly, the NASD filed a proposed rule change to amend section 26(d)(4) to exempt certain money market mutual funds from the disclosure requirement. 7 The exemption is limited to money market mutual funds with asset-based sales charges equal to or less than .25 of 1% of average net assets per annum. 7 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33352 (Dec. 16, 1993), 58 FR 67884 (Dec. 22, 1993). III. Comment Letters As noted above, in response to the solicitation of comments, the Commission received three comment letters. The NASD responded to these comments in an amendment to the filing dated February 9, 1994 8 and a letter dated February 14, 1994. 9 8 File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;42, Amendment No. 2 (Feb. 9, 1994). 9 Letter from Suzanne E. Rothwell, Associate General Counsel, NASD, to Selwyn Notelovitz, Branch Chief, SEC (Feb. 14, 1994). All three commenters supported the NASD's proposed exemption but suggested certain changes. Two commenters suggested that the exemption not be limited to money market mutual funds but also extend to any fund where the disclosure might be misleading or inaccurate. 10 One of these commenters suggested that the NASD establish a test to determine whether the disclosure would be required, 11 and the other recommended allowing the funds to assess the surrounding circumstances to determine whether disclosure would be necessary. 12 The third commenter argued that the disclosure should be expanded to include a statement that ``short term shareholders will pay sales charges less than the maximum permitted by (the rules).'' 13 10 Letter from Frances M. Stadler, Associate Counsel, Investment Company Institute, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (Jan. 13, 1994) (``ICI Comment Letter'') and letter from Robert L. Butler, President, Pioneer Funds Distributor, Inc. to Office of the Secretary, SEC (Jan. 10, 1994) (``Pioneer Comment Letter''). 11 Pioneer Comment Letter. 12 ICI Comment Letter. 13 Letter from Vern M. Clemenson, Saturna Capital, to Margaret H. McFarland, SEC (Jan. 10, 1994). The NASD has determined not to incorporate the suggested changes and noted that it crafted the exemption for money market mutual funds because these funds typically charge low asset-based sales charges and have a relatively low return on investment. Thus, that an investor would pay the economic equivalent of the maximum permitted front-end sales charge is unlikely. In addition, in the NASD's assessment, the current tendency is for investors to use money market mutual funds for short-term purposes, for example, as checking accounts or temporary holding areas for investment funds and, therefore, these funds should be exempted from the section 26(d)(4) disclosure requirement. IV. Discussion The Commission believes that the NASD's rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD and, therefore, has determined to approve the rule change. Specifically, the Commission believes that the rule change is consistent with Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act. 14 This section requires, among other things, that the NASD's rules be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public interest. 14 15 U.S.C. 78 o &hyph;3(b)(6). The NASD adopted section 26(d)(4) with the intent of providing adequate disclosure to readers of prospectuses of investment companies assessing asset-based sales charges. While the current rule only states that shareholders may pay more than the economic equivalent of the maximum front-end sales charges, by creating an exemption from this disclosure requirement for money market mutual funds, the rule provides more accurate disclosure to readers of these prospectuses. With respect to money market mutual funds, the disclosure is unnecessary, potentially misleading and serves no regulatory or investor protection interest. V. Conclusion In conclusion, for the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;42 be, and hereby is, approved. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 15 15 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
