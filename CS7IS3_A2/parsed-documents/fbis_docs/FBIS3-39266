Henceforth, the agricultural sector is an integral part of the GATT system. Fixed customs rates will replace the varying duties that have been imposed at the frontiers to date. These rates will be reduced by 36 percent over a period of six years. A minimal opening up of access to all of the markets is planned. Domestic measures to support prices will be reduced by 20 percent, but direct aid to producers will be allowed. Subsidized exports, for their part, will be reduced by 21 percent in volume, while overall budget support of exports, for its part, will be reduced by 36 percent in value. The reduction commitments will not apply to the "less-developed countries." A first assessment can be made. The Americans emerge from the agreement as the principal winners, inasmuch as their system of subsidies is not altered by the final document. This is because one of the advantages they still enjoy is that their domestic prices are close to those quoted internationally. There is a greater disparity between the prices guaranteed to the producers in Europe and international prices. Despite everything, the Europeans have not come out of these accords too badly. The bulk of the guidelines had already been established by the Common Agricultural Policy of the Union (CAP). But a new reform of the CAP is to be expected in the years to come (additional restrictions on the production of beef). While subsidized exports will be reduced, those exports that are not subsidized may increase thanks to the opening up of certain markets. In France, the producers of basic foodstuffs such as grains and beef will suffer as a result of the agricultural accord. On the other hand, it will benefit the manufacturers of processed or "luxury" products such as wines, poultry, cheeses, and dairy products. "There has been a psychological and political overinvestment where this issue is concerned," Michel Rainelli, a professor at the University of Sophia-Antipolis, believes. "Economically, this is a satisfactory agreement for France. But it is difficult to pursue this discussion with the farmers. Instead of taking agriculture as a whole into account, the debate has become polarized around the oleaginous crops and wheat. But the wine producers are aware of the opportunities provided by the opening up of the markets." The assessment is clearly less favorable for a certain number of other countries. The producers in the Cairns group (Australia, Argentina, Canada, etc.), who fought for a real opening up of the agricultural markets, are likely to have to pay the cost of an understanding between Europe and the United States. In the short run, it is the developing countries that will be the main losers as a result of the accords, according to Abdelaziz L. Alaoui, a Paribas Bank economist. They will no longer benefit from the exemption allowed them on the subsidized European wheat they receive. The social consequences to be expected from a rise in prices are likely to be harsh.
