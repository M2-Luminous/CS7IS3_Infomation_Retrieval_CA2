SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The proposed grant will provide funding to Howard University, which is a nationally recognized historically black academic institution with a broad curriculum. The Howard University School of Continuing Education (HUSCE) is one of the 17 schools and colleges of Howard University. HUSCE was established in April 1986 to meet the special higher-education needs of a rapidly expanding community of professionals, administrators, entrepreneurs, technical personnel, paraprofessionals and other adults. A part of the mission of the HUSCE is to serve as the central administrative unit for coordinating all continuing education at the University and for administering the Summer Sessions. The program is meritorious because it not only provides the interface desired in the above subject areas, but also supports the Department's objective of building a well-educated and diverse community in energy-related fields of study reflecting the core values articulated in the Department of Energy Strategic Plan. This project will promote education as well as provide local colleges and universities the opportunity to provide a curriculum to the community which will better prepare them to gain employment with the Department of Energy. Based on the evaluation of relevance to the accomplishment of a public purpose, it is determined that the application represents a beneficial method for the Department to form partnerships with the academic community to foster educational growth closely attuned to national energy policy and technology development. The result should be university graduates which represent a diverse population with the foundation required to more adequately address the national energy challenges. Craig S.
