Mario Rognoni, PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] legislator, said his party has reports "radical" elements have been making contacts with those foreigners so they will execute violent actions. According to Rognoni, that group of Middle Eastern individuals reportedly operates from a residence in San Francisco corregimiento. The opposition legislator said PRD presidential candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares has been informed of the situation, but he does not plan to decrease his campaign visits. Mario Rognoni said the intelligence team that works with Perez Balladares gathered the reports about the presence of Middle Eastern extremists in Panama. According to Rognoni, all the parties that have nominated presidential candidates have on their teams people who in one way or another undertake intelligence tasks. Meanwhile, Camilo Brenes, Christian Democratic Party legislator, reiterated yesterday Bocas del Toro Province is one of the points used for arms trafficking. Brenes said the Changuinola area on the border with Costa Rica was used in the past to bring in trailer trucks loaded with weapons from Central American countries. Camilo Brenes said he does not have information on the hiring of Middle Eastern extremists, but he said anything is possible. Months prior to the U.S. invasion of Panama several officers of the then Defense Forces traveled to Middle Eastern countries to seek military support to confront the North Americans. They were looking for surface-to-air missiles. One of those in charge of that mission was Captain Asuncion Gaitan, then chief of General Manuel Antonio Noriega's bodyguards. It is unknown whether he was able to obtain these weapons. A short time ago, Roberto Troncoso, head of the Panamanian Human Rights Committee (CPDH), warned about the possibility of death squads operating in Panama. On that occasion, the authorities denied they had reports on this and urged the CPDH to provide any information in this regard.
