When discussing the "government work report," Tibet's deputies to the National People's Congress [NPC] cited a series of figures familiarly. The region's gross domestic product amounted to more than 3.2 billion yuan, a growth of 9.6 percent over the previous year. The region reaped bumper agricultural harvests for six consecutive years, with a record 1993 grain harvest of 620,000 tonnes. Rural enterprises turned out more than 100 million yuan worth of products, up 14.9 percent over 1992. Export trade volume surpassed $100 million, up 55.4 percent. The per capita income of farmers and herdsmen was 30 yuan more than in the previous year...[ellipses as received] These figures clearly record the track of Tibet's development, showing the solid steps taken in the advance toward modernization. Some deputies said: Modern industry was nonexistent in old Tibet. Today, it boasts a dozen industries, ranging from electric power, coal, and chemicals to machinery. Its power generating capacity has exceeded 170,000 kw. On the daily-improving infrastructure of the region, Deputy Gyainzim talked about the first day Medog county gained access to a highway, as well as the progress of highway construction in Tibet as a whole. According to him, a highway network now covers all the 74 cities, prefectures, and counties in Tibet. A communications network embracing wireless, wire, air control, and satellite communications with Lhasa as its center has begun to take shape. Satellite ground stations have been built in most areas. International program-controlled telephone switches connected with the world network are now available to some counties and cities. As a result, it is no longer a pipe dream for peasants and herdsmen in out-lying areas to watch television. A number of airports, including the Gonggar International Airport and the Bangda Airport, are either under construction or have been completed and put into operation. With the steady increase of grain output, the long history of food shortages in Tibet has come to an end. At present, the percentage of marketable agricultural and animal husbandry products has exceeded 23 percent. The clothing, food, housing, and transportation conditions of the more than two million people in Tibet have improved remarkably. Television sets, washing machines, stereo equipment, and other durable consumer goods can be found in ordinary peasant and herdsmens' homes. Some are even able to afford cellular phones. Urban residents here are as well-dressed as those in the interior and coastal regions. Tibet's educational facilities have been built from scratch. There are now more than 3,000 schools of various categories in the region. Medical care facilities are available in all peasants' and herdsmen's settlements [dian 7820]. There are 30 cultural organizations in the region. Scientists in Tibet have scored more than 1,000 scientific research achievements, of which 288 have won national or autonomous regional awards. Last year the region received 23,000 tourists from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and foreign countries, and earned $9 million in foreign exchange from tourism. According to the deputies, reform and development have benefited the two million people in Tibet. Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the autonomous region said: Tibet's progress today is completely due to the great support given by the party, government, and people of all nationalities across the country, as well as reform and opening up. It is also inseparable from the hard work done by the united people of all nationalities in Tibet. The deputies said: The huge state investment and vigorous support provided by other parts of the country have added vitality to Tibet's economic development. Reform and opening up have enabled Tibet to free itself from a closed status, and become a channel for China's export goods and technology to the South Asia subcontinent. Under the new situation in which the establishment of a socialist market economic structure is being accelerated, Tibet is seeking greater development. By 1997, Tibet's gross domestic product and regional income are expected to reach 4.8 billion yuan and 3.68 billion yuan, respectively. Development is the last word. Deputy Pingcuo said: "Only development means maximum human rights. Only when Tibet achieves development can its stability have a reliable foundation."
