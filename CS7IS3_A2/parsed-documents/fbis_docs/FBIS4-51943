Kakizawa, at a news conference after his assumption of office, expressed positive attitude toward constitutional debates to formulate emergency legislative arrangements and approve collective self-defense rights. Yamagishi harshly said: "This is a very serious problem that a man, who had been a member of the Liberal Democratic Party only 10 days before, became the foreign minister of the coalition administration, and made irresponsible remarks. He should be blamed." He said that this issue should be discussed at the Budget Committee. In addition, he noted: "The security issue can be a reason for presenting the no-confidence motion against the cabinet. There is a great possibility that this issue will result in the dissolution of the House of Representatives." Moreover, touching on the policy agreement reached among the coalition parties, including the Social Democratic Party of Japan, Yamagishi pointed out: "The agreement does not say that the coalition parties should positively discuss this issue. Unless he approves the agreement, it is impossible for him to join the coalition." With regard to the dissolution of the lower house to conduct a general election, he predicted that, "at the earliest, it will be conducted after the summit talks in early July." He further said: "It is most desirable to carry out the election under the new election system. However, if it is physically impossible, there will be no choice but to conduct the election under the present system."
