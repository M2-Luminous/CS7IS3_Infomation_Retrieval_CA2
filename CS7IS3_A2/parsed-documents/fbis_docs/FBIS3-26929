A series of regulatory and control measures has been implemented, and grain prices have now stabilized. But what does this unanticipated round of grain price fluctuations mean? What lessons and experiences can we learn from the situation? People have not stopped pondering these questions since the grain prices stopped fluctuating. The Problems Exposed by the Grain Price Fluctuations Last year, after restrictions on grain prices were lifted in the country, the peasants, who had experienced "difficulties in selling grain" for years, hoped that grain prices would increase but also feared that they could not be able to sell their grain. When the summer grain purchasing season arrived, the advantages to peasants brought about by the lifting of restrictions on grain prices and by the provision of many channels for purchasing grain became immediately apparent and peasants no longer worried about grain selling difficulties. Under these conditions, many peasants compared the prices offered by several purchasers and sold their grain to the one who offered the highest price. Particularly after the early crop witnessed a drop in output, the peasants became more reluctant to sell their grain at low prices. In this way, state-owned grain enterprises experienced "difficulties in purchasing grain," and this to some extent led to the illusion of a grain shortage. State-owned grain enterprises contributed to the problem because they failed to adapt to the new situation when the restrictions on the grain market were lifted, and the number of loss-makers among them increased dramatically. The situation was exacerbated by the fact that many local governments cut financial subsidies to grain enterprises, and, therefore, grain enterprises also hoped to see an increase in grain prices in the market. In addition, because the areas under grain cultivation in the coastal region in south China have decreased substantially, the market areas in the coastal region have approached the producing areas in central China to purchase grain and are competing with the grain-purchasing departments there, leading to an upsurge of prices in the grain market. Experts pointed out that, following the lifting of the restrictions on the grain market, a moderate increase in grain prices is understandable and is also good for the development of grain production. In a bumper harvest year and during the autumn grain purchasing season, however, it is abnormal to see a great increase in grain prices, which even skyrocketed in some localities. The state has decided to increase the purchase price of grain this year, and a sharp increases in grain prices would be very unfavorable to stabilizing prices throughout the country. If the government still does not come out to intervene in the market at this time, the interests of the consumers will be badly harmed, and social stability and the overall situation of deepening reform will be affected. When we reflect on the situation, the main motive forces behind thoroughly lifting the restrictions on the grain market last year were: Lifting the restrictions on selling prices in cities, changing the situation whereby purchasing prices were higher than selling prices, reducing the government's financial burden, and, through developing the market's role in regulating production, to arouse the peasants' enthusiasm for producing grain and increase grain supply for all of society. This original plan of "killing two birds with one stone" was not wrong. The problem was that, after the restrictions on the grain market were lifted, we failed to respond to the situation by quickly building a new protection system ensuring stability in grain supply and demand. State-owned grain enterprises have been slow in changing their operational mechanisms, and they have been facing operational difficulties since the lifting of restrictions on the market. In many cities, the business volume of state-owned grain enterprises accounts for only one-third of grain supply in society. In the rural areas, being restrained by the system and certain policies, state-owned grain-purchasing departments also cannot compete with other grain purchasers who are operating within other channels. Following the lifting of restrictions on the grain market, this stripped the government of a "handle" on macro regulation and control. On the government side, for various reasons, the money originally used as subsidies could not be transformed into risk funds as people have expected, and, therefore, some administrative means have been taken unavoidably. Speaking in a certain sense, the price fluctuations in the grain market during a bumper harvest year have revealed the shortcomings of the grain market system and have pointed out the direction in which the reform of grain system should be deepened further. "Cheap Grain Hurts the Peasants" and "Expensive Rice Hurts the People" What is noteworthy is that, within the government's regulation and control of the grain market, handling relations between the producers and the consumers is the most difficult problem. "Cheap grain hurts the peasants," and this has been known to the people since ancient times. Throughout the history of China we can see the authorities resorting to a regulatory method in which they buy rice when its market price is too low and sell rice when its price has increased. We are currently reforming the centralized system for purchasing and selling grain and are marketizing grain production and operation. One of the major reasons for doing this is to increase returns from grain production and operation through the establishment of a new system in order to arouse the peasants' enthusiasm for production. Generally speaking, at a time when the market is regulating the economy, production elements will usually flow toward the sectors which have high profit rates, whereas grain production has a relatively low profit, and grain supply can be ensured only when certain protection is given to the producers. Grain is not an ordinary commodity, and changes in the relations between supply and demand have a direct bearing on social stability; as the most basic necessity of life, grain is a strategic commodity which ensures the country's security. Therefore, even in developed countries, grain production and operation is not purely marketized. To a big country such as ours -- which has 1.1 billion people, 200 million peasant households, and a comparatively weak agricultural production foundation -- the degree of difficulty in marketization of grain production and operation will be even greater. Experts maintain that the government's regulation and control over grain, which is a special commodity, is difficult because it cannot just "take care of one aspect." When grain prices in the market are low and "cheap grain hurts the peasants," it will eventually lead to inadequate production and a rapid increase in grain prices; when grain prices in the market are too high and are breaking the consumers' backbones, not only will there be a cobweb effect in the market and social instability, but the sharp increase and decrease will distort market signals, lead to an unbalanced agricultural production structure, create new "difficulties in selling grain," and eventually bring disadvantages to producers. Therefore, after restrictions have been lifted from the grain market, we must build a forceful, authoritative, and keenly responsive system as quickly as possible to exercise macroregulation and control over the market, and to carry out flexible regulation at any time depending on fluctuations of grain prices in the market; this is the correct way to properly handle the relations among producers, operators, and consumers on the premise of protecting the peasants' enthusiasm for growing grain. The Market Calls for a New Regulatory and Control System After analyzing the fluctuations of grain prices this time and the experience of the 15 years of reform, economists have pointed out that, in a big country such as China, in order to ensure the stability of the grain market, the government must build a regulatory and control system which is forceful, authoritative, and responsive to changes in the market situation. In particular, attention must be paid to properly protecting the interests of producers. Because, from a long-term perspective, the shortage of grain supply will be the main contradiction; in the short term, relative and regional surpluses will be a secondary contradiction. In concrete terms, in the areas of grain purchasing, grain selling, and market regulation and control, the government must build a whole set of systems which adapt to the new situation and are in line with the country's conditions. Experts have pointed out that, following the lifting of restrictions on the market, the government's purchasing behavior -- how much it purchases and at what price -- will have a direct impact on the economic behavior and economic interests of the main body of the market. Therefore, the government will still be the most crucial factor contributing to market stability. Whereas the building of a reserve system is the core of the building of a grain system as well as an important means by which the government can regulate, control, and intervene in the market. A complete state grain reserve system should at least include the following aspects: A price protection system, a grain risk fund system, a grain reserve system participating in international grain trade system, and a system of targeted subsidies. The price protection system is the government's most important tool for protecting peasants and regulating the interests of various quarters of the market. After the lifting of restrictions on the market, there will be fluctuations in the market every year, and the government's duty is to buy the peasants' grain at protected prices when market prices are too low to protect the interest of the producers; when market prices are too high, the government will release to the market grain that was purchased at protected prices, to check the upsurge of grain prices and protect the interest of the consumers. The price protection system must be supported by the grain risk fund system. The size of the fund determines the government's ability to give protection. Furthermore, the system of macro regulation and control over grain must have the right to participate in the international grain trade. With such a right, when the country has bumper harvests for several consecutive years, the reserve system can resort to export as a form of regulation in order to solve the difficulties in purchasing and storing grain, and vice versa. An understanding of the international market can be seen as a necessary condition which must be acquired by an open macroregulation and control system. A system of targeted subsidies should also be considered while we are building a new system. Under the system of state monopoly for the purchase and sale of grain, what our country has implemented is a policy of subsidizing the whole people. At present, within the wages of each and every urban worker there is nearly 20 yuan in food subsidies. When the income gap among urban residents widens, there will be no need for the government to continue subsidizing the portion of population which earns a lot of money; it should, however, concentrate its financial strength on subsidizing the low-income population. Experts maintain that effective procedures to implement this idea should be formulated, such as opening some state grain shops selling ordinary government-subsidized food at low prices, to ensure that "people are fed but not with quality food." Separation of Government and Enterprises After the lifting of the restrictions on the market, another urgent reform is to change operational mechanisms within state-owned grain enterprises and establish a new system in which a policy-based grain regulation and control system coexists with an enterprise-like grain operation system. At present, state-owned grain enterprises have their own economic interests, but at the same time they perform a regulatory function of a policy nature. The consequence is that, during actual practice, it is easy to have contradictions between enterprise behavior and government behavior, to the extent that government regulation and control cannot be really implemented, or even that market contradictions are intensified. This point has become very clear during the several rounds of fluctuations in the grain market over the past 15 years of reform. Therefore, economists maintain that the crucial link in the new system is to solve the problem of mingling government and enterprises in state-owned grain departments, that is, to separate grain of a policy nature from grain of an operational nature, so that at the same time when state-owned grain enterprises truly walk toward the market, the government acquires a means of macro regulation and control which can discharge government functions and duties independently. After the lifting of restrictions on the market, another big thing the government must do is to establish a number of regional grain wholesale markets and a series of corresponding market regulations to enable the flow of grain to have a channel through which the state can conveniently exercise control. At present, our country has already established a large number of grain wholesale markets, as well as several futures markets. But a market order has not been formed, and there are enthusiastic transactions outside the market and unenthusiastic transactions within the market. According to experts, the state should stipulate that interprovincial grain regulation should be traded in the large-scale wholesale markets established by the state. Only in this way can we form a new pattern in which the state regulates and controls the market, the market guides enterprises in operation as well as guiding the flow of grain of producers. A special policy must be adopted for a special commodity and a special market. This is an enlightenment with profound contents which has been left to the people by this round of grain price fluctuations.
