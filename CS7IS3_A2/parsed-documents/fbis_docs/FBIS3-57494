I simply did not accept the invitation to join the reorganized Cabinet. I did not submit a resignation, but I refused to accept the invitation. The president repeated his offer to me once again. I cited the same arguments, saying that when policies are being changed, policies which were repeatedly spelled out in government documents...[pauses] We were aiming for 60-80 percent annual inflation at the end of the year. But now they are proposing 300 percent. This is a change of policy. So, I cannot participate in this. If people who are manifestly opposed to the government, opposed to the policy which we pursued in 1993 -- a policy which produced substantial results -- are brought into the government, this is the premier's and the president's prerogative. But they tell me that there is no reason to remove Gerashchenko, for instance. This means that he is right and I am wrong. So, my choice is a very simple one. I respect the premier's choice in forming the government. He is entitled to choose the government he wants. But, as a free man, I am also entitled to determine my own place in this structure.
