He added that Jordan realizes the magnitude of plotting against the Arab and Islamic nation, which calls for activating the nation's capabilities in the face of foreign challenges. Hammad further said that the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq and its unyielding people has lost all its justifications after Iraq has complied with all international resolutions imposed unfairly on it. Salamah Hammad visited the holy shrines in al-Hadrah al-Qadiriyah, al-Imam al-'Azam, al-Rawdah al-Kazimiyah, and the Royal Cemetery in Baghdad. The custodians of the religious shrines informed the guest minister of President Saddam Husayn's concern for the holy shrines and places of worship. Salamah Hammad also laid a wreath on the Martyr's Memorial and read verses from the Koran for the souls of the martyrs. He then visited the gallery that contains martyr medals. He wrote in the visitor's book, praising the brave position of the Iraqi martyrs and their generous sacrifices to defend the soil of Iraq and the glorious Arab nation.
