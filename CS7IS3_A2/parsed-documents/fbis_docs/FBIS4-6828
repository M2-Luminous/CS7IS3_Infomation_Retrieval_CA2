A Ministry official said on Friday that there were no talks at all on the possible purchase of Apache helicopters, Patriot missiles and other high-tech weapons from the United States during the recent visit to Seoul by U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry. THE WALL STREET JOURNAL of the United States reported that during Perry's visit to Seoul, South Korea agreed to buy a host of American-made high-tech weapons. "Apart from Perry's visit, we had partially modified the Yulgok arms procurement program in a way that places a more emphasis on building up our anti-artillery and night-time battle ability," the official said.
