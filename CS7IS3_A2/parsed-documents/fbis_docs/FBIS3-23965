Over the past week, the increase in prices for nonfood goods was equal to 2.4 percent. Foodstuffs and paid public services became more expensive over the week by 1.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. The difference in the price increase rates for basic consumer goods and paid public services for Russia's individual economic regions was insignificant. In Moscow and St. Petersburg, the increase in prices for goods and services was higher than the national average increase and amounted respectively to 2.5 percent and 2.6 percent. In Moscow, the prices for nonfood goods increased most of all -- by 3.1 percent, while, in St. Petersburg, paid public services became more expensive by 4.5 percent. Only Vodka Is Becoming Cheaper Basic food products over the past week became more expensive by 1.6 percent. Prices rose most of all for vegetables -- by 4.4 percent, for groats and pasta items -- by 3.5 percent and for dairy products -- by 3.4 percent. The prices for vegetable oil and sugar hardly changed at all. Over the week, vodka became cheaper on the average by 1 percent. At the municipal and unofficial markets, the prices for meat and fish products, butter, eggs, sugar, flour, and salt remained unchanged. Table 1.

Food products became more expensive in the Northern Caucasus region than anywhere else. Here, vegetables and fruits were 10 percent higher than a week ago, butter was 5 percent higher and dairy products, pasta items and some types of canned goods were 3-4 percent higher. Prices for foodstuffs in the Eastern Siberian region remained practically unchanged in comparison with the preceding week. The average cost of a basket of the 19 most important food products on 22 February amounted to 40,500 rubles [R] calculated on a monthly basis and rose over the week by 1.6 percent and, since the beginning of the year, by 32.8 percent. The cost of this basket, based on organized trade prices, was equal to R39,200 and, based on unorganized trade prices, to R54,300. Average Cost of a Basket of the The disparity between the maximum and minimum costs for a basket in different Russian cities amounted to a factor of 3.4 (in the previous week, it was a factor of 3.9). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

The most "inexpensive" region in basket cost in the past week was the Central Chernozem region -- R21,600, while the most "costly" was, as before, the Far East region (R70,200). Among the surveyed Russian cities, a substantial increase in the cost of a basket was noted in the cities of Tatarstan (Kazan, Chistopol and Naberezhnyye Chelny), where, over the week, milk and sour cream became more expensive by a factor of 1.4-1.6, while rye-wheat bread, wheat bread from grade I and II flour and potatoes increased by a factor of 1.3-1.4. The cost of a basket of the 19 most important food products in Moscow and St. Petersburg amounted to R45,300 and R41,800 and increased over the week by 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. On the list of surveyed cities, Moscow, just like a week ago, occupied the 30th position, while St. Petersburg moved from the 49th position to the 51st position. Fabrics, Powders and Wallpaper Are Becoming More Expensive Nonfood products became more expensive by 2.4 percent. Over the past week, just as over the 2 preceding weeks, the greatest price increases were for fuel -- by 9 percent, and for medicine -- by 8 percent. Fabrics, synthetic detergents and wallpaper became 4-5 percent more expensive over the week. The prices for footwear changed less than those for other nonfood products (just like a week ago -- by 1 percent). The increase in prices for non-food products amounted in nearly all economic regions to 2-3 percent. And only for the inhabitants of the Eastern Siberian region, where fabrics, fuel and medicine became 12-15 percent more expensive, did they increase overall by 4 percent. The disparity between the minimum and maximum price levels for individual goods is not shrinking. So, for example, in the surveyed Russian cities, the differences in the cost of footwear in February amounted to a factor of 6-8. Whereas one pair of men's good-quality shoes cost R11,000-14,000 in Novocheboksarsk, Cheboksary and Shebekino at the end of February, their price exceeded R90,000 in Groznyy.
