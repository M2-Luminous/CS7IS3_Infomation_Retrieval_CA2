Responding to a question from correspondents yesterday, the government spokesman said the ambassadors who received the president's document on 20 December as well as the UN officials who received it three days earlier had commented favorably but so far there has been neither a written reply nor any public statement by the recipients that would even imply support for the Kliridhis proposal. The only official position adopted in the meantime was the Russian Foreign Ministry statement that called upon the parties to cooperate for the implementation of the confidence-building measures. Political circles interpreted this statement as advice for the Cyprus Government to put aside the idea of demilitarization and focus its attention on the realization of the confidence-building measures. The same sources also pointed out that this is the approach being proposed by all the Security Council members. The issue was raised yesterday to government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis, who confirmed that the president would be sending messages to the leaders of the NATO member countries concerning his suggestion for the demilitarization of Cyprus. The messages will be sent on the occasion of the alliance's summit which will be held on 10 January in Brussels and the Cyprus issue will be discussed on the summit's sidelines. It has already been announced that President Bill Clinton and UK Prime Minister John Major will raise the Cyprus issue at their private meetings with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. It should be noted that three leading NATO countries--the United States, Britain, and France--are also permanent Security Council members and received the Kliridhis suggestion 15 days ago. However, no letter will be sent to Mrs. Ciller because, as Mr. Kasoulidhis explained, Cyprus does not maintain diplomatic relations with Turkey. The spokesman was also asked whether the government has considered, provided it accepts them, the ways suggested by the two groups of experts for the implementation of the confidence-building measures or whether it is prepared to discuss them. His response was: "We cannot regard the documents submitted by the experts as being official or binding on us because the experts' report does not deal only with the technoeconomic questions, which fall under their jurisdiction, but also tackles political arrangements concerning the implementation of the confidence- building measures and will be the subject of negotiations if the Turkish side also accepts in principle the three documents. Official documents are the three documents that have been proposed by the UN Secretary General." [passage omitted]
