Russia made an official proposal for a meeting between President Boris Yeltsin and President Lennart Meri last autumn. The summit was then expected to take place in November or December. Olljum reiterated that the meeting between the presidents can take place only after the principal issues of the Estonian-Russian relations have been resolved. He had in mind in the first place the setting of the final deadline for the Russian troop withdrawal. "From the first, we were not sure the summit could soon take place," Olljum told BNS. "It was primarily Russia's statement that sparked interest in the press." Olljum voiced hope that the troop withdrawal deadline -- Aug. 31 -- proposed by Russia will be officially confirmed at the upcoming meeting between the Russian and the Estonian delegations next week. Estonia agreed to the deadline in principle but will not accept any strings. When Russia for the first time suggested the August deadline last autumn, it made a number of stipulations concerning "social protection" of Russians residing in Estonia, money for housing construction, and other issues. Olljum expressed the opinion this was a "propagandistic step."
