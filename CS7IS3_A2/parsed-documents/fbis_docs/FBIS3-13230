He described the Russian initiative to hold a new international conference as worthy of consideration. Qaddumi said the PLO made many concessions to the U.S. Administration after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre to encourage the United States to approve a draft resolution condemning Israel. But Clinton's administration rejected the draft, threatening to veto it. We asked Qaddumi first about the PLO reaction to the U.S. lack of neutrality: [Begin recording] [Qaddumi] We were surprised to see the United States postponing this draft resolution. Mr. Dennis Ross contacted us to say that it was necessary to hold negotiations with Peres or one of the brothers and that if we agreed to these negotiations they would approve the draft resolution. We refused. Mr. Ross contacted us again to threaten that the United States would veto the resolution. We said: If, as a major state responsible for peace and security in the region, you want to tamper with peace then this is your own business, but we cannot drop Jerusalem from that draft. Therefore, Jerusalem will stay. We have to see practical measures, not only a decision to approve this draft; we have to see action taken to reassure our people that some measures have been taken, either by the United Nations or the conference sponsors. [Qabalan] What is your reaction to the Russian suggestion to hold an international conference similar to the Madrid summit, and what are the prospects for success? [Qaddumi] In fact, I believe that the Russian suggestion is worthy of consideration. There must be an international conference to assess what was achieved in the past; to determine who disturbs the climate of peace, who commits acts that violate the stipulations of the agreement completely, who obstructs this agreement, who fails to show commitment to the agreement, who deports and kills the citizens, who spoils everything, and who is the cause of all that tension. It is Israel. Who is backing Israel? It is the United States of America. It is necessary to make an international assessment of this march so that we can determine who is responsible for obstructing this peaceful march. It is Israel, with U.S. backing. [end recording]
