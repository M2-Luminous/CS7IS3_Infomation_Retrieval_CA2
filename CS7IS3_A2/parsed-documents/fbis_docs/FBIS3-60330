Environmental demands were met several years ahead of time, something that had earlier been regarded as unrealistic by the industry. Deformed Fish Emissions from long-lived organic chlorine compounds--including the very unfortunate dioxin--was one of the major environmental issues of the 1980's. The most extreme sign of it was malformed, sometimes sterile, fish in the waters around pulp plants--where emission of bleaching agents was and is the largest source of pollution. But, there was also uneasiness concerning the more long-term accumulation of chlorine compounds on the sea floor, and in animals and people. Society registered its concern--the government through tough environmental measures, consumers through boycotting chlorine-bleached diapers, coffee filters, and writing paper. Environmental correctness became a factor in competitiveness. In 1988, the Riksdag set the goal of cutting emissions in half, corresponding to 1.8 kilograms of organically bound chlorine (measured by the so-called AOX [expansion unknown] method) per ton of pulp production. The effort to reach this level was to begin no later than 1992. The industry wanted more lenient standards and a longer time to fulfill them. Alternative Chemicals The reality was quite different, all the environmental goals were exceeded. The industrial average for 1992, according to the most recent report from the Swedish Environmental Agency, was approximately 0.6 kilograms AOX per ton of pulp, a reduction of 80 percent in four years. "Yes, you are correct, it progressed very quickly--through rapid technical advancement and conversion to other bleaching chemicals. Above all, in the case of the most dangerous, long-lived compounds, including dioxin," said Erik Nystrom of the Swedish Environmental Agency. The reason is due primarily to the fact that the old chlorine gas is no longer used as a bleaching agent. It has been replaced principally by chlorine dioxide, but also by chlorine-free alternatives such as hydrogen peroxide and ozone. Deformed pike are no longer to be found. The political objective now is to reach levels by the year 2000 at which "the environment is not harmed at all." Closed Systems Are we perhaps already there? "We don't know. There are those who believe that even today's chlorine content causes harm, if somewhat more diffuse, but there are also those who think the opposite. Even completely chlorine-free bleaching can cause certain problems, but we do not have sufficient knowledge," said Nystrom. He feels that other emissions--metals, nutritive salts, lignin, resin acids--are now receiving greater emphasis and point to the next step, the "closed factory." Runoff water is returned to the factory and waste products can be readily controlled. This also saves energy. "In three or four years, there is sure to be a number of factories with closed systems. It can be done with chlorine dioxide, but is technically simpler with ozone. Furthermore, the market is demanding ever more chlorine-free paper," said Nystrom.
