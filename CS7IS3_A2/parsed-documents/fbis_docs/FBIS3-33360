In the recent past, even high-level government sources from the Prosecutor General's Office itself have described in detail to this magazine discrepancies of this sort with the government regarding the case of the Cali cartel. In addition, the week before last this disagreement was confirmed once again to SEMANA by a high-level source from President Gaviria's cabinet. With respect to the reports on differences between the Colombian Prosecutor General and his counterpart in the United States, these reports have been confirmed both by sources in the U.S. Government and by Colombian cabinet ministers. Thus, Mr. Prosecutor General, it is not a question of either inventions, or feverish imaginations, or irresponsible journalism.
