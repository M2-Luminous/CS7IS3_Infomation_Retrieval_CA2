FR940112-0-00094 FR940112-0-00021 Comment: One State pointed out that it is reasonable to require that States deduct insurance premiums, as this encourages individuals to continue insurance coverage. The commenter argued that it is not logical, however, for us to require that States deduct coinsurance and deductibles on services that are not covered under the plan. An individual still benefits from the insurance coverage because he or she must pay only the deductible or coinsurance rather than 100 percent of the charge. Response: As we explained in the response to the first comment in this section, Congress passed legislation on the post-eligibility process requiring the deduction of expenses for deductibles and coinsurance in the post-eligibility process. It would be inconsistent with the direction taken by Congress to allow States to exclude these expenses in the spenddown process altogether. Therefore, States are required to deduct a reasonable amount of these expenses from income. We rely on the authority in section 1902(a)(17) of the Act to allow States to place reasonable limits on the deductible amounts of these cost-sharing expenses even though no such limits are allowable in the post eligibility process. IV. Summary of Changes to the Regulations In this final rule, we are making the revisions proposed in the NPRM with the following modifications based on our review and analysis of public comments. 1. We are revising proposed §§435.831(e)(1) (designated as §435.831(g)(1) in this final rule) and §436.831(e)(1) (designated as §436.831(g)(1) in this final rule) to clarify that incurred medical expenses may include projected institutional expenses at the Medicaid reimbursement rate. We are not revising §435.732(c)(3) (redesignated as §435.121(f)(1)(iii)) to make the same clarification since that section applies to States with more restrictive criteria than SSI. 2. We are also clarifying in §§435.831(i) and 436.831(i) (proposed §§435.831(e)(1) and 436.831(e)(1)) that an institutionalized individual is eligible when incurred medical expenses, including projected institutional expenses, reduce an individual's income to the income standard, rather than on the first day of institutionalization as indicated in the NPRM. 3. We are revising §§435.831(a) and 436.831(a) to clarify that an agency is not limited to the use of a single budget period to compute income. However, an agency must use budget periods of not more than 6 months to compute income. 4. In addition to other changes noted, we are revising paragraph (d) as proposed in §§435.831 and 436.831 by transferring most of its contents to new paragraphs (e), (f) and (g) and cross-referring to those sections. a. New paragraph (e) in both sections includes the contents of paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A), (B), and (C) as paragraphs (e)(1), (2), and (3) respectively. b. New paragraph (f)(3) in both sections consists of the contents of proposed paragraph (d)(6). c. New paragraph (h) in both sections consists of the contents of paragraph (d)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) as paragraphs (h)(2), (1), and (3), respectively. d. New paragraphs (g)(1), (2) and (3) in both sections contain the contents of paragraphs (d)(4), (5), and (3), respectively. 5. We are revising §§435.831(d)(5) and 436.831(d)(5) (redesignated as §§435.831(g)(2) and 436.831(g)(2)) to specify that an agency is not required to deduct expenses incurred earlier than 3 months before the month of application for Medicaid, clarifying that the 3-month period is measured from the month of application, rather than from the date of application as specified in the NPRM.
