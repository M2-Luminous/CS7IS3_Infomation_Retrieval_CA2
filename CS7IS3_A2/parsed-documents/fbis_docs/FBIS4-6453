FBIS4-6453 "dreas077_m_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-077 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 Thailand Chuan Calls AFP Reportage `Danger' to Nation Chuan Calls AFP Reportage `Danger' to Nation BK2104045994 Bangkok THE NATION in English 21 Apr 94 p A 4 BK2104045994 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday charged that "inaccurate reports" from the French news agency Agence France Presse (AFP) on the fighting in Cambodia were a "danger" to Thailand. He also warned Thai media which subscribe to the agency to be careful about publishing AFP reports from Phnom Penh, saying they might contain "inaccurate" information. Speaking after attending a meeting of the National Security Council (NSC), Chuan said he had checked with the Thai military and the Cambodian government in Phnom Penh about the fighting around Pailin. The information he received reconfirmed Thailand's neutrality on the conflict, Chuan said, adding that Thailand wants to see peace in Cambodia and did not want to involve itself in the country's affairs. He said Cambodia's accusations of Thai support of the Khmer Rouge were not true. Chuan said the National Security Council has cautioned the Thai media about publishing reports by AFP from Phnom Penh. He said the French news agency has been repeatedly warned that its reports often contained "inaccurate" information which could pose a "danger" to Thailand. Thai media sometimes publish information from AFP without crediting the source and include it in news reports as if it were fact, thus hurting the country, he said. Phnom Penh leaders have repeatedly accused Thailand of abetting the Khmer Rouge forces in their military offensives against the Cambodian government. Prime Minister Chuan said the National Security Council is considering measures to be taken, as Thailand has never retaliated against accusations by Phnom Penh regarding its losses in the fighting. He said the Thai Foreign Ministry is gathering information and will report to the United Nations. Meanwhile, NSC Chief Gen Charan Kunlawanit has warned Phnom Penh that Thailand's patience is running out on the Cambodian allegations. He said Phnom Penh should communicate with the Thai government directly and not use other people to pass on messages. He said he was surprised that Cambodia did not use the Thai Embassy in Phnom Penh to communicate with the Thai government. "We can communicate through the Thai Embassy in Phnom Penh as we are both sovereign states. I am very surprised that the Cambodian government has never contacted the Thai government through that channel, but always used other people's mouths in sending messages. I can't believe it, because the government of a sovereign state should speak directly to us," said Charan. He said Thailand had always been very patient about events along the Thai-Cambodian border despite the fact that local people and schools were badly affected by the fighting.
