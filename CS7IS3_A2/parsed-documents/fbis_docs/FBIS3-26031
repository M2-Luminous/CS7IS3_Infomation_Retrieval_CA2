The move follows what officials call "a positive participation of China in the world scene" in copyrighting and patenting product and technological innovations. One patent court was established in Haikou, Hainan Province last week. "We'll suggest local governments open such courts at a proper time," said Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi. She said China was better than the world average in protecting intellectual property rights, although improvement is needed. "China is so large a country. We'll kick off nationwide education campaigns to promote public awareness," she said. And patent courts will be an integral part of the campaigns. "If violations are evident, both Chinese and foreigners can appeal to such courts," Wu added. She urged countries like the United States to better understand China's situation, calling it unwise for the US to pressure China on its patent reforms. "The United States doesn't understand what is happening with China," she said in response to a question on possible straining of Sino-US relations over the intellectual property rights issue. China and the US reached a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on January 16,1992 on the protection of intellectual property rights. "China has honoured the MOU since then, a fact even recognized by the US," Wu said. She also pointed to a series of new laws on trademarks, patents and copyrights. According to a Xinhua report, China's trademark law conforms to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, of which China is the 95th member. The report said since signing the Madrid Agreement for the International Registration of Trademarks, about 10,000 foreign trademarks have been protected in China. Moreover, China has signed the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, and the Universal Copyright Convention. In another development, Wu reaffirmed that Sino-British trade could hardly escape damage from "an uncooperative and unfriendly Britain." But she noted the trade increases between the nations last year, which leaped 86 percent to around $3.6 billion. Sino-Russian trade also experienced a boom last year to $7.7 billion, up 31 percent over 1992. Broken down, China's imports from Russia went up 41.4 percent to $4.99 billion, while its exports grew 15 percent to $2.69 billion. Vice Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng said the two neighbours have vast potential for trade development. There were 27,000 Chinese working in Russia's projects last year, with more than 2,000 Chinese enterprises set up there with $82 million in investment.
