FR940919-1-00014 FR940919-1-00005 There are approximately 426 McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 269 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. It would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspections at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the inspections proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $29,590, or $110 per airplane, per inspection cycle. It would take approximately 8 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed replacements at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $9,009 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the replacements proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,541,781, or $9,449 per airplane. Based on the above figures, the total cost impact of the inspections and replacements proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,571,371, or $9,559 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive. Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD. A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this proposed AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this proposed AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that the original cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the proposed actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this proposed AD would be redundant and unnecessary. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: McDonnell Douglas: Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;79&hyph;AD. Applicability: All Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;10F, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, &hyph;30F, &hyph;40, and &hyph;40F series airplanes, and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent undetected cracked or failed attach bolts that may lead to reduced structural integrity of the vertical stabilizer, accomplish the following: (a) Within 12 months after the effective date of this AD, perform an ultrasonic inspection to detect cracking in the attach bolts of the upper vertical stabilizer, in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Service Bulletin 55&hyph;20, Revision 2, dated August 4, 1994, unless accomplished within the last 18 months prior to the effective date of this AD in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Service Bulletin 55&hyph;20, Revision 1, dated March 8, 1991, or Revision 2, dated August 4, 1994.
