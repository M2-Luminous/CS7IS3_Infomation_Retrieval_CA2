"Since parliament has not solved the problem of presidential powers, Kravchuk will appeal to the people," Nikolay Mikhalchenko told INTERFAX on Monday. Earlier Kravchuk said he would not stand for the next term of presidency in the June 26 elections because the future president's powers had not yet been delineated. Last month, parliament passed a law, which would give local councils to be elected on June 26 all executive authority in their respective regions and would dismiss regional presidential envoys. Kravchuk believes the president would then effectively cease to be head of the Executive Branch.
