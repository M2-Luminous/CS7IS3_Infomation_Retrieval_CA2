Yes and not all of them are of any real benefit; many have given way to commerce... But concern about military people essentially forms the basis of the development and consolidation as a market structure of the fund that is located in the capital's Smolenskaya-Sennaya Ploshchad [Square]. But then again, the Fund for the Social Protection of Servicemen President Reserve Major Erast Aleksandrovich Galumov will discuss this in more detail. Erast Aleksandrovich Galumov is a reserve major who was born in 1958. He is a Tbilisi native. He graduated from Tbilisi Higher Artillery Command School in 1979. He served in TransBaykal and was released into the reserve due to reductions in 1990. He is a businessman. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Erast Aleksandrovich, the ritual question is: Is the fund--also a technique for earning money? [Galumov] That is not the main thing. You can earn--more and more rapidly--by not founding a fund for social protection. Moreover, the fund's founders do not have that urgent need--all of them are successful businessmen. Something else is essential. An enormous group of highly qualified, disciplined, experienced people are leaving the army's ranks. Some do not know where to go in the civilian sector, others want to start their own businesses but do not have start-up capital, and still others need organizational and legal assistance... They can find all of that at our fund. Recently, several junior officers, who will be released into the reserve in the near future, visited my office. They have a productive idea that permits them to develop a quite profitable business but they have neither the money nor the experience of "going into business". We are subsidizing them and we are carrying out, speaking military language, organizational and legal support at no charge, without requiring any dividends whatsoever... [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Altruism? Is there a place for that in our market? [Galumov] The issue is not altruism. We know that an enterprise that the fund can help to stand on its feet will certainly begin to cooperate with it. This is not our first day in the market and we have at our disposal commercial experience, a data bank, ties in the world of finance (we are co-founders of the Moscow City Bank), and a network of partners throughout the country... And therefore, as partners, very promising. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] What are the primary directions of the fund's activities? [Galumov] They are varied. There is a broad spectrum of legal services. We are engaged in job placement. During the past year, we helped people find work--in accordance with the skills and requests of the very people who have been released into the reserve--approximately 2,000 people. And the data base continues to be augmented by enterprises' requests for reserve officers whose cadre value is already universally recognized in our labor market. Investments occupy a large place in our plans. The preference is for regional investment programs. For example, right now we are developing an investment program at a defense plant jointly with the Russian Academy of Sciences. Incidentally, the regional direction of our investment programs helps us to create locally, figuratively speaking, "cadre subunits" that can immediately be deployed and ensure rapid realization of larger programs in the regions if necessary. We are aggressively participating in purely scientific projects. And major scientific institutions willingly cooperate with us. Because we are uniting people who have gone through the army school--those who, due to their professionalism, discipline and ability to work under the most complex conditions, are worth so much right now. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] But what socially oriented programs have you already managed to carry out and what's in the plans? [Galumov] In our view, philanthropy must have a precise address. For example, we assumed responsibility for distinctive pension support for some veterans of war and disabled people who have lost the ability to work. We pay 50,000-500,000 rubles per month in addition to the state pension of each one depending on the specific situation. For the time being, we are allocating R5 million per month for this purpose. We recently conducted a discharge sale at military hospitals at reduced prices. (We sold goods at prices that were much lower than the purchase prices)... What's in the plans? Let's put it this way: Let our philanthropic acts become pleasant surprises for everyone. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Erast Aleksandrovich, just how active in the sphere of entrepreneurship are those reserve officers whom you have helped? [Galumov] They are active and this equally applies to Great Patriotic War veterans' social organizations and to junior "reservists". For example, branches of the fund in Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, Chita, Bratsk, and Novosibirsk, that are led by recent cadre officers, are operating with a high return and more than 20 major commercial programs are in the stage of realization today. And, in general, I must tell you that our fund acts, and let's hope, will act henceforth as a center of gravity for former servicemen. We are our own people: Until recently we ate from the same pot, we lived according to the same regulations and according to the same code. We are loyal to it even today, officer's honor. So we understand and trust each other. And perhaps there is no other path--we need to jointly, shoulder to shoulder, resolve all problems. Moreover, how many former military personnel (currently entrepreneurs, frankly speaking), are flailing around in our market, not knowing where to find a place for themselves and becoming easy targets for any criminal. We need to unite; we will be stronger and more confident. This will be required; for the purpose of this unification, the fund is prepared to offer in principle an equal partnership for everything at its disposal: information support, the accumulated experience of entrepreneurship, ties, and resources... The address of the Fund for the Social Protection of Servicemen is: Building 6, No 30, Smolenskaya-Sennaya Ploshchad, Moscow. Contact telephone -- 241-21-71.
