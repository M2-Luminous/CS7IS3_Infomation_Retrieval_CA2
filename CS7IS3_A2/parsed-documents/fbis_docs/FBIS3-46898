The 30-minute meeting at the prime minister's official residence opened with a briefing by a Labor Ministry official on the current employment situation followed by discussion, Hatoyama told a news conference. The official cited some depressing data on the nation's job situation, including recent government reports showing the ratio of job openings to job seekers fell to 0.65 in November, off 0.02 percentage point from October, while the nation's unemployment rate in the month rose 0.1 percentage point to 2.8 percent, the highest since August 1987. The task force comprises the entire cabinet except for the justice minister. Foreign minister and deputy prime minister Tsutomu Hata serves as acting head of the body. Deputy heads of the body are Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, Economic Planning Agency (EPA) Chief Manae Kubota, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi and Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato. At the meeting, Hosokawa instructed the cabinet ministers present to do their utmost to secure employment for the sake of the public's welfare, Hatoyama said. Some participants explained about their respective ministries' and agencies' efforts to tackle the job problems facing the nation, he added. Education Minister Ryoko Akamatsu and Kubota of the EPA spoke of the need to ensure employment of female university graduates. Akamatsu was quoted as saying female university students' dissatisfaction with sexual discrimination should be removed. Hatoyama told reporters that no specific timetable was set for the task force's activities. It is the first government team on employment to be created since 1986 under Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, when the nation was again suffering from the yen's sharp appreciation against the dollar. Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the eight million-member Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), has been seeking the establishment of a government task force on employment to cope with the nation's rapidly worsening job situation.
