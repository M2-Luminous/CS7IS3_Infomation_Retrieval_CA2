Therefore, he added, western countries must be careful about this point when they comment on lifting the immunity of certain deputies in Turkey. Demirel received (Mark Gali), the European Union special envoy and cochairman of the Turkish-European joint parliamentary committee. A statement issued by the Presidential Press Office says Demirel recalled at the meeting that as recently as 1993 the separatist terrorist organization killed 1,800 persons, of whom 1,100 were civilians. The president stressed that no state can allow the foundations of its constitutional order to be destroyed or its country to be divided. He pointed out that the Turkish Grand National Assembly resisted lifting immunities until very recently, but the attitude of some Democracy Party [DEP] deputies toward the recent incidents infuriated the public. That is why, Demirel said, the Assembly had to take certain measures to open the way for the independent judiciary in order to prevent certain deputies from using their legislative immunity as armor. Demirel pointed out that the deputies in question have full means of defense under the guarantee of the Constitution, the protection of the law, and before independent judicial courts. Nobody should doubt the independence of the Turkish courts of justice, the president stressed. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl telephoned President Demirel today, saying that the detention of some deputies has led to a negative campaign against Turkey in Europe. Kohl told Demirel that incorrect information and erroneous reports about the issue are circulating that are tarnishing Turkey's image. Kohl said he has absolutely no intention of interfering in Turkey's internal affairs, and he only wants to express certain ideas as a friend of Turkey and of the president. During the telephone conversation, Demirel told Kohl that certain circles in Europe are trying to portray Turkey as unjustified in many cases where it is justified. Demirel pointed out that the DEP deputies and party leaders were acting as a branch of the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorist organization. We have the documents to prove it, Demirel said, adding that he repeatedly asked the DEP deputies to openly denounce the terrorist acts perpetrated by the PKK. They always refrained from doing that, he added. Demirel recalled the remarks by the DEP leader, who had said that the murder of five NCO cadets in Tuzla, Istanbul, by the PKK was a normal thing and part of a war. The president stated that these remarks infuriated the public, and the Assembly was forced to take the measure it took. He stressed that this measure is nothing but a step to open the way for the judiciary. He also said that the Constitutional Court will soon announce its ruling about the DEP application concerning the lifting of the deputies' immunity. The president stressed during the conversation that nobody should doubt the independence of the judicial bodies in Turkey. The measures taken in Turkey so far, he said, are not and will not be any different from the measures taken or to be taken by any European country against terrorism and separatism.
