Yesterday in the city's Leninskiy Court there occurred the latest session in the suit brought by Vice-Mayor Vladimir Gilgenberg, who contested the appointment of a kray administration employee as the acting mayor. Meanwhile eight local journalists who had spoken out in the mayor's defense requested the United States consulate to grant them political asylum, since they "feared for their life." As KOMMERSANT-DAILY has already written, the scandal began with the procurator's office initiating a criminal case based on instances in which employees of the Vladivostok mayor's office had received bribes, although the fact of the bribes themselves is confirmed only by a certain person offering the bribes, who is named Volkov. Mr. Cherepkov's lawyer, Semen Ulitskiy, reported to a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that the kray administration's reports to the effect that an accusation had been made against the mayor are false, and, consequently, the procurator's office's decree concerning the mayor's removal from his position is illegal. Meanwhile, according to the lawyer, associates of Mr. Cherepkov are currently being barred from entering the city administration building. These include, for example, Vladimir Gilgenberg, the acting mayor during the latter's illness. Gilgenberg himself feels that this is the consequence of his dismissal by order of the acting administration head of Primorskiy Kray, Igor Lebedinets, who was contested by the vice-mayor in Vladivostok's Frunzenskiy Rayon Court. But so far the documents concerning who specifically had dismissed Mr. Gilgenberg have not been presented to the court, and therefore the case is dragging out. The vice-mayor also protested in the Leninskiy Rayon People's Court Lebedinets' order concerning the appointment of kray administration employee Konstantin Tolstoshein as acting mayor of the city. Yesterday there was no court session -- this time the judge was ill. Viktor Cherepkov himself has his own opinion about the reasons for the scandal, and he expressed that opinion in an interview with a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent. According to him, even as early as the mayoral election he was threatened, and told to withdrawn his candidacy. But when he nevertheless became mayor, "dual authority formed" in the city. On one side was the "Pakt" [Pact] grouping of Primorskiy Kray industrialists, who occupied key positions in the kray administration, and on the other side were the "democrats," headed by the mayor. Mr. Cherepkov feels that "Pakt" monopolized the sale of the output produced by the Primorskiy Kray industrial enterprises, which sell their output cheaply to "Pakt," which then resells it at substantially higher prices. The mayor asserts that he began openly to oppose this, and that resulted in the present criminal case. As long ago as late 1993, certain people "began replacing" him with Mr. Volkov (who has accused the mayor of taking bribes). The mayor was warned that he should avoid Volkov, and he met with him in the presence of witnesses, with the conversation being recorded by a video camera. Mr. Cherepkov also reported that the local journalists who had spoken out in his defense are currently experiencing a large amount of pressure on the part of unknown individuals -- for example, Sergey Shakolenko, editor in chief of PRIMORYE newspaper, was beaten up in the street. Therefore Mr. Shakolenko, as well as Anatoliy Lelyakin, editor in chief of BOLSHOY VLADIVOSTOK newspaper; Pavel Kiyevskiy, chief of the Vladivostok administration's television center; Vadim Karyagin, director of the Vladivostok administration's television studio; and four more journalists had asked the United States consulate to grant them political asylum.
