No decision was reached before the lunch break. Three figures were proposed -- 14, 20 and 50 people. A rating vote left only the last two numbers for further debate, but none scored a majority in further voting. Factions, their leaders and numbers are of special concern to the present legislature in which the Liberal Democratic Party can command the largest single group of deputies and thus have a decisive say in voting. Before the break the Duma elected members of the commission charged with seeing to it that the electronic system used in registering and displaying voting results function effectively, and two other commissions. The deputies also elected a provisional secretariat of the State Duma.
