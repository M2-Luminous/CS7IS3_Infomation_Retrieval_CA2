Do They Really Face Destruction or Neglect?"] [Text] "Live at home, and your home will not collapse." These words of the poet about something simple and vital painfully affecting everyone who has seen the senseless destruction are, unfortunately, valid not just for wars and conflicts. When the Russian Army went into action and began abandoning the familiar garrisons abroad, and all of us sighed as we calculated the property losses, it could not have occurred to anyone that we would squander far more in our own fatherland. And when, with the reduction of the Armed Forces in Russia, military posts began to be vacated, it turned out that there was actually no one in charge of them.... "A military unit was deployed in Krasnoglinskiy Rayon in the city of Samara," V. Ageychenko, chairman of the rayon committee of the Alliance for the Social Protection of Pensioners, wrote to the editors. "It occupied two 100-apartment buildings, a messhall and other premises. The unit left in the spring of 1993, however. The buildings stand there without windows, floors or doors and continue to deteriorate. We went everywhere: to the police, the procurator's office, the city administration.... There is no one to be found to look after the post. No one is doing anything; everyone is blaming everyone else.... Unfortunately, such letters are not isolated entities in our mail. Even though alarm signals are coming in from various areas of the nation, from the Transbaykal to the Moscow region, they do not provide a complete picture of the scale of what is happening. The list of military posts vacated in 1993-1994 within the Russian Federation's Ministry of Defense is extremely vast. It was compiled by Russia's State Committee for Property and the Central Directorate of Material Resources of the Russian Federation's Ministry of Defense in October of last year and includes 312 posts. This means hundreds of apartment buildings, clubs, barracks, messhalls, storage facilities, garages, parking lots and filling stations--property with a value of billions of rubles. And the number of posts whose fate has been decided can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Why has this happened? Is there actually no one who would like to acquire all of this property? Or is the possibility of rectifying the financial affairs of the Ministry of Defense, which, quite frankly, did not receive very much in the privatization process, not obvious? There are more than enough good intentions, but the hitch lies in the fact that all of the ukases, decrees and directives issued up to this point have not provided a precisely defined system for utilizing or selling the military's real property. The military posts are federal property, and the Ministry of Defense must coordinate their sale with the State Committee for Property. According to Russia's Land Code, however, the land on which they are located belongs to local government agencies. And the latter say that if you want to sell your buildings, dismantle them and take them wherever you see fit. While such debate is going on, "popular privatization" is underway on the sly. The people are starting to remove everything they can. They ask why the property should go to waste, all the more since there is no one to guard it. This is a slight exaggeration, but the fact remains that missiles have been dismantled and local aficionados have gradually not just removed refrigeration and other equipment of any value but have used tolite to blow up things which could not be dismantled.... A more detailed inventory of vacated military posts was recently conducted in the Ministry of Defense. They were all broken down into groups, to each of which a special approach will be taken. The most "prestigious" are the posts which it is planned to auction off. Those which cannot be sold will be transferred to the pool of local authorities or written off entirely as an expense. Instructions for selling the posts and some initial experience already exist. There is just no confidence that the Ministry of Defense will earn a great deal. Even the state in general has not become any richer from this area of revenue. Furthermore, anyone attracted to the military property must provide firm guarantees, and these are presently stuck in a vicious circle of the State Committee for Property, the Ministry of Defense and local authorities. Many specialists agree that the only rational route, given the present legal regulation of the land issue, is to lease out the military posts. And it would be the fair thing to give priority as lessees to reserve officers, whose privatization interests have not yet been taken fully into account. The military posts could be turned into enterprises where reserve officers and their wives could work. Their retraining could be organized directly for the kind of production engaged in by the enterprise. The leased facilities and land would remain within the Ministry of Defense and provide profits for solving the social problems of military personnel. One specific project for deciding the future of the military posts in this way has been worked out by the Independent Trade Union of Military Personnel and submitted to the government. It calls for setting up an auction association, one of whose founders would be the Ministry of Defense. The plan is meeting with support from commercial structures. Specifically, Tveruniversalbank is prepared to finance it. The Russian Business Center for Reserve Servicemen set up under the Independent Trade Union of Military Personnel is already working out the technical feasibility for building motor-vehicle service centers out of two large garrisons on the Moscow-St. Petersburg and Moscow-Smolensk routes. It is planned to locate a Moscow area center near Golitsyno-2, one of the main basing sites for military space personnel, which already has some experience in the retraining and job placement of reserve officers. There are other options as well: for example, selling the posts together with the land. In any case drastic steps must be taken so that the inheritance of the armed forces, created by the labor of more than just a single generation, is not thrown to the wind or sold for next to nothing to those who are totally unconcerned about the military problems or the fate of the former servicemen.
