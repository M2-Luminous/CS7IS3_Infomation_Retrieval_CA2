Thus, several reasons could be found why the dollar should gain rather than lose in value, at least against the German mark. Purchasing power and the upswing of the U.S. economy are just two of them. But the reality is different. The dollar is preparing for a downward move. Why do the relevant economic comparisons at best serve as counterindicators of the exchange rate forecast? Why is the German mark gaining against almost all currencies -- except for the Swiss franc and the yen -- without leaving any corresponding traces on the German share and bond markets? Since the spring of 1994 at the latest, a new, technical, code of conduct has established itself in the foreign exchange markets. Inspired by the then successful concerted interventions of the central banks, an increasing number of investors have betted on this horse. They hope for, and expect, measures supporting the dollar, also in the future. To make this a profitable strategy, most of the investment firms use the charter analysis, which indicates support points visible to everyone. At these points, whether they are at 1.6250 or 1.60 German marks [DM], the participators in the market enter into dollar positions, because in anticipation of central bank interventions they consider themselves to be on the right side. But if such joint activities fail to take place, the U.S. currency drops due to profit-reducing stop-loss orders. This pattern also emerged over the past week and a half, and, retrospectively, it is very well known from crises in the European Monetary System. The psychological aspect cannot be overlooked. What is particularly surprising is that supposed interventions are thought to have such a strong effect. There have been several examples in the past where administrative interventions in the foreign currency markets failed badly. The volumes moved and the symbolic value of interventions were too low. But probably the "softening job" by the central banks is successful, who "threaten" banks that they are constantly ready for interventions. In addition, the U.S. currency has dropped to its October 1993 level. The DM1.60 currently paid against the dollar is the lower limit of the range in which the dollar has moved since the beginning of 1993 (upper limit: DM1.76). To interpret this as willingness to intervene would be wrong only if one were to ignore that almost everyone thinks that way, and acts accordingly. In this connection, the question as to who is interested in a more stable dollar easily becomes less important. On closer examination, the German Bundesbank should not have any problems with the current value of the dollar, and it would certainly only become active out of loyalty to the Federal Reserve. Exchange rates of around DM1.60 are still acceptable to the German export industry, and they promote the stability of prices. The fact is that so far there have not been any warnings on the part of industry. The Federal Reserve, however, is torn between fears of inflation on the one hand and foreign trade considerations on the other. If it were to call for dollar purchases internationally, this would mean putting its cards on the table in a risky manner. Should the interventions fail to achieve a lasting effect, which is not unlikely in view of the increasingly pessimistic mood toward the dollar, an increase in key interest rates would be absolutely necessary to halt the drop of the dollar. In the current year, this strategy has not proved successful, although the Bundesbank simultaneously lent a helping hand with its relaxation tactics. The fact that the ailing dollar is not reflected by price increases in German shares is another phenomenon that has a touch of novelty about it. The loss of a positive correlation between fixed currencies and rising share indexes makes one wonder about the suggested market development. Where are the German marks that have been purchased by international addresses? As prospects are rated as poor in both shares and bonds, the funds have found their temporary destiny in the DM-capital market. The feared exchange rate losses in traditional shares are not set off by a sufficient compensation through the desired currency profits. In view of the latest dynamic downward movement of the Dax and Bund futures, this scenario is unlikely to change fundamentally in the near future. Nevertheless, an enormous investment potential of German marks has formed, which will sooner or later want to achieve higher yields than those available in the capital market, all the more so as the German short-term interest rate does not seem to have reached its lowest point yet. Only then would the world of the fundamental analysts be in order.
