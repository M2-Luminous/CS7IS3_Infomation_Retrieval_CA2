At present no official body existed in Slovakia with the competence to issue screening certificates, he added. The cabinet is being screened to ascertain whether any of its members collaborated with the communist secret police, since Slovak law bans former collaborators from holding high public office. The Slovak Information Service (SIS) was charged by the former government with issuing screening certificates for a period of nine months, by which time the problem was to have been solved, Moravcik said. However, ex-Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's cabinet did not solve the problem by this date. The shortcoming would be dealt with at the next parliamentary session, Moravcik said. He also pointed to the fact that the previous government had not proceeded at all in accordance with the valid screening law. "We have been, and will be, thorough in this respect," he said. With reference to Economy Minister Peter Magvasi, who is rumored to be having problems in obtaining a negative certificate, Moravcik said that Magvasi was "a very capable minister" who in a short time had managed to gain a good reputation abroad. "However, we have to wait for the results of the screening," he said.
