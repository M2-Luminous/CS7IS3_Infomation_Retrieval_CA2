The branch has decided to set up a merchant banking division and it is expected to play an important role in BOC's global business, said Li Zhuangfei, assistant general manager of the branch. One focus of the new division will be structured financing, including syndicated loans and aircraft leasing. The branch has been engaged in this business for several years. It has completed two major aircraft leasing deals, one for Xiamen Airline and the other for Southern China Airlines. Both of these entailed complicated structured financing involving commercial lending, U.S. export credits, equity and leasing. The other area the branch is to concentrate on is corporate financing, including advising European companies on doing business with China and helping Chinese companies invest in Europe. Li said the branch is also interested in underwriting China-related shares. "We hope to help list Chinese shares on the London Stock Exchange in the future," he said. China has selected 22 domestic firms for possible listing overseas this year. Although most will be listed in Hong Kong, State securities authorities have indicated that some will be listed in New York and London. Li said the Bank of China's London branch is now recruiting staff in London and is applying for licensing. "We know that our path will have many twists and turns, but we are confident that we will reach our destination," he said. The London branch was set up in November 1929, the first overseas branch of the Bank of China. The branch was originally staffed by only three English bankers but has been expanding steadily and now employs 200 people. It conducts a comprehensive range of businesses, including savings and lending for the Chinese community in the United Kingdom, trade settlement between China and Europe, foreign exchange trading, inter-bank borrowing and interest rate swaps. The branch has become an important member of London's banking community. "Although we have achieved a great deal in London, we still have a lot to learn and many new goals to be realized," he said. The unprecedented structural changes in China's economy impose a duty on the branch to explore new businesses to support the reform, Li said. He said his bank is seeking to better use the advantages of London which he called the most international, flexible and advanced financial centre in the world. The city has the world's largest foreign exchange market, with an average daily turnover of $300 billion. It has the biggest foreign banking community, with offices of over 600 banks. Of the top 100 banks in the world, 99 have offices in London.
