The appeal was initiated by leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Legal proceedings will be held on July 7, the court decided. Gaydar's representative, his lawyer Genri Reznik sent a notification to the court saying that he was overloaded with current affairs, that he had to go on a trip on business and that he would go on holiday from July 26. Reznik asked to postpone the proceedings and demanded that they be held not earlier than September 10. Zhirinovskiy initiated an appeal against Gaydar after Gaydar published the article "A Stake on Villains" in the IZVESTIYA newspaper. In the article Gaydar called Zhirinovskiy a "fascist populist."
