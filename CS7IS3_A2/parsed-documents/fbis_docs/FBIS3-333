The president noted that, as a sovereign state, Kenya deserves respect from these nations the way it respected them. Saying that these countries were partisan, the president wondered why their embassies had not disassociated themselves from the subversive elements operating in the country in the name of democracy. The president gave examples of the tribal clashes started by the opposition and their assertion of terrorism as areas where these countries never came up to condemn. President Moi noted that he had implemented a lot of conditions by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, IMF, and wondered why these countries have not appreciated all these efforts. President Moi was speaking at Eldoret showground when he officially opened this year's Uasin Gishu Agricultural Show. At the same time, President Moi once again criticized a section of the local press for their lack of patriotism and thriving on lies and sensationalism. He disclosed that it was now clear that these newspapers have a hidden agenda, and told Kenyans to be on the lookout. The president observed that the KANU [Kenya African National Union] government has for a long time been the target of intimidation and said should the country be pushed to civil war, then Kenyans should know who pushed them that far. He challenged those subversive elements in the country to come out and state whether they do not want a united nation instead of hiding behind the song of democracy. Saying that violence breeds violence, President Moi told those friendly countries to Kenya to take time off to understand the way Kenyans live, instead of rushing to call for changes in the country. President Moi reiterated that although he has been tolerant for quite some time now, tolerance has a limit. [passage omitted] Once again, President Moi told civil servants, including the police, that the government will not enter into any negotiations over their loyalty to the government of the day. He told the commissioner of police to make it clear to the police that they had an obligation to serve the government in power loyally or risk dismissal. He gave an example of the armed forces who, despite being officers and soldiers drawn from all over the country, lived harmoniously as a family. [passage omitted]
