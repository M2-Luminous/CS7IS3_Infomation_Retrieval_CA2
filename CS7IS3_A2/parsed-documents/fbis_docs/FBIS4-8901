In a letter to Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, carried by Ljubljana papers, Kucan demanded a government investigation into arms smuggling to determine who was involved, what was the profit of officials, institutions and individuals gained in that way, and the exact quantity of arms delivered to Slovenia from abroad. The truth about Slovenia's involvement in arms smuggling came out in the public last summer, when 120 tonnes of weapons for Croatia and Bosnian Moslems were recovered at Maribor airport. By drawing attention to arms smuggling, Kucan attempted to attenuate his role in the affair that assumed international proportions. Kucan's "considerate" letter to Drnovsek is also intended to build up his reputation, but it will probably trigger new polemics instead, notably about the ex-Defence Minister Janez Jansa's role in Slovenia's instigating armed conflicts in former Yugoslavia.
