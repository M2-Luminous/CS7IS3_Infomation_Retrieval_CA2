At a press meeting in Oita, western Japan, Hata did not elaborate further, but said the two countries have already agreed on the direction of the trade talks. Hata also said that Japan would not agree to setting "numerical targets" since it could lead to managed trade. Japan has strongly refused U.S. demands to set numerical targets to measure progress in the opening of the Japanese market. Hata added that Japan will not replace "objective criteria" with numerical targests. Both Japanese and U.S. officials have said they want to get an agreement at least on some industry sectors prior to the Naples summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations. A bilateral summit meeting between Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. President Bill Clinton is scheduled in Naples. The current trade talks between Japan and the U.S. focus on seven Japanese market sectors of particular interest to U.S. firms. Among them are Japanese Government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment, insurance, and automobiles and auto parts. The two countries have also kicked off negotiations to ease market-access regulations in Japan's financial sector, tighten the protection of foreign patents and copyrights in Japan and increase sales of foreign-made flat glass in Japan.
