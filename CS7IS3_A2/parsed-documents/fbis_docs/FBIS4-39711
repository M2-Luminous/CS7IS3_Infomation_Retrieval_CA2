The Border Troops Main Directorate informed KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's correspondent that during this period 948 violators had been detained, contraband goods worth 11.5 million rubles had been detected, the export of over 225 tonnes of nonferrous metals had been prevented, and 276 weapons and 81 kg of drugs had been seized. The border guards have returned $750,000 to the state treasury. This sum, converted into Belarusian rubles, equals half of the resources allocated to the border guard department from the state budget for the current year. So the republic's "green caps" are earning their keep.
