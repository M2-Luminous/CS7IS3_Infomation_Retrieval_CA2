At present, partly foreign-funded enterprises total 2970 in Henan and actual investment used has reached 600 million U.S. dollars. Foreign capital has poured into the province from more than 50 countries and regions of the world. Investment scale has been further enlarged. Seventy percent of Henan's total joint ventures boast foreign capital investments from 5 to 30 million U.S. dollars. Apart from funding the booming industrial and service sectors, more and more foreign investment has been directed toward infrastructure projects. Zhengzhou Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., jointly funded by Japan, Thailand and China, has become one of the province's biggest profit-earners after introducing advanced technology and management experience. A large agricultural province with very few foreign-funded enterprises only several years ago, Henan has rapidly expanded its economic opening-up in recent years. Rich natural resources, abundant agricultural products, an ample labor force and preferential policies in utilizing foreign investment have effectively pushed Henan to the forefront of economic activities in inland China. Henan's economic growth was six times the country's average in the year 1993, which was also faster than that of the developed coastal provinces. Its export trade volume also topped that of interior provinces last year.
