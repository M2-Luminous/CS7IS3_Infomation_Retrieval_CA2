The main points are as follows: 1. Raising or lowering metallurgical product prices is an important component of metallurgical product prices. These prices are verified by the state according to the users' needs and product quality on the basis of the existing or partially promulgated state criteria for metallurgical products. Whether an enterprise increases or reduces its metallurgical product prices must be based on the user's proposal, and the lowered or raised prices must be clarified in the contract that is signed. 2. The names, sizes, physical properties, chemical components, and specifications of products listed in the catalogue of "ex-factory prices of metallurgical products" are governed by the existing or partially promulgated state criteria. If the names, sizes, physical properties, chemical components, or specifications of metallurgical products are not covered by the existing or partially promulgated state criteria, the enterprise's criteria or the technical requirements set by both parties' agreement can be taken as the basis. 3. Raising or lowering the state-set or state-guided prices of products must strictly proceed in accordance with the catalogue of "ex-factory prices of metallurgical products." If an enterprise reduces a product's chemical component according to its internally controlled criteria for production, changes its workmanship, improves its precision, or increases its inspection, but does not do so at the user's request, it cannot raise the product's price. 4. Raising or lowering the state-set prices of products must proceed under the management of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry; localities or enterprises are not allowed to change prices without authorization. 5. Raising or lowering the market prices of iron and steel products must be discussed by both parties and explained in their purchase and sales contracts.
