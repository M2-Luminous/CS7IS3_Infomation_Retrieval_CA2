FBIS3-12276 "drnes039dd_94041" FBIS-NES-94-039 Document Type:Daily Report 28 Feb 1994 Palestinian Affairs `Hardline' Groups Vow `Revenge' for Massacre Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Others React NC2502151394 Paris AFP in English 1436 GMT 25 Feb 94 NC2502151394 Paris AFP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Amman, Feb 25 (AFP)--Hardline Palestinian groups vowed on Friday [25 February] to carry out revenge attacks for the massacre of more than 50 Palestinians at a mosque in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas put all its fighters "on a maximum state of alert" and called on them "to retaliate as hard as possible to avenge the slaughter in Hebron." In a statement to AFP here, Hamas said that "emergency military plans were put in place to strike at Zionist targets, occupation soldiers and settlers." It also declared that the peace process had been dealt a "fatal blow" by the massacre. One or more settlers shot dead 53 Palestinians and wounded dozens more inside a mosque at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron, and eight other Arabs were killed in clashes with troops. Hamas has been at the forefront of attacks on Jews in the occupied territories since the PLO signed its peace deal with Israel in Washington on September 13. A group formed to oppose the deal, Black September 13, vowed to "commit a series of attacks against Jewish institutions inside and outside the occupied territories" until the collapse of the autonomy accord. The attacks will take place in the next few days, said an anonymous caller to AFP in Beirut identifying himself as a member of the group. From now on "all settlers are legitimate targets" for Palestinian militants, he added. Black September leader Munir Maqdah, who is based in Lebanon, blamed Arafat's policies for the massacre and said that he "has no other choice to shoot himself in the head and commit suicide." In Damascus, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, two hardline PLO groups, denounced the massacre as a "perfidious crime" committed with the knowledge of Israeli troops. They promised the "martyrs and the people" that the FDLP's Red Star fighters and the PFLP's Red Eagles in the territories will take revenge against settlers and Israeli troops. The PFLP called an emergency meeting of the Damascus-based "Alliance of Palestinian Forces" -- which includes the PFLP, the DFLP, and Hamas -- in order to decide how to respond. Syria -- along with the PLO, Lebanon and Jordan -- is involved in the peace negotiations with Israel, but hosts the hardline groups as a means to pressure the Jewish state with whom it has made little progress in the talks. Another group, the Revoltionary Army for the Liberation of Palestine, threatened to assassinate the PLO leader. As the threats flew, 'Arafat said he had told his UN envoy to request an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council "so as to take the necessary measures to ensure the protection of our people." "This massacre will have very serious fallout, not only on the (Israeli-Palestinian negotiations) but also at all levels and in all fields," 'Arafat added. 'Arafat accused the Israeli army of "complicity, adding "how can they allow settlers to bear arms and not our people?" His organization declared three days of mourning and a general strike in the occupied territories. The PLO's West Bank chief Faysal al-Husayni warned that "the peace process is dying." Arab League Secretary General 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid and Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali both warned that the massacre threatened the negotiations. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin condemned the "odious massacre" and called on "Jews and Arabs to show restraint and not to become involved in provocative acts." King Husayn of Jordan was among the leaders who joined the chorus of condemnation.
