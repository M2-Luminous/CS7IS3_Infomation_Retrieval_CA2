The Thai government is trying hard to convince Cambodia to support the three airlines, including Kampuchea Airlines, Cambodia International Airlines, and SK Air in addition to Thai Airways International [THAI] and Bangkok Airways. Cambodia however has already established a solid relationship with Singapore for its aviation future. Aviation Department Director-General Sisuk Chantharangsu met Keo Saphal, the Director-General of Cambodia's Aviation Department last month. Both agreed to extend the current aviation agreement with some changes. They plan to meet again after October. The amended agreement calls for each country to be allowed to increase its weekly capacity from currently 1,800 to 2,000 seats. Thailand plans to give this additional quota to THAI and Bangkok Airways, while Cambodia will give it to Cambodia International Airlines, an industry source said. Currently, Kampuchea and Cambodia International Airlines have seven flights a week while SK Airlines has four. Thai businessmen are involved in ventures with all three of Cambodia's airlines, a result of the country's political instability. In November last year, the Cambodian government, together with Singapore Airlines (which holds 40 per cent) set up Royal Air Cambodge (RAC) as Cambodia's official national airline to replace Kampuchea. The emergence of RAC will affect the three pioneering airlines. RAC was due to start flying by the middle of this year, linking Phnom Penh, Bangkok, Singapore and Hong Kong. Flights to Japan Taiwan and Vietnam will commence later. Initially the new airline will use 130-180 seat Boeing 737s. The industry source said Thailand's Aviation Department had expected the February meeting to result in the cancellation of the flights of the other three airlines. This was not the case. "At first they (officials at the Thai aviation agency) thought Cambodia would have RAC benefit from aviation rights. It is likely that RAC is still poised for (taking over these) operations after October; therefore they (the Cambodian government) prolonged the present agreement," the source said. He added that Thai investors failed to satisfy the Cambodian government, having yet to begin improving the airports, as they had earlier promised to do. Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak had helped negotiate with the Cambodian government for the three airlines' continued operation. Singapore Airlines now has the potential to control aviation-related businesses in Cambodia in the future, including catering, cargo, ticketing and reservation systems, the source said. Meanwhile, the source said, Thailand approved Vietnam's first-ever request for transit rights in Bangkok for France-bound flights, starting next season. Vietnam's move is expected to threaten THAI's operations on that route. "We have yet to estimate the damage from Vietnam's approach to the market. Vietnam's economy is rapidly growing, but we are going to lose chances. THAI will be affected," the source said.
