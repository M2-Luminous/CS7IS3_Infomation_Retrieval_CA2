During question hour the Opposition expressed its strong reaction to the recent "anti-Indian" statements made by Washington. The External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, said that India has told USA that the views expressed by President Clinton and other officials on Jammu and Kashmir will affect relations between the two countries. However, he added that the Indian representative there had already replied to the anti-India views, so there was no need for him or the Prime Minister to take up the matter with the U.S. President or the Secretary of State. Mr. Dinesh Singh's defence of the Government's low-key reaction to the statements of President Bill Clinton and the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs on Kashmir and Punjab was resented strongly by a section of the Opposition. Mr. Singh justified the Government stance saying that the U.S. Administration had "corrected" its earlier stance stating "that these views do not constitute and should not be construed to imply any change in the U.S. policy". He said that India, thus, should accept it. The Minister said the unanimous resolution on Kashmir passed by Parliament last week and the statements of the Indian Ambassador to the USA and the Government spokesmen had an impact the world over. Earlier, the Minister of State for External Affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, while answering supplementaries said that India was doing everything to tell the world that the present situation in Jammu and Kashmir was the result of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in the state. However, he said, Kashmir was a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan, which should be resolved within the framework of the Shimla Agreement. No other country would be allowed to mediate on the issue, he said. The Home Minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, told the Rajya Sabha that the Government was committed to greater transparency in its handling of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and had initiated strenuous efforts to reactivate political activity, adds PTI [Press Trust or India]. Moving a statutory resolution seeking further extension of President's rule in the State for a period of six months from March 3 in the House, Mr. Chavan quoting the Governor's report said there had been a visible improvement in the situation. He said that as a part of greater transparency the Government had allowed a delegation of the International Commission of jurists and three ambassadors from the European Commission to visit Kashmir. Meanwhile, 20 people including 10 militants, two of them self-styled commanders, and three women were killed while 14 others including an area commander were arrested in the Kashmir valley overnight.
