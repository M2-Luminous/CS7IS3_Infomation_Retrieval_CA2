The question arises: Will this change bring any new tone in U.S. policy toward our small Balkan country? I think there is little reason to expect any U.S. policy change in this respect. It is a policy that has been conceived in detail by specialist personnel, and there is no reason why it should be lightly changed within two or three years. What is certainly due to change in the future is Albania itself and the Albanian people, who already have changed over the past four years, together with the Albanian realities and political parties. With the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries, U.S. policy in Albania immediately appeared to be a consistent anti-communist policy aimed at speeding up the changes that had already begun in the 1988-89 period. It was also a policy of establishing a system of pluralist democracy and a capitalist market economy. With all the means at the disposal of his profession, Mr. Ryerson has contributed to the destabilization of the last communist ruling party in Albania, and did the same thing against Fatos Nano's socialists in the run-up to the 22 March 1992 elections, thus reflecting the official U.S. policy of temporary diplomatic mistrust of any democratic transformation of the reform- minded trend within the PPSH [Party of Labor of Albania] into a modern party of a social-democratic type, called afterward the PSSH [Socialist Party of Albania]. Another expression of this U.S. political stance was Ambassador Ryerson's appearances in public, side by side with the PDSH [Democratic Party of Albania], which at that time appeared to be the greatest and most determined anti-communist force in Albania. The Albanian public today has a certain assessment of Mr. Ryerson's activities in Albania, but it is not a uniform one. Nevertheless, a considerable number of Albanians have long expressed a tendency to identify the PDSH with U.S. policy in Albania, and to identify Mr. Ryerson himself with the PDSH leaders when this party was in opposition, and also now that it is in power. There seem to have been certain public factors -- especially those related to the run-up to the 22 March 1992 elections -- that prompted Albanians to reach such conclusions. The Albanians remember all too well, and they could not help mentioning several times afterward, Mr. Ryerson's declaration at a PDSH election rally in Korca, where he stated: "I wish all the socialists good health and unemployment." However, the Albanians are also wise enough to appreciate the criticism contained in a recent U.S. State Department report on human rights violations committed in this country by ruling government officials -- a report in which information provided by the U.S. Embassy in Tirana played its part. Nevertheless, the identification of Mr. Ryerson with the present PDSH leaders -- whose prestige has been badly compromised because of the difficulties Albania is faced with in this transition period, and because of signs of wear and tear, incapability, and corruption in various segments of the PDSH state organs -- could negatively affect the friendly feelings that Albanians have toward the great and powerful U.S. democracy and toward the United States itself. Whereas the former President Alia masterfully succeeded in appeasing the anti-U.S. sentiments instilled in the Albanians' minds for decades by the communist regime, the identification of the present U.S. ambassador in Albania with the present PDSH and its ruling, discredited elite has had the reverse impact upon the Albanians' mixed feelings. Such a thing is in the interest of neither the great United States nor little Albania. Since Mr. Baker's visit to Tirana in spring 1991, ordinary Albanians have given ample proof that they are able to appreciate their friendship with the United States. Mr. Ryerson has made a great contribution to the process of eradicating communism from Albania. He will therefore be remembered for a long time by the Albanian people. There will be pleasant memories of him, but also bitter ones, bearing in mind the tactics used to bring the former communists to their knees. Such tactics unleashed destructive anti-communist forces that gave vent to their frustrations by burning down and destroying factories, schools, cultural centers, farms, and so on. It is yet another "dark stain" on how the overwhelmingly majority of Albanians view the Western support for the PDSH to come to power. To some extent, this also applies to how the Albanians view the U.S. ambassador of that period. With Mr. Ryerson's departure from Albania, one chapter in the evolution of U.S. policy in Albania is closed, and the new chapter will require a new ambassador. The foreign policy analysts will not have forgotten the reaction of the Albanian population against those who implemented such a policy thus far. From now on, it will be a matter of the consolidation of U.S. influence in Albania. The Albanian policymakers have to show themselves capable of respecting and defending Albania's interests first and foremost, and then the interests of her friends, be they small or great. Naturally, the anti-communist U.S. policy is, in essence, not going to change. From this viewpoint, one can assume that it is the right-wing parties that will be the more privileged ones. However, Mr. Ryerson's visit to the PPSH headquarters to attend its press conference on 3 April 1994, among other things of significance, is symptomatic of the official U.S. policy of also opening up toward the left-wing parties, and perhaps at the same time an indication of the end of its "cold war" against the PSSH as a "former communist" party. The fact that some former communists today are leading the PDSH and the Albanian State is encouraging in this respect. Being a pro-European party, the PSSH has strived from the very beginning, and continues striving to build all kinds of links with the United States at all levels. The Albanian socialists have eventually recognized the fact that a pro-European policy also presumes a permanent U.S. presence in Europe and U.S. membership in a number of European political and military structures. The Albanian people are in need of powerful friends, especially those near them, but without ever refusing the friendship of those who are far off. Now that the cards on the Balkan table are being reshuffled, all Albanians, regardless of their persuasion or where they live, value their friendship with the United States as a historic chance of achieving a fair solution to their national problem.
