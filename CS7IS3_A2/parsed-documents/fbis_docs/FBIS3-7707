Foremost among the five priorities is the stability of free industries and the protection of Filipino workers abroad. Also included in the priorites is the implementation of strict discipline in governmental financial management through effective rules and regulations, and efficient coordination in the execution of economic programs. Likewise, the government must attend to the on-going peace talks with the rebels in order to end the armed rebellion. The President also promises to make alterations in programs in order to administer justice, decrease criminality, and increase trust in the government, programs targeted primarily at the uniformed scalawags and anomalous government officials. In this connection, the House of Representatives will extend all the support needed by the Ramos administration in order for it to be successful in 1994, and to proceed with national improvement plans through the year 2000. This was the statement made by Speaker Jose de Venecia, Jr., in response to the report to the nation presented by President Ramos yesterday at Malacanang regarding the Ramos Administration's accomplishments in 1993, and its plans for this year and the years to come. According to De Venecia, almost all of the legislative proposals and the support asked for or set forth by President Ramos have been approved by the House, such as the Foreign Bank Liberalization Act, Build, Operate and Transfer Act, and other bills relating to business progress, tax collection, and attracting foreign investors. De Venecia also stated that it is up to the Senate to act now because the bills approved by the lower House have been pending in the upper House.
