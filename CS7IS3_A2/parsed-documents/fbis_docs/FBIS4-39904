If that is the case, will this hit the our country's national security interests? [Baturin] Here, the level of the budget that is now set is the minimum and maybe even less than the minimum, and the main danger for the defense capacity lies in the question: Are we able to maintain our high technology, our high technology production? In other words, those things in which we are for the moment ahead of other countries. If we lose these, then the damage to the defense capacity will be irreparable. [Medvedev] The Security Council was due to meet this week. What happened, Yuriy Mikhaylovich? Why did the meeting not take place? [Baturin] Nothing out of the ordinary took place. It is just that three members of the Security Council were out of Moscow and were unable to attend this meeting. Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, as leader of the Security Council, postponed the meeting to another day. [Medvedev] What was the theme for the cancelled meeting? [Baturin] The issue of Russia's borders and, in particular, state border policy, the tasks of which were laid down by the president at the meeting at the high command of the border troops on 27 May. [Medvedev] About the borders, more and more often we have seen them being violated. I do not mean just in those parts of the border where things are hot. Take for instance the recent incident with the American Lockheed. We still do not know what it was carrying on board. [Baturin] I should tell you that the incident with the Lockheed 130 ended without any particular losses materially or in terms of status on both sides. But here, of course, we can see a symptom of the lowering of the general level of security, which is linked to the lowering of Russia's authority, something our country can hardly be pleased about. In point of fact, for a long time now the Russian air force has not flown to the shores of the United States and has respected state borders. The opposite, as you see, is taking place. This sort of inequality does not help to reinforce the trust between our countries of which we have so much need.
