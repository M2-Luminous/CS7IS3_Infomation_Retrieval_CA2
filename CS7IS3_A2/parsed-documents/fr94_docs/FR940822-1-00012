ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA is proposing a significant new use rule (SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for the chemical substance described as modified propylene glycol ether, which is the subject of premanufacture notice (PMN) P&hyph;93&hyph;507. This proposal would require certain persons who intend to manufacture, import, or process this substance for a significant new use to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing any manufacturing or processing activities for a use designated by this SNUR as a significant new use. The required notice would provide EPA with the opportunity to evaluate the intended use and, if necessary, to prohibit or limit that activity before it can occur. DATES: Written comments must be received by EPA on or before September 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: All comments must be sent in triplicate to: Environmental Protection Agency, OPPT Document Control Officer (7407), 401 M St., SW., Rm. E&hyph;G99, Washington, DC 20460. Comments that are claimed as confidential business information (CBI) must be clearly marked CBI. If CBI is claimed, three additional copies of the comments without the CBI must also be submitted. Nonconfidential versions of comments on this proposed rule will be placed in the rulemaking record and will be available for public inspection in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC) located in Rm. NE&hyph;B607. Comments should include the docket control number. The docket control number for the chemical substance in this SNUR is OPPTS&hyph;50621. Unit VI. of this preamble contains additional information on submitting comments containing information claimed as CBI. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan B. Hazen, Director, Environmental Assistance Division (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E&hyph;543B, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Telephone: (202) 554&hyph;1404, TDD: (202) 554&hyph;0551. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This proposed SNUR would require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import, or processing of the substance identified as modified propylene glycol ether for the significant new uses described herein. The required notice would provide EPA with information with which to evaluate an intended use and associated activities. I. Authority Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant new use.'' EPA must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including those listed in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B) of TSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the chemical substance for that use. Section 26(c) of TSCA authorizes EPA to take action under section 5(a)(2) with respect to a category of chemical substances. Persons subject to this SNUR would comply with the same notice requirements and EPA regulatory procedures as submitters of premanufacture notices under section 5(a)(1) of TSCA. In particular, these requirements include the information submission requirements of section 5(b) and (d)(1), the exemptions authorized by section 5(h)(1), (h)(2), (h)(3), and (h)(5), and the regulations at 40 CFR part 720. Once EPA receives a significant new use notice (SNUN), EPA may take regulatory action under section 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to control the activities for which it has received a SNUN. If EPA does not take action, section 5(g) of TSCA requires EPA to explain in the Federal Register its reasons for not taking action. Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a proposed or final SNUR are subject to the export notification provisions of TSCA section 12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b) appear at 40 CFR part 707. II. Applicability of General Provisions General regulatory provisions applicable to SNURs are codified at 40 CFR part 721, subpart A. Regulatory provisions covering user fees applicable to significant new use notices are codified at 40 CFR part 700 under the authority of TSCA section 26(b). Interested persons may refer to these sections for further information. III. Background EPA is proposing to establish significant new use and recordkeeping requirements for the chemical dipropylene glycol dimethyl ether. The proposed SNUR designates as significant new uses: (1) Any manner or method of manufacturing, importing, or processing associated with any use of the substance without the use of dermal protection, including gloves, that provides an impervious barrier to the substance. (2) Annual manufacture and importation volume for any use greater than 4 times the yearly volume specified in the PMN for the substance (annual production total must include quantities manufactured for export and for all domestic uses). (3) Use of the substance in a consumer product. On February 2, 1993, EPA received a PMN, designated as P&hyph;93&hyph;507, for a modified propylene glycol ether. Based on test data on the PMN substance, submitted with the PMN and during the review period, EPA has concerns for the substance's potential to cause adverse systemic, maternal, and fetal effects. The greatest potential for risk appears to be associated with the dermal route of exposure. The extent to which the Agency expects that adverse effects may occur relates in large part to the isomer mix of the PMN substance, which is a combination of three individual isomers. If the ratio of these isomers in the PMN substance is maintained at certain levels, the Agency considers the potential risk to workers during manufacturing, processing, and use to be reasonable; however, if the formulation contains a high percentage of an isomer for which the suspected human health hazard is significant, the Agency might consider the risk to workers to be unreasonable. Although the Agency does not consider the higher risk formulations likely to be made, and is reasonably confident that the isomer of greatest potential concern will be present at low levels (<5 percent) in the formulation, the PMN submitter was not able to specify with certainty the percentage at which each isomer would be present in the PMN substance. Consequently, there is potential for the PMN substance to be formulated in isomer ratios that may present an unreasonable risk to human health as described above. In deciding not to regulate the PMN submitter through an administrative consent order, the Agency balanced the potential risks from certain isomer formulations with the benefits to worker safety offered by the PMN substance as a substitute for more potentially hazardous glycol ethers. Another factor in the Agency's decision not to regulate the PMN substance through an order was the product stewardship program that the submitter had established for the substance, which included up-front glove testing to ensure that accurate information on dermal protection would be communicated to workers exposed to the substance. The results of the glove testing indicated that permeation at rates that might present an unreasonable risk could occur with certain glove models. The Agency considers it prudent and necessary, therefore, that any glove or dermal protective clothing intended for use in handling the PMN substance be tested, or the specifications from the manufacturer or supplier evaluated, prior to use. This testing or evaluation must ensure that the protective item will be impervious to the PMN substance for the expected duration and conditions of exposure, which includes the likely combinations of other chemicals to which the item may be exposed in the work area. (Each piece of personal protective equipment must be selected and used in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.132 and 1910.133.) Handling the PMN substance without the use of equipment that provides an impervious barrier to it would be considered a significant new use requiring Agency notice and appropriate justification. Based in part on the submitter's commitment to incorporate the results of the glove study in its product literature, the Agency considered regulation of the submitter to require use of dermal protective equipment under a consent order unnecessary, especially in view of the substance's relative human health advantages. The balance in favor of non-regulation might shift, however, if aspects of the manufacture and use of the PMN substance were to change from those on which the Agency's risk assessment was originally based. The production volume estimated by the submitter in its PMN, for example, is expected to result in relatively few workers being exposed to the PMN substance. If the production level were to increase substantially, however, the number of workers and the duration of exposure_especially during manufacture_would increase proportionately. As a consequence, EPA would need to revisit its original risk assessment, consider whether a potential unreasonable risk might result at the higher production levels and whether to regulate to mitigate that risk. Of course, if this increase in production volume were coupled with formulation of the PMN substance with a proportionally greater amount of the isomers of concern, the potential risk to workers would increase as well. The filing of a SNUN based on production volume would afford the Agency an opportunity to evaluate not only the increased worker exposures and risks, but also the risks associated with a particular isomer formulation of the PMN substance, the knowledge of which would be based on actual production experience. For purposes of determining the annual PMN production volume and compliance with the volume limitation, quantities of the PMN substance manufactured for both domestic use and export should be totaled (i.e. considered in aggregate), even if the export volumes were formerly manufactured ``for export only.'' Once domestic manufacture is intended or commences, all volumes produced_both for domestic consumption and export_are subject to PMN reporting requirements and TSCA section 5 regulation. Also, the annual production total should reflect manufacture or import volumes for any and all uses; the total should not be calculated on a per-use-basis. (See 40 CFR 720.45 and associated Agency guidance documents and instructions.) In addition, while the potential risk to workers from exposure to the PMN substance might be considered reasonable, similar exposures and risks to the general population by way of consumer uses for the PMN substance might not. The Agency considers potential risks to workers to be mitigated in part by the greater level of protective measures normally found in the workplace and the generally greater awareness among workers of the potential hazards associated with the substances they handle. Consumers, on the other hand, usually are not as aware of potential hazards, do not have access to the same types of information and protections available to workers, and therefore are potentially at greater risk if exposed to a hazardous new substance in a consumer product. Thus, in an effort to prevent an unreasonable risk to the general population, the PMN substance cannot be manufactured or processed for a consumer use until that use and the potential exposures and risks associated with it have been reviewed and evaluated by the Agency. In summary, for the reasons described above, the Agency has designated handling the PMN substance without adequate dermal protection, production volume when it reaches a substantial level per year, and any consumer use of the PMN substance as significant new uses. IV. Applicability of SNUR to Uses Occurring Before Effective Date of the Final SNUR EPA has decided that the intent of section 5(a)(1)(B) is best served by designating a use as a significant new use as of the date of proposal rather than as of the effective date of the rule. If uses which had commenced between that date and the effective date of this rulemaking were considered ongoing, rather than new, any person could defeat the SNUR by initiating a significant new use before the effective date. This would make it difficult for EPA to establish SNUR notice requirements. Thus, persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the substance for uses regulated under this SNUR after the date of this proposed rule will have to cease any such activity before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, such persons would have to comply with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions, expires. EPA, not wishing to unnecessarily disrupt the activities of persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of a significant new use before the effective date of the SNUR, has promulgated provisions to allow such persons to comply with this proposed SNUR before it is promulgated. If a person were to meet the conditions of advance compliance as codified at §721.45(h), the person would be considered to have met the requirements of the final SNUR for those activities. If persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the substance between proposal and the effective date of the SNUR do not meet the conditions of advance compliance, they must cease that activity before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, these persons would have to comply with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions, expires. V. Economic Analysis EPA has evaluated the potential costs of establishing significant new use notice requirements for potential manufacturers, importers, and processors of the chemical substance. The Agency's complete economic analysis is available in the public record for this proposed rule (OPPTS&hyph;50621). VI. Comments Containing Confidential Business Information Any person who submits comments claimed as CBI must mark the comments as ``confidential,'' ``trade secret,'' or other appropriate designation. Comments not claimed as confidential at the time of submission will be placed in the public file. Any comments marked as confidential will be treated in accordance with procedures in 40 CFR part 2. Any party submitting comments claimed to be confidential must prepare and submit a nonconfidential public version in triplicate of the comments that EPA can place in the public file. VII. Rulemaking Record EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control number OPPTS&hyph;50621). The record includes basic information considered by the Agency in developing this proposed rule. EPA will supplement the record with additional information as it is received. EPA will accept additional materials for inclusion in the record at any time between this proposal and designation of the complete record. EPA will identify the complete rulemaking record by the date of promulgation. A public version of the record, without any CBI, is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC) from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center is located in Rm. NE&hyph;B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC. VIII. Regulatory Assessment Requirements A. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this proposed rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. EPA has not determined whether parties affected by this proposed rule would likely be small businesses. However, EPA expects to receive few SNUNs for this substance. Therefore, EPA believes that the number of small businesses affected by the proposed rule would not be substantial, even if all of the SNUN submitters were small firms. C. Paperwork Reduction Act OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), and has assigned OMB control number 2070&hyph;0012. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 30 to 170 hours per response, with an average of 100 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch (2131), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on the information requirements contained in this proposal.
