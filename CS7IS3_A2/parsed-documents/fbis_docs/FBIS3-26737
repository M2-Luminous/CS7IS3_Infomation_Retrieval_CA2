The 140 or so Chinese and foreign scholars at the meeting spoke highly of the town's great achievements, saying it is a path China can follow in urbanizing its rural areas, and that it is also a great way in which the hundreds of millions of peasants contribute to China's economic and social modernization during the course of reform and opening up. According to the Ministry of Construction, ever since the adoption of the reform and opening up policy 15 years ago, 14,458 small towns (including county seats and towns with established administrative organizations) with the necessary infrastructure -- such as water and power supply systems, roads, economic facilities, cultural and educational facilities, and health services -- have emerged in both the north and south of China, and in areas inside and outside the Great Wall, whereas there were only 2,894 such cities in 1979. According to the information, the total population of small towns in the country (not including county seats) has reached 150 million, including 100 million people whose domiciles are not registered in these towns. Moreover, close to 40,000 new market towns (townships and villages where village enterprises are developed), which have services comparable to those in cities, have emerged in rural China. Township and town enterprises have served as the powerful "afterburners" of this urbanization. As result of the tides of industrialization, which have gone on in coastal areas and in the suburbs of large and medium cities for more than a decade, factories, highways, telephones, banks, insurance service, modern commercial business, hospitals, schools, and various other things representing industrialization and urban civilization have appeared in these thriving small towns. This development is particularly conspicuous in the Zhu Jiang and Chang Jiang deltas, the Jiaodong peninsula, and the Liaodong peninsula. The historical opportunities created by reform and opening up have changed Zhongshan, Shunde, Nanhai, and Dongguan in Guangdong from ordinary small county seats in the past into medium size cities with modern industries, commerce, banking services, communications, telecommunications, medical health services, and cultural and educational facilities. Because their economic growth is higher than in the "four little dragons" of Asia, the development in these cities has been described as an economic miracle in China. Some townships and towns have also developed into new cities around these cities. Although administratively they are still called towns, these towns have long- distance telephone and express postal services, bus services, commercial centers, and other services peculiar to modern cities. Their urbanization has far exceeded the level of county seats in the past. The urbanization in the Chang Jiang delta is comparable with that in the Zhu Jiang delta. Because modern industries and commercial businesses have put down roots, blossomed, and borne fruit in thousands of famous and ancient towns in areas south of the lower reaches of the Chang Jiang, the peasants there can now enjoy modern living without having to leave their hometowns. Moreover, these small towns' economic activities have reached beyond provincial boundaries. The industrial output yielded by Shengze Town in Jiangsu's Wujiang City has exceeded 5 billion yuan, and the town has become one of the four major silk capitals in China. The many highways criss-crossing the rural areas have linked these small but industrially and agriculturally developed towns with Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Yangzhou, Shaoxing, and other large and medium cities, forming new urban belts in which rural and urban areas supporting each other in their quest for development. What surprises people is that, because of the industrialization in rural areas, many sparsely populated hamlets in the past have now become new towns on the map of the republic. For example, Bashan in Shandong's Zibo City used to be a small village with only 1,000 or so villagers prior to reform. Its per capita income was only a little more than 100 yuan. Now the village has a new name -- Wantongde Corporation, Ltd. -- and the industrial output yielded by its 27 factories and 12 foreign-funded enterprises has exceeded 500 million yuan. In this village, there is the Wanjie Hospital, a world-class hospital built with Chinese and U.S. funds, secondary vocational schools, shopping malls, and guesthouses. Some scholars call these places -- which are villages in name but small towns in fact -- "village-class towns," and there are tens of thousands of such "village-class towns" in China. The economic development in ancient towns with relatively developed communications services in Northwest and Southwest China has also been revitalized as result of reform and opening up. Fenglingdu by the Huang He and Linxia on the loess plateau have again distinguished themselves as ancient towns. Thanks to thriving border trade, small towns located along the China's long borders have also found their opportunities for development. Economic experts say that, as peasants have created for themselves the opportunities and space for development, they have blazed a practical way for China to create jobs for surplus laborers in rural areas, to modernize agricultural production, and to develop the rural market. The transfer of surplus manpower is a formidable issue which rural areas in China have to confront in their economic development. According to estimates, by the end of this century, over 100 million surplus laborers will be transferred from the agricultural sector. The development of small towns not only can help improve the environment for the development of town and township enterprises and accelerate the modernization process of the rural economy, but also can alleviate the pressure created by the flow of peasants into large and medium cities. If each small town can absorb 2,000 peasants over the next five years, 50,000 towns can absorb 100 million people. Thus, the state is attaching great importance to the development of small towns and has started planning to reform the system governing domicile registration in small towns to facilitate the hundreds of millions of peasants to work and do business in cities.
