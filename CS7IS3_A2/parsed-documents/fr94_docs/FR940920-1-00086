FR940920-1-00086 FR940920-1-00008 Today's proposed guidelines for MWC's would apply to MWC units at plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day. The lower size cutoff of 35 Mg/day aggregate plant capacity for controlling MWC emissions under the proposed emission guidelines was selected after reviewing the population distributions of MWI's and MWC's. Most incinerators at medical waste facilities are smaller incinerators that fire segregated medical waste with general hospital discards (MSW), and these incinerators would have the potential to be covered by today's proposal. The population distribution of MWI's is distinctly different from the population distribution of traditional MWC plants that are the target of today's proposal. The existing distribution of MWC's is composed of about 372 units (about 179 plants), with an average plant size of about 600 Mg/day combustion capacity, with two or three MWC units at each plant. The potential nationwide combustion capacity of existing MWC's is about 107,000 Mg/day, assuming continuous operation. The MWI distribution is quite different and includes about 7,000 combustors with a single combustion unit per facility and an average unit size of less than 3 Mg/day combustion capacity. The total U.S. capacity of MWI's is about 20,000 Mg/day. This population is being addressed under a separate rulemaking. Clearly, the MWC population represents a smaller number of comparatively larger units, and MWI's represent a much larger number of smaller units. The lower size cutoff of 35 Mg/day aggregate plant capacity that is included in today's proposed emission guidelines would exclude less than 1 percent of the total nationwide combustion capacity of MWC's and would result in over 99 percent of total MWC capacity being covered by this proposal. The same lower size cutoff would prevent significant dual coverage under this proposal by excluding more than 99 percent of MWI units and about 97 percent of nationwide MWI capacity from today's proposed revisions. As mentioned above, the proposed emission guidelines with a 35 Mg/day cutoff would cover the great majority of MWC's, and may also cover a few of the largest MWI's (nine units at three sites are known to cofire medical waste with MSW and are above the 35 Mg/day of MSW total plant capacity cutoff). Section 129 of the Act requires that regulations for MWI's be developed in a separate rulemaking. For these reasons, it is appropriate that today's proposed guidelines focus on MWC's and that a separate regulation focus on MWI's. The NSPS and guidelines for MWI's are scheduled to be proposed in 1995. Municipal waste combustor plants with aggregate capacities below 35 Mg/day would not be subject to the emission limits under today's proposed emission guidelines. However, those facilities with aggregate plant capacities between 25 and 35 Mg/day would be required to report (one time) their location, startup date, and aggregate plant capacity. They would also be required to provide supporting information, including calculations used to determine plant capacity. This one-time report would allow the EPA or State agency to enforce the lower size cutoff for applicability to the proposed guidelines. Plants with aggregate capacities of 25 Mg/day or below would not be subject to any provisions under this proposal. The proposed emission guidelines for MWC's are subdivided into two subcategories of air emissions requirements: The first for MWC's located at MWC plants with aggregate capacities to combust more than 35 Mg/day but less than or equal to 225 Mg/day of MSW (referred to as small MWC plants), and the second for MWC's located at MWC plants with aggregate capacities to combust greater than 225 Mg/day of MSW (referred to as large MWC plants). The 225 Mg/day dividing point was established because this size break represents a transition point between field-erected waterwall MWC's and modular MWC's. In the subcategory of existing plants with capacities greater than 225 Mg/day, there are about 119 MWC plants with 235 MWC units. In the subcategory of existing plants with capacities greater than 35 Mg/day but equal to or less than 225 Mg/day, there are about 60 plants with 137 units. The large plant subcategory accounts for about 94 percent of the total combustion capacity whereas the smaller subcategory accounts for about 5 percent of total capacity. F. Selection of Maximum Achievable Control Technology The following discussion addresses the EPA's selection of MACT. The existing technologies for controlling emissions of the designated pollutants from MWC's are reviewed, followed by a summary of the EPA's approach for establishing the MACT floor. Finally, the discussion presents the EPA's selection of MACT for MWC's at small and large MWC plants. 1. Summary of MWC Control Technologies The following discussion reviews the existing technologies for controlling emissions of acid gases, dioxins/furans, PM, Cd, Pb, Hg, and NO x from MWC's. a. Acid Gas/PM Control Technologies. Municipal waste combustor acid gas/PM control is a general term that refers to a group of MWC air pollution control technology combinations. These combinations control a wide range of pollutants, such as acid gases (including SO 2 and HCl), organics (including dioxins/furans), and PM and metals (including Cd, Pb, and a number of other metals except Hg). The three acid gas/PM controls most commonly used in the United States for existing MWC's are: (1) GCP plus DSI followed by an ESP; (2) GCP plus an SD followed by an ESP; and (3) GCP plus an SD followed by an FF. Discussions of each of these control systems were presented in the December 20, 1989 proposal preamble for the acid gas and PM emission guidelines in subpart Ca (54 FR 52209). Control of Cd, Pb, and Hg were not discussed in detail in the 1989 preamble. Since 1991, the performance of the acid gas/PM control systems for removal of Cd, Pb, and Hg has been investigated in more depth. Cadmium and Pb are both volatile at temperatures present in combustion systems, but condense onto PM in the flue gas at temperatures associated with the operation of most PM control systems. As a result, the control of Cd and Pb is generally related to the control of PM emissions. Much of the PM in the flue gas from an MWC is fine PM; from 20 to 70 percent of the PM in the flue gas from an MWC has an aerodynamic diameter of less than 1 micrometer (1 micron). Because of the potential for adsorption of Cd and Pb onto fine PM that is less readily collected by control devices than larger PM, the control of fine PM is especially important in controlling these metals.
