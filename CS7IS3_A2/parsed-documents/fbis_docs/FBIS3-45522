According to statistics by the Ministry of Labour, the number of unemployed receiving unemployment relief between January and October last year were more than 700,000, more than the total for the previous seven years after the establishment of the unemployment insurance system. The official of the Ministry of Labour said that the reason for this increase in numbers last year was due to the widening of the range of people receiving such relief and the increasing number of people leaving their former employment. Up until now, 70.4 million workers from 470,000 state-owned entities have taken part in the unemployment insurance scheme as have also workers in collectively owned enterprises in some places. According to the scheme on reform of social insurance worked out by relevant departments, unemployment insurance will gradually cover all kinds of labourers in cities and towns in the country. At present, the unemployment insurance funds and the insurance mechanism for the unemployed must be brought into full utilization and the activities of job-training, job-introduction and the issuance of relief for production must be carried out in an active way. The basic rights and interests of workers must be guaranteed in the process of reform.
