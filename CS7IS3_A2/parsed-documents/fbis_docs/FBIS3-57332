State of Emergency Regime Will Apparently Be Extended"] [Text] Vyacheslav Titorenko, representative of the Russian Federation Government interdepartmental commission for the elimination of the aftermath of the Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict, has arrived in North Ossetia, in the zone under the emergency situation regime. According to INTERFAX, the purpose of his arrival is to coordinate the actions of all interested ministries and agencies, including "power" ministries and agencies, to implement the Russian Federation president's edict on returning to their homes refugees and those who have been forced to resettle. In the meantime, there is growing dissatisfaction in the republic at an alleged introduction of additional Russian military formations onto its territory. The All-Ossetia "Greater Council" ("Styr Nykhas") and the pan-national movement "Our Ossetia" have passed a request to Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to confirm or deny this information. A statement circulated by these movements says that on the territory of North Ossetia now "there are more than enough military formations to ensure security in the zone affected by the emergency situation regime." In the view of the statement's authors, troops are being brought in the republic in order "to create a powerful military fist in the center of the Caucasus," capable of "pacifying" the Caucasian peoples." North Ossetia's public movements have demanded that the Russian Government withdraw the additional troops from the republic's territory, and discontinue support to extremist circles in Georgia's leadership. It appears that the possible introduction of additional Russian troops is causing such dissatisfaction because the emergency situation regime is to end on 31 January. On 28 January, North Ossetia's parliament intends to discuss this question, and, according to information from Vladikavkaz, many deputies will speak categorically against extending the validity of the emergency situation. However, INTERFAX reports, it is known from competent sources that the president of North Ossetia is now ready to sign an edict extending the state of emergency, but that would affect a considerably smaller area. The edict will apparently be signed after Akhsarbek Galazov, former chairman of North Ossetia's Supreme Soviet, is sworn in as president. The inauguration ceremony has been scheduled for 26 January. Invitations for the ceremony have been forwarded to Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin, government chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin, and to the leaders of both chambers of Russia's Federal Assembly. The leaders of the North Caucasus republics, krays, and oblasts are also expected to arrive in Vladikavkaz for the ceremony.
