Imports totalled $600 million last year, up by $100 million on the previous year and almost twice 1991's figure, according to ministry statistics. And China's re-entry into the Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) will bring a lot more sophisticated foreign medicines onto the home market in direct competition with domestic products, said the ministry. Imported medicine accounted for 7-10 per cent of the domestic medicine market last year. And joint venture products claimed a 35 percent share. "Imported medicine may bring in products that domestic plants cannot manufacture and enhance our pharmaceutical technology," the ministry spokesman said. Over 2,000 foreign medicines have been submitted for official approval since the registration system for imported medicine was set up in 1987. About 400 applications have been approved so far. "Joint ventures have played a big role in increasing China's medicine production," the spokesman said. Xian-Janssen Pharmaceutical Limited, China's biggest pharmaceutical joint venture, reported sales of 820 million yuan ($94.3 million) last year, 150 million yuan ($17 million) up on 1992. The figure is almost that of China's largest domestic company, North China Pharmaceutical Plant, which reported 1 billion yuan ($115 million) sales last year. About 60 per cent of China's one thousand plus joint ventures are engaged in medicine production. Most of the pharmaceuticals imported were for the treatment of blood and digestive system diseases cancer and everyday infections. Antiinfection medicine accounted for 30 percent of imports. China's pharmaceutical output hit 72 billion yuan ($8.3 billion) last year, a 13 per cent increase over 1992. Medicine products accounted for a solid 70 percent of total output. Exports from China's largest State run medicine trader, China National Medicines and Health Care Products Import and Export Corporation, reached $78 million last year.
