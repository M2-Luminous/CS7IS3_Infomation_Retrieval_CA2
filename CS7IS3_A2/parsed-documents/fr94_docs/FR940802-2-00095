FR940802-2-00095 FR940802-2-00054 The proposed rule change brings the issue of eligibility, both as a threshold matter and with respect to disputes among the parties over eligibility, within the authority of the Director of Arbitration to decide. The threshold test will remain the sufficiency of the allegations in a claim. Sufficiency in this context does not require the claimant to sustain the burden of proof of eligibility to any level, it is merely an inquiry into whether the claim on its face states when the events or occurrences giving rise to the claim occurred. If the facts alleged in a claim are ambiguous or are not sufficient on their face to determine if a claim is eligible for arbitration, the staff will advise the claimant and request modification of the statement of claim. If the claimant does not modify the statement of claim to permit a determination of eligibility, the Director will determine if the claim is eligible on the basis of the claim as stated. 15 If the modification discloses facts which show that the claim is ineligible, it will be rejected as ineligible. The inquiry to be made by the Director in these instances is objective and goes to the existence of statements of facts in the claim, not subjective weighing of evidence. 15 A statement of claim will generally be regarded as insufficient to determine eligibility if it cannot be determined from its plain language whether any part of the claim is based on occurrences or events less than six (6) years old. As stated above, if it appears that some part of the claim is based on occurrences or events less than six (6) years old, those portions may be submitted to arbitration. See supra n. 1, and discussion of bifurcation infra. Under the proposed rule change, in the event a respondent disputes the facts alleged by the claimant as supporting the eligibility of the claim following the threshold determination that the claim is eligible, the respondent carries a heavy burden of showing that the timing of the events or occurrences giving rise to the claim are other than those alleged by the claimant. In the absence of proof that is not subject to reasonable dispute that the claim is ineligible, the Director will presume that the claim is eligible. Paragraph 2(a) of the Commission's January 31, 1994 letter identified a distinction between then-proposed Subsections 15(a) and 15(b) in that the latter sets forth a procedure for determining eligibility, while the former does not. The NASD agrees with the Commission's concerns and has amended the proposed rule change pursuant to Amendment No. 1 to clarify the procedures. Amendment No. 1 also addresses the concern set forth in paragraph 2(b) of the January 31, 1994, letter about the effect of a threshold determination of eligibility on the claimant's right to seek a judicial remedy. With respect to the question in paragraph 3 of the January 31, 1994 letter, the proposed rule contemplates that eligibility will be determined prior to the appointment of the arbitrators, whether as a threshold matter only, as a result of a challenge by a respondent or both. The NASD believes that the amendments described herein contemplate that eligibility determinations made by the Director are final and that such determinations resolve the question of whether a claim can be submitted to arbitration. Once submitted, the issue cannot be revisited. 16 Disputes over eligibility must be raised and resolved within the context of the process described in proposed new Section 15, or they are waived. The NASD does not believe an amendment is required to address this issue. 16 The NASD recognizes that new facts relevant to an eligibility determination could arise through an amendment to the claim pursuant to Section 39(b) of the Code, which requires the consent of the arbitrators before an amendment to the pleadings is permitted. Because the NASD intends that the determination of eligibility will occur before a matter is submitted to the arbitrators, an amendment to the claim permitted by the arbitrators under Section 39(b) would not reopen the eligibility issue for the arbitrators or for anyone else to decide. Responses to Commenters With respect to the arguments of the commenters that the proposed rule change contradicts the holdings of various courts on the issue of eligibility determinations, 17 the NASD does not agree. Arbitration is a creature of contract, AT&T Technologies, supra, and it is for the parties, through the choice of a forum, to determine the terms of the contract. See, e.g., U.S. Steelworkers v. Warrior Gulf Navigation Co., 363 U.S. 574 (1960). There is, therefore, no impediment erected by the courts which would prevent the NASD from adopting a rule which permits the Director of Arbitration to decide issues affecting access to the NASD's arbitration forum. further, the proposed rule, by its terms, does not affect the substance of a claim_an eligibility determination by the Director does not bar a party from asserting the claim in court. 17 Wilmes, Friedman. Another commenter asserted that under the proposed rule the Director of Arbitration would be conducting fact-finding hearings to determine eligibility. 18 The proposed rule will not produce such a result. As discussed in more detail above, eligibility will be determined as a matter of the sufficiency of the allegations in a statement of claim, not as a subjective decision regarding disputed facts. 18 Friedman. Finally, a third commenter 19 raised four issues: (1) whether the time limit for filing a claim under the proposed eligibility rule can be tolled; (2) whether the proposed rule will permit the Director of Arbitration to bifurcate claims by declining to take jurisdiction over ineligible portions of a claim; (3) how bifurcated claims will proceed; and (4) whether it is fair to bar a party from seeking to enforce an agreement to arbitrate where the claim has been ruled ineligible. 19 Miller.
