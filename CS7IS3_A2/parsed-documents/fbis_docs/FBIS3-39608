"The threat of air strikes is a political means of applying pressure. Such a threat is only credible if it is carried out," said Kooijmans. According to Ter Beek, the air strikes will be limited to the area around Sarajevo. Cancelled Neither Kooijmans nor Ter Beek said precisely when air strikes would begin. Ter Beek did cancel a planned working trip to Norway combined with a visit to the Olympic Games in Lillehammer. "I would have been back by Monday evening, but the ultimatum expires on Sunday evening, and I would have not been very calm there," said Ter Beek just before the beginning of the debate in the Chamber. According to Kooijmans, the decision to deploy Netherlands F-16's in the air strikes was very tough for the government. "The risks for the troops on the ground and civilian aid workers cannot be taken lightly." However, Kooijmans seemed to be only partly in agreement with Chamber members who said that the ultimatum appeared to be working: "There is insufficient progress. In addition, the Serb leaders are making contradictory statements. Milosevic and Karadzic are prepared to take steps, while some military leaders are not." Guarded According to Kooijmans, the West cannot be satisfied with "monitoring" at a distance, for example with the help of radar. "That is not sufficient inspection." The heavy weapons taken over by the United Nations must be guarded by UN men, perhaps in a central location, before being destroyed. Mr. De Hoop Schoffer (of the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal]) called on the government to use the five days left before the ultimatum expires to exert a maximum amount of political pressure. He also asked the Second Chamber to be directly involved in every successive step. Earlier in the day, Ter Beek stated that the United Nations' request for extra military personnel for the UN peacekeeping force in Bosnia was not directed at the Netherlands. The Netherlands will shortly have some 3,100 military personnel stationed in or in the area immediately around the former Yugoslavia.
