However, the Social Democratic Party [SDP] is unable to understand the party's major losses in this months Gallup opinion poll. It is understandable that the Center Democrats should be losing voters after the infamous affair involving Bente Juncker, the former social affairs minister who accused the head of an institution of the sexual abuse of the mentally subnormal. Such are the comments from several Social Democrats after BERLINGSKE TIDENDE's new Gallup poll today. On the other hand they are unable to understand why the Social Democrats have lost more than 4.2 percent of voter support since the February poll. However, Interior Minister Birte Weiss (Social Democratic Party) is well able to understand why the Liberal Party is "slowly but surely" continuing its downturn -- this time from 26.9 percent to 25.8 percent of votes. "The closer we come to the elections, the greater will be the nervousness of those drifting voters who have sought refuge with the Liberal Party," Interior Minister Birte Weiss said. She also said that Liberal Party chairman Uffe Ellemann-Jensen's "unsavory manner" is gradually causing voters to beg off. Conservative People's Party leader Hans Engell is extremely satisfied with his party's continued success. He stressed that "people must now count on a Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party majority as a real possibility." And he believes that Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is facing a reverse "prime minister effect" [the effect of increased support in opinion polls for the party providing the prime minister in a coalition government]: "There is much to indicate that Nyrup Rasmussen is pulling everything down for the Social Democrats," Engell said.
