Unfortunately, the political course that the President intends to pursue is not as obvious. A few days before Air Force One starts the flight across the Atlantic, hectic activities can be observed in Washington, which, in numerous background talks, is trying to give the impression that the various and often disparate elements of U.S. European policy all serve one purpose -- to imbue new contents to the alliance after the end of the Cold War, encourage the reform policy in the countries of the former East Bloc, and open to them the paths to the community of Western states. For this purpose, the White House devised a plan intended to concentrate the conflicting interests in Europe under the name of "Partnership for Peace." The "partnership" is intended to facilitate cooperation between the former Warsaw Pact members and NATO without extending to them the alliance's security guarantee. In Warsaw, Budapest, and Prague, it was, thus, described as a plan whose most important task is to deny them speedy membership, not least to enable Clinton to assure the Russian president that NATO was not intending to isolate Russia. Clinton said that "we want to avoid the impression that we are creating a new dividing line in Europe after having worked for decades to eliminate the old one." Such arguments can also be heard in a similar form from Moscow. It is no coincidence. The congruence makes it clear that the Clinton administration is obviously determined to concede the highest priority to promoting the democratic developments in Russia in its European policy -- also out of security considerations. The Americans believe that accepting the three former communist countries into NATO would threaten the Russian reform process. It was particularly Polish President Lech Walesa who strongly warned against such a view. It might rather contribute to destabilize the situation in his country and in the other young democracies and to expose them to Russian pressure for hegemony. Yet, Clinton obviously thinks that this risk is acceptable and intends to elaborate on his position during his meeting with the politicians of these countries in Prague, a position which, he said, was "misunderstood" in East Europe. The American position is biased in favor of Russia without an appropriate counterweight. Many of its critics at home, including, among others, Robert Zoellick, who served as undersecretary in the State Department in the Bush administration, are convinced that the persuasiveness and the credibility of this policy would be greater even vis-a-vis Moscow if the "Partnership for Peace" plan were to contain a set of firm criteria and a schedule for accepting new members to NATO instead of a rather vague offer for cooperation. At the moment, America's economic policy toward the former Soviet empire appears similarly unbalanced and leaning toward Russia. While, after the collapse of the communist-controlled economies, there was wide agreement among Western governments that only a resolute implementation of reforms based on the market economy could create the basis for economic recovery, Washington recently expressed its doubts about whether such a policy is correct. Under the impact of the result of the Russian election of December, which brought considerable gains to antireform forces, Clinton's leading Russia strategist, Strobe Talbott, announced the necessity of a slower reform pace to undermine the basis for the demagogic arguments of the reactionary forces. Talbott, who has since been nominated by Clinton as deputy secretary of state, said that the "shock therapy," which has so far been pursued, has proved a failure; more therapy and less shock will be necessary in the future. One may now well discuss whether the policy that has so far been applied was applied in the right doses, but the assumption that the pace of reform was too high puts the actual facts upside down. The White House has obviously also realized that and initiated attempts for a retreat. One spokesman said that Talbott was misinterpreted, but he failed to deliver the appropriate interpretation. What remains is the impression of a certain confusion in America's East European policy. Out of fear of a setback for the democratic development in Russia, it evades to orient itself by clear principles and, instead, is guided by the short-term aspects of day-to-day politics.
