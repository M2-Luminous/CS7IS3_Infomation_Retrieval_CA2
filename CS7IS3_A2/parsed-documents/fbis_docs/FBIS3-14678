The criticism came as authorities prepared to take legal action against two newspapers for reports on the investigation into the bombing of a Maronite Christian church and allegations that a leading suspect was beaten up in custody. Ten people were killed and 54 wounded when a bomb exploded in the Our Lady of Deliverance Church in Zuq Mika'il, north of Beirut, on February 27. "In five days a party was dissolved, radios and televisions were silenced and (now) they are after newspapers," said the pro-Syrian AL-DIYAR daily on Monday. "Is the government of Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri trying to transform the country into a big jail?," asked the daily's political commentator. Newspaper publisher and Lebanon's former ambassador to the United Nations Ghassan Tuwayni blasted Information Minister Michel Samahah describing him as a "little Goebbels." "We fear the country will become a third world dictatorship with tribunals like those of the 1930s under Stalin," said Tuwayni in a front-page editorial in his Arabic-language daily AL-NAHAR. Tuwayni, who up until now supported al-Hariri's government, called for a cabinet reshuffle. Authorities last week charged that seven out of nine suspects in the bombing were members of the disbanded Christian Lebanese Forces militia. The group, which became a political party in 1991, was outlawed after its deputy leader Fu'ad Malik, was arrested as part of the inquiry. The cabinet also banned private radio and television stations from broadcasting news and political programs from midnight Wednesday until parliament approved legislation to regulate the media. The ban restricted news coverage to the state-run Tele Liban and Radio Liban. The state-run National News Agency (ANI) said the state prosecutor would take action Monday against AL-DIYAR over a report alleging that Malik was beaten while under arrest. Action would also be taken against the pro-Syrian newspaper AL- SAFIR which alleged the Israeli Shin Beth internal security service had "planned the attack on the church," according to ANI. ANI said legal officials had "warned against any violation of the secrecy surrounding the investigation and maintain they will take action against anyone publishing information without official proof."
