FR940324-1-00046 FR940324-1-00016 47 CFR Part 73 [MM Docket No. 94&hyph;26] Radio Broadcasting Services; Pago Pago, American Samoa AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Commission, on its own motion, requests comments on the proposed deletion of Channel 266C1 from Pago Pago, American Samoa. Western Samoa has recently assigned an FM station to operate on Channel 266 which conflicts with the American Samoa allotment. Should an interest be expressed in applying for a Class C1 channel at Pago Pago, the Commission proposes to allot Channel 226C1 as a replacement channel. Channel 226C1 can be allotted in compliance with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements without the imposition of a site restriction, at coordinates South Latitude 14&hyph;16&hyph;41 and West Longitude 170&hyph;42&hyph;09. DATES: Comments must be filed on or before May 12, 1994, and reply comments on or before May 27, 1994. ADDRESSES: Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Leslie K. Shapiro, Mass Media Bureau, (202) 634&hyph;6530.
