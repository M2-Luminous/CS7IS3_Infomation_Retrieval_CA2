The general interest in environmental affairs led to a great deal of publicity about the event in all of the countries bordering on the Baltic. In Finland too there was talk of the "mother of all saltwater discharges" and an abundance of stormy years was predicted. There had, as we know, been saltwater discharges before then too, but only a very few researchers knew about their flow and its consequences: It was only in January 1993 that the first discharge of the information generation entered the Baltic. This whole natural spectacle is incredibly complex. This is why a saltwater flow does not just like that lead to big harvests of storms, as was the case after some of the earlier ones. Five hundred cubic kilometers of freshwater annually enters the Baltic catchment area. If salty ocean water from the North Sea did not occasionally get into the Baltic, the latter's salt content would gradually diminish. Saltwater flows enter it through the Danish straits across a low threshold. Since, because of this, it is North Sea surface water, it is abundantly supplied with oxygen. But since it contains more salt than the water of the Baltic, it is heavier and sinks to the depths of the Baltic. Flows Come at Long Intervals However, water only flows from the North Sea into the Baltic under certain conditions. The prerequisites for this are that there be an east wind over the straits and that the surface of the Baltic be lower than that of the North Sea. Flows into and out of the Baltic usually last only a few days and the effect of the flows does not extend over a very long period. In some years -- usually in winter -- however, a continuous, incoming flow is produced that lasts for even weeks on end. Then the water coming from the North Sea gets so far into the Baltic that it does not get back into the direction of flow into the North Sea after turning [at the east end of the Baltic]. Such big water flows occur only a few times in a century, but their effects are felt for a long time. The last big discharge was in the winter of 1975-76. Since then, the salt content of the Baltic has been constantly diminishing and that is also why the density of the water has been reduced -- the water has "gotten lighter." Because of this, a big ocean water discharge is increasingly more likely. Oxygen is needed to decompose the plankton. Since the layer of water adjacent to the bottom is not renewed, its oxygen is depleted. However, oxygen is not the only substance that bacteria use to be able to decompose the plankton. The most important of the others is saltwater sulphate, which is transformed into hydrogen sulfide during this decomposition process. Hydrogen sulfide kills nearly every living thing on the sea floor. Before the arrival of the saltwater flow, the hydrogen sulfide layer extended from the floor of the central basin of the Baltic, that is, from a depth of 250 meters, to a depth of as little as about 130 meters. Hydrogen Sulfide Uses Up Oxygen Last February the water surged into the Baltic for about three weeks. Danish and Swedish measuring stations estimated that the volume of the incoming flow was about 310 cubic kilometers. This was one of the "big" discharges of our century. They knew that large amounts of hydrogen sulfide and nutrients had accumulated on the floor of the Baltic. They feared that this old water would be set in motion and rise to the surface in the southern part of the Archipelago Sea and the Gulf of Finland, where it would result in a sharp increase in algae production. Nevertheless, this did not happen that time. What happened? From the standpoint of the heavy incoming mass of water, the Baltic develops into a series of basins. After the threshold formed by the Danish straits, the water flows into the Arkona area, which forms a shallow, flat basin. The mixing of the water was so turbulent in the Arkona that it reduced this mother of all discharges to about a third of its original size. Some of the water continued on its way into the 100-meter-deep Bornholm Basin, which has a volume of 50 cubic kilometers. From the Bornholm the saltwater flow went on to the central basin of the Baltic, the Gotland Basin. The flow moves slowly: It took from four to six months to cover this 600-km distance. So, no more than about 100 cubic km of relatively salty and oxygen-rich water was reaching the central basin of the Baltic in the early summer of 1993. In it there was sea water discharged originally from the North Sea into the Baltic and old Baltic water from the depths of the Arkona and Bornholm basins. There were 10-12 g/m[.sup]3[/] of oxygen in the North Sea surface water, but no more than a third of that oxygen, about 4 g/m[.sup]3[/], in the water that was entering the central basin. So, 100 cubic kilometers of water brought 400,000 tons of fresh oxygen into the deep water of the central basin of the Baltic. However, a whole basinful, about 250 cubic kilometers, of old water containing hydrogen sulfide was waiting for the new water. There had been time enough for about 5 g/m[.sup]3[/] on average, or all told over a million tons, of hydrogen sulfide to form. It takes roughly 2 tons of oxygen to convert 1 ton of hydrogen sulfide into a harmless form. So, even though an abundance of oxygen rolled into the central basin, it could only handle a small portion of the hydrogen sulfide that was in the basin. Thresholds Protect Gulf of Bothnia This is why they think that, if a new mass of relatively unmixed water rapidly pushes its way into the central basin, it may shove the light water in it, which contains a lot of hydrogen sulfide, toward the Archipelago Sea and the Gulf of Finland. The Gulf of Bothnia is protected because the underwater thresholds formed by the continuations of the Salpausselka and the shallows on the south side of the Aland Sea keep the water near the northern [arm of the Baltic] from advancing. Nevertheless, the pressure of the saltwater that entered the Baltic in January 1993 was great enough to push the old water from the central basin to the floor of the Gulf of Finland. This caused a slight drop in sedimentation and oxygen content on the bottom. As a result, there will obviously be a shortage of oxygen in the deep waters of the Gulf of Finland over the next few years and bottom-dwelling fauna will suffer because of it. As it rises to the surface, this water containing phosphates will probably somewhat increase the growth of plankton, especially offshore of Hanko and on the eastern side of Suursaari. The production of algae will not, however, accelerate out of the ordinary. The future of the Gulf of Finland will continue to depend on whether we get the abundant nutrient discharges at the eastern end of the Baltic under control. Flows Come in Successive Years The flow that occurred in January 1993 was already so mixed at the start of its journey that the increase in salinity -- and hence density -- it caused was not very significant. The water of the Baltic deeps is still "light" and the situation is still favorable for a new flow. Actually, the situation is an exciting one: The way has been cleared for a new flow and there has not been time for the hydrogen sulfide to form to any extent. The bulk of a new flow will no longer be expended on disposing of the hydrogen sulfide, but it will be enough to renew the bottom-dwelling animal population. North Sea flows very often come in series, in successive years. The disturbance in the rhythm of the water exchange that has been going on for nearly two decades also illustrates how delicate the oxygen balance in the Baltic is. If there is a continuation of the 1993 flow in the near future, we may hope that, after this disturbance in its rhythm that has lasted for nearly 20 years now, the water exchange in the Baltic will return to its normal beat. Last Winter's Saltwater Flow Got as Far as Gotland Basin The Baltic needs the saltwater that comes from the North Sea through the Danish straits. However, this saltwater flow is only rarely strong enough for it to affect the entire Baltic. Last winter the incoming flow lasted three weeks. The last big discharge prior to that was in the winter of 1975-76. The oxygen of the bottom water layers was exhausted because of the long interval between flows. When the oxygen was lacking, bacteria produced hydrogen sulfide, which kills nearly every form of life, near the sea floor. A year ago there was a layer of hydrogen sulfide in the central basin of the Baltic that extended to a depth of about 130 meters from the bottom. Last January 310 cubic km of oxygen-rich, North Sea surface water entered the Baltic. Since it was salty, it was heavier than the water of the Baltic, which is why it advanced along the bottom. The water flowed from the Danish straits into the shallow, flat Arkona Basin. Some of the water drifted back into the Kattegat area and some of it continued on its way into the Bornholm Basin, which has a volume of 50 cubic km. Once that basin was filled, the excess water went on to the Gotland Basin, which received 100 cubic km of fairly salty, oxygenated water. This 100 cubic km of water carried with it 400,000 tons of new oxygen. Lying in wait for it, however, were 250 cubic km of old water containing a million tons of hydrogen sulfide. There was not enough oxygen to dispose of all of the hydrogen sulfide. The pressure of the saltwater pushed the old water of the Gotland Basin into the Gulf of Finland. The oxygen content on the bottom of the latter dropped. Over the next few years there will probably be a shortage of oxygen in the deep waters of the Gulf of Finland and bottom-dwelling fauna will suffer because of it. The growth of plankton will probably increase somewhat.
