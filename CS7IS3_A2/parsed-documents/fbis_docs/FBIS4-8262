Jiri Sitler of the President's Office confirmed the information for CTK. Sitler said the president would speak about his reasons for signing in more detail during his regular Sunday radio address tomorrow. The congress had decided to ask President Vaclav Havel, through either a declaration, resolution or letter, not to sign the amendment into law. The deadline for signing the law was midnight tonight. Frantisek Klima, chairman of the Union of Public Road Transportation, suggested the congress call a 10-15-minute general strike if Havel signed the law, but the new CMKOS chairman, Richard Falbr, rebuffed the idea, saying it was necessary as soon as possible "to establish order among ourselves." "Don't expect this congress to call a general strike," he said. His words were met with applause from congress delegates. Falbr said he had expected Havel to sign the law, since it would be difficult for him to defy the government coalition. The parts of the amendment that most disturb the unions are those defining work agreements for fixed periods of time and regulating night shift work for pregnant women. On March 22, about 40,000 union members from throughout the country gathered on Prague's Old Town Square to protest the amendment. Parliament passed the amendment the following day, vetoing all opposition amendments to the amendment.
