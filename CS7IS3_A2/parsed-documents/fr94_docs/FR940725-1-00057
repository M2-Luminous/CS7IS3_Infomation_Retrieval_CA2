FR940725-1-00057 FR940725-1-00010 Section 23.67␣Climb: One Engine Inoperative This proposal would reorganize §23.67 for harmonization with the JAR; and would require WAT limits for some airplanes; require wings level climb up to 400 feet for commuter category airplanes, and make minor changes in airplane configuration requirements. Revised §23.67(a) would specify the climb requirements for non-WAT airplanes with no change in requirements for those airplanes. Proposed §23.67(b) would specify climb requirements for WAT airplanes. WAT criteria would be applied for both reciprocating engine-powered airplanes of more than 6,000 pounds maximum weight and turbine engine-powered airplanes. (See the discussion of WAT limits in the proposed change to §23.45.) Turbine engine-powered airplanes are currently subject to limited WAT limitations under §23.67(c), which would be incorporated into proposed §23.67(b). The takeoff flap position for normal, utility, and acrobatic category reciprocating engine-powered airplanes of 6,000 pounds or less is changed to ``wing flaps retracted'' from ``most favorable position'' (current §23.67(4)). Wing flaps retracted is the position most used in certification and in service for this size of airplane. The proposed change is contained in §23.67(a)(1)(iv), (a)(2)(iv), and (b)(2)(iv). Current §23.67(d) is deleted since all climb speeds (both all-engine and one engine inoperative) are scheduled and the determination of V Y is no longer required. V Y is also proposed to be deleted in all other sections of part 23 for the same reason. Current §23.67(e) for commuter category airplanes would be redesignated as §23.67(c) with no change in requirements except that the takeoff climb with landing gear extended must be conducted with the landing gear doors open. This is a conservative approach offered by the JAA to specify a definite gear door configuration and to delete the requirement to determine performance during the transient condition of gear doors opening and closing. Proposed §23.67(c)(1) specifies that the first segment climb must be conducted with the wings level and further specifies that the climb speed for the segment must be V 2 instead of the current requirement for a range of speeds from V LOF and whatever the applicant selects at gear retraction. Proposed §23.67(c)(2) requires conducting the second segment climb with wings level, which would be appropriate for operational scenarios. The current §23.67(e)(1) requirements are partially moved to §23.67(c) and the remainder are contained in §23.63(a)(1) and (d). Proposed §23.67(c)(3), enroute climb, adds a minimum climb speed to ensure an adequate margin above stall speed. The proposed §23.67(c)(4) makes no substantive changes in the current requirements of §23.67(e)(3) but does change the paragraph heading from ``Approach'' to ``Discontinued approach.'' In addition, proposed §23.67(c)(4) clarifies that the climb gradients must be met at an altitude of 400 feet above the landing surface. Section 23.69␣Enroute Climb/Descent Proposed new §23.69 would require the determination of all engine and one-engine-inoperative climb/descent rates and gradients in the enroute configuration under all operational WAT conditions. This information is necessary for enroute flight planning and dispatch. Climb speeds are specified to provide a margin above V SI . Section 23.71␣Glide: Single-engine Airplanes Proposed new §23.71 would require the determination of glide distance and speed for single-engine airplanes. The information is necessary for flight planning and for providing the pilot with information from which to make informed decisions. Section 23.73␣Reference Landing Approach Speed Proposed new §23.73 would define the reference landing approach speeds, V REF . Establishing a definition for these speeds simplifies the use of V REF in other portions of the rule. The V REF speeds for the various category airplanes are established as not less than 1.3 V S0 . Also, the established speeds consider the appropriate relationship to V MC determined under §23.149.
