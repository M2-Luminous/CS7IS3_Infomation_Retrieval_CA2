These are camps where soldiers sent here in 1997 are being trained. This will be a PR exercise. No more, no less. Or, re-phrased in the language of the Cold War, a campaign to win the hearts and minds of Hong Kong people. It's a good start. Hong Kong people have to get used to the PLA and vice versa. The last thing we would want to see in 1997 is the PLA regarded as an occupation army. Or the PLA treating the Hong Kong population with hostility. Widespread anxiety about a PLA presence is a fact of life. The reasons are historical. Beijing is aware of this, otherwise it would not have gone to such lengths to select and train the men and women who will be stationed here. Their special preparation includes the study of Hong Kong laws, way of life, languages (Cantonese and English), and all the nitty-gritty which makes this territory so exasperatingly unique. Regular visits to the Guangdong camps by Hong Kong people will foster understanding, goodwill and -- hopefully -- lasting bonds. Hong Kong Affairs Advisers and the territory's National People's Congress deputies appear to be at the top of the PLA invitation list, presumably because they are important people. Giving important people first crack is, of course, the Chinese-way in such matters. But if the object of this exercise is winning hearts and minds, the people who matter are the ordinary folk. Will the common folk get invited? Or are invitations to be confined to community leaders? Will grassroots leaders like District Board [DB] members get a chance to visit the camps? Will all these people -- DB members or common people -- have to pass political muster, meaning their views must be acceptable to China? These are some of the questions which need to be asked. Because the converted have less anxieties about a PLA presence than the apolitical majority or those opposed to the transfer of sovereignty. Inviting only the converted will not advance the PLA cause of building bridges, making friends. Ultimately the whole population has to get along with the PLA, and vice versa. There are other areas the PLA can usefully explore to achieve its aims. Inviting university undergrads to participate in language training would help to foster better understanding between the young soldiers and Hong Kong youth. Another way would be to liaise with the Hong Kong Administration to enable batches of PLA men to visit the territory informally, to familiarise them with the sights and sounds of Hong Kong. If this was done on a regular basis, the PLA contingent would not be total strangers on arrival in 1997. If the Hong Kong Administration is sincere about a smooth transition, it would offer to arrange such familiarisation tours without waiting to be asked. It would also be reassuring to Hong Kong people if China could enact laws covering the behaviour of its troops in the territory speedily and disseminate them. This way both Hong Kong people and the individual soldiers would know exactly what each other's rights and responsibilities are. Hong Kong people want to be assured that PLA men posted here would be subjected to the rule of law. They would want to be assured, too, that their public behaviour would be subject to civilian control. What goes on within the camp where Hong Kong people and Hong Kong interests are not involved is another matter. But a PLA officer who gets involved in a drunken brawl with a local in Wan Chai, or runs up a bill he cannot settle must be subject to local laws. If a soldier has committed an offence outside his camp and the aggrieved party is a local, it would be most reassuring to know that a policeman can arrest him and deal with him under Hong Kong laws, without a superior PLA officer having the right to intervene. The PLA, undoubtedly, has this in mind. But, for most people here, seeing will be believing. The PLA is not the monster that a minority in Hong Kong have made it out to be. But the PLA is made up of many soldiers, all human beings. And Hong Kong is a city of countless temptations. Hong Kong people are also far more individualistic than their mainland counterparts. The PLA is off to a good start. But it needs to keep in mind at all times its aim to endear itself to Hong Kong people.
