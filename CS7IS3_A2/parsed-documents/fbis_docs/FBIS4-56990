Rear Admiral Luis Cabrera Aguirre, the highest-ranking officer still being held, left San Carlos Garrison accompanied by Colonel Higinio Castro, Air Force Col. Jorge Garrido, Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo Delon Romana, Lt. Col. Jose Villarroel, Major David Monagas, Maj. Oscar Perez Escalona, and Navy Captain Carlos Reyes Rodriguez. A large number of relatives were at the doors of the stockade waiting for the order to be carried out. The soldiers reported to their commanding officers to submit a six-month leave request of sorts. During this six months the officers will remain under the orders of the Defense Ministry and will not be given operational duties of any kind. The terms of the discontinuance orders state that once the leave period is up, they may request their discharge. Because of this, the soldiers refused to make any statements to the media. Rear Adm. Luis Cabrera Aguirre said that the defense minister gave them his word of honor that he would allow other implicated soldiers to return to active duty. Maj. Pedro Alastre and Lt. Eliecer Otaiza accepted the leave order. [Alastre] We have left active duty and are simply going on leave. [Otaiza] The leave is for six months and I will decide on whether to request dismissal or not later. My generation retires in January of next year. He said that the minister of defense is studying the current situation of other officers involved in the second coup attempt. It boils down to whether President Rafael Caldera agrees to sign these new acquittals. Col. Higino Castro is in the Military Hospital suffering from a difficult illness. In Fort Tiuna's Lino de Clemente Battalion there are six officers under arrest who could receive their discontinuances in the next few hours.
