"If North Korea strives to secede from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Russia will be forced to gradually begin solving the problem: make a warning and then the world community should adopt a decision on imposing sanctions on North Korea", Russian President Boris Yeltsin told a press conference on Thursday. He added, however, that it is premature to speak about sanctions as no decision has been yet adopted on convening an international conference on the nuclear problem of North Korea. Yeltsin also said that both the Russian and South Korean leaderships are "greatly concerned about what is happenong in the People's Democratic Republic of Korea (PDRK) taken into consideration its direct closeness to the Russian eastern borders". "We cannot be indifferent to how the PDRK treats the earlier signed Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and are ready to act", Yeltsin said and admitted that the problem has been delayed for too long and "has no positive solution so far". The Russian president said that he may discuss the problem with his US counterpart. Speaking on the Soviet-North Korean friendship and cooperation treaty of 1961, Yeltsin recalled that an amendment had been introduced to its first article which envisaged an immediate military help to Pyongyang if the latter was attacked. Now "there is no strict provision envisaging that we help and side with the PDRK", Yeltsin said.
