It bears the signatures of the president, the government, the chambers of the Federal Assembly, a number of parties, trade unions, public movements, and religious faiths, and the representatives of the overwhelming majority of Russian regions. How should this event be evaluated? Here is the president's opinion: "The treaty will make it possible to unite all society around our biggest problems. We will resolve them if we are able to counter fragmentation and mutual enmity with collaboration based on dialogue." And here we have a diametrically opposed assessment, that of Communist leader G. Zyuganov: The treaty "tries to preserve the misguided tenedencies which have led to the destabilization of society and state" and is an "ultimatum demanding the complete capitulation of the opposition." What kind of document is it, then, which can produce such diametrically opposed assessments? Perhaps it proclaims objectives which do not suit Russian citizens? Let us look at what seems to be the most crucial section -- the section on overcoming the socioeconomic crisis. Here the government pledges in this current year to reduce inflation; to achieve an increase in investment activity; to draft a tax blueprint which will provide incentives for the development of production; to develop the structural reorganization of the economy; to take measures to clear budgetary arrears in the payment of wages; to pursue a vigorous social policy to achieve stabilization and then raise living standards; and to draw up an employment program. None of this (if only it were actually realized) would seem to be a cause for rejection on the part of citizens. Nor are the pledges in the treaty to take measures to consolidate the economic, political, and legal area of Russia, to organize a single labor market, and ensure citizens' safety. So what is the problem, then? Why did not all those invited to sign the treaty do so? They did not sign because to a considerable extent they expected from the treaty what it cannot provide -- an accord not just on objectives but on ways of achieving them. The treaty proceeds from a different premise: Let us agree about the priority objectives and then seek the ways and means in calm, respectful dialogue rather than mounting the barricades and indulging in the mutual recriminations of which the country is tired. Such an approach has not suited everyone, albeit for different reasons. The Yabloko [Yavlinskiy Bloc] faction in the Duma, for example, considered that the objectives were formulated in such a general way that there was nothing on which to agree. And if the members of the faction have not gone to the barricades and nor do they intend to, so their signing it would make no sense. It is difficult to argue here: The formulation of the objectives in the treaty is indeed very general. But the problem is that you will not be able to make them specific while those involved in the political process wield clubs and seek to bludgeon their opponents. So, like it or not, the treaty signed in the Kremlin is no more than a kind of "nonaggression pact." Its point is simple: to place common interests above group, party, departmental, and regional interests and rule out the use of force to resolve problems in society. That is to say, the accord is principally about the need for civil peace. The treaty contains a minimum set of essential conditions in development of this. The parties to the treaty consider that only changes which will further the stabilization of the situation in society should be made to the Constitution and that the relevant proposals should be prepared via conciliation procedures. A pledge is taken not to initiate early elections to the federal organs of power. The organizers of rallies and demonstrations and the organs of power and law and order at local level assume not just legal but moral and political liability for ensuring the peaceful nature of such actions. The trade unions pledge not to carry out strikes which have no direct bearing on questions of wages, working conditions, or job retention, while state organs and entrepreneurs pledge to use conciliation procedures to settle labor conflicts and to provide trade unions with all requisite information. The parties to the treaty oppose the creation of any armed formations whatsoever by political parties, movements, or public associations. At the moment of signing the treaty it emerged that this set of conditions does not suit certain political forces. The Communists, who aim to change completely the present socioeconomic course and want to be free of all pledges, do not agree with it. But let us note that the proposed conditions do not bind the opposition and in no way exclude the possibility of political struggle, they merely channel it within a civilized context in order to reduce tension in society. The call for peaceful means of political struggle in no way suits the sundry extreme tendencies, which can operate only when a supercharged atmosphere prevails in society. Already on May Day V. Anpilov was calling at rallies for a general political strike, inflaming his hearers with abusive criticism of the government. The National Salvation Front, headed by I. Konstantinov, seems in general to know no slogan more constructive than "Down with!" But now is the right time to ask another question: How should we regard the treaty signed in the Kremlin, what hopes should we pin on it? First and foremost, we should not overestimate it, and we should not be complacent. If forces prepared to use any methods of struggle and ill-disposed toward constructive work under the present conditions of reality remain outside the treaty the danger of violence will loom over society one way or another. There will be attempts to exploit difficulties and stir up the mass of poverty-stricken people to... And yet the act of signing a treaty is, as a rule, as S. Shakhray correctly observed, "not the ceremonial outcome of the achievement of accord but the start of a long and complex search for it." From this standpoint, one has to agree with A. Sobchak when he stated that the actual fact of signing the treaty is more important than its text, as it shows society's desire for accord. And it is precisely that desire, expressed in such an authoritative form, which is to serve as the stabilizing factor. Otherwise we will not be able to overcome the crisis. In a situation where no single political force can impose its will on another, there is simply no alternative to accord because, let us repeat the words uttered in the Kremlin, "a fruitless, exhausting struggle will allow no one to work and will prevent even a single problem being solved."
