FBIS3-59114 "drweu018__a94006" FBIS-WEU-94-018-A Document Type:Daily Report 27 January 1994 ANNEX Inter-European Affairs EU Signs Agreement on Modernizing CIS Payment Systems BR2601142394 Brussels RAPID Database in English 26 Jan 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR2601142394 Brussels RAPID Database Language: English Article Type:BFN [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/42: "EU Supports Payment and Clearing Systems in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus"] [Text] Assistance to countries of the former USSR under the TACIS [Technical Assistance to CIS] program took a major step forward last week with the signing of a contract for nearly ECU2 million to provide expert advice for the modernization of their payment and clearing systems. The main beneficiary is the Central Bank of Russia, but substantive assistance is also being provided for a new institution, the Inter State Bank, and for the central banks of Ukraine and Belarus. The contractor is a Spanish-British consortium led by the Sema group of Spain. Despite initiatives to combat fraud, organize clearing houses, reduce delays and improve payment security, considerable problems remain in the payment systems of the NIS [newly independent states] countries. It can still take several weeks until a payment is made between, for example, Vladivostok and St. Petersburg. This inhibits the development of trade both within the countries as well as between the NIS. In particular, the lack of a multilateral clearing institution between the NIS central banks has been seen as a major deficiency and has led to the setting up of an Inter State Bank to serve this purpose. These problems are moreover associated with a worrying lack of transparency on the net position of credits and liabilities between banks, and between banks and their customers, implying possible hidden insolvency problems. Meanwhile, private individuals continue to distrust the banking system. Not surprisingly therefore, modernization and upgrading of the NIS payment and clearing systems has been seen as a priority in designing technical assistance to strengthen the NIS central banks. The Commission earmarked funds for this purpose as part of wider efforts to assist the NIS central banks. The assistance is being delivered in close cooperation with other donors and NIS central banks. The assistance to the Russian Central Bank is being coordinated under the aegis of an international steering committee comprising the Commission, the IMF, other multilateral financing institutions and cooperating Western central banks, (Banque de France, Deutsche Bundesbank, Bank of England, U.S. Federal Reserve) and the OECD. In more detail, the TACIS assistance aims: i) To strengthen the capacity of the Central Bank of Russia to formulate and implement reform policy initiatives by providing a pool of highly qualified European payment system experts to the beneficiary institutions; ii) to provide training and expert assistance during the start-up phase of the Inter State Bank whose task is to put in place and manage an efficient interstate payment system among the NIS; and iii) to help the central banks of Ukraine and Belarus to cooperate successfully in making an improved interstate payment system work. In this regard, assistance to the Central Bank of Belarus will naturally take account of the recent agreement with Russia on monetary unification.
