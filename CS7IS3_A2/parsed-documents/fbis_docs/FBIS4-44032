If in the future someone threatens northern Europe it will be a threat not only to northern Europe, but also to the whole system of European cooperation. ``It is true that I do not believe that red-brown revanchism will win power in Russia. But if this were to happen, membership in the EU gives increased security. When Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark participate in the EU's common foreign and security policy there will be a clearer linkage between European and northern European stability. ``This is of significance for the three Baltic states. And for relations between West Europe and Russia, which only meet up here in the north,'' the prime minister said. [Michelsen] But could Sweden not come to be seen as an outpost of one of the great powers -- precisely that which our old policy of neutrality wanted to avoid? An outpost that the other great power (read: the former Soviet Union) would attack immediately when it came to the crunch? "They could suspect that we were part of the other side -- something that we were to a large extent, it has emerged," Carl Bildt said. "What has surprised me most in what has now emerged is the construction of bases. That we built air bases to receive large bombers returning after attacks on the Soviet Union. They were not based in Sweden, thank God. Instead they were to carry out their attacks on the Soviet Union from bases a long way away, and for them to be able then to get out of the unpleasantness Sweden had landing places ready. It is obvious that this was known in the Soviet Union. It is not particularly difficult to measure the length of the runways at airports. ``Now the situation is very different,'' Bildt said. ``Now we are entering into open cooperation with the other European democracies with the aim of achieving security and stability in Europe as a whole. ``This cannot be compared with the policy in the fifties and sixties when we played a role in the nuclear strategy of the Western side. A role that was brought to the knowledge of the government of the country and no one else. But known in the Soviet Union. ``Then, in the fifties and sixties, we had a confrontation between superpowers. Two systems stood armed against each other. The whole time there was a risk of nuclear war. This is something we no longer have. And the nuclear arms are becoming outdated. The nuclear balance means less and less and the bloc system is being broken up. Instead systems of cooperation are on their way. But dangers and instability could also arise in this new situation. And then the security and cooperation systems will mean a great deal.'' [Michelsen] What has the government achieved in respect of the submarine question? "We do not know much more about why violations occur. But we have theories that are better founded," Carl Bildt said. ``And Russian experts have attested that there are minisubmarines in our archipelagoes. But every `indication' is not a submarine. We had submarines here last summer, if on a somewhat limited scale. We have also seen a change in how they behave. And there have been certain indications this year too, even though they have not been fully analyzed yet. ``This is a very big security problem. We have moved forward in our contacts with the Russians. But we have not reached our goal,'' Bildt said. And he believes that it will be a long time before the submarine question is answered. So what chance does Carl Bildt think he has of remaining in office after the election? He has just lost a minister in his government and opinion poll figures have long been pretty awful for the government. But Bildt demonstrated a steely optimism. Most things are splendid. "It is really quite remarkable. We have done everything we said we would do. I have just dug out and reread the government declaration from October 1991. There is only one thing we have not managed to do. That was to make it possible to dentists to set up their own practices -- something that New Democracy blocked," Bildt said. "The Oresund bridge was the last big thing that still remained. We have cleared that hurdle now." [Michelsen] But despite this the opinion poll figures are so bad. "What is needed is a solid election campaign. Then the opposition will also find itself with its back against the wall with its alternatives being scrutinized. And then people will see that the only thing that is certain about the Social Democrats is that they will raise taxes significantly." [Michelsen] But has not the government pushed this message quite a lot of times? "But it has not hit home. It drowns in other issues," Carl Bildt said. "And do not forget that a third of voters make up their minds during the election campaign itself. An election is always a very open affair, regardless of the opinion poll figures." [Michelsen] But are not the Social Democrats usually good at election campaigns? "No, that is partly a myth. It is true that the Social Democrats still have a powerful machine. But now people are no longer as tied to authority and they do not accept diktats from the trade unions in the same way," Carl Bildt said. ``As a result the Social Democrats' relative upper hand in election campaigns has almost disappeared. ``They could find themselves in the psychologically difficult situation of having to fight an election campaign with opinion poll figures that are falling.'' Carl Bildt said that he is convinced that in four months' time he will still be leading a government consisting of the same four nonsocialist parties. "And I see no reason to change the government team. But this is up to the various parties. The choice of team players is not up to me."
