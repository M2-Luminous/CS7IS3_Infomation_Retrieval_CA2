Although the total is 11.9 percent higher than the present APBN [State Revenue and Expenditure Budget], the government will achieve some savings by setting development priorities and by determining to avoid waste and leaks. To accelerate state revenues from the nonoil and gas sectors, the government will depend to a greater extent on the contribution of the tax sector, which will reach 40.1 trillion rupiahs, or 69 percent of total domestic revenues. For that purpose, the government will continue to deregulate and debureaucratize in order to eliminate obstacles in the national economic system and to mobilize the efficient movement of funds. By stabilizing the institutionalization and the apparatus of all sectors, the goal of economic growth can be accelerated to 6.2 percent per annum. President Suharto made these and other statements when he delivered the Financial Memorandum and RAPBN for 1994-1995, the first year of the Sixth REPELITA [Five-Year Development Plan], to a plenary session of the DPR [Parliament] at the DPR Building in Jakarta yesterday. The entire Sixth Development Cabinet and ambassadors were present at the session, which was led by Wahono, chairman of the DPR/MPR [People's Consultative Assembly]. The president said that this 69.7 trillion rupiah RAPBN consists of 59.7 trillion rupiahs in domestic revenues and 10 trillion rupiahs in development revenues (cashing in foreign aid). The revenue projections assume a crude oil price of $16 per barrel. Routine expenditures will be 42.3 trillion rupiahs and development expenditures will be 27.4 trillion rupiahs. The gap between domestic revenues and routine expenditures means that the government will have savings of 17.4 trillion rupiahs. "This means that we will have an increased independent ability to fund development," said the president. The rise in the 1994-1995 RAPBN is actually not very different from the previous year's rise of 11.1 percent. But, the head of state said, in this budget year the government will not increase the wages of civil servants and of members of the Armed Forces. The government will also not make funds available for the construction of new buildings for government departments and nondepartmental institutions, either in the capital or in the provinces. The routine expense budget has in fact risen by 14.2 percent over last year to 42.3 trillion rupiahs, almost half of which is used to pay for the cost of the civil service, both in the capital and in the provinces. But the rise is just the result of last year's average 12-percent rise in civil service and Armed Forces salaries and of plans to increase the Armed Forces food subsidy from 1,800 to 3,000 rupiahs per person per day. Provincial Development According to the head of state, most of the development budget, 5.5 trillion rupiahs, will be devoted to provincial development. Of this, 5.3 trillion rupiahs will be in the form of INPRES [Presidential Instruction] funds, consisting of six programs: village INPRES, district-level INPRES, provincial-level INPRES, underdeveloped village INPRES, elementary school INPRES, and health INPRES. Twenty million rupiahs of underdeveloped-village INPRES funds (IDT) have been set aside for each village; 389 billion rupiahs will be spent on this. Village INPRES funds will be increased from 5.5 million rupiahs to 6 million rupiahs for each village. District-level INPRES funds will be increased by 135 percent to 2.4 trillion rupiahs, and provincial-level INPRES funds will be increased by 55 percent to 1.2 trillion rupiahs. On the other hand, elementary school INPRES funds will be decreased by 33 percent to 497 billion rupiahs, and health INPRES funds will stay at 393 billion rupiahs. Beginning with the first year of the Sixth REPELITA, the president said, a number of INPRES programs will be simplified by giving the provinces greater responsibility. This step is intended to develop a provincial autonomy which is more real, more compatible, more dynamic and more responsible, by placing greater emphasis on the district level. "This shows the great trust that we place on the abilities of our provincial development apparatus," said the head of state. Other big budget sectors are transportation at 5.2 trillion rupiahs, mining and energy at 3.5 trillion rupiahs, education at almost 3 trillion rupiahs, and the irrigation sector at 1.7 trillion rupiahs. Other sectors with budgets over 1 trillion rupiahs, the president said, are the defense and security sector at 1.2 trillion rupiahs and health at over one trillion rupiahs. The agricultural sector, which has been separated from irrigation, will receive 900 billion rupiahs, followed by the housing and residential sector at 888 billion rupiahs. "If other sectors do not receive large amounts of funding, it does not mean that they have a lower priority. They have low budgets because they have different needs from the sectors which require large investments," said the head of state. The industrial sector, which the president gave as an example, received a relatively small development budget of 450 billion rupiahs, even though industry is an important sector in the Sixth REPELITA. The reason, he continued, is that the business world, including the BUMN's [state-owned corporations], carry out industrial development. "The government guides and fosters it and creates a healthy climate for the growth of industry". The president stated that he had instructed his ministers to set precise priorities, to increase efficiency, to put a stop to waste and leaks, and to motivate their rank and file to work more actively and efficiently and to comply with our basic philosophy, so as to achieve optimal results. "In particular, I ask you to make sure that what we have built up to now--the infrastructures, facilities, production, projects, and buildings--are really treated well and cared for so that they function in an optimal way. There is no use in building something if what we build does not function as it should and there is no use in building something new if it is neglected over time," said the president firmly. Taxes Raised The president also said that we must continue to enhance the national economy, especially the industrial sector, which we depend on not only to provide employment, but which will also gradually take over the role of the agricultural sector. But he also warned that the agricultural sector will continue to play a strategic role and will still be an important means of livelihood for a large part of the work force. By stimulating the business world the government hopes that domestic revenues can best be gotten from tax revenues. With tax revenues of 40.1 trillion rupiahs, or 78.6 percent of total domestic revenues, it is hoped that the structure of state revenues will be able to face external fluctuations in a firmer and more dependable way. Taxes are the key to the success of future development. That is why the president asked everyone to be an honorable citizen and pay his tax obligations. "I especially direct this request to businessmen and to those who are fortunate enough to have greater income and assets than other members of society," the president added. Besides taxes as the primary contribution to nonoil and gas revenues, the government also still depends on development revenues of 10 trillion rupiahs. This figure is 4.8 percent higher than present development revenues. "This relatively small increase indicates the decreasing role of foreign aid and development expenditures." In another area, the president stated that economic growth, supported by steady economic stability, has stimulated the shift of the economic structure towards greater firmness and balance. In 1991 the role and contribution of industry surpassed the contribution of the agricultural sector--20.8 for the former and 19.6 percent for the latter. The dependency on petroleum is decreasing; in 1992 it contributed only 13 percent to national production. This also strengthened the acquisition of foreign exchange and state revenues. The development of the national economy is still very encouraging in 1993, even though there has been a slow-down in several sectors. Steps taken over the past few years to cool down the economic engine resulted in macroeconomic stability in 1993, even though the rate of inflation is still rather high. The president said that the 1993 current transaction deficit rose slightly over the previous year. The increase in nonoil and gas exports is rather impressive, even though it is not big enough to cover the increase in nonoil and gas imports. Foreign commercial loans by the private sector and by BUMNs, the head of state continued, began to slow down in 1992; on the other hand, foreign exchange reserves continued to rise and were sufficient to pay for five months of import needs. Deregulation and Debureaucratization The president admitted that positive economic development does not mean that the national economy no longer has any problems. "We must continue to guard against increases in the current transaction deficit and in the balance of payments. We must continue to maintain growth in next year's nonoil and gas exports so that the current transaction deficit remains below 2 percent of the gross national product. "I have asked all my ministers to be cautious and to refrain from easily proposing projects with commercial credit costs from foreign export credits". The president went on to say, "We must try as hard as possible to keep inflation in 1994 lower than in 1993," adding, "We must continue to implement cautious fiscal and monetary policies. We must safeguard those steps already taken to deregulate and debureaucratize," said the president. We must continue to carry out and complete the consolidation of the financial and banking sectors, including improvements in the system for examining banks and financial institutions so as to avoid any difficulties. We must gradually overcome any obstacles to the physical infrastructure, such as electricity, ports, roads and telecommunications, so that they do not obstruct economic growth. In the uncertain economic conditions of today's world, the president said, increasing exports will face serious constraints. The growth of economic blocs, the existence of various political issues connected to trade and economic cooperation, and the rise of new competitor nations can have an effect on increasing exports. "With the enactment of the GATT agreement of 1994, obstacles to world trade have decreased and this has given us the opportunity to increase exports on the international market. But the consequences are that the domestic market is also opening up and is facing competition. There is no other way; we must increase our ability to compete in the export market and to compete in the domestic market," said the president. Wahono's Introduction Meanwhile, Chairman of the DPR RI Wahono opened the session by saying that the DPR will always exercise political oversight over various government policies, supported by the results obtained from the Financial Auditing Board. This is an effort to help the president, in line with what he conveyed in his inauguration speech of March 1993, which hoped for the support, correction, and oversight of the DPR. "The Parliament is ready to form a Sixth REPELITA Special Committee, which will carry out a detailed, sector-by-sector examination of the economy, with the hope that responsibility will lie with the Sixth REPELITA, which spells out the 1993 GBHN [Main Outlines of National Direction]," he said. Wahono said that the Parliament hopes that various policies, such as those spelled out in the GBHN and its implementation, will really be supported by the ability, good will, hard work, and a high degree of discipline of the government bureaucracy. To match all of this he invited all members of the Parliament to carry out their tasks with greater quality and seriousness in the areas of legislation, determining the APBN and in their oversight tasks. Wahono also emphasized that President Suharto has achieved success after success in his efforts to play a more active role in various international forums, both as the head of state of the Republic of Indonesia and as the head of the Nonaligned Movement, which has the role of voicing the interests of the nonaligned nations. The Parliament hopes that the progress achieved in international forums can be maintained and increased by trying to work on the domestic conditions which support it, such as the implementation of PANCASILA [Five Principles of the Nation] Democracy, by improving human rights and by handling environmental problems.
