This has been the case not only with the budget but with the control of its execution. The former Russian Supreme Soviet's Control and Budget Committee found itself sidelined, as it were, before it was able to develop and the new Federal Assembly Comptroller's Office currently consists only of the chairman -- the 52-year-old State Duma Deputy Khachim Karmokov, who had until recently headed the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria Supreme Soviet. [Lynev] So, there is a chairman but no office. Why? And what form should the office take? [Karmokov] Under the Constitution (Article 101, Paragraph 5), the Comptroller's Office is the Russian Federation Federal Assembly organ that monitors the execution of the federal budget. A draft law on it and its status, functions, powers, and structure was drawn up by the president's Legislative Proposals Commission with the participation of the Supreme Soviet Control and Budget Committee and other organizations. This bill had its first reading in the State Duma the other day. And the shape of the office will depend on the type of law that is passed. [Lynev] What does the draft law say on this score? [Karmokov] It raises the question somewhat differently from the Constitution. First, the office is presented as a statewide financial control organ that is independent in its activity and is subordinate only to the law. Second, under the draft, the office monitors not only execution of the budget but the activity of nonbudgetary funds and, finally, the utilization of state property. [Lynev] That's a tall order, as they say. Doesn't it strike you that each of the three avenues of monitoring you have mentioned are important in themselves and have their own features? For instance, there would seem to be nobody responsible for the state property that is not currently being privatized. How is it to be dealt with? Should a special superministry be set up? Should administrative control be passed down to the regions, creating something akin to the old national economic councils? It's an open question. And we can see that it is linked with two other, quite separate issues -- monitoring of the budget and nonbudgetary funds. [Karmokov] I agree. These are different, independent areas of monitoring. I am convinced that they should not be mixed up -- you can't do everything. (Suffice it to say that the sums handled by our nonbudgetary funds -- pensions funds and others -- are of the same order as the revenue side of the federal budget). But it is far more important that the Comptroller's Office, under the draft and contrary to the Constitution, will not be a parliamentary organ but will be positioned somewhere between the branches of power without being dependent on either of them. [Lynev] Is there a bad side to the monitoring organ having this kind of independence? [Karmokov] First, as I have just said, it contravenes the Constitution. Second -- and this is the main point -- it is bad because parliament is deprived of essentially the only means of monitoring envisaged by the fundamental law. With the current noticeable strengthening in the executive, there is a risk that the office could come under its influence -- as has in practice happened to the recently independent Central Bank of Russia. Just imagine -- those executing the budget would be monitoring it themselves. That is only possible when there is no separation of powers or when the system of their separation is incomplete. [Lynev] As is well known, the Finance Ministry is responsible for the execution of the federal budget. It monitors the timeliness and fullness of every item of revenue, the accuracy of spending on the upkeep of the authorities, defense, education, and so forth -- down to the very lowest level. What form should the Comptroller's Office take -- surely not a new administrative monster duplicating the Finance Ministry? [Karmokov] Anything but. I am opposed to increasing the staffing of the office to that level. But let's take another look at the Constitution and at real life. The fundamental law envisages that the chairman of the office is chosen by the Duma, the deputy (who has not yet been chosen) is selected by the Federation Council, and the auditors are drawn from each chamber equally. [Lynev] How many will there be? [Karmokov] That too has not yet been decided. But if we have one for each of the most important avenues of budgetary control, there will be eight to 12 people. [Lynev] Will they be deputies? [Karmokov] They will primarily be qualified specialists. And if a deputy has the relevant qualifications, then why not? This will strengthen the office's links with parliament. As for its size, the office's staff will reach 500-550 people. These will mainly be comptrollers [kontrolery] and auditors. [Lynev] Wouldn't you call that overblown? [Karmokov] The corresponding body in the FRG has 420 employees, while the U.S. equivalent has a staff of 5,248. [Lynev] And are they paid out of the budget they monitor? [Karmokov] Yes. But in the United States a single budgetary dollar invested in monitoring yields $60 in return. In 1989 staffers at the General Accounting Office -- which is what this service is called in the United States -- saved $23 billion. [Lynev] How will the office's work be organized? For instance, the draft budget for this year states that privatization proceeds will total 147 billion rubles. How will that be checked? [Karmokov] First and foremost we must find out just how realistic this figure is. Of what does it consist? What are the specific sources? It is not enough to know that the Finance Ministry, under the budget adopted by the State Duma, has allocated so much to education or defense, say. It is important to monitor the figures all the way down to see whether the funds reach each specific consumer on time or get stuck halfway, bringing somebody a "windfall." We have to do that for each item. [Lynev] Are you not worried about the scale and complexity of the job? [Karmokov] It's a difficult area because it requires not just a certain level of qualifications but also other human qualities -- a principled approach, firmness, and experience of organizational work. Nonetheless, I would like to answer your question optimistically -- we will do our job.
