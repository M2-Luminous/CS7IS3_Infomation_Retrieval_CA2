This request is motivated by the inability of 75 percent of newly formed Russian commercial banks to compete owing mainly to the generally low qualification of their staffs. At the same time Mr. Yegorov noted the need for all-out support for banks with mixed capital. The ARB president made his statement in the presence of the heads of Moscow City's major banks "Stolichnyy," "Menatep," and "Mostbank."
