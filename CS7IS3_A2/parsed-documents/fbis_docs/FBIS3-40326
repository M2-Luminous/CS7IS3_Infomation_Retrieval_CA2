The authorities have found an arsenal of sophisticated infantry weapons in the apartments and hiding places of the leaders of this Muslim political party. The arms were intended to be used for bringing down the Montenegrin state. The masks have, therefore, finally fallen. After this, how can anyone say that the critical remarks regarding the activity and behavior of this party were exaggerated and an "expression of inborn mistrust of the Muslims," which is how Alija Izetbegovic's followers like to qualify them? When their activity is linked with elements of the Novi Pazar indictment, which stress that their [the defendants'] goal was to carry out attacks on military buildings, the destruction of roads, and the liquidation of undesirable Muslim and Orthodox citizens, then the framework of the SDA mosaic is complete. To anyone who is vaguely familiar with the described game of this party, and the ideology that inspires it, this must have seemed inevitable. From the very beginning, the founders of the SDA branches in Montenegro and Serbia took as their basic ideological foundation Alija Izetbegovic's political program, explained in the famous Islamic Declaration. It is practically a declaration of war on all those who think differently and quite directly stresses that the Muslims not only can, but should use the most brutal violence to stifle their opponents' resistance. It is particularly important to note that the followers of the SDA, particularly of its leadership, did not have a choice, since the individuals in charge of purity of religion pointed out that this was the only real Islam. The now already former Reis Ul Ulema Jakub Selimovski, talking about Alija Izetbegovic's declaration, said the following: "Alija Izetbegovic's declaration expresses his opinion and views regarding things in general, based on his religious education and affiliation to Islam." Therefore, if the Reis himself -- a man who interprets what is, and what is not correct according to Islam -- says that Izetbegovic's declaration is based on real Islam, then it is logical that Harun Hadzic and the others -- as devout Muslims -- should act according to the norms prescribed by their religion. The Yugoslav public, and particularly the authorities, have to be clear about the fact that this ideology will not stop bringing forth new branches for as long as Islam does not emancipate itself in the same way that Christianity has done, based on the principle -- religion on one side, politics on the other.
