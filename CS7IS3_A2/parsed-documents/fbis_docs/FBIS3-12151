In the aftermath of the firing by one or more settlers at the Tomb of the Patriarchs, Israeli troops shot dead three Palestinians in Hebron, three in the Gaza Strip, one in Nablus, one in Jerusalem and a settler killed another man in the Bethlehem area, Palestinian sources said. Police said a Palestinian hacked to death an 80-year-old Israeli with an axe near Tel Aviv and made off with his gun. Maurice Eisenstadt was patrolling the streets of Kfar Saba as a volunteer in the civil guard. Several Palestinians in the vicinity were arrested. Doctors in Hebron and Jerusalem hospitals reported 113 people treated for bullet wounds, most of them hurt in the mosque carnage. The killer either turned his automatic rifle on himself or was shot by someone else, the army said. About 100 Palestinians were shot and wounded by soldiers in the Gaza Strip, about a dozen them seriously, as trouble erupted throughout the occupied territories. In the Old City of Jerusalem hundreds of Palestinians staged running battles with police and soldiers. Palestinian sources said 47 were injured, most by rubber bullets or tear gas inhalation. Police said 13 members of the security forces were hurt by the showers of rocks which rained down on them from the walls and Temple Mount after some 80,000 Moslems attended prayers at Al Aqsa mosque.
