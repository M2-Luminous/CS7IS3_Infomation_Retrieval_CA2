FR941122-0-00043 FR941122-0-00010 Under the commenter's approach, a Phase I unit would be relieved of the obligation to surrender allowances simply because it obtained the consent of an owner of a sulfur-free generator to ``claim'' some of that owner's electricity from the generator. As explained by the commenter, there would not have to be any actual acquisition of electricity by the dispatch system of the Phase I unit from the sulfur-free generator. However, the rationale for allowing the Phase I unit to avoid surrendering allowances if it designates a sulfur-free generator is that the Phase I unit is replacing the reduction in its own generation below its 1985&hyph;87 level with electricity from a source (i.e., a sulfur-free generator) that does not emit any sulfur dioxide when producing that electricity. To the extent the Phase I unit replaces its own reduced generation with electricity from units that emit sulfur dioxide in the process, allowances must be surrendered in order to account for the emissions consequences of the reduced utilization of the Phase I unit. Otherwise, the Phase I unit could bank its unused allowances ``notwithstanding the fact that actual emissions reductions had not been paid for or achieved'' at that unit. 56 FR 63019. The Agency recognizes that the complexity of the movement of electricity through interconnected transmission and distribution systems make it difficult to determine precisely the source of compensating generation. 56 FR 63023. That does not mean that all efforts, in the allowance surrender procedure, to reflect actual electricity transactions and to approximate resulting emissions should be abandoned. Under the commenter's approach, ``paper'' claims to sulfur-free generation that may have no actual, underlying energy transactions could be used to avoid allowance surrender. Such an approach would run contrary to the rationale for allowing the designation of sulfur-free generators and therefore is rejected. Thus, the final revised rule includes the requirements that the designated representative of the Phase I unit submit: Contractual agreements that expressly provide for the acquisition of electricity by the unit's dispatch system from the designated sulfur-free generator outside the dispatch system, which generator must be identified in the agreements; and documentation that such acquisition from the identified generator actually took place. (Similarly, to ensure that claims of compensating generation are based on actual transactions, the same approach is taken for compensating units outside the dispatch system. See 58 FR 60961 (proposing parallel treatment of sulfur-free generators and compensating units).) In light of these requirements, commenter's concern_that Phase I units lacking a common owner with a sulfur-free generator may claim to have acquired from the generator electricity that is actually sulfur-free generation retained by an owner of the generator_is misplaced. A sulfur-free generator can be designated only by those Phase I units that meet certain requirements. A Phase I unit whose dispatch system includes the generator may designate that generator. 12 If the generator is outside the dispatch system of a Phase I unit, the Phase I unit may designate the generator if the dispatch system has a contract specifically providing for the acquisition of electricity from the particular generator. A contact to purchase power from the dispatch system of an owner of the sulfur-free generator, where the sulfur-free generator is not specified as the source of the power, is not sufficient. If the dispatch system of the Phase I unit has a contract specifically to purchase power generated at the sulfur-free generator and the contract is with a third party that is not an owner of the generator, the designated representative must show that the third party in turn has an agreement with an owner of the generator specifically to purchase power from the generator. Further, ยง72.91(a) (5) and (6) require that the designated representative document the amount of power actually acquired from the sulfur-free generator and that the designated representatives of all Phase I units claiming generation from the same generator must agree on apportionment of the available generation. It is difficult to see how a Phase I unit could take credit for electricity legitimately claimed by an owner of the sulfur-free generator. Consequently, it is unnecessary to impose the additional requirements suggested by the commenter. 12 No contract to acquire power from the sulfur-free generator is required if the generator is in the Phase I unit's dispatch system. Since a given sulfur-free generator can be included in only one dispatch system, Phase I units in any other dispatch system must have such a contract in order to desigate the generator. IV. Applicability of Rule Revisions to Existing Permit Applications In the November 18, 1993 proposal, the Agency requested comment on how to address any reliance by owners and operators on the January 11, 1993 regulations. The Agency noted that it had proposed in draft Acid Rain permits to approve for 1995, under the January 11, 1993 regulations, those substitution plans and those reduced utilization plans with compensating units that EPA determined to be in compliance with those regulations. 58 FR 60962. In a subsequent extension of the period for comments on the November 18, 1993 proposal, the Agency requested comments on whether any of the allowances allocated to substitution or compensating units under the January 11, 1993 regulations should be returned to EPA at some future time. 59 FR 3660 (Jan. 26, 1994).
