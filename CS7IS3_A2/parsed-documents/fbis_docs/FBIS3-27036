According to the principle of being younger in average age, Jiang Zemin has continued to establish his influence in the Army, while the influence of "the Yangs" [Yang Shangkun, former President and formerly permanent vice chairman and secretary general of the CPC Central Military Commission; and his half-brother, Yang Baibing, former director of the PLA General Political Department and former member of the PRC Central Military Commission], and of those soldiers who rose in the wake of the "4 June" incident has weakened further. The most important cause lies in ensuring that the leading body, with Jiang Zemin as the core, promptly obtains the military's support after Deng Xiaoping. At the same time, the transfer of military brass will be conducive to cooperation among various military regions. This point finds obvious expression in the transfers of personnel in the Nanjing and Guangzhou Military Regions, which have been the main force aimed at Taiwan. The journal ZHONGGUO JUSHI indicated that three wide-scale transfers of military brass already have taken place since the "4 June" incident in 1989. With the development of military strength, and with China's superem leader Deng Xiaoping -- who is nearly 90 -- having one foot in the grave, the hidden political motive in these transfers of military brass is worth studying. The current personnel reshuffle involves the Central Military Commission organizations and all major military regions. The outside world believes that compared with his predecessors -- Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang -- Jiang Zemin has less military background, but when Jiang Zemin acquired the legally constituted authority of the Central Military Commission, he stepped up the establishment and expandsion of his influence, with the backing of Deng Xiaoping. Viewing the present conditions, we find that his relations with the military have gone far beyond the imagination of the outside world. As for the three rounds of military brass transfers since the "4 June" incident, the first round was conducted exclusively by Yang Shangkun and Yang Baibing, and Jiang Zemin basically had no say in it. When the "14th party congress" was in session, "the Yangs" were defeated by the joint forces of Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and other military brass. In the wake of the congress, Jiang Zemin seized the opportunity to conduct the most wide-ranging military reshuffle since the PRC's founding, with focus on purging the forces of "the Yangs." In the latest round of reshuffling, Jiang Zemin was playing the card of "being younger in average age, and more professional," and a number of the military brass who had solid and extensive personnel networks were removed from office on the grounds of "exceeding the retirement age." Included in this category were Song Keda, political commissar of the Shenyang Military Region, and Wang Chengbin, commander of the Beijing Military Region -- both of whom were 66 years old; and Liu Anyuan, political commissar of the Nanjing Military Region, and Li Lun, deputy director of the General Logistics Department, both of whom were 67 years old. However, they were invited to be advisers to their original units, and their hidden influence should not be overlooked. At the same time, a number of military brass who had been promoted for suppressing the 1989 students' movement were demoted. This category included Commander Wang Cheng, Deputy Commander Zou Yuqi, and Political Commissar Zhang Gong -- all of the Beijing Military Region. They all were the major military brass who suppressed the 1989 students' movement. At that time, Wang Chengbin was the deputy commander of the Nanjing Military Region who led troops to Beijing to participate in the suppression, Zou Yuqi was the chief of staff of the troops that enforced martial law, Zhang Gong was director of the Beijing Military Region's Political Department and the man of the day in the "4 June" incident. Now one of them has retired, another has been transferred to the border areas, and the whereabouts of the third are unknown. In view of the fact that there is no end to the talk that "the Yangs" could stage a comeback after Deng, Jiang Zemin has spared no effort in completely uprooting the Yangs' influence. At the same time, he has removed from important posts all those people who were involved in the "4 June" incident, an act that should contribute to easing people's grievances against the CPC. The traditional view is that the aim of the CPC's transferring the military brass lies in reducing their influence, so as to make effective control over the military possible. Some people believe that this transfer of the military brass will bring about a situation in which "commanders are unfamiliar with the troops, and vice versa." However, ZHONGGUO JUSHI believes that a motive that has been neglected is the promotion of cooperation among the military regions and various service arms, so these transfers may be a means of "killing two birds with one stone." The military brass promoted during the current reshuffle included Li Laizhu, the newly appointed commander of the Beijing Military Region. The rest mostly were transferred from other military regions. There was a high frequency of exchanging commanders between military regions. For example, Lieutenant General Gu Hui, of the Nanjing Military Region, served in the Guangzhou Military Region for almost 40 years before his recent transfer. Both Liu Yuanan, former political commissar of the Nanjing Military Region, and Fang Zhuqi, the region's newly appointed political commissar, used to serve in the Guangzhou Military Region. Lieutenant General Qu Zhenmao, deputy commander of the Nanjing Military Region and concurrently commander of the Donghai Fleet, used to be deputy commander of the Nanhai Fleet under the Guangzhou Military Region. Lieutenant General Shi Yuxiao, political commissar of the Guangzhou Military Region, used to be political commissar of the Nanjing Military Region. It should be noted that newly appointed Beijing Garrison Commander He Daoquan used to be commander of the the 23d Group Army stationed in Heilongjiang; he was the first officer in the field troops to set up an automation system and was trained at the PLA's National Defense University. The Beijing Garrison is in charge of defending the CPC central organizations. In principle, its commander should be nominated directly by the PLA chief of general staff; nevertheless, its commander has been changed three times since the "4 June" incident. Another new phenomenon to be explored and studied in the recent transfer of military brass is that both Li Xinliang, the newly appointed political commissar of the Shenyang Military Region, and Zhang Zhijiang, political commissar of the Chengdu Military Region have no background in political work, but are professional soldiers. If this is no coincidence, it may mark the beginning of a trend of depoliticization of the Army.
