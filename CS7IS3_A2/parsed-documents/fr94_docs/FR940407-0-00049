FR940407-0-00049 FR940407-0-00010 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lieutenant (junior grade) Katherine E. Weathers, Chief of the Case Management & Port Safety Section, Ninth Coast Guard District, (216) 522&hyph;3994. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Request for Comments Comments on this regulation, including comments on the prior version in effect during the 1993 navigation season, or future regulations of the same nature, on either a temporary or permanent basis, are all invited. All comments received will be considered in any proposal for a final rulemaking at the end of the 1994 navigation season. The Coast Guard does not currently plan to have a public hearing, but consideration will be given to holding such a hearing if it is requested. Such a request should indicate how a public hearing would contribute substantial information or views which cannot be received in written form. If it appears that a public hearing would substantially contribute to revisions or further refinements of this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will announce such a hearing by a later notice in the Federal Register . Discussion of Comment Period In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this 1994 regulation, and good cause exists for making it effective less than 30 days after Federal Register publication. A notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) because this regulation is simply a continuation, with minor amendments, of the 1993 regulation noticed on January 13, 1993 (58 FR 4130) and promulgated on April 5, 1993 (58 FR 17526). The minor amendments made in this version of the regulation reduce rather than expand the scope of the operating exemptions granted by the prior version. The Coast Guard published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the 1993 temporary rule and invited comments from the public. No adverse comments were received. Repetition of the prior notice period would be contrary to the public interest as well as unnecessary under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) because it would impede the further testing of a commercial innovation which so far has proved to be safe without adding significantly to the opportunity to make public comments. Additional comments are invited during the continuation of the test period in the 1994 navigation season and the Commander of the Ninth Coast Guard District will consider all comments received before November 1, 1994. Finally, the requirement for 30 days notice before the effective date of the regulation is not applicable under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1) because this temporary action is a substantive action to ``relieve a restriction'' on commerce otherwise imposed by the standing regulations. This temporary regulation will lessen the restrictiveness of the speed limits otherwise applicable to nondisplacement vessels in the connecting waters from Lake Huron to Lake Erie in the absence of any temporary regulation. Background and Purpose Current regulations in 33 CFR 162.138 which apply to connecting waters from Lake Huron to Lake Erie set maximum speed for vessels 20 meters or more in length at limits ranging from 4 to 12 statute miles per hour in various areas. One of the primary purposes of these speed regulations is to limit wake damage. The standing regulations were not written to account for the substantially lesser wake-generating characteristics of nondisplacement vessels. In fact, certain vessels designed for nondisplacement operation would generate larger wakes at the lower speeds now required because they would be forced to operate in a displacement mode. During the 1993 navigation season, the Commander of the Ninth Coast Guard District temporarily amended 33 CFR 162.138 in order to allow trial runs of nondisplacement vessels which requested permission to operate in the nondisplacement mode in the area (33 CFR 162.T139, 58 FR 17526, April 5, 1993). A corresponding exemption was granted by the Central Region of the Canadian Coast Guard, which has authority over the Canadian waters in the same area. That trial period allowed nondisplacement vessels less than 100 gross tons to operate in the nondisplacement mode at speeds not more than 40 statute miles per hour. During the 1993 trial period, one complaint was received alleging excessive wake. Upon investigation, it appeared that the vessel gave the impression of creating an excessive wake because of its relatively high rate of speed during a sharp turn. The Coast Guard was unable to determine if in fact an excessive wake was generated in that one case. There was no damage, and the operator agreed to modify similar maneuvers in the future in order to avoid any problem. Also, it should be noted that this amendment of the speed limit for nondisplacement vessels does not in any way excuse the general obligation to exercise good seamanship when maneuvering in close quarters or the responsibility for damage which might be caused by a wake which is excessive in a location close to other vessels or shore structures. No subsequent complaints of any kind were received by the Canadian Coast Guard or the U.S. Coast Guard. With concurrence from the Director General of the Canadian Coast Guard Central Region, the Commander of the Ninth Coast Guard District considers it appropriate to institute another temporary test period during the 1994 navigation season. This new period will extend from April 1, 1994 through November 30, 1994. During this time, the Commander of the Ninth Coast Guard District will test the feasibility of some minor refinements to the prior version of the temporary regulation. Generally, these refinements place more conditions on the use of the higher speeds by the operators of the nondisplacement vessels in order to better ensure safe, effectively regulated operations. As before, the Commander of the Ninth Coast Guard District is setting an upper limit of 40 statute miles per hour for nondisplacement vessels 20 meters or more in length but less than 100 gross tons, and is allowing such nondisplacement vessels to overtake other vessels when otherwise safe. All other navigational regulations will remain in force. This regulation specifically provides that it does not preempt any state or local law or regulation setting a lower speed limit applicable to nondisplacement vessel in areas under the jurisdiction of such state or local authority. (The Canadian Coast Guard Central Region is also stipulating that the higher speed limit will not be applicable to certain harbors areas in Canada, particularly the harbor of Windsor, Ontario.) Each vessel operator shall submit a schedule to the Captain of the Port Detroit at least thirty days in advance for each anticipated excursion. The schedule shall contain an itinerary for each excursion including dates, arrival and departure times, all destination points, and the nature of the excursion, i.e., passengers, no passengers, etc. The vessel operator must then confirm each excursion with the Captain of the Port Detroit between three and seven working days prior to the intended date of the departure. This will give the Captain of the Port time to anticipate potential conflicts with scheduled marine events, and allow timely notice through a Broadcast Notice to Mariners. Any excursion schedule not submitted within the thirty day time frame may be subject to Captain of the Port disapproval. These special provisions for nondisplacement vessels will apply only during daylight hours, defined as sunrise to sunset. The Captain of the Port or Commander, Ninth Coast Guard District may revoke approval of operations at the increased speed for the remainder of the navigation season due to an operator's failure to comply with any of these requirements. Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant (junior grade) Katherine E. Weathers and Commander M. Eric Reeves, Project Managers, and Commander Robert G. Blythe, Project Counsel. Environment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c. of Coast Guard Commandment Instruction M16475.1B, it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
