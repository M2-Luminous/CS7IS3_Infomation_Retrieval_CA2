Elements of a revised policy will be included in a report forecasting Japan's long-term energy demand and supply toward the next century, set for release on June 21, said the official at the Natural Resources and Energy Agency, who declined to be named. The official said the review is in response to requests by power firms to "fine-tune" the amount of energy supply during the peak energy usage time in summer. Under the adjusted policy, the agency will allow renovation of outmoded oil-burning thermal power plants, the official said. But building completely new facilities will still not be allowed under the terms of the June report, he said. Construction of new oil-fired thermal power plants has been prohibited since 1980 as part of efforts to promote the development of alternative energy following the second oil crisis in the late 1970s.
