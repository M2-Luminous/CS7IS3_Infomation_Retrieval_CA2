Peto qualified Friday's dismissal of 129 radio program makers as a politically motivated "cleansing" maneuver. "The action announced on Friday by the deputy chairman of Hungarian Radio (who is vested with full powers of chairman) surpasses in dimensions even the dismissals following the 1956 uprising," Peto said. The SZDSZ chairman placed the responsibility on the government, as the cabinet provided 105 million forints to Hungarian Radio to cover severance pay for those dismissed. Peto said the Radio deputy chairman took the unlawful step in the knowledge that legal remedy will only be possible following the elections. The leader of the Hungarian Socialist Party's parliamentary group, Zoltan Gal, said the government wants to transform the electronic public service institutions into a mouth-piece for the values of one single political order. Tamas Deutsch of the Federation of Young Democrats pointed to the fact that his party had always opposed the appointment of the deputy chairmen of Hungarian Radio and Television, and consistently held out for Elemer Hankiss and Csaba Gombar, the chairmen of the organizations. "The current decision of Radio Deputy Chairman Laszlo Csucs has annulled the hope of a clean election campaign. The government is now striving to divert the public's attention from other inglorious details of its final certificate," Deutsch said. Istvan Csurka of the extreme-right Hungarian Justice and Life Party said he did not write the scenario for the events that have taken place in Hungarian Radio, but he did propose similar measures back in 1990. Zoltan Kiraly, an independent deputy who is now the chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Hungary, called on Laszlo Csucs and Television Deputy Chairman Gabor Nahlik to return to their original professions (Csucs formerly worked in the Finance Ministry and Nahlik was an engineer). The parliamentary group leader of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, Ferenc Kulin, said the events do not favor the governing coalition, which he claimed indicates that there was no hidden governmental agenda behind the measure. He blamed the opposition for the hopeless situation of the entire media affair. In his view, the opposition has tried to turn the wrangling surrounding the media bill to its own advantage. He recalled that a consensus was nearly reached on the media bill, as well as on the leaders of radio and television holding regular consultations with opposition representatives. This agreement in the making was, according to Kulin, upset by the opposition's representatives because they felt they would be better off if they shifted all responsibility in media matters on the government. Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross called the supposition that the government and the prime minister played a role in the selection of persons to be dismissed ungrounded and false. He said the government has no political relations with Istvan Csurka, in other words, it does not pass measures based on Csurka's scenarios. In conclusion, Boross promised that the government would take a stand in all issues which genuinely endanger a clean election. The chairmen of Hungarian Television and Hungarian Radio, Elemer Hankiss and Csaba Gombar -- both sociologists -- were appointed with the approval of the parliamentary parties by the president of the republic, on August 1, 1990, at the proposal of the prime minister. Barely one year later, the representatives of the governing coalition parties qualified both as unsuited to fulfil their posts. In March 1992, at the request of the prime minister, the president of the republic appointed deputy chairmen to head both institutions. In May 1992, the two chairmen were summoned for hearings by Parliament's Cultural Committee, to re-examine their suitability. The government-party majority in the committee, citing unsuitability, proposed that the presidents be relieved. The prime minister forwarded the committee's proposal to the president of the republic, who refused to relieve the Radio and Television chairmen from their posts. Five months later, the government initiated disciplinary action against the chairman of Hungarian Television. The disciplinary committee, led by the minister of justice, duly suspended Television Chairman Elemer Hankiss in December of 1992. Hankiss argues with the legality of the proceedings and has since been trying to prove his case through legal channels. The president of the republic became the target of attacks by the ruling parties and by right-wing political forces not represented in Parliament because he would not relieve the two media chairmen. In January 1993, the two media chairmen asked the president of the republic to relieve them of their posts, but the president has not fulfilled their requests to this day. Under the terms of a government decree from 1974, the public service media are under the supervision of the government, thus the prime minister relieved the two media chairmen on the basis of this decree and invested the two deputy chairmen with full authority of chairmen. At Hungarian Television, the deputy chairman exercising the rights of chairman took the alternative news program off the air, and has dismissed the news crew accused of being sympathetic to the opposition. Hungarian Radio has now dismissed 129 staff members who were mainly known to have prepared programs of a critical tone.
