In a 13-hour meeting that ended after midnight, EU foreign ministers also narrowed the gap in an internal split over voting rights which was threatening to block the entry of all four applicants into the Union by January 1. The Greek chairman of the EU's Council of Ministers, Theodoros Pangalos, said: "I think we can give out a message of optimism to the people of Europe. It is a sign of strength that Europe can work together well." Pangalos added that impetus had been given to proposals for a further enlargement of the Union -- initially to take in Cyprus and Malta, then other applicants which include Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic. The EU ministers hammered out a compromise deal to give the EU's poorer countries, particularly Spain, limited access to Norwegian fishing waters plus bigger catch quotas in other fishing grounds. The negotiations had been blocked earlier by Spain's insistence on access to Norway's fish-rich waters as part of Norway's price for EU membership, and Oslo's refusal to open up its carefully-husbanded fishing grounds. But the meeting could not overcome Britain's refusal to give way in a row over how to change the voting rules in ministerial councils -- the EU's main decision-making organs -- to take account of the four new members. The ministers agreed to meet again next Tuesday in their fourth attempt to resolve the dispute amid signs that a compromise might be in sight to let Britain back down without too much political damage at home. Pangalos warned that the Union would be in trouble if the issue was not resolved. "The whole of community life would be at a dead end. I do not think this is possible," he said. Britain, with some backing from Spain, was demanding that the entry of four small countries into the EU should not tilt the balance of power in the EU by diluting the ability of bigger members to block decisions they do not like. The argument hinges on the system of weighted majority voting in ministerial councils. Under current procedures, 23 out of 76 votes divided up among the 12 members -- 30 percent -- are enough to block majority decisions. Such a blocking minority can be formed by one small and two large countries. Most members want to keep the 30 percent threshhold so that 27 out of 90 votes would be necessary for a blocking minority after the four applicants join. Britain and Spain objected because this would mean three countries could no longer form a blocking minority, so that London and Madrid would have a harder time defending their interests. But Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes said Spain was leaning towards the majority view on the issue. "I can't see Britain alone being prepared to shoulder the blame for preventing enlargement (of the EU)," he said. Some diplomats suggested that the British opposition was more cosmetic than real, aimed at appeasing anti-Europe sentiment back home which could be damaging to the government of Prime Minister John Major. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said there had been understanding for the British point of view, despite the charge from his Danish colleague, Niels Helveg Petersen, that London was driving the enlargement drive into crisis. Hurd suggested that progress might be made on Tuesday. "We want enlargement but we do not want that to weaken minorities," he said. Pangalos proposed a compromise -- that the blocking threshhold should be raised to 27 pending a major review of EU rules in 1996, but that the interests of minority groupings would be treated sympathetically in the meanwhile. The dispute must be resolved by the end of March if the four applicant countries are to have any chance of joining the EU by the target date of January 1 next year.
