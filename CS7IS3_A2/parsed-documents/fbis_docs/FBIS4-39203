Azerbaijan is not ready for all that. In present conditions, privatization would mean squandering of public property and seizure of people's wealth by mafia groups", told the Azerbaijani Prime-Minister Suret Guseynov at the Ministers' Cabinet meeting May 27. The state of credit system in the republic was discussed at the meeting. Guseynov spoke again in favor of state enterprise support by credits. He noticed specially that priority should be given to oil and gas industry and agriculture. Earlier, during the March meeting, Guseynov also emphasized that reforms in economy cannot be carried out in conditions of war. While the total amount of credits increased during the last year for 5.9 times, the sum of over-time payments grew for 28.6 times. "The major burden of overdue payments lies on fuel and power complex, and on agricultural facilities", observed Guseynov. In order to improve the financial discipline, Guseynov ordered the ministries and concerns to pass the state companies' accounts to the state banks. In their turn, the state banks shall grant credits to the fuel and power industries. Suret Guseynov noted that the situation did not change though a number of top-rank officials were dismissed. He stressed the importance of strengthening the administrative measures and spoke in favor of addition powers for Ministers' Cabinet.
