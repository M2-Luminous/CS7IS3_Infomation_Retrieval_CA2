FR940919-2-00187 FR940919-2-00081 18. We also seek comment on the possible effects of competition on the achievement of universal service goals in rural areas. Some argue that competition in such areas is not only unsustainable, but potentially destructive to universal service goals. 21 On the other hand, competition may spur the introduction or expansion of service in rural areas, as suggested by the forty-fold increase in telephone penetration that occurred in rural areas during the competitive period between 1895 and 1920. 22 We also solicit comment as to whether the ``rural subscriber may be just as willing to ride the information highway as his urban counterpart,'' thereby creating a market setting that could sustain competition. 23 21 See, e.g., John Panzar and Steven Wildman, Competition in the Local Exchange: Appropriate Policies to Maintain Universal Service in Rural Areas (undated, unpublished paper) (Panzar and Wildman). To gather a more complete picture of market conditions in rural areas, we request the following data from rural telephone companies (although additional information would be welcome): cost of service per access line; average minutes of use per access line; number of business lines versus number of residential access lines; long distance calling by business customers versus residential customers; and nature, number, and market share of competitors, where applicable. 22 Nearly 40% of all farm households had a telephone in 1920, as compared to less than one percent in 1895. See Mueller, supra note 2, at 356, 357. 23 The Universal Service Subcommittee, Western Alliance, Universal Service in the Nineties, Section II, at 2 (a draft report by a consortium of western rural telephone companies released at the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) Summer Meetings, San Diego, California, July 1994). III. Universal Service Today and in the Future 19. The record developed over the course of NTIA's five universal service field hearings demonstrates considerable public support for expanding the current definition of universal service beyond ``plain old telephone service''_POTS. 24 Accordingly, this section of the Notice addresses the myriad issues raised by such a redefinition. 25 Because any new concept of universal service will build on the existing definition, it is appropriate, however, first to consider the extent to which the nation has achieved its goal of universal POTS before turning our attention to a new definition of universal service. 24 NII Field Hearings, supra note 10, at 8&hyph;9. 25 This Notice does not, of course, contain the definitive list of such issues. We encourage commenters to raise other important matters not touched on in the Notice. A. Achievement of Universal POTS 19a. In many respects, U.S. universal service policies have been a major success. As of March, 1994, 93.9% of all American households had telephone service, compared to 91.4% a decade earlier, and fewer than fifty percent at the end of World War II. 26 Moreover, telephone subscribership in the United States exceeds that in most other nations, often by a substantial margin. 27 26 See Industry Analysis Division, Common Carrier Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, Telephone Subscribership in the United States at 6, Table 1 (Aug. 1994) ( Telephone Subscribership ) (citing the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS)). See also Congressional Budget Office, The Changing Telephone Industry: Access Charges, Universal Service, and Local Rates 55 (June 1984) ( cited in Office of Policy Analysis and Development, NTIA, Telephone Subscribership in the United States: A Post-Divestiture Analysis (1985)). Basic telephone service has also become increasingly affordable for the average American, particularly since the AT&T divestiture in 1984. Between 1983 and 1993, prices for telephone service, on average, rose less (2.0%) than the consumer price index for all items (3.8%) or for all services (4.7%). Moreover, since 1984, telephone service has comprised no more than 2.0&hyph;2.1% of annual household expenditures. Telephone Trends, supra note 13, Table 3, Table 8. Over this same period of time, the variety and quality of telephone services and equipment have also increased dramatically. Devices such as touch-tone service, multiple phones, cordless phones, and answering machines, that were once regarded as luxuries, have now become commonplace for many U.S. citizens. 27 For example, compared to the world's major industrial nations_the so-called ``Group of 7''_the United States in 1992 (56.49) trailed only Canada (59.21) in terms of main telephone lines per 100 inhabitants while surpassing France (52.13), Japan (46.74), the United Kingdom (45.25), Germany (43.96), and Italy (41.03). International Telecommunication Union, World Telecommunication Development Report 1994, A&hyph;3. Canada's success in extending universal service to its citizens (evidenced by the 98.7% of Canadian households in 1992 with basic telephone service) demonstrates, however, that there is room for improvement in the United States. See Universal Service Project, NARUC Subcommittee on Communications, Staff Draft Position Statement on Universal Service Principles 4 (June 1994) ( NARUC Paper ). 20. On the other hand, although the vast majority of American homes have at least one telephone, approximately six million households have none. 28 28 H.R. Rpt. No. 560, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1994).
