[Correspondent Vlada Vishnevskaya] Today the heads of the state delegations at the Russo-Latvian negotiations, Sergey Zotov and Martins Virsis, initialled an agreement on the conditions and timetable for the withdrawal of Russian forces from Latvian territory, an agreement on social security for servicemen in the Russian army, military pensioners and members of their families, and a treaty on the temporary functioning of the Skrunda radar station. So, the bilateral talks which have been going on for two years have entered the concluding stage. The delegations have managed to reach agreement on the fundamental question, the timetable for the withdrawal of forces. Ten thousand Russian servicemen will be withdrawn from Latvia by 31 August this year. The problem of the lease payment for the use of the Skrunda radar remains unresolved. Russia is offering 2 million dollars, but this is not acceptable to the Latvians. However, the leaders of the delegations believe that these disagreements should not affect the final signing of the agreements which were initialled today. The documents may be signed when the Russian and Latvian presidents meet. According to the head of the Russian delegation, this meeting could take place as early as April.
