FR940112-0-00080 FR940112-0-00021 Comment: Some commenters objected to the exclusion of expenses incurred in an acute care facility when considering projection of institutional expenses in spenddown. Response: As noted in the NPRM, we excluded projection of expenses in acute care facilities because these expenses are not as recurring and predictable as are expenses in long-term care facilities. We believe that it is not as easy to anticipate the cost of a stay in a hospital or to predict when it may occur as it is to anticipate long-term care costs. While acute care facility expenses may not be projected, they are valid medical expenses and may be deducted from excess income in spenddown when they actually occur. Comment: A number of commenters suggested that the regulations be revised to include actually incurred institutional expenses in addition to projected institutional expenses. Response: There was no intention on our part to exclude actually incurred institutional or other medical expenses from spenddown. Actually incurred (past) institutional expenses may be deducted along with projected (future) additional institutional expenses. In view of the comments indicating confusion on this point, we are revising paragraph (i) in both §§435.831 and 436.831 of the final regulations to clarify this. Comment: Several commenters pointed out that eligibility begins not on the first day of institutionalization as indicated in the NPRM, but on the day on which an individual incurs medical expenses (including projected institutional expenses) equal to or exceeding the spenddown liability. Response: We generally agree with these comments. In States that elect partial month coverage, the first day of eligibility is the day that deduction of incurred medical expenses reduces income to the income standard. In States with full month coverage, eligibility begins on the first day of the month in which spenddown liability is met. However, a State may not begin eligibility later than the beginning of the budget (spenddown) period if the individual is subject to the post-eligibility process and, under the post-eligibility process, would owe the provider more than the individual has in contributable income. This issue can occur when the State uses either a monthly budget period or a multi-month budget period. We are revising paragraph (i) (paragraph (e) in the NPRM) in both §§435.831 and 436.831 of the regulations to reflect these points. (It should be noted that regardless of when eligibility begins in a budget period, expenses used to meet spenddown liability are not reimbursable under Medicaid. Since these expenses may be deductible from income in the post-eligibility process under the requirements of section 1902(r)(2) of the Act, States may need to reduce the otherwise reimbursable amount of provider charges by spenddown expenses to prevent the transfer of spenddown liabilities to the Medicaid program. The three examples in the response to the fifth comment below show in detail how the spenddown and post-eligibility policies interact in these cases.) We considered beginning eligibility in all cases on the first day of the budget period in which spenddown liability is met. However, this option could increase State administrative burdens without advantaging recipients in cases not covered by the exception in §§435.831(i)(3) and 436.831(i)(3). Many States use eligibility and claims payment systems that are automated to pay claims beginning with the date of eligibility. These States would have to weed out bills from the first day of the budget period (up to 6 months before) that were used to meet spenddown liability to ensure that their automated systems do not pay those bills. Under these rules, no such weeding is required in States that begin eligibility with the day spenddown is met. (Note that these States would have to begin eligibility on the first day of the budget period in cases where the individual, in the post-eligibility process, would otherwise owe the provider more than he or she has in contributable income.) In States that provide coverage in whole months, weeding is required only from the first day of the month in which spenddown is met to the day spenddown is met. The failure of the individual to identify all of his or her incurred expenses before the spenddown determination is made can have an adverse effect on the date of the individual's eligibility. In these cases, States may, but are not required to reopen the spenddown determination and take the additional expenses into account. (For individuals in partial-month coverage States who are subject to the post-eligibility process for the partial month, income and income deductions (e.g., the personal needs allowance) should be prorated in the post-eligibility process to reflect the number of days of eligibility.) Comment: Some commenters advocated permitting States to project copayments, deductibles, and insurance premiums in addition to projecting institutional expenses. Other commenters argued that States should be permitted to deduct any projected medical expense that is predictable. Response: This provision is intended to cover only projection of long-term care institutional expenses, at the Medicaid reimbursement rate, as they are constant and predictable. We believe expenses mentioned in the comment such as deductibles or coinsurance, which are generally associated with the utilization and varying costs of other medical services, are difficult to predict. Because of the difficulty in determining what kinds of care, and what amounts, are predictable, we have limited the application of this provision to long-term care institutional expenses. Regardless of whether States implement this provision, they are still required to deduct actually incurred copayments, deductibles and insurance premiums in spenddown. We further discuss State flexibility concerning copayments and deductibles under the comments and responses on Provision E.
