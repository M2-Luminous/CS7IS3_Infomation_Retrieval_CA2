Kinkel said in Bonn that, on the one hand, people expect the largest member country to bring its weight to bear in order to advance the reform of the EU and to outline the further course of European integration. On the other hand, the "most powerful" partner state was bound to create the suspicion of wanting to shape the community in its fashion, regardless of what it will propose, the minister said. It is not least due to this concern that the Foreign Ministry head is anxious about who the Community will choose to succeed Jacques Delors as president of the Brussels Commission. The decision will be made at the Corfu Summit at the end of this month. Kinkel was optimistic, which probably means that Jean-Luc Dehaene, the head of the Belgian Government and the favorite of France and Germany, will win the race against his Netherlands colleague Ruud Lubbers. Yet diplomats in Bonn have been skeptical and assume that although a majority will support Dehaene in Corfu, there will not be the necessary unanimous support. Then it would be up to the Federal Government, as of 1 July, to find the candidate who is acceptable to all EU members. According to Kinkel, the German EU presidency, because of the pending referendums in the countries of EU candidates Finland, Sweden, and Norway, would be ill-advised to come up with proposals for far-reaching reform. Yet reform has been regarded as inevitable for a long time. In view of the number of member states, which will continue to grow in the long term, the community must retain its ability to make decisions. Yet changing the weight of the votes in the Council of Ministers and, for example, keeping the number of commissioners in Brussels within certain limits, would be bad for the smaller partner states, which are to a degree enormously over-represented. They will be joined by the new Nordic members. This is why the membership opponents there might use any ideas launched by Bonn as ammunition for their campaigns. Kinkel's difficult situation is not made easier by the fact that any reform resolutions are not to be dealt with until the Maastricht II conference scheduled for 1996. The now consecutive half-year presidencies of Germany and France are regarded within the community as the phase of significant decisions in European policy. Diplomats in Bonn are facing great expectations from the neighboring Eastern European countries that expect, particularly from Germany, to be led closer to the EU. Kinkel would like to "get them to the table" as best as he can. New constructions, such as partial membership for the Eastern Europeans (for example in transportation, trade, and energy policy) -- something that has been discussed again and again -- have been rejected by the foreign ministers. The Federal Government will probably not react to ideas that suggest that, first, an inner circle of member states might enter into a closer union. Therefore, it rejects the plan of French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure for a "convention of the new founders." However, Kinkel has not ruled out that an inner circle will emerge within the community at one point. Out of consideration for members who would then presumably have to remain outside against their own will, the Federal Government must not promote the "two-speed Europe," Kinkel said.
