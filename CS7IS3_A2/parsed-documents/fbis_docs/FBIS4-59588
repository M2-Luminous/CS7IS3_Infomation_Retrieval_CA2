In its editorial, AL-THAWRAH says: With the beginning of Christopher's new tour of the region, it must be reasserted that Syria adheres to peace in accordance with the bases that were agreed upon in Madrid. Syria will accept no alternative to the bases and principles provided for by the UN resolutions and the laws of international legitimacy. If Syria insists on dismissing partial solutions, this is because its peaceful orientation proceeds from one basic axiom--that unless peace is just, comprehensive, and based on sound bases of equality and equilibrium, it will not be a genuine and firm peace. AL-THAWRAH stresses that Syria wants a peace that ensures the principles and values of truth and justice and ends any form of injustice, occupation, and aggression. Syria wants a peace that restores rights to their rightful owners and enables the region to enjoy true security and stability. Expressing its constant readiness to cooperate to achieve a peace of this kind, Syria places all those concerned, especially the United States, before their historic responsibilities. It asks them to honor their promises and assurances and to support the resolutions and laws of international legitimacy, which are disregarded by Israel. AL-THAWRAH adds: Christopher is coming to the region in a new effort to activate the peace process, especially on the Syrian- Israeli track. However, Israel, through Foreign Minister Peres, went ahead of events and cast doubts about any possibility of achieving any success in this tour. AL-BA'TH says: In his latest statement, a few hours before his new tour of the region, the U.S. secretary of state did not show a great deal of optimism about his continuous mission to boost and activate the stalemated peace process. AL-BA'TH adds: When the U.S. secretary says that he does not hope for much from this tour, this means that he has prejudged the results without giving any reasons. Reviewing the reasons that may have made Christopher prejudge the results, the paper says that the reasons are innumerable. The paper reviews Israel's recent stands and attempts to portray itself as moderate and flexible. It says that during Christopher's recent tour of the region, the U.S. secretary conveyed [to Syria] so-called Israeli ideas on withdrawal from the Golan. The ideas were listed as concessions, directly linked with conditions that have nothing to do with the essence of the peace process. AL-BA'TH adds: Regarding Israel's alleged concessions, it can be stressed that the term concessions is a completely rejected political fallacy that the Rabin government is trying to peddle in order to mislead domestic and foreign public opinion. This is a argument must be rejected because a concession is made when someone concedes something that he possesses. But, since Israel, the paper says, does not possess an iota of the Golan nor any inch of the soil of the occupied Arab territories, it has no right to use the term concessions anywhere on any issue. Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH says: Against this backdrop, it is possible to understand the judgment that Christopher issued on the eve of his visit to the region. It is the judgment of someone who knows the Israeli mentality, which insists on obstructing the peace process. For hopes for progress to become greater, this situation should be corrected and restored to its logical context. In this case, logical context is commitment to the essence and principles of the peace process. On the same subject, TISHRIN notes that Syria is not ready to deal with any Israeli proposals that do not show an explicit commitment to full withdrawal from the Golan within a reasonable and acceptable period of time. The paper adds: Syria has long experience with Israel's evasive and intransigent policy. Therefore, in view of Syria's constant stands, Israel must have realized that partial, phased settlements are not possible and that Syria will not relinquish its territory and rights or Arab territories and rights. Simply speaking, Syria believes in a just, comprehensive peace in the Middle East. TISHRIN says: A just, comprehensive peace is one of Syria's strategic objectives. Yet, this does not at all mean that Syria will relinquish the essence of this peace or accept fragile agreements that do not usher in a complete removal of the occupation. The paper says that if all parties have the right to raise their security concerns, then Syria's security is represented primarily in the removal of the occupation and providing peace and security for others, especially since it is a peace that will be guaranteed by the international community. The paper believes that achieving substantive progress on the Syrian-Israeli track does not require all the complications and thorny issues raised by Israel. Syria is proposing a full peace in return for full Israeli withdrawal. Peace with Syria means a comprehensive Middle East peace. This is because there is no peace at all without Syria's participation. Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN says: It is high time the United States translated the role of a full, fair, impartial partner into reality. This is would be forcing the Israeli rulers to make the sound decision without which peace is impassible; namely, full withdrawal from the Golan and the other occupied Arab territories.
