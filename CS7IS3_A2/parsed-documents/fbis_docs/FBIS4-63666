This was said in a statement the congress made regarding the latest developments in Crimea. The document stresses that the Crimean Supreme Council's decision to restore the autonomy's constitution in its original version represents disregard for the fundamental law of Ukraine and international agreements on the inviolability of the borders and territorial integrity of states. The statement's authors describe these actions as criminal in respect of the Ukrainian people and state. The Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists also demands that the registration in Crimea of political parties, which perform anti-Ukrainian activity, should be discontinued, separatism ended, and calm and peaceful work guaranteed for the peninsula's citizens.
