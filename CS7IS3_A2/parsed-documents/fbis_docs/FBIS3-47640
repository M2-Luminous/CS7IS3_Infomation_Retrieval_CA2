Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, made the remark in response to recent news reports that the United States and the European Union (EU) have agreed to call for ministerial talks among the four trading partners of Canada, the EU, Japan and the U.S. next month. "There is no possibility of a new round of talks since negotiations have already been concluded," he said. Working-level talks will be enough if they want to confirm agreements reached under the GATT negotiations, he added. Kumagai also said no ministerial talks are required for Japan and the U.S. at this stage to break an impasse in their talks on a "framework" for bilateral trade. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor suggested both sides hold high-level talks to straighten out differences. The two parties should continue negotiations strenuously, rather than setting the stage for higher-level talks, he said.
