Hosokawa and wife Kayoko, who departed on a government aircraft from Haneda Airport, are scheduled to arrive in Washington later Thursday evening local time. The prime minister will meet with Clinton for two hours Friday in an effort to break the deadlock over trade issues. He is also scheduled to attend a joint press conference with Clinton, meet with leaders of the Republican Party, and deliver a speech in English at Clinton's alma mater, Georgetown University. Hosokawa is scheduled to return to Japan on Sunday. It will be the third meeting between the two leaders, but Clinton is expected to press Hosokawa harder this time for a "results-oriented" agreement on the bilateral trade framework negotiations.
