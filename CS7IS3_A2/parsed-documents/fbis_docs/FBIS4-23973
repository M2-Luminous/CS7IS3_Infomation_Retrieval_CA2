I went to see them in order to organize a consultative meeting in view of the deteriorating situation that everyone witnessed in Rwanda a day after the death of President Habyarimana. Secret diplomatic negotiations were undertaken. I do not think I am disclosing a secret when I tell you that this action by President Mobutu was countered by some Western countries -- you can easily guess who they are -- simply because it was Mobutu who made the proposal. So the death of the poor Rwandan Africans was not to be taken into account. They did not want Mobutu to be the one to put an end to the bloodbath in Rwanda. That is why his initiative seemed hesitant at the beginning because some Western countries interfered in the process. But, despite all this, President Mobutu redoubled his efforts and, as you are aware, we succeeded in making the warring factions -- that is the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the Rwandan Government and the heads of state of the subregion -- sign the cease-fire agreement separately. After this, you saw all the efforts that were made by other heads of state of the subregion, including President Mwinyi who summoned two meetings attended by the two warring factions. But these two meetings were a failure because both parties refused to come. Therefore, in the face of the deteriorating situation and confronted with the role of troublemakers played by some countries to hinder the quick organization of a meeting to solve the massacres and genocide, because the truth is that the horror had overstepped all boundaries of the imaginable, we thought that it was time to take it a step further. That is why the head of state made every effort and used all his diplomatic weight to obtain the subregional mini summit that took place in Tunis and led to the signing of the cease-fire by the two warring factions and the heads of state of the subregion.
