Despite 15.9 billion roubles in subsidies received from the budget in 1993, the postal Workers paid 20 billion roubles in taxes. The 1994 federal budget allocates no funds at all for the development and social needs of the postal services. These facts were cited by Anatoliy Nazeykin, the chairman of the Communication Workers' Union, at a meeting with State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin on April 29. Since the service is not profitable, post offices are closing down in many regions, with postal workers being dismissed. Such a situation, in the view of the union leaders, may affect the interests of the population, disrupting the regular delivery of pensions and benefits and periodicals. Rybkin backed the communication workers' request that the house should consider exempting the state-run postal services subsidised from the budget from value added tax and a special tax on services rendered to the population, as well as from taxes on press distribution and acceptance of international mail. He also promised to speed up the examination and adoption of federal laws on communications and on federal postal services.
