The article on compensation, which had originally delayed the signing of the agreement eight months ago, now reads as follows: Principle of expropriation with just, adequate, and effective compensation -- by virtue of this principle acknowledged by the Constitution, the state will not expropriate, unless it is of public or social interest, foreign capital investments in a discriminatory manner or without previously paying fair, adequate, and effective compensation. According to some experts, this article runs against the spirit of Article 58 of the national Constitution, according to which there can be special compensations for the sake of equity. Nevertheless, in the agreement signed today in London, Colombia promised to always pay compensation. Despite changes made to the article that had prompted Britain's original refusal to sign the accord, there still places in which it contradicts the national Constitution. These contradictions likely will come up when the Constitutional Court and Congress review the agreement. [Begin recording of constitutional expert Luis Carlos Sachica] A fair, effective, and adequate compensation might turn out to be completely different from what the Constitution says considers prior compensation -- compensation in which the interests of both the community and the affected parties are taken into consideration. [end recording] The new agreement basically seeks to protect the interests of British investors.
