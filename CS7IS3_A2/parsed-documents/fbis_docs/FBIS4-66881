According to him, in the future ``Ukraine hopes to get Western aid for the process of dismantling strategic nuclear missiles deployed on its soil.'' As Shmarov maintains, ``by signing the trilateral statement concerning nuclear arms Ukraine undertook to dismantle missiles, and it is fulfilling its pledge without any aid from other countries.'' He spoke about this with members of the American delegation visiting Ukraine now, the deputy premier said. According to him, top priority will be given to removing from Ukraine nuclear warheads, whose safety guarantees will soon expire. There are 176 strategic nuclear missiles on Ukrainian soil. Since the Russian, Ukrainian and American Presidents signed their statement concerning Ukraine's nuclear disarmament forty nuclear warheads have been removed from Ukraine in exchange for Russian fuel to be used by Ukraine's nuclear-power plants.
