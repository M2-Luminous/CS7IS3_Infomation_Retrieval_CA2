This step -- the discount rate was cut from 5.0 to 4.5 percent and the Lombard rate from 6.5 to 6.0 percent -- will provide an additional boost to "the ever clearer economic upswing," Finance Minister Theo Waigel said. With its policy of cutting interests, the Bundesbank is reacting to the Federal Government's successful policy of consolidation." Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, however, added that not only industry and labor but the government, too, ought to pursue a policy that is guided by the objective of stability. Public budgets must be further consolidated "so that the economy can continue its upward trend." As far as wage and salary demands are concerned, it is still necessary to pursue a restrained course. The Bundesbank is now using "the room it is being conceded by the financial and wage policy, thus supporting the recovery of the economy, which is beginning to show."
