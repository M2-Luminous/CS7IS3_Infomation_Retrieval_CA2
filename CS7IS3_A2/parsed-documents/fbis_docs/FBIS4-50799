In addition, Li Peng ordered the public security units and armed police units in the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities throughout the country to go on alert beginning 0000 on 18 April. It was an unpleasant surprise: The whole country was on the alert! The Armed Police must be on the alert and party and government units must also be on the alert. The information circulated within a small circle in the capital. Although it was a rumor some intellectuals believed it to be true. Many people did not understand: It is still a long period of time from now to "4 June." Why must they be on alert ahead of time? The information was as follows: Li Peng Issues Nationwide Alert Order On 16 April, Li Peng issued an order in his name as premier of the State Council: Beginning 0000 on 18 April, the standing committee members of the party committees of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities throughout the whole country work a 24-hour shift system to take charge of the security, public order, and sudden incidents which occur in their localities. Li Peng also ordered the public security units and armed police units in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities throughout the whole country to go on alert starting 0000 on 18 April. On 16 April, Qiao Shi issued an order in his name as chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, authorizing the standing committee members of the people's congresses in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities throughout the whole country to make decisions according to the conditions or sudden incidents occurring in their localities and to issue orders to safeguard social order and protect the normal work and daily lives of the people. At 0900 on 16 April, the State Council approved and relayed the order from the armed police and the Public Security Ministry, that beginning 1800 on 17 April, the public security units and armed police units in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Chengdu, Chongqing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xian, Zhengzhou, Taiyuan, Fuzhou, Urumqi, Nanjing, Jinan, and Haikou go on alert. The order issued by Li Peng on 16 April was "urgent and top secret." When the State Council approved and relayed the order from the Public Security Ministry and the armed police on 16 April, it clearly pointed out that the alert period must last until an appropriate time when it can be lifted or partially lifted. Possible "Sudden Incidents" Which Make the Alert Necessary Some intellectuals are not very interested in whether the rumor is true or false or else they believe it but do not take it seriously. What they find interesting is: What are the "sudden incidents" which make the alert necessary? The following views have been expressed: "Hu Yaobang died on 15 April 1989 and, thereafter, a great political earthquake took place. Li Peng issued the alert order on 16 April. Was he afraid of a recurrence of the historic event?" "Is this a coincidence... or the death of a certain person will lead to a repercussions like those in 1989? Is it because the senior level of the CPC is worried about Deng Xiaoping's health problems?" "Recently, the official rhetoric that 'Deng Xiaoping is in good health' has repeatedly appeared in the official media. Is it a sign of misfortune?" "Perhaps the official rhetoric is not too strange but the cadres and the masses are rather worried, for they are afraid that the situation may become unstable or change tremendously." "This mental condition has been reflected in the sensitive monetary market--since late March, many people have rushed to buy gold, bought U.S. currency notes on the black market, and sold some shares. To conclude, the people's minds are neither at ease nor stable." "The current situation is different from that in April and May 1989. However, inflation is very high and in the first quarter of this year it reached 24 percent on average, whereas in the municipalities, provinces, and autonomous regions such as Beijing, Guangdong, Hubei, Liaoning, Sichuan, Shanxi, and Xinjiang, it was between 28 and 40 percent. On 11 April, the State Statistics Bureau revealed some data and figures for internal use which showed that the State Council's promise to keep inflation under 15 percent in the first quarter of this year could not be realized. Under these circumstances, the people have more complaints." "The shadow of 1989 cannot be removed and can be vividly portrayed, therefore..." "The approach of several dates makes people like Li Peng feel uneasy even when eating and sleeping. These days, the 75th anniversary of the "May 4th Movement," the "1989 pro-democracy movement," and the fifth anniversary of the "4 June massacre" are the things that they fear and so it is not strange to see Li Peng hurriedly issuing the alert order in a panic. Jiang and Li Regime Feels Its Own Weakness "The spearhead of the alert order is aimed at the healthy forces within the party and, on the other hand, at the pro-democracy forces in society. And Li Peng and his men had the nerve to think of this!" Regardless of whether or not "sudden incidents" do occur, one thing can be certain and that is: The current Jiang and Li regime can feel its own weakness and it has lost confidence. Therefore, even if nothing happens, their hearts will almost jump out of their chests.
