Rumors about an accident reached Lithuania Wednesday [25 May], first from Belarus and later from Latvia. Shevaldin even received telephone calls from the Belarussian atomic energy inspection. "The rumors are completely groundless. Both reactors are at a standstill and there were no accidents," Shevaldin told BNS. Ignalina's first reactor is still undergoing maintenance repairs which started March 26. The second reactor was shut down April 12 when excess energy appeared at Latvian hydroelectric power stations. Shevaldin said neither of Ignalina's reactors should be started earlier than June 20 and added that public announcements will be made in advance. Povilas Vaisnys, head of the Lithuanian Atomic Energy Safety Inspection, said the rumors that were set afloat Wednesday are "misinformation," which may be related to political process in one of the neighboring countries that he did not specify. The official said "it's all quiet at the Ignalina nuclear plant."
