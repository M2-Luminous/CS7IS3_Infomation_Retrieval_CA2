However the question is whether the rest of the party will go along with him. It is true that Westerberg says the main goal is a nonsocialist majority government. At the same time he rejects a continued four-party coalition government with support from the New Democracy Party. If the Social Democrats and the Left Party do not win a majority either, he wants to try a bloc-spanning government. It is clear that Westerberg now feels there is less ideological distance to the Social Democrats than to the moderates. He designates the question of whether or not Sweden will uphold the welfare state as the most important ideological issue today. Now that he has stepped out as the champion of the current model of the welfare system there is almost no common ground for continuing to rule with the moderates during the next four years. The situation was different at the time of the liberal-moderate program, "A New Start for Sweden," in the spring of 1991. There was no mass unemployment, no waiting period for benefits and no reduced compensation level for social insurance. Most of the program has now been implemented. And that marks the end of Westerberg's participation when it comes to cuts in the public sector. It is different for the moderates. They want to keep going where Westerberg calls a halt. SVENSKA DAGBLADET's editor in chief, Mats Svegfors, has chosen him as the number one defender of the system, a more ardent proponent of today's welfare state than the Social Democrats themselves. But the Moderates, the young conservatives and the Timbro intellectuals are not the only ones the Liberal Party leader is at odds with. He accuses practically the entire corps of Swedish economists of having a simplified view of taxes and the public sector. This means he is also attacking a number of liberal economists whose political home is in his own party. In some respects Westerberg goes farther than right-wing Social Democrats. Among other things he thinks Sweden must safeguard a large public sector. The current size is good when it comes to activity and employment, but expansion is said to be impossible due to financing problems. He flatly dismisses the theory that a public sector as large as the one we have now hampers growth. Westerberg also defends the general welfare policy and rejects any ideas about basic coverage. But what about the runaway budget deficit? That will be cleared up if unemployment is cut in half and the government's reorganization program is implemented. According to Westerberg the OECD economists are quite wrong when they maintain that the savings goal must be doubled from 80 to 160 billion kronor to achieve stable economic growth. Nor does the Liberal Party leader accept the economists' solution to mass unemployment--opening up low-paying jobs in the private service sector. He feels that if we maintain the public sector and concentrate on industries that are research- and development-intensive, a labor market B team will not be necessary. And, finally, he flatly rejects the domestic-servant deduction. The current refrain may seem a long way from the early 1980's when Westerberg launched the "Market Economy Alternative." He himself claims that he has had the same assessments all along. It is the debate that has changed and with it his emphasis on different aspects of social liberalism. But at the moment his leftist-liberal side seems to have the upper hand. There is great affinity with the Social Democrats and the women associated with the Women's List with regard to the public sector, family policy ,and equality. With his present political course Westerberg should be able to appeal especially to employees in the public sector who are frustrated by the cuts in recent years. Westerberg stands up for a group that undoubtedly feels mistreated and tired of concepts like the "draining sector." Two-thirds of all public employees are women. Westerberg's strong involvement in equality issues and his flirtation with the Women's List make the target orientation even more obvious. However the question is whether the right wing of the Liberal Party will go along with him in a possible alliance with the Social Democrats. Leading "socialist eaters" like Anne Wibble and Birgit Friggebo have previously blocked such ventures. There is always a risk that ordinary nonsocialist voters will issue a harsh verdict. With today's low poll figures, the Wibble-Friggebo wing can strengthen its position and once again change the party's course. Westerberg: `Maria-Pia Close to Us' Bengt Westerberg is not giving an inch. Despite a sharp drop in the polls he maintains the line that he has now made the Liberal Party's: the public sector must not be trimmed, the big savings have already been made and he is open to cooperation with the Social Democrats. He also praises Maria-Pia Boethius, the initiator of the Women's List. [Roos] You have said there is no possibility that the Liberal Party will be part of a nonsocialist minority government again after the election. If the nonsocialists do not win a majority would you then recommend a Social Democratic-Liberal government? [Westerberg] I think it is urgent that the present government remain in office, but it must win its own majority. If it does not achieve this and neither do the Social Democrats and the Left Party combined, I think a bloc-spanning government should be tried. But it is too early to say which parties should be included. [Roos] You are said to have written the following in an internal memo dated 12 March 1990: "In my opinion the liberals are closer to the Social Democrats (than to the moderates) ideologically and programmatically, provided that the Social Democrats do not renew their socialist demands." Does that still apply? [Westerberg] There must have been a longer train of reasoning behind that statement. But there is no doubt that the decisive difference between the Social Democrats and the liberals has been how we view the market economy. If the Social Democrats gradually abandon their demand for a planned economy... [Roos] But haven't they already done so? [Westerberg] Yes...then it would make cooperation easier in the future. [Roos] Haven't you now moved quite a long way from the ideological tone that characterized the liberal-moderate program, "A New Start for Sweden," in the spring of 1991? [Westerberg] No, as members of the government we have implemented most of what stood there. But the debate is somewhat different today. Now a lot of debaters have entered the arena demanding that we scale down the welfare state. I think the general welfare policy with the income loss principle and inexpensive social services for those who are in need is good. [Roos] In other words, the public sector does not need further trimming. [Westerberg] No, not as far as its activity and employment are concerned. In this respect we support a large public sector. Then of course we would like spending pressures to diminish, but they will when the economy improves and unemployment declines. [Roos] Many economists maintain that the present size of the public sector and the accompanying tax burden hamper growth. You don't think so? [Westerberg] No, the economists who say that it will provide more jobs if we shrink the public sector and replace it with private activity are wrong. I am more inclined to think that it will have the opposite effect, that there will be fewer jobs. Many economists have a simplified view of how the economy functions. They do not give enough consideration to the social effects. [Roos] And you don't think it is necessary to open up low-paying jobs in the service sector? [Westerberg] No, I think the economists are greatly influenced by the current situation in their analyses. I think they underestimate the dynamics once the economy gets going. [Roos] Have the big structural savings already been made? [Westerberg] Yes, but part of the reorganization program we approved remains to be implemented. [Roos] And that will also be enough to overcome the budget deficit? [Westerberg] The most important contribution will be to bring unemployment down. In combination with the budget-strengthening measures I think it will be enough. [Roos] You have said that many of your basic assessments are very close to those of Maria-Pia Boethius. Is she a liberal politician? [Westerberg] I will say that in many respects she stands very close to the Liberal Party, for example where equality is concerned. [Roos] But what has become of the market liberal Westerberg of the early 1980's? [Westerberg] My basic assessments are the same today as they were then. It is the debate that has changed. Then it was about wage-earner funds. Today it concerns whether or not we will uphold the welfare state.
