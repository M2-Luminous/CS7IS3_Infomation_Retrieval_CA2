FBIS4-6958 "dreas080_a_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-080 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Hata Wants `International Trust', `High Quality' Hata Wants `International Trust', `High Quality' OW2204083594 Tokyo KYODO in English 0801 GMT 22 Apr 94 OW2204083594 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, the ruling coalition's candidate to succeed Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, said Friday [22 April] that if elected premier, he wants to create a country that could win international trust. Hata told a joint press conference with leaders of coalition parties that he will do his best to make Japan a nation of "high quality" which could be internationally trusted, understood and loved. Calling himself "an inexperienced person" who hesitated to shoulder the burden of leading the nation, the 58-year-old Hata said, "but considering the support and the hardships of everyone, I decided to accept the recommendation, feeling my body tremble." Prior to the news conference, the heads of the coalition parties endorsed a policy platform for a new cabinet and chose Hata, leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], as their candidate for prime minister. Hata is expected to win the election for the premiership in plenary session votes of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors on Monday. The second coalition administration, led by Hata, will be launched later Monday. The coalition agreement to field Hata, who is also deputy prime minister in the Hosokawa administration, followed weeks of wrangling over two vital policy issues -- tax reform and national security. On April 8, Hosokawa, who became premier last August, abruptly announced he will resign to take responsibility for stalled Diet business over his alleged involvement in financial scandals. Hata said he does not think there are cracks in the ruling coalition although the parties took two weeks to narrow differences over policies. The two weeks of debates were "meaningful," Hata said, because discussions on such matters as tax reform had to be done anyway by the end of June. Hata also pointed out the need to enact the fiscal 1994 budget as early as possible. He said that although the ruling parties come from different backgrounds, the Hosokawa government was able to overcome various difficult problems, such as those involving the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks and electoral reform. Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, said he recommended at the meeting of heads of parties earlier in the day that Hata is the "most suitable" person to succeed Hosokawa. The leaders of the parties unanimously agreed to field Hata as the candidate, he said. Keigo Ouchi, head of the Democratic Socialist Party, said Hata is the most suitable considering his personality, knowledge and ability. Komeito chairman Koshiro Ishida said the new government's main theme is to push ahead with reforms and an early enactment of the budget.
