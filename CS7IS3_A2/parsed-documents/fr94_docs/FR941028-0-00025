FR941028-0-00025 FR941028-0-00009 Regarding the AVS, the Committee joins the House in commending OSM for improvements made to the system. The Committee has consistently supported development and implementation of the AVS because the AVS is essential to effective enforcement of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 [SMCRA]. Report of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senate Report No. 103&hyph;114, at page 47 (July 28, 1993). Accordingly, OSM has determined to go forward with the final rules published today without regard to the course of litigation between OSM and SOCM or any other person. OSM has reviewed the proposed rules in light of the comments that have been made with a view towards serving the agency's commitment to protecting the environment, to implementing SMCRA, and ultimately, to serving the public interest. These final rules incorporate the AVS into the Federal regulations and mandate the use of the system by State and Federal surface mining regulatory authorities. At the same time that these rules strengthen the enforcement of Section 510(c), they also establish a detailed set of procedural pathways to assure the protection of due process for the regulated community. Public Participation As indicated above, OSM published proposed rules on September 6, 1991. The proposed regulations were available for public comment until November 20, 1991. Comments were received from members of the regulated community, representatives of environmental advocacy groups, representatives of State regulatory authorities, and various citizens. While a total of 20 commenters submitted written comments, most comments can be grouped into three major categories which are captioned below. After the discussion of these three major issues, this preamble will then provide a section-by-section discussion of the final rules. II. Rules Adopted and Responses to Public Comments A. Summary of Rules Adopted These final rules include the following provisions: Part 701_Permanent Regulatory Program Section 701.5 is amended to delete the definition of ``Violation notice.'' Part 773_Requirements for Permits and Permit Processing The Table of Contents is amended to include new section numbers 773.22, verification of ownership or control application information; 773.23, review of ownership or control and violation information; 773.24, procedures for challenging ownership or control links shown in AVS; and 773.25, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations. Section 773.5 is amended to include definitions of ``Applicant/Violator System'' or ``AVS.'' The terms are defined to mean the computer system maintained by OSM to identify ownership or control links involving permit applicants, permittees, and persons cited in violation notices. The regulation is further amended to include definitions of ``Federal violation notice,'' ``Ownership or control link,'' ``State violation notice,'' and ``Violation notice.'' A ``Federal violation notice'' is defined to include a violation notice issued by OSM or by another agency or instrumentality of the United States. An ``ownership or control link'' is defined as any relationship included in the definition of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' in 30 CFR 773.5 or in the violations review provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b). It includes any relationship presumed to constitute ownership or control under 30 CFR 773.5(b) unless such presumption has been successfully rebutted under sections 773.24 and 773.25 of this rule or under the provisions of 30 CFR part 775 and ยง773.25 of this rule. It also includes an identity between persons, e.g., an applicant and a violator. A ``State violation notice'' is defined as a violation notice issued by a State regulatory authority or by another agency or instrumentality of State government.
