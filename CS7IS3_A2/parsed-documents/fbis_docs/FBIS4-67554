The state of environment in Bulgaria is alarming. Last year nearly 900,000 tonnes of sulfur dioxide were thrown up in the air. The major source of sulfur dioxide pollution is the Bulgarian brown coal, especially the coal mined in the Maritsa-Iztok area. However, the power stations using brown coal as fuel account for 31.62 percent of the electricity output in this country, the news conference was told. According to power producers, bringing power engineering into line with the Bulgarian environment legislation will cost a lot of money--every Bulgaria will have to pay 1,500 leva a year until 2010. According to experts of the Ministry of the Environment, the power engineering industry is hardly the sole air polluter. Exhaust emissions pollute the air in the big cities with carbon dioxide. Measurements show that exhaust emissions account for 70 percent of the air pollution in Sofia.
