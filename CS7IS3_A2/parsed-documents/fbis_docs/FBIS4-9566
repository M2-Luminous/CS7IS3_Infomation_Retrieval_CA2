The new duties apply to all classes of goods that make up Slovenia's most significant exports to Macedonia: -- furniture and other wooden products, -- poultry, -- paper and cardboard, -- tires, -- washing powders, -- cosmetics, -- household appliances. This effectively means that the bilateral free trade agreement signed in 1992 is no longer in force.
