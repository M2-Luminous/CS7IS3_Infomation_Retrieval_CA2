FR940523-2-00011 FR940523-2-00006 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE International Trade Administration [A&hyph;549&hyph;502] Certain Circular Welded Carbon Steel Pipes and Tubes From Thailand; Termination of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review AGENCY: International Trade Administration/Import Administration Commerce. ACTION: Notice of termination of antidumping duty administrative review. SUMMARY: On April 15, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) initiated an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand. The Department is now terminating this review. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Debra R. Crumbie or Michael J. Heaney, Office of Antidumping Compliance, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, telephone: (202) 482&hyph;5253. Background: On April 15, 1994, the Department published in the Federal Register a notice of initiation of administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand (59 FR 18099) at the request of a respondent Saha Thai Steel Pipe Company, Ltd. (Saha Thai). This notice stated that the Department would review merchandise sold in the United States by Saha Thai for the period March 1, 1993, through February 28, 1994. Saha Thai subsequently withdrew its request for review on April 18, 1994. Under 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5), a party requesting a review may withdraw that request no later than 90 days after the date of publication of the notice of initiation. Because Saha Thai's withdrawal occurred within the time frame specified in 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5), and no other interested party has requested an administrative review for this period, the Department is now terminating this review. This notice is published pursuant to 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5). Dated: May 13, 1994. Roland L. MacDonald, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance.
