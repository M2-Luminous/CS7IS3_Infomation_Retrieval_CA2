In an interview with The European, Rustum Kadic said the attack would be directed against Novi Travnik (half of it already controlled by the Muslims and the other half by the Croats), Vitez (the Muslims control the old part of the city) and Busovaca, Kiseljak, and Kresevo (all under Croat control). But in the light of the mortar attack on Sarajevo's market square, the plan may be revised. Air strikes on Serbian positions around the town, or any Nato-induced withdrawal by the Serbs, would offer the tempting option of an immediate push by the Muslims to follow up and gain territory. Such a move, which the UN would undoubtedly try to prevent, could signal the start of the Muslims' spring offensive, which has a series of objectives, according to Kadic. They want to break the Serbian ring around Sarajevo by liberating Kiseljak, near Vitez, and reduce their own commitment in the area to redeploy forces on other fronts, Kadic said. They also want to capture vital arms factories in Novi Travnik and Vitez, and aim to supplant the Croats in controlling the relief aid routes. If the Muslims gain control of Kiseljak, they will be able to cut the Croats' supply lines from the Serbs in the east. By controlling Busovaca the Muslims would ease links along the valley, currently dominated by Croat snipers who are inflicting heavy casualties on the Muslims. According to Bosnian military commanders, more than 1,000 Muslim fighters have died on that road. There is already heavy fighting between the Muslim-led Bosnian army and Croat separatist forces in the Vitez area which closed the main aid route into the Croat enclave. "We can achieve our aims. However there is a risk of a large number of casualties," Kadic said. "When we took back Kakanj and Vares, the Croatian fighters took shelter in Kiseljak, which became a fortress." Muslim politicians in Sarajevo oppose the plan because of potential losses. But Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic backs the military commanders. The military headquarters of the Bosnian Muslims has been transferred to Zenica from Sarajevo.
