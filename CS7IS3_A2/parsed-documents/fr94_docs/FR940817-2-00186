FR940817-2-00186 FR940817-2-00090 The Shareholders Agreement also contains provisions relating to shareholder votes for other than the election of directors. 11 In addition, the Shareholders Agreement contains provisions relating to required transfers of MBSCC's stock 12 and permitted transfers of MBSCC's Class A and Class B stock. 13 The Shareholders Agreement also provides that the provisions governing the voting of shares shall continue in force for ten years and shall be automatically renewed for a subsequent ten year period. 14 Finally, MBSCC is amending Article V, Rule 6, Section 3 of its Rules to delete references to the CHX. 11 Participant shareholders may not remove a director of MBSCC, with or without cause but must remove a director for cause if directed to do so by a majority of the directors. A 2/3 affirmative vote of the MBSCC shares is required to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of MBSCC, for MBSCC to repurchase or issue any of its securities, or for MBSCC to purchase securities not incident to MBSCC's normal business. In addition, the shareholders must vote as directed by the board of directors for amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation relating to (1) Greater than majority requirements of quorum and voting at board meetings; (2) cumulative voting for the election of directors; (3) classification of directors; (4) shareholder rights to fix consideration for shares, to determine the stated capital and surplus upon issuance, and to authorize a reduction in capital in respect of such shares; (5) shareholder rights to fix compensation of directors; and (6) shareholder rights to elect and remove directors. In addition, the board also has the authority to direct shareholder voting for the amendment of any By-Laws except any By-Law which the board is prohibited from amending by the provisions of the By-Laws. 12 Upon the insolvency of a participant shareholder, all MBSCC shares held by it will be transferred automatically to all other participant shareholders pro rata. 13 A participant may sell its Class A shares only to another participant but only after giving notice to MBSCC of the proposed sale. NSCC, the sole owner of Class B stock, may sell its Class B shares only to another participant (which shares will immediately convert into Class A shares) or to a registered clearing agency but only after giving notice to MBSCC of the proposed sale. MBSCC has the option to purchase the Class A or Class B shares for the lower of $100 per share or the offering price. 14 The provisions in the Shareholders Agreement governing voting include: (1) The obligation of the shareholders to elect directors selected by all participants; (2) the prohibition against shareholders removing directors with or without cause; (3) 2/3 majority voting requirements; and (4) requirements that the shareholders vote as directed by the board for certain matters ( see supra footnote 10). All other provisions of the Shareholders Agreement remain in effect unless the agreement is terminated or amended by the consent of all of the parties to the agreement. If at the end of any calendar year there is no agreement governing the voting of the shares in effect, the shares of MBSCC will be redistributed in proportion to each participant's usage of MBSCC. II. Discussion The Commission believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of the Act and, therefore, is approving the proposal. Specifically, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(C) 15 of the Act in that it assures the fair representation of its shareholders and participants in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs. 15 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(C) (1988). The Act does not define fair representation or set up particular standards of representation. Instead it provides that the Commission must determine whether the rules of the clearing agency assure adequate representation of participants and shareholders in the selection of the board of directors and the administration of the clearing agency's affairs. In its release setting forth the standards for registration of clearing agencies (``Standards Release''), the Commission stated that rather than prescribing a single method for providing fair representation, the Commission would evaluate each clearing agency's procedures on a case-by-case basis. 16 With respect to providing participants with a meaningful opportunity to be represented in the selection of the board of directors and the administration of the clearing agency's affairs, the Standards Release suggests a number of methods can be used to comply with the fair representation standard. Among others, these include the allocation of voting stock to all participants based on their usage of the clearing agency or the selection by participants of a slate of nominees for which the stockholders of the clearing agency will be required to vote their shares. 17 16 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16900 (July 1, 1980), 45 FR 41920. 17 The other suggestions in the Standards Release are: (1) Solicitation of board of director nominations from all participants; (2) selection of candidates for election to the board of directors by a nominating committee which would be composed of and selected by the participants or representatives chosen by participants; or (3) a number of directors chosen by and from the participants. MBSCC's proposal initially allows all participants to purchase voting stock based on their usage of MBSCC. Rather than reallocating the voting shares each year in proportion to participants' usage of MBSCC, the Shareholders Agreement requires the participant shareholders to elect directors selected by all participants. If the voting provisions of the Shareholders Agreement expire, the participants' voting stock will be reallocated each year in accordance with each participant's usage of MBSCC. Both methods of electing directors appear to be consistent with the methods outlined in the Standards Release. The Shareholders Agreement should ensure that the candidates for the board and the nominating committee represent the entire MBSCC participant base. The nominating committee is directed to select candidates with a view toward providing fair representation for the interests of a cross section of the participants. Other candidates may be nominated if the nominating committee is petitioned by participants. Other aspects to the proposed rule change serve to enhance the ability of small participants to have a voice in the administration of MBSCC's affairs. By limiting each participant's representation on the board to only one director, MBSCC's board should represent a cross-section of MBSCC's participant base and should not be dominated by one or two large participants. To counter the potential for a few large participants to determine the outcome of a shareholder vote, certain provisions of the Shareholders Agreement limit the shareholders' authority in favor of board power. For example, the shareholders must vote as directed by the board regarding removal of directors and the amendment of certain provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation. In addition, by requiring a 2/3 vote to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws, a greater consensus among shareholders must be obtained before making substantial changes to MBSCC's administration. The Commission believes that the provisions enhancing the authority of the board of directors, who represent all the participants, are consistent with a clearing agency's obligations of fair representation. The Commission also believes that the limitation on the voting entitlement of BHC participants is permissible under the fair representation requirements. During 1993, the BHCs' usage of MBSCC was less than 20% of the total usage of MBSCC, and therefore, no reduction in the BHCs' voting entitlement would have been required. MBSCC has agreed to notify the Commission if the BHCs' usage of MBSCC exceeds 24%. However, the Commission believes that even if a reduction of the BHCs' voting entitlement occurs, the fair representation requirements are not violated because the provision was adopted at the request of the BHCs, whose voting entitlements are being reduced, because of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. MBSCC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of the notice of filing. The parties to the merger have agreed to close the transaction during the first two weeks of August 1994. To permit an efficient transfer of ownership from the CHX to MBSCC participants, it is necessary that the appropriate governance changes are in place. Therefore, the Commission finds sufficient cause to accelerate approval of this proposal.
