Officials said Kim's application was taken to mean that he is giving up his Korean citizenship and seeking political asylum. It is not immediately known how the Seoul government will respond. Kim, who was a trusted aide to President No Tae-u, left the country when authorities started investigating him on suspicion of receiving bribes while he was in Chongwadae.
