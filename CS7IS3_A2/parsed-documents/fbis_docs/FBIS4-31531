FBIS4-31531 "dreeu112_p_94003" FBIS-EEU-94-112 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 POLAND Unemployment Assessed, Policy Criticized Unemployment Assessed, Policy Criticized 94P20790A 94P20790A CSO [Editorial Report] An article in the 26 April issue of the Warsaw daily POLSKA ZBROJNA comments on the impact the increasing rate of unemployment is having on Polish society and criticizes the government's approach to dealing with this problem. Referring to an accompanying map of Poland that indicates those districts (mostly in northern Poland) suffering from the highest levels of unemployment with black shading, journalist Elzbieta Szmigielska-Jezierska writes that "unemployment is growing in Poland, and the black stain is getting larger. In some regions, the rate is over 20 percent, and this is alarming." Szmigielska-Jezierska finds disturbing the fact that the 30-to-44-year-old age group has been the most severely affected by unemployment: "The tragic aspect of our condition is underlined by the fact that this age group is being hit the hardest. These are people in the prime of their lives.... If all of these people are useless to the country, a country that must intensively modernize its economy, are we a lost nation?" Szmigielska-Jezierska notes that, in addition to the 2,900,000 registered unemployed (15.7 percent of the population), an even larger number pf "hidden" unemployed are on the payroll of factories where they have nothing productive to do. The extent of this overmanning, which is made possible by large government subsidies, is estimated at approximately 5.5 million. Szmigielska-Jezierska finds fault with the government and, in particular, with Leszek Miller, minister of labor and social policy, for relying on large welfare appropriations to alleviate the results of unemployment rather than coming to grips with its root causes. She describes the relief payments as "manna from heaven," which will not provide a lasting solution to Poland's unemployment problem.
