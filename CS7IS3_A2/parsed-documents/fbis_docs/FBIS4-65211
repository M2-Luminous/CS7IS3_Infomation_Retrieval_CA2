La.": "Suspicion That Boeing May Launch Own Project Prompts Airbus To Continue Studies on High-Capacity Airliner"] [Text] The Europeans and the Americans mistrust each other with respect to their high-capacity aircraft project. As a result, in the coming weeks Airbus Industries will start the second study phase of its own project, referred to as A3XX, without interrupting the joint feasibility studies it has been conducting with Boeing. This announcement was made by Aerospatiale Aircraft Division Director Claude Terrazzoni on Saturday, 7 May. Participants in this program are the world's three largest aircraft manufacturers (Boeing, Airbus, and McDonnell Douglas): None of them intends to risk being left behind. For the time being, the A3XX project is at a very preliminary stage, that of feasibility studies. According to Aerospatiale, the market, which is primarily located in Southeast Asia, could require annual production rates of 60 aircraft by 2010 and remain roughly at this level until 2020. The French manufacturer fears that the joint work it has been doing with Boeing might turn out to be "no more than a smoke screen," according to Claude Terrazzoni. Two months ago, the announcement that cooperation would continue had been received with some skepticism by Airbus Industries, which felt uncomfortably constrained. Today, the French worry that the Americans might launch their own high-capacity aircraft based on Boeing's 747-400. They believe Boeing's recent announcement of a longer-range, stretched version of the new twin-engined 777 confirms such a theory. This aircraft "would be a direct competitor to the existing four-engine 747-400," Mr. Terrazzoni said. "Therefore Boeing would have no choice but to put out new versions of the 747-400 and study a new wing unit for a bigger machine." With an estimated price tag of $220 million (Fr1.25 billion), the French are determined not to miss this market. For the time being, however, only two airlines (British Airways and Singapore Airlines) have shown interest for an airliner able to carry over 500 passengers.
