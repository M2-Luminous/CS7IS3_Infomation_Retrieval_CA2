Zhirinovskiy reportedly met a certain Werner Girke, who was responsible for managing the enormous foreign assets of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] in the former German Democratic Republic [GDR]. According to Bonn security circles, Zhirinovskiy wanted to "tap" the enormous Stasi funds that were embezzled to Austria via cover companies. Zhirinovskiy, who made his career in the surroundings of the KGB, is also believed to be the "manager" of an underground network of former KGB enterprises abroad, as NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG reported recently. After the collapse of communism, the security apparatuses of the USSR, the GDR, and other states set up their own businesses using these huge assets. The profits of the cover companies are also being used for political purposes -- Zhirinovskiy's assumption of power, for example. Zhirinovskiy had enormous sums of money at his disposal during the election campaign, and now he even wants to buy a majority of votes in the new parliament! The coup with the Berlin "businessman" Girke (nicknamed "Account-number Girke"), agreed in Austria, was to be finalized in Berlin. This is why the Russian applied for another visa for Germany, which, however, he was denied. On the orders of the Trust Agency and the "Commission for the Search of SED Assets," the Berlin police searched Werner Girke's offices yesterday. During the raid, numerous documents were seized. Girke is missing. A trustee was installed at his company.
