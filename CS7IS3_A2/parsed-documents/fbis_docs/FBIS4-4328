The visit is aimed at strengthening bilateral relations between Thailand and New Zealand and exchanging views with New Zealand leaders on the situation in the Asia-Pacific region and the upcoming meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum, or ARF, to be held in Bangkok in July. On the first day of his visit in Wellington, the foreign minister paid courtesy calls on New Zealand leaders, namely Peter Captain, house speaker and national assembly chairman; James Bolger, prime minister; and David Lange, former prime minister of New Zealand; and had talks with his New Zealand counterpart, Donald McKinnon. The foreign Minister said New Zealand leaders attached special significance to the efforts to strengthen relations with Thailand, especially regarding trade, investment, and tourism cooperation, for they believe that the future of New Zealand is closely bound up with Asian countries. In this connection, the foreign minister expressed support for New Zealand's Asia 2000 Program, under which New Zealand business people will visit Thailand and other countries in Asia to find ways of promoting investment cooperation. The foreign minister suggested an increase in contacts between business circles, the setting up of Thai-New Zealand business council, and wider dissemination of trade and investment information as measures to promote trade and investment cooperation between the two countries, and the New Zealand side has agreed to take them up for further consideration. The New Zealand side expressed its gratitude to Thailand for its support for New Zealand becoming a member of the UN Security Council in 1992 and expressed interest in joining the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, or the Bali Treaty. The foreign minister promised to bring the matter up for consultations with the other ASEAN member countries. The foreign minister praised the long-standing relations between the two countries and thanked New Zealand for the excellent reception rendered to Princess Sirinthon during her visit to Antarctica. Touching on the ARF meeting, which Thailand will host in July, the deputy prime minister of New Zealand said the meeting is the most meaningful meeting this year because it will provide both an opportunity for leaders of big countries to meet each other and a forum for the discussion of the future and stability of the Asia-Pacific region. The foreign minister noted that there should be a mechanism in the region to settle conflicts and act as a guarantee for regional stability. The New Zealand side agreed with him. The foreign minister also briefed his New Zealand hosts on the latest developments in Cambodia and Burma. The foreign minister told the New Zealand leaders that he, in his capacity as chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee, will soon pay a visit to Burma at the invitation of the Burmese foreign minister and will consider inviting Burma as a guest of the host to attend the ASEAN annual meeting to be held in Thailand in July. On the same day, the foreign minister met with Thai residents in Wellington and briefed them on the latest developments in Thailand and answered their questions on tourism promotion and the environment in Thailand. During his meetings with the New Zealand leaders, the foreign minister asked them to look after the well-being of the Thai residents who are there to earn their living, pursue higher education, and do business. The New Zealand leaders promised that Thai residents would be accorded fair and proper treatment. The foreign minister received a warm and respectful reception during his visit. The foreign minister also extended his invitation to the New Zealand foreign minister to visit Thailand.
