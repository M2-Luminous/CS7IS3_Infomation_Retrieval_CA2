Provincial leaders, including Mao Zhiyong, Wu Guanzheng, Lu Xiuzhen, Shu Shengyou, Shu Huiguo, Huang Zhiquan, Zhong Qihuang, and others, attended the conference. Wu Guanzheng, provincial party committee deputy secretary and provincial governor, delivered a speech at this morning's meeting presided over by provincial party committee Secretary Mao Zhiyong. In his speech, Governor Wu Guanzheng called on the party organizations and comrades on the province's propaganda and ideological front to focus on the following three aspects of work: 1. To clearly understand the current situation, further enhance a sense of mission and a sense of responsibility, and successfully carry out propaganda and ideological work, 2. To take account of overall interests, focus on key work aspects, and comprehensively accomplish propaganda and ideological work tasks, 3. To strengthen leadership, brace up, and raise propaganda and ideological work to a new level. Wu Guanzheng said: In order to strengthen leadership over propaganda and ideological work, it is imperative to cultivate a new train of thought, adopt new work methods, closely integrate propaganda and ideological work with economic and other types of work, and enable propaganda and ideological work to promote and contribute to economic construction and other types of work. Specifically speaking, we should make redoubled efforts in the following three aspects: 1. To arm the whole party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and unify the ideology of the broad masses of cadres and people with the party's basic line; 2. To constantly serve the people and socialism, strive to unite all forces that can be united, and mobilize all positive factors to build socialism with Chinese characteristics; 3. To step up theory, public opinion, ideological education, cultural, and artistic work. To this end, party committees at all levels in Jiangxi should place propaganda and ideological work high on the agenda, frequently analyze each and every major social and ideological trend, provide regular guidance to propaganda and ideological departments, and carry out regular examination and supervision of propaganda and ideological work. At this morning's meeting, Lu Xiuzhen, provincial party committee deputy secretary, also delivered speech in which she called for conscientiously implementing the spirit of the recently concluded national propaganda and ideological work conference, and comprehensively carrying out both the basic principles and four basic types of work in the propaganda and ideological domain. [passage omitted] In the end, provincial party committee Secretary Mao Zhiyong delivered a speech in which he said: The propaganda and ideological front is an important front, while propaganda and ideological work has a crucial impact on the overall work. Over the past few years, the province's propaganda and ideological work front has done a lot of work by adhering to economic construction as the center, thereby pushing ahead with the two civilizations building. The new situation has set higher requirements on the propaganda and ideological front. Therefore, we should attach greater importance to rather than neglect, further strengthen rather than weaken, and further improve rather than leave unattended propaganda and ideological work. Now that we have propaganda and ideological work principles to follow, the crux of the matter lies in how to implement these principles to the letter. We should conscientiously carry out province-wide propaganda and ideological work by implementing the basic principles and four basic types of work spelled out by Comrade Jiang Zemin, arm the mind with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and focus on studying and publicizing Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, this being a fundamental ideological work task. We should also persistently, actively, comprehensively, and correctly implement the party's basic line and basic central work principles and consciously submit to and serve the overall interests of grasping each and every excellent opportunity to deepen reform, expand opening up, promote development, and maintain stability. We should make every possible endeavor to mobilize the broad masses of the people to support and participate in reform, continually strengthen unity, maintain stability, boost morale, conduct mainly positive propaganda, correctly guide public opinion, publicize the spirit of the central authorities, win people's hearts, strengthen confidence, step up spiritual civilization and relevant infrastructure building, further increase input in propaganda and cultural undertakings, and gradually improve propaganda work conditions. Secretary Mao Zhiyong emphatically stated: Party committees at all levels across the province should strengthen leadership over propaganda and ideological work by showing concern for overall interests, carrying out in-depth investigations and study, summing up experiences, and constantly improving and heightening ideological work standards. The provincial propaganda and ideological work conference is now being attended by prefectural and city party committees deputy secretaries and propaganda departments directors, provincial work committees deputy secretaries, comrades in charge of various propaganda units directly under the provincial authorities, and comrades in charge of the relevant units. This morning's meeting was attended by persons in charge of the relevant provincial units, those at the on-going provincial foreign- related propaganda work conference, those at the on-going provincial conference of radio and television bureaus chiefs and radio and television stations chiefs, those at the on-going provincial conference of cultural affairs bureaus chiefs, those at the on-going provincial news and publication work conference, as well as those at the on-going provincial conference of prefectural and city party committees organization departments directors.
