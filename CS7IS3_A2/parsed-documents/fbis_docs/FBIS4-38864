The Press Has Never Written About the Role of the Air Defense Forces Men and Equipment in Disarming Air Terrorists. Although Not a Single Case of Clamping Down on Air Piracy Has Occurred Without Their Participation"] [Text] Every time such a situation occurs, a task force is formed at the Air Defense Forces high command. Its leader, Lieutenant General of Aviation Yevgeniy Makoklyuyev, first deputy chief of the Air Defense Forces Main Staff, spoke to our correspondent about how it works. [Makoklyuyev] Let us recall last Friday.... The latest terrorist act in the Mineralnyye Vody area. At 0900 an A-50 radar patrol airplane took off from the Privolzhskiy airfield. It was faced with the task of reinforcing the radar intelligence system in the North Caucasus region. That was the moment when the air defense men and equipment began their most vigorous actions to discover the exact route taken by the helicopter containing the terrorists and the hostages that had been taken, determine the landing site, and, if need be, quickly send raiding parties into the area. The alert forces located in the area of the criminals' supposed flight were brought to Alert Condition One, an extra 10 radar subunits were involved, and mobile low-altitude platoons were taken out to the position areas. I would observe that this was done in a very short space of time. All the information about the helicopter's flight was processed by an air defense task force in Rostov headed by Lieutenant General Nikolay Kurochkin and was then sent to the Air Defense Forces Central Command Post. The information received was sent minute by minute to the Ministry of Internal Affairs task forces in Rostov and Mineralnyye Vody. These measures were necessary because we understood perfectly well that the criminals, using minimum flight altitudes, the mountainous locality, the weather conditions, and various maneuvers, would try to shake off the raiding parties that were following them in the air and then land and disappear undetected. [Ivanov] That is exactly what terrorists did in the same region at the end of December of last year when they took some Rostov schoolchildren hostage. [Makoklyuyev] Yes, they flew out of Mineralnyye Vody by military helicopter at the lowest possible altitude. The weather was terrible: There was fog, and a snowstorm was blowing. In a word, the helicopters carrying the raiding party lost view of the target. Who could have supposed that the criminals would land twice on the route, trying to get their bearings and, despite the visibility, which was practically zero, find a place near Georgiyevsk where their accomplices were evidently waiting for them. Having used up most of the fuel, they decided to return to Mineralnyye Vody. And they only flew out again after refueling the next morning.... At the same time, taking advantage of the poor visibility, the pilots made a landing not five km west of the village of Khasavyurt, as the terrorists were demanding, but about 10 km north. Then they took off again, this time for Makhachkala. Our A-50 tracked the target for two days, passing on full information. It was practically only the air defense systems that registered all the criminals' maneuvers in the air and gave out precise details of where they landed, and they were were the first to furnish the Dagestan Ministry of Security with the information about the likely landing place, which made it possible to blockade the area in advance and end the operation successfully. [Ivanov] But in the latest case the weather was favorable, and the tracking helicopters did not get lost.... [Makoklyuyev] Nevertheless we had a lot of trouble with the extremely short time frame. And it was not only the air defense forces that had this trouble. There was every justification for assuming that it was accomplices of the same criminals that had gotten down to carrying out the plan that was disrupted in December. As soon as the route was determined, the Ministry of Internal Affairs task force bore in mind that the terrorists might try to escape to Azerbaijan and beyond. Therefore, on the instructions of Colonel General of Aviation Viktor Prudnikov, commander in chief of the Air Defense Forces, who was in charge of all the air defense forces in this operation, we reported to the commander of the Azerbaijani air defense. We agreed the procedure for the helicopters to fly across their borders together with the raiding party and our A-50 airplane, as well as the actions that the alert forces should take against the intruder. But the criminals landed in Chechnya, just as they had six months before. The air defense forces clearly determined the landing location, accompanied the helicopter all the time, and gave out the necessary information both to the Ministry of Internal Affairs organs and to the raiding party. Hundreds of specialists from the radiotechnical troops, aviation, command posts, and the leadership of this branch of service were employed in making sure that the operation to save the people and disarm the criminals passed off successfully.
