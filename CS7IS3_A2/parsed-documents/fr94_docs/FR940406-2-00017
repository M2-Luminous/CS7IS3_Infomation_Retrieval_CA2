FR940406-2-00017 FR940406-2-00007 Also excluded from the scope of the investigation are paper that is designed exclusively for use in graphic arts proofing equipment and does not exceed 160 microns in thickness, and emulsions classified under subheading 3707.10.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) that are used in the manufacture of monochrome graphic arts film or paper that are not used in the production of color negative photographic paper. The color negative photographic paper subject to this investigation is currently classifiable under HTSUS subheadings 3703.10.3030 and 3703.20.3030. Emulsions are currently classifiable under HTSUS subheadings 3707.10.0000 and 3707.90.3000. Couplers and coupler dispersions are currently classifiable under HTSUS subheadings 3707.90.3000, 3707.90.6000, 2933.19.3000, 2933.90.2500 and 2934.90.2000. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. To avoid suspension of liquidation of non-subject chemicals, those items entered under the HTSUS subheadings listed above, which are not for use in the color negative photographic paper production process, must be accompanied by an importer's declaration to the Customs Service to that effect. In order to be excluded from the suspension of liquidation ordered in this notice, all sensitized (whether chemically or spectrally) and unsensitized emulsions, couplers, and coupler dispersions entered into the United States must be accompanied by an importer's declaration to the Customs Service to the effect that they are not for use in the color negative photographic paper production process and will not be used in the color negative photographic paper production process. On February 18, 1994, petitioner and respondent submitted comments on whether the chemical components are in the same class or kind of merchandise as color negative photographic paper. Petitioner argues that the subject merchandise constitutes one class or kind of merchandise, whereas respondent argues that the merchandise included in the scope of investigation constitutes two classes or kinds of merchandise. We determined that color negative photographic paper and the chemical components constitute one class or kind of merchandise (see March 24, 1994, decision memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford). We based our determination on the criteria set forth in Diversified Products v. United States, 572 F. Supp. 883 (1983) and Kyowa Gas Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. v. United States, 582 F. Supp. 887 (1984). Period of Investigation (POI) We initiated this investigation using a six-month POI from March 1, 1993, through August 31, 1993. On October 13, 1993, petitioner requested that the Department expand the POI. We expanded the POI in order to capture U.S. shipments made pursuant to an October 1, 1991, contract with the single-largest unrelated purchaser (see December 30, 1993, decision memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford). We instructed respondent to submit foreign sales information of the subject merchandise for the month of November 1991 to be the basis for the foreign market value (FMV) comparison to the U.S. shipments made pursuant to the long-term contract (see January 17, 1994, decision memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford). Such or Similar Comparisons In this investigation, we have examined sales of color negative photographic paper; we have not examined sales of chemical components because respondent did not make such sales during the POI (see October 22, 1993, memorandum from James Maeder to David Binder). We have determined for purposes of the preliminary determination that the color negative photographic paper covered by this investigation comprise a single category of ``such or similar'' merchandise. Respondent reported products that are identical according to the Department's matching criteria but have minor cost differences based on the emulsions contained in each product. For purposes of the preliminary determination, we are treating these products as identical and are making no adjustments for differences in merchandise between the products as claimed by respondent in accordance with 19 CFR 353.57. This is because respondent failed to provide a narrative description for its adjustments for differences in merchandise that explains the exact nature, source, and size of each difference. We have instructed the respondent to submit a thorough description of its adjustments for differences in merchandise so that these adjustments can be considered for use in the final determination (see February 23, 1994, decision memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford). Fair Value Comparisons/Multinational Corporation Provision In its petition, Kodak alleged that all of the criteria for invoking the multinational corporation (MNC) provision have been met. To determine whether sales of CNPP from the Netherlands to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the appropriate FMV as required by the MNC provision. The MNC provision, contained in section 773(d) of the Act, requires the Department to determine if the following three criteria are met: (1) Merchandise exported to the United States is being produced in facilities which are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by a person, firm or corporation which also owns or controls, directly or indirectly, other facilities for the production of such or similar merchandise which are located in another country or countries; (2) The sales of such or similar merchandise by the company concerned in the home market of the exporting country are nonexistent or inadequate as a basis for comparison with the sales of the merchandise to the United States; and,
