FBIS4-27362 "dreas105__a94043" FBIS-EAS-94-105-A Daily Report 12 May 1994 ANNEX Japan NEC, Bull To Develop Mainframe Computers NEC, Bull To Develop Mainframe Computers 942A0231A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 12 May 94 p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0231A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] NEC and Bull, the largest computer manufacturer in France, have made a basic agreement on joint development of mainframe computers. A formal decision will be made at a top-level meeting of the two companies to be held in early June, and the outlook is for commercialization in 1995 or 1996. Since expansion of demand for mainframe machines is not anticipated with the advancement of downsizing (shift in demand to small machines), the burden of cost is becoming heavier for design and development such as a processing unit appropriate for high-speed processing. Both companies, which will cooperate in the capital aspect, etc., will embark on sharing development in the mainframe field which is their main product, and hasten to rebuild the computer business. There will be joint development of the highest grade machine type, the large "System 3900" (NEC product name) which NEC is OEM [original equipment manufacturer] supplying to Bull. The details of sharing design and development will be decided later, but it seems that the CPU (central processing unit) and board that carries the CPU which are the heart will be the object. NEC and Bull will respectively commercialize the jointly developed machine. A CPU with a bipolar structure in which it is easy to increase processing speed will be used in the jointly developed machine. Furthermore, it is anticipated that there will be future study of cooperation in development of a parallel mainframe that will raise processing performance by lining up several CPU's with a CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) structure which is easy to plan 0 costdowns. In development of mainframe computers, it is said that it costs about 10 billion yen for a new machine type and several billion yen for an improvement. Both companies see that they can greatly alleviate the cost burden by sharing development. NEC agreed at the end of 1993 to cooperate with Bull, whose business has seriously worsened, in a wide range of fields such as computers, communications, and electronic parts on the occasion of providing an additional investment of about 7 billion yen (4.43 percent stockholding rate after increased investment), and has proceeded with specific discussions. This sharing of development in the field of mainframes will be the first shot and also implies Bull support.
