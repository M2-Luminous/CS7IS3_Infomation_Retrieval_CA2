The Ministry of Defence [MoD] tonight confirmed details of the incident at the notorious Rogatica checkpoint near the Muslim town of Gorazde, but said it was not officially releasing the name of the officer involved. The UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in former Yugoslavia said the incident happened a week ago when Major Tony Randall of the Royal Engineers and five soldiers were detained at the checkpoint for 10 hours by 40 Bosnian Serb troops. Their weapons were taken and they were forced to sit with hands on head at gunpoint. Then Major Randall was forced to read an apology to the self-declared Bosnian Serb republic of Srpska after local troops alleged his convoy failed to stop at the checkpoint. They were eventually released unharmed but the only confiscated weapon to be returned was the Major's pistol, minus ammunition. The confession was screened on local Serb-controlled television near Sarajevo on Thursday night and was video taped by REUTERS Television. The MoD added that UNPROFOR made an official complaint to the Bosnian Serb Army and asked for the weapons back. A Ministry spokesman said the British convoy, a Land Rover and two lorries, passed through an unmanned checkpoint as they left Gorazde having obtained prior clearance. The soldiers attempted to make contact with local forces and waited 20 minutes but received no response. They then moved on to a second point where they were stopped, searched and disarmed. The Major was forced to write a statement of apology but when this failed to satisfy the Serbs he was made to rewrite it and read it out in front of a camera. Reuters quoted Major's "statement" as saying: "I realise by my actions I have insulted the Rogatica Brigade, the army of the Republic of Srpska and the state of the republic of Srpska." He added that "in my rush to get through the checkpoints I was both rude and incautious". UNPROFOR spokesman Major Dacre Holloway dismissed the dictated apology and said there had been many problems at this checkpoint, including the hold-up for almost a week of a convoy from French charity Medicins Sans Frontieres. "Our understanding is that the Major believed he and his men were in danger and the price to pay by writing this statement was relatively small," Major Holloway said, adding that it was not the first time this had happened to UN forces at checkpoints in Bosnia. -- Earlier this month 168 soldiers in the Duke of Wellington's Regiment were delayed at the Rogatica checkpoint while trying to make their way to Gorazde.
