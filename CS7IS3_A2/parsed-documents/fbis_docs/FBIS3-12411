The criminal's timing coincided with Muslim prayer ceremonies. This increases the anger and the feeling of bitterness and pain. Despite this, President Clinton has called on us to exercise restraint. This means that we should bow our heads and accept these shameful crimes. Despite our people's ordeal, U.S. President Clinton announced that he was inviting Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to come to Washington to complete the talks on the agreements. He did this while our blood, which flowed at the Ibrahimi Mosque, was still warm. He does not realize the extent of the hatred this sort of massacre causes. We would have liked President Clinton to say that he opposes the settlers' impudence; that Israel, if it desires the establishment of a just peace, should put an end to settlement activity and the settlers' practices; and that he condemns their attempts to wreck the chance for peace. Does President Clinton wish to continue the policy of his predecessor, President Bush, in humiliating our nation and imposing hegemony over its future? We ask President Clinton: What would have been Israel's and the United States' position if it were the Palestinians who perpetrated such gross violence against the Israelis? We recall that when some Palestinians tried to carry out an operation on the shores of Tel Aviv during President Bush's term, there was a worldwide uproar and the President adopted the unfair decision to suspend the dialogue with the PLO, which was followed by other measures. Our people have always been against violence aimed at innocent persons, regardless of its source. We reject the fact that President Clinton spoke in such a manner and blamed only the criminal who perpetrated this barbaric act. The massacre has deeper dimensions. In Qiryat Arba', the settlement built on the outskirts of Hebron, hatred and violence against Palestinians is fomented. What the criminal Goldstein did was no more than a translation of what those malicious people harbor in their minds. If it is not possible to evacuate them from Palestinian lands, they must at least be punished by preventing them from entering Hebron, especially the Ibrahimi Mosque, which they have defiled by their act. We are addressing President Clinton not only because he sponsors the peace process and oversees the Palestinian-Israeli accord, but because the criminal came from the United States. He is of U.S. origin. Many of the settlers who have committed crimes against our people came from the United States. They are fanatic adherents of extremism and racism who cover their crimes with Israeli garb. As for the Palestinian-Israeli talks and the sincere Palestinian aspiration for a just peace and a settlement based on international legitimacy, this has been met by the United States or Israel by obvious foot-dragging and a policy based on maneuvering and on gambling on the Arabs' current situation. President Clinton must realize that it is folly to bet on this state continuing. Our nation's despair, its sense of humiliation, and the scorn with which our causes are addressed can lead to explosions that will be difficult to control. What is taking place today on the land of Palestine will put matters back at square one. Needless to say, it will be difficult to discuss President Clinton's invitation to resume the talks in Washington on the presidential level unless the issue of the settlements and the settlers is addressed. The failure of the Israeli settlement policy on Palestinian lands has been proven. Israel must address this issue and defuse the situation before it blows up. U.S. invitations are tantamount to entertaining futile hopes, devoid of reality. All peace initiatives and efforts and peaceful invitations will be of no benefit unless they are accompanied by urgent action to end the violence and extremism practiced by the settlers against our people.
