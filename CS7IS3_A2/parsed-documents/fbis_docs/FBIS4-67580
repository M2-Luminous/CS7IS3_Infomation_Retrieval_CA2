Construction is to be completed by late (1994). Then, this processing complex will begin treating the waste from Gomel enterprises. The cost of construction is covered by some 100 Gomel enterprises with which the Gomel Executive Commission signed agreements on sharing expenditures for this project. Gomel authorities had to make this decision when Dorofeeva, chairman of the State Committee for Ecology, and the Belarusian Government refused to earmark financial assistance to them. According to Alyaksandr Titov, chairman of the Gomel Office for Ecology and Radiological Security, he does not understand why the State Committee for Ecology does not use this unique occasion to work out the technology of construction and operation of this complex to eventually free the city from dumping grounds.
