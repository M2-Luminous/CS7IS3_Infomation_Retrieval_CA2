This is the answer we reporters often receive when trying to arrange interviews. Even if we manage to see the VIPs, they tend to glance continually at their watches. Some even cut the interviews short because of the ubiquitous meeting. There are reports about a governor who was so tied-up with meetings that he was unable to go to his office for a month. Some work institutions even select leaders whose responsibility is simply to attend various meetings. The government has made persevering efforts to decrease the number of meetings. Still, meetings go on in profusion, all claiming to have good reasons for their existence. A round-the-year meeting calendar goes like this: A meeting must be held at the beginning of the year to discuss and set down work plans. A year-end meeting is naturally convened for summarizing the plans. In between the kick-off and close, there are the inevitable meetings to exchange experiences, read documents and award prizes. And many others. Ironically, an important part of the year-end meeting is to report on the number of meetings that have been held over the year. To maintain good relations with various departments, work institutions have to give a nod to meeting invitations from almost all sources, including their superior organizations, friendly counterparts and the local public service bodies. To pass up an invitation is considered an insult. If the local traffic control office is unhappy, all your vehicles may be accused of being in poor condition and be ordered off the road; if the local neighbourhood committee is displeased, you might be fined for "failing to keep the environment clean enough." Reject an invitation -- and you will be rejected. Of course, many people are only too pleased to be invited to meetings and harvest all the freebies--free trips, big feasts and souvenirs. Though I have been to too many meetings--quite often reluctantly--I am not totally against them. What I hate are the meaningless and long ones. The Chinese Communists have been known for their talent in mobilizing people to rise up against practices left over from the old feudal society. Such mobilizations were often done through meetings in which revolutionary principles were explained and problems concerning the interests of the participants were discussed. People were enthusiastic about going to such meetings. But since the establishment of the People's Republic, this once-effective weapon has been excessively used. As a result, it has lost its power. Most meetings are met with a "never-again" attitude. Few are interested in what's discussed in the meetings. Moreover, I doubt if the attendants are really able to carry out what's assigned to them at the meetings. The number of meetings held around the country is not available, but I believe the figure could run in the millions. As far as I know, most government organizations and enterprises still have Wednesday afternoons off for so-called "political study" meetings. I believe most people are bored with such routine meetings, in which newspaper articles are read by a responsible leader while the participants busily engage in chatting, dozing or knitting. Having such weekly meetings might be a decades-old practice and there might be some argument to keep them going, but I would advise meeting organizers to cancel them if they want to improve the unit's efficiency and productivity. It is a waste of time and money to hold these meetings if they achieve nothing. Billions of yuan must be needed to organize these millions of meetings. I am no expert on this affair, but friends tell me that, in organizing a meeting, the budget ranges from a few thousand yuan to half a million. It's time that we dampened the meeting fever of both organizers and participants. They should be reminded that, if a meeting has to be held, something concrete should be discussed, and decisions should be made. Empty talk has no value. Now that the management mechanism is being reformed in enterprises, managers should be accountable for their own actions. They should decide things for themselves and not involve half the factory. If they do, it only shows their sense of insecurity and lack of business confidence. Traditionally, in appraising an organization's performance, the number of meetings it held was regarded as a standard of its achievements. But the new concept should be: The fewer meetings held, the better. The best and most efficient way to cut down on the number of meetings, it seems to me, is to slash the meeting budget drastically. Who would attend if there were no banquets or carrier bags full of goodies? Who would organize if they had to reach into their own pockets? The money saved could be put to good use in an infinite number of ways--such as paying the teachers who have been given IOUs instead of their salaries. It requires great determination and a new way of thinking to bid farewell to meetings. The Hebei provincial government has set a good example. It decided to have no meetings in the entire month of April. The leaders, liberated from meeting engagements, could head to all corners of the province during that month for on-the-spot investigations, which helped their decision making far more than meetings ever would. When this directive was issued in March, many people were skeptical that, without meetings, things in the province would fall apart into a real mess. Now the month has passed, and we can see that the sky did not fall. I hope other provinces and organizations will follow the Hebei example, and I also hope Hebei's no-meeting period will be prolonged from the present one month to two months -- or longer.
