ACTION: Final rule; determination of applicability of regulations. SUMMARY: The List of Marginable OTC Stocks (OTC List) is composed of stocks traded over-the-counter (OTC) in the United States that have been determined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to be subject to the margin requirements under certain Federal Reserve regulations. The List of Foreign Margin Stocks (Foreign List) is composed of foreign equity securities that have met the Board's eligibility criteria under Regulation T. The OTC List and the Foreign List are published four times a year by the Board. This document sets forth additions to and deletions from the previous OTC List and Foreign List. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Peggy Wolffrum, Securities Regulation Analyst, Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, (202) 452&hyph;2781, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551. For the hearing impaired only, contact Dorothea Thompson, Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD) at (202) 452&hyph;3544. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Listed below are additions to and deletions from the OTC List, which was last published on July 25, 1994 (59 FR 37651), and became effective August 8, 1994. A copy of the complete OTC List is available from the Federal Reserve Banks. The OTC List includes those stocks that meet the criteria in Regulations G, T and U (12 CFR parts 207, 220 and 221, respectively). This determination also affects the applicability of Regulation X (12 CFR part 224). These stocks have the degree of national investor interest, the depth and breadth of market, and the availability of information respecting the stock and its issuer to warrant regulation in the same fashion as exchange-traded securities. The OTC List also includes any OTC stock designated for trading in the national market system (NMS security) under a rule approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Additional OTC stocks may be designated as NMS securities in the interim between the Board's quarterly publications. They will become automatically marginable upon the effective date of their NMS designation. The names of these stocks are available at the SEC and at the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and will be incorporated into the Board's next quarterly publication of the OTC List. Also listed below are additions to and deletions from the Board's Foreign List, which was last published on July 25, 1994 (59 FR 37651), and became effective August 8, 1994. The Foreign List includes those foreign securities that meet the criteria in section 220.17 of Regulation T and are eligible for margin treatment at broker-dealers on the same basis as domestic margin securities. A copy of the complete Foreign List is available from the Federal Reserve Banks. Public Comment and Deferred Effective Date The requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to notice and public participation were not followed in connection with the issuance of this amendment due to the objective character of the criteria for inclusion and continued inclusion on the Lists specified in 12 CFR 207.6(a) and (b), 220.17(a), (b), (c) and (d), and 221.7(a) and (b). No additional useful information would be gained by public participation. The full requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to deferred effective date have not been followed in connection with the issuance of this amendment because the Board finds that it is in the public interest to facilitate investment and credit decisions based in whole or in part upon the composition of these Lists as soon as possible. The Board has responded to a request by the public and allowed approximately a two-week delay before the Lists are effective.
