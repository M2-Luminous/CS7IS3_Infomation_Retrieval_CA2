The balance stood at 525.4 trillion yen at the end of January, the central bank said. The banks involved are 11 major commercial banks, 64 regional banks, 65 second-tier regional banks, three long-term credit banks and seven trusts banks. It was the third consecutive month in which the lending growth rate has hit a new low. Major commercial banks in particular made an effort to step up lending, said a Bank of Japan official. "But with fund demand generally frail, there was too much competition to get a piece of the pie and the lending situation basically stayed the same," he said. "I don't think lending will drop in the future, but it probably won't increase for a while either," he said. The balance of lending by the major commercial banks, known as city banks in Japan, rose 0.4 percent, while that of long-term credit banks grew 0.1 percent. Regional banks saw a 1.8 percent rise, and second-tier regional banks posted a 0.4 percent increase. But trust banks saw a decline for the fourth straight month, dropping 1.7 percent -- the biggest fall on record. Trust banks are probably suffering from the lack of popularity of their mainstay variable-interest loans whose rates are decided by the long-term prime rate, the central bank official said. Foreign banks saw a decline for the second straight month, but the drop by 14.7 percent was smaller than the 15.5 percent decline in December.
