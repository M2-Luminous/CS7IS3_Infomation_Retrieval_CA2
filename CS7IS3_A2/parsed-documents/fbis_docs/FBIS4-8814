"I believe that the current Bucharest regime does not feel confident" said the king, and invoked as arguments in support of this statement the numerous lies that were invented about him. Among other things, King Mihai mentioned that on Christmas Eve, the Romanian Television Station scheduled a documentary on the prime minister's Press Bureau in which he, the king, is accused of having betrayed the country, accusations that according to His Majesty are simple fabrications. The king reasserted his intention to return to his homeland only in his capacity as king and showed willingness "to serve the country faithfully and to help it regain the place it used to hold in Europe before the Communists came to power." In accordance with the declarations of His Majesty King Mihai, Princess Margaret will become his successor to the throne.
