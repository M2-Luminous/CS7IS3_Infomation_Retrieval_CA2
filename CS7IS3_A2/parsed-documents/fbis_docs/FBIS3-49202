Albright made the statement on Wednesday when replying to a question on how Washington would react to Croatia rendering military assistance to the Bosnian Croats. Albright underlined that Washington had often discussed the situation in Bosnia and that Croatia would face sanctions if it did not change its stand. Croatian President Franjo Tudjman recently threatened the Moslems that Croatia would openly intervene in Bosnia-Herzegovina unless they stopped their offensive against the Croats. Erstwhile allies in the war against the Bosnian Serbs, the Croats and Moslems fell to fighting fiercely last spring over territories in central and south-western Bosnia-Herzegovina. Co-chairman of the Yugoslav Peace Conference Lord Owen said in Vienna on Tuesday it was a public secret that Croatia already has regular troops in Bosnia. This was confirmed by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] reports. Regular Croatian troops have been involved in the Bosnian civil war since it broke out in April 1992. Their number at the end of last year was estimated at 60,000.
