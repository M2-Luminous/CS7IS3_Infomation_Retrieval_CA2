Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz adds that the ministers heard briefings on the situation in Gaza and Jericho, mainly by the coordinator of government activities in the territories. It was reported that unless funds are received in these areas, chiefly for the Palestinian police, the situation there will deteriorate. Prime Minister Rabin reiterated his criticism of 'Arafat's call for a jihad to free Jerusalem, and once again rejected 'Arafat's explanation. Foreign Minister Peres was more moderate in his remarks on the issue. The cabinet is currently dealing with the housing problem. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0920 GMT on 22 May carries a similar report, live from the Prime Minister's Office by political correspondent Udi Segal, which adds: "Ministers Shetrit and Tzaban noted the genocide taking place in Rwanda. The cabinet decided to express its shock in view of the murders in Africa. Foreign Minister Peres said he would examine the possibility of providing humanitarian aid to Rwanda."]
