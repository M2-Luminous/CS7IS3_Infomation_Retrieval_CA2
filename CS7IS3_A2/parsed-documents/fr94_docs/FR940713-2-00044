SUMMARY: EPA has received notices of registration of pesticides to meet special local needs under section 24(c) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended, from 28 States and Puerto Rico. A registration issued under this section of FIFRA shall not be effective for more than 90 days if the Administrator disapproves the registration or finds it to be invalid within that period. If the Administrator disapproves a registration or finds it to be invalid after 90 days, a notice giving that information will be published in the Federal Register . DATES: The last entry for each item is the date the State registration of that product became effective. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Daria Mills, Program Management and Support Division, Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 216, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-305-7406. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice only lists the section 24(c) applications submitted to the Agency. The Agency has 90 days to approve or disapprove each application listed in this notice.
