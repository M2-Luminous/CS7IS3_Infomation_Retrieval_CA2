He accused France of "supporting the dictatorship" of President Mobutu. Mr. Maliba, accompanied by Etienne Tshisekedi, the main Zairian opposition leader, was taking part in a mammoth rally organized by the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, UDPS, the first radical opposition party, to which both belong. Mr. Tshisekedi "warned" Marshal Mobutu to sign the decree appointing him the new prime minister of Zaire, otherwise threatening to call on diamond producers to embark on an indefinite strike. Mr. Tshisekedi is a native of the Kasai-oriental region (in central Zaire), the main diamond producing region of the country, whose production currently represents the main source of revenue for the country.
