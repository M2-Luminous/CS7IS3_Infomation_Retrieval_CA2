The announcement followed a statement by former Russian Vice-Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar that the merger of the two systems is detrimental to Russia. Myasnikovich said that "the statement by Yegor Timurovich reflects the position not of the whole government of Russia, but of one of its members, though very influential." Myasnikovich stressed that during the talks in Moscow on January 5 with Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, Gaydar did not rule out the possibility of the integration of the two monetary systems. He said, however, that this is a long process and may take up to six months. The Belarusian vice-premier said that Belarus is doing everything possible to agree the tax, banking, customs and foreign economic policies. The talks on these issues were in progress during the entire last year. On many of them agreements have been reached. "We are working within the framework of an agreed tax, licence and quota policy," Myasnikovich said. He stressed that the merger of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems aims at removing barriers in trade and monetary cooperation that emerged after Russia seceded from the rouble zone, starting the chaotic development of independent monetary policies in CIS states. In a joint statement signed on January 5, the heads of government of Russia and Belarus stated that the necessary preliminary work for merging the two monetary systems has been completed.
