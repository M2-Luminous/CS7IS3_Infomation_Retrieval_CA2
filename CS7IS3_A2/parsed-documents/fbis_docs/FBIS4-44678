CNES [National Center for Space Studies] has commissioned Europropulsion (a subsidiary of SEP [European Propulsion Company] France and BPD [Fiat group] Italy) with the project. Working out of the MPA University of Stuttgart, Man Technologie of Germany, in charge of developing the body of the engine, submitted the metal structure of the engine (the most powerful powder burning engine ever built in Europe) to structural qualification testing at limit internal and external loads up to rupture point. Preparation of the model and procedures had been handled by Man Technologie and Andritz (Austria) under prime contractorship of Division Propulsion of Haillan Powder and Composite Propulsion Division. The one-month test period illustrated the ability of the motor body to withstand, with the required margins, all stress generated on the ground and in flight by the MPS and Ariane 5 space rocket. Rupture occurred under a pressure of 92 bars (1.4 times normal engine operating pressure) in accordance with the anticipated scenario. For the third fire-up test of the MPS now being prepared at Kourou, engine attachment to structure will be representative of flight configuration. The qualification testing of 11 February 1994 constitutes the green light of Europropulsion to continue this preparation work. The Ariane 5 is a program of the European Space Agency which has commissioned CNES with technical and financial management.
