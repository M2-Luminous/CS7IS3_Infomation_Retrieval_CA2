Kovac Rejects Accusations, Corruption Charge AU0205134394 Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak 28 Apr 94 p 2 AU0205134394 Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA Slovak BFN [TA SR report] [Text] Bratislava -- In a statement issued yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac states that he learned about the motion by 35 deputies to recall him from the post of Slovak deputy prime minister from radio yesterday at noon. He expresses his unequivocal rejection of the accusations leveled against him, which he considers absurd, also because he does not know a single reason that prompted the deputies to come up with their motion. He is convinced that this motion is part of the unfair strategy pursued by a certain political entity, or entities, whose aim is to discredit their political adversaries at any price. Slovak Prime Minister and Democratic Union of Slovakia Chairman Jozef Moravcik said yesterday that he was not aware of anything connected with the person of Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac that would confirm "inability to cope with the post of deputy prime minister, suspicion of attempted corruption, and a faulty moral profile." Speaking to a TA SR correspondent, T. Cabaj, chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia Club of Deputies, confirmed that the movement availed itself of specific evidence bearing out Roman Kovac's corruption. He added that they would submit this evidence only at the extraordinary NRSR meeting that has been called to deal with their motion. Asked about the existence of documents that might serve as evidence, K. Tothova, former minister of justice, said that she did not know these documents.
