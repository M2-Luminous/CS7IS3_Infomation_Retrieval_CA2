FR940404-0-00097 FR940404-0-00023 Some comments objected to Bureau staff review of numbers submitted, suggesting that such review would be arbitrary and without standards. Another comment stated that the new rule constitutes a loss of opportunity to call all persons without a prior restraint. The Bureau's rule does not prevent an inmate from submitting any telephone number he or she chooses to submit, including telephone numbers for persons other than family and friends. As revised, the final rule provides for the requested telephone numbers to be added to the inmate's telephone list. Further, the final rule modifies proposed §540.101(a) with respect to specifying the grounds for rejection of requested numbers. As modified, that provision, now 28 CFR 540.101(a)(3), states that the Associate Warden may deny placement of a telephone number on an inmate's telephone list if the Associate Warden determines that there is a threat to institution security and good order or a threat to the public. Any disapproval must be documented in writing to both the inmate and the proposed recipient of the calls. The Bureau notes that one commenter acknowledged that ``*␣*␣* some of this [disapproval] is understandable, i.e., security, threats to the public safety; *␣*␣*'' Examples of situations that may warrant rejection include, but are not limited to, indication that the proposed recipient of the call is involved in the introduction of contraband into the institution, in an escape plot, or in other activity threatening the public safety, such as harassing victims or witnesses. The rejection of a number may be appealed, as discussed in the next section. 6. No Separate Appeal Process Some commenters complained that the proposed rule does not provide for any separate appeal of ITS-related decisions, specifically, decisions concerning the inmate's list of numbers to be called. The Bureau believes it is unnecessary to provide for any separate ITS appeal process because a program is already in place which is well-known and used by inmates to raise individual concerns about any correctional issue. All inmates entering BOP institutions are informed of the Administrative Remedy Program, described in 28 CFR part 542. Briefly, the Program operates as follows: At the institution level, an inmate may raise concerns formally by filing a Request for Administrative Remedy on a form known as a BP&hyph;9. If the inmate disagrees with the Warden's response, he or she may file an Appeal to the Regional Director on a form known as a BP&hyph;10. If the inmate is dissatisfied with the Regional Director's response, he or she may file an Appeal to the Office of the General Counsel on a form known as a BP&hyph;11. The Administrative Remedy Program is available for inmates to raise individual ITS-related complaints. Recently, the Bureau surveyed all institutions where the ITS has been implemented to determine the level of concern. This survey showed that only a very small number of ITS-related Administrative Remedy requests and appeals have been filed. In fact, only one percent or less of the total Administrative Remedy requests and appeals filed during the survey period were ITS-related. Given the successful operation of the Administrative Remedy Program, the Bureau finds no reason to provide for any separate inmate appeal process in the revised telephone regulations. However, in response to these comments, the Bureau is modifying the final rule to include a reference to the Administrative Remedy Program. See 28 CFR 540.101(a)(3).
