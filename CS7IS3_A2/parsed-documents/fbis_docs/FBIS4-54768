Previously -- from January 1, 1994 -- Kopecna was charged with temporary heading of the Attorney General's Office as deputy attorney general until the appointment of an attorney general. Bohumira Kopecna, LLB, was born on July 28, 1946. She graduated at the Law School of Prague Charles University and in 1971 she began to work at the District Prosecutor's Office in Bruntal, north Moravia. Later she worked at District Prosecutor's Office in Sumperk, north Moravia, and from 1975 she was prosecutor in the department of general crime at Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Brno, south Moravia. In 1990, Kopecna was appointed deputy prosecutor at Brno-Countryside Prosecutor's Office, where she worked until April 1993. Then she returned to Brno Prosecutor's Office where she worked until December 1993, when the Czech Justice Minister Jiri Novak appointed her deputy attorney general. Kopecna has never been member of a political party. "I am neither member of any party nor I do intend to join any party, but I favor the Civic Democratic Party (ODS). It is true, that I voted for them in the last (June 1992) elections," Kopecna told CTK on Tuesday. She also said that if she is proposed to the post of the attorney general, she would accept, also because it was unbearable to exercise simultaneously the functions of the attorney general and deputy attorney general. "It is necessary to separate these functions," she said.
