He made this promise at the 7th conference of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], which is being held on the eve of the party's fifth congress scheduled for April 2. The LDP leader is confident that if his party gained success at the elections to the Duma, his manners and behaviour are quite right and should not be changed. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy called upon the LDP to get ready for the presidential elections which, in his opinion, may take place already this year. In his opinion, neither Shakhray, nor Yavlinskiy, nor Sobchak will be able to harvest over 10 percent of voices and Rutskoy, who "may get more", is also no challenger. "Our party has real chances to be a success," said the LDP leader. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy assured the participants in the conference of no prospects for any split in the party or any collective leadership. "We have undivided authority and, at the same time, full democracy," said Zhirinovskiy.
