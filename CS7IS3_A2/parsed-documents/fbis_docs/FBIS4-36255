The government assumes that terrorism can be fought without silencing the political process, and following the Air Force attack, the time has come to test this concept. The problem is that even prior to Mustafa al-Dirani's capture and the attack on the terrorists in Lebanon's al-Biqa', there were blanks on the political radar Jerusalem directed at Damascus. It is true that Yitzhaq Rabin did not promise Husni Mubarak that his government would be prepared to withdraw from the entire Golan Heights, but he led the Egyptian president to believe Israel is ready for such a move. That is a wise and dangerous move. It reflects a complex situation for a statesman feeling around for an Archimedes level in diplomacy to signal to his enemy his willingness to pay a high price for peace, but not any price. Rabin can permit such brinkmanship after accumulating with Shim'on Peres a lot of credit in the negotiations with the Palestinians. Just as Likud leaders know they cannot bring the right-wing masses out to demonstrate against an evacuation of Gaza and Jericho, they also know that had the prime minister proposed a peace accord based on a total withdrawal from the Golan Heights the minority coalition in the Knesset would have received majority support among the people. Warren Christopher's entourage told Hafiz al-Asad precisely that. When he complained about Rabin linking any withdrawal to a national referendum, he was told that in their view, the prime minister has the power to align a majority for his position. Al-Asad silently agreed with that. It seems that the only one who cannot gauge the level of credit at his disposal is Rabin himself. He sees the situation as made up of both light and shade. He is first interested in giving al-Asad the feeling that there are no free meals, and therefore Israel will express no regrets if Christopher does not make haste to take off in the first flight to the Middle East. On that there is full coordination between Jerusalem and Washington. That understanding is part of the overall perspective that Bill Clinton's administration will not impose a solution on Israel, which al-Asad must be convinced of in order to understand that the negotiations must be conducted with Rabin and Peres. Under those conditions, Jerusalem responds incorrectly by emphasizing that Syria lacks a military option against the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. The government believes that Damascus has the clout to harass and support terrorism, but not to score a strategic victory. Modern history is full of such misguided declarations, like those made by Golda Me'ir and Moshe Dayan at the time. Rabin and Peres were a part of that team and should remember, given their positions in the top leadership. So why repeat the mistake? Just like in those bad years, Jerusalem is developing a lexicon of dangerous terms to hold up the process. At the time, the Israelis aspersed to Henry Kissinger and Joseph Sisco that Yasir 'Arafat will never recognize Israel's right to exist, therefore there is nobody to talk to on the Palestinian side. This was until we heard 'Arafat's famous "caduc," embarrassing Jerusalem. Warren Christopher and Dennis Ross are now being told that al-Asad is not Anwar al-Sadat. The disparity is as long as the negotiations themselves: The Egyptian got things going by stepping off in Jerusalem, and the Syrian stays clear of it. Al-Sadat agreed to the withdrawal starting without the uprooting of settlements in Sinai, al-Asad refuses to hear of such a possibility. What can be done, Jerusalem asks with glee, if Damascus refuses to adopt the Camp David model? But that is a mistake. One day al-Asad will get up and fully adopt the Camp David technique after adapting it geographically to the northern border, and Rabin's arguments and Peres' diplomatic arrows will become empty cliches in one blow. The prime minister is mistaken in waiting for processes to develop in Israel and the Arab world. He and Peres have the backing and power to advance the negotiations. Since in my view, they have already accepted in their hearts the concept that any peace with Syria depends on a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, they will gain almost nothing by sticking to the approach that it has no chance of being approved. No delaying tactics will lead Damascus to give up part of its territory. The horse trading has to be conducted by sticking in principle to the Camp David accords and adapting it to Israel's special defense needs in the north. There is also another important parallel: Rabin rightly claimed recently that the accord with the PLO was completed five minutes before midnight, not five minutes after. He just has to continue the parallel: Why does the agreement with Syria also have to be made under tough conditions? If the initiative and political credit exist, then it can be agreed upon at the 11th hour. It is a blatant case of the saying: the sooner the better.
