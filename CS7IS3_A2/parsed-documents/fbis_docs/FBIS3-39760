The reason is because Rauf Denktas rejected President Kliridhis' proposal on setting up a schedule for the return of all the residents to the fenced-off part of Famagusta in conjunction with the reopening of the Nicosia Airport and for safe access from and to Famagusta. The Kliridhis proposal includes the withdrawal of the occupation troops to the east of the Dherinia Road so that there will not be any danger of enclaving the Varosha residents. [passage omitted] A senior government source told I MAKHI yesterday that at the next session of the talks President Kliridhis will reiterate the same positions about Famagusta, Nicosia Airport, and safe access to the fenced-off area of Famagusta. The same source added that these issues are of substantial importance to the Greek Cypriot side. This is why there is not going to be any retreat, the source stressed. The same source also noted that the Greek Government has been fully briefed on the results of the first phase of the talks. President Kliridhis, the source added, will convene a meeting of the National Council after the second phase of the talks is concluded at the end of February. At any rate, the Cyprus Government and the political leaders in general do not expect any "spectacular" developments in the new phase of the talks either. What is expected to happen after Rauf Denktas' return from Ankara -- where he will go tomorrow and return on Wednesday -- is that he will make some new maneuvers and then again block the course of discussion by reiterating the same positions, particularly on Famagusta, which is the key to developments. At the same time, backstage diplomats, particularly the British and Americans, have begun again to move actively in an attempt to overcome the deadlock. Their efforts will also be focused on Ankara on the occasion of the Turkish Cypriot leaders visit there. To break the deadlock, U.S. Ambassador in Nicosia Richard Boucher and British High Commissioner David Dain received instructions to begin intensive consultations with the two sides. It is also rumored that U.S. Special Cyprus Coordinator Robert Lamb will be coming to Nicosia during these days to assist in the consultations. The purpose of the new diplomatic moves is to attempt, in the event that it is impossible to end the deadlock, to find a formula on the basis of which Mr. Kliridhis and Mr. Denktas will meet with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali in New York for two-three days to hold a "general" discussion. On the basis of this formula, the British and Americans hope that the proximity talks, of which they are "sponsors," will continue. At any rate, the experiment of the proximity talks and the CBM's seems to be failing. [passage omitted]
