The Game of Radical Economic Reforms in Russia Has Ended for the Time Being"] [Text] Yegor Gaydar's resignation is in no way capable of changing the character of the economic policy pursued by Viktor Chernomyrdin, because the incumbent government had none even after Gaydar's comeback. The fact is that it has been more than six months now that the reformist theoretical mood has been pushed into the background relative to the cabinet's ongoing fire-fighting activity. When, in responding to questions about his possible appointment to replace Gaydar, Grigoriy Yavlinskiy described the government as "Soviet," it was not his intention to use profanity. Simply, the "Soviet" government has always been a secondary organ with respect to the ideological apparatus structures in Staraya Ploshchad. And now, when the government has meekly moved into the White House (while the president's administration went into Staraya Ploshchad), everything has been put into place. It is another matter whether there is a perception about the need for an economic policy in Staraya Ploshchad. From the start, Yegor Gaydar claimed starring roles in the cabinet. After the election defeat Viktor Chernomyrdin demoted Gaydar to the "second" first vice premier. The formal sharing of the status of first deputy with Soskovets, who can be defined as the cabinet's industry leader, effectively deprived the ex-premier of the opportunity to influence the government's conduct of any economic policy. In this context the mention of the ambitious and rational Yavlinskiy as a replacement for the ideologically reformist decoration can only evoke a smile. Although it needs to be recognized that if the EPICenter head had no substantial material and ideological basic structure, he would have had to consent. What then substitutes for economic policy in the present cabinet of ministers? Here one should go back to the trinity that featured in Chernomyrdin's speech in parliament. Apparently, this is social policy as a method of preserving and multiplying the well-being of the (entire) people; the second, that is to say, "anti-shock" wind for the reforms; and support and assistance for producers. Naturally these are guidelines for practical people, not a concept for long-term development. The practical peoples' weight in the Russian cabinet of ministers is so substantial, however, that the interests of industrial, agrarian, and financial lobbies will acquire the character of economic policy in the very near future. At the same time, since Gaydar's pressure on the president has after all led to his effective resignation, the entire spectrum of economic policy options will be presented in parliament. It is clear that such a scenario can result in a curious lineup in the system of power distribution. The government, while remaining a purely working body, will be implementing political decisions by the president's administration and economic decisions by parliament. Radical reform advocates will consider such a scheme typical for a third-world country. It is necessary to admit, however, that an alternative to this at the present stage is only a reformist dictatorship, and therefore many, many upheavals. The evolution of the above scheme on the contrary contributes to political stability, which is necessary to overcome many complexes of the post-socialist power, including the irrationality of the politicized populace. Specifically this will mean for the Russian economy the maintaining of inflation at its current level with the haphazard flourishing or degradation of various branches. Until a new perception has come about of what is a real economic reform for Russia.
