The conference was organized by the Energy Efficiency Committee of the United Nations and sponsorship over the conference was adopted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic. "Mr. Frederic Romig, the secretary of the UN Energy Commission, assured me that the conference signifies hope for us and that the model solution for saving energy in Ceska Lipa Okres, a project which is designated as an energy-efficient demonstration zone in the region of Ceska Lipa, and on which we began working with Mr. Romig approximately 18 months ago, continues to be alive. Mr. Romig already has in hand the final signatures pertaining to the availability of financing and the first operations could be initiated by the end of this year," said Bohuslav Rychtarik, the mayor of Straz pod Ralskem, about the negotiations. [hp] At the conference, you met with representatives of entrepreneurial circles and government organizations. What are their experiences in revitalizing former military regions? [Rychtarik] They assured us that the basic condition for revitalizing military areas is privatization--without privatization, we cannot move from the spot. The Czech Government has already created the fundamental conditions. A budgetary organization has been established for the privatization of former military areas at Ralsko and Mlada. The organization is called PRIVUM and a part of the property owned by the former military area has already been transferred to the property holdings of Straz pod Ralskem. We have already negotiated with representatives of PRIVUM and we were very surprised about how much they were "in the picture" with regard to the Ralsko area. They are extremely forthcoming and are developing maximum efforts to see to it that the problems are finally solved rapidly. We agreed on a precise schedule under which the various individual facilities will be transferred to PRIVUM, we know who must do what by when in order for matters to move forward. [hp] Did the negotiations with representatives of foreign firms bring any concrete results? [Rychtarik] In establishing personal contacts, we realized that we are not the only ones who must deal with the revitalization of former military areas. The U.S. Government is releasing enormous financial resources toward the revitalization of former military areas. It can afford to do so, much as it can afford to finance retraining of individuals and provide some advantages to those who are beginning to operate in former military areas as entrepreneurs. The Czech Republic, as one of the countries of the former Eastern bloc, has progressed the furthest in the privatization of former military territories, something which was confirmed to us by representatives from Belarus as well as from Latvia, who are sincerely envious of us. Revitalization of the Ralsko area was of great interest at the conference to the Greeks, but, so far, they have not come up with a specific offer. On the other hand, negotiations involving Americans look quite promising. Rolls-Royce representatives were not only representing the world renowned automobile factory at the conference -- one of the divisions of the company is oriented toward processing uranium and is focused on ecology. The Americans were interested in the program for discontinuation of the extraction of uranium ore. In the immediate future, a working group from Rolls-Royce is to negotiate the topic with Eng. J. Makovicka, the director of the DIAMO state enterprise at Straz pod Ralskem.
