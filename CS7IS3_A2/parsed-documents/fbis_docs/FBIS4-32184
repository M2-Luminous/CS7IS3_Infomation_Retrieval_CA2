The chairman of this council, Adem Demaci, stressed in his talks with the CSCE delegation that the political and repressive actions of the present Serb regime against the Albanians are public actions, and in most cases sanctioned by the Serb laws, such as the Law on Kosova's Colonization, and on Banning the Sale and Purchase of Real Property Among Different Nationalities. Demaci also familiarized the CSCE delegation with the daily Serb police and military violence against Albanians, murdering and wounding them without any cause.
