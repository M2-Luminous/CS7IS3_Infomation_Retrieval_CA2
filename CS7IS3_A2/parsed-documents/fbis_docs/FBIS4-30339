"A result that derails common sense is not to be expected," Ozawa told reporters. Hata and his cabinet ministers resigned en masse Saturday prior to a possible defeat in a no-confidence vote against his cabinet tabled by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the largest opposition party. Earlier Sunday, another key coalition figure Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito [Clean Government Party], also said "I don't think Mr. Hata will become prime minister again and he himself probably thinks similarly." Ozawa said it would be natural to extend the term of the current 150-day regular Diet session, which closes on Wednesday, if the Diet fails to nominate a new prime minister. Ozawa, secretary general of Hata's Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], also urged the LDP and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the No. 2 opposition bloc, to offer their own vision of a new government to succeed Hata's minority coalition administration. "Both the LDP and the SDP should put to the people their blueprints for establishing the next government because it is they who pressed the Hata cabinet to resign... We will wait for those blueprints," Ozawa said. Ozawa said the resignation of Hata and his cabinet was not intended to meet the SDP's demand that the cabinet resign voluntarily as a prerequisite for its rejoining the coalition.
