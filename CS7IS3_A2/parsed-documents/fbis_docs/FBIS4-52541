Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says no one but a separatist dead set against reunification can make such remarks. The news analyst says: It is crystal-clear that the traitor Kim Yong-sam wants a permanent division of the country and fratricidal war, not reunification and peace. It is a never-to-be-condoned crime for him to block reunification desired by the nation and drive the chariot of permanent division for the sake of his personal ease and power. The South Korean people have concluded once again that the reunification of the country is impossible as long as the traitor Kim Yong-sam is left alone. For the reunification of the country, the supreme desire of the nation, the Kim Yong-sam group of separatists must be removed as early as possible. The traitor Kim Yong-sam must look straight at the trend of the nation toward reunification, give up the anti-reunification, separatist moves, step down and face judgement by history as demanded by all people.
