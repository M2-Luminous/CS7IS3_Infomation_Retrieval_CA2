FR940810-0-00031 FR940810-0-00016 The State of Wisconsin has provided for exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after consultation with the USEPA and the Small Business Administration Administrator and after providing notice and opportunity for public comment, of any category or subcategory of sources that the State determines to have sufficient technical and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the Act. WDNR has the authority to narrow the definition in this manner through rulemaking. III. This Action The State of Wisconsin has submitted a SIP revision implementing each of the required PROGRAM elements required by section 507 of the Act. The Small Business Ombudsman elements began delivering assistance services in July 1993. The SBEC was fully functional by October 1993. The SBAP will be fully implemented by the effective date of Wisconsin's Title V Operating Permit Program, which may occur before November 1994. USEPA is, therefore, approving this submittal. Because USEPA considers this final rule noncontroversial and routine, we are approving it today without prior proposal. This rule will become effective on October 11, 1994. However, if we receive notice by September 9, 1994, that someone wishes to submit adverse comments, then USEPA will publish: (1) A document that withdraws the action, and (2) a document that begins a new rulemaking by proposing the action and establishing a comment period. This action has been classified as a Table 2 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional Administrators). A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993), USEPA must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, of State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, users fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or
