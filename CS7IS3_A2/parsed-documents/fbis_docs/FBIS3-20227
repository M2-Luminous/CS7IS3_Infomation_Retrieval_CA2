Tsakiris] [Text] Look East, North, and West. A new Greece is waiting for us and we should defend it. This is the philosophy of the new defense doctrine that aims to retain the only opportunity given to our country to play a decisive role in the Balkans and reinforce its position in Europe. For the first time, the National Defense Ministry appears to be getting out of the narrow framework and entering the foreign policy and military diplomacy fields. The right of the powerful, a policy Turkey follows, is the ministry's new goal. The first and necessary move on the international chessboard is the change in our country's defense doctrine and the unified defense space with Cyprus. It is the second time in our country's recent history that there has been a change in the defense doctrine. The first change was imposed by the developments of 1974. Earlier, Greece's threat came from the North and was not so much due to a real threat as designed to serve NATO's needs. But the events of 1974 forced the government to withdraw from NATO's military branch (to which it later returned) to change the defense doctrine and clearly state the danger from the East. The second change in the defense doctrine is formulated now by the National Defense Ministry. Compared with the first change, the substantial difference is that this change is not a result of military action. It constitutes a change in handling international political and military developments. The goal now is to strengthen Greece internationally and the first move is the unified defense space with Cyprus. In practice, this means that the two countries coordinate their defense needs and moves and their defense purchases and exercises. And the "casus belli" will be valid for both sides. The second factor leading our country to change its defense doctrine is the agreement by all governments that "they wrongly placed their hopes for a Cyprus solution on an ineffective and bureaucratic machine like the United Nations. Not only has it failed to help substantially, but it has reduced hopes of a solution to the minimum." The success of the new defense doctrine is based on unified Hellenism, which means--and this is clear in the Defense Ministry's documents--that an offensive move by the Turks in Cyprus "provides the legal basis for our country to attack Turkey from any point, not only from the front that Turkey opened." In this way, we will increase the fronts the Turkish Army must face and decrease the possibilities of a Turkish attack, while pressing Turkey to amend its intransigence over the Aegean and Cyprus. The goal is to upgrade Hellenism as a force in the Balkans and increase Greece and Cyprus' negotiating capabilities.
