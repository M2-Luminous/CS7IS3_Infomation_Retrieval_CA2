What is your assessment? [Iliescu] As for the democratic transition process, I believe that we have achieved the most significant reforms, and that these have deeply changed Romanian society. We now have a multiparty political system with genuine freedom of expression and a veritable boom as far as the press is concerned. Over 200 political parties have emerged, 90 of which participated in the various elections, whose fairness nobody questioned. All this was done in record time, and the process must of course continue and expand. The foundation for a constitutional state and a democratic society has now been laid in Romania. [Audibert] But has the rapporteur of the Council of Europe not just reminded you of some of your commitments concerning the demilitarization of the police and the rights of the Hungarian minorities in Romania? [Iliescu] Look, one can find room for improvement in any country. I could draw a list, say, for the United States of America. We do not view ourselves as perfect in this regard, but I do want to stress the fact that we have made considerable headway. We are being judged on the matter of national minorities, but quite frankly, I do not know of a single country in Europe where minorities have comparable rights. Here, all minorities are represented in Parliament. Hungarians alone have 39 representatives in the lower and upper houses, and they can study their native tongue in primary and secondary school. Who can match this? Not Hungary, I assure you. [Audibert] What about the economic situation? [Iliescu] The Cold War is over, but there still is a veritable economic iron curtain between the West and the East in general, and Romania in particular. At first, we had the theoretical advantage of starting out without being burdened by an external debt. In fact, this turned out to be a liability. While countries such as Hungary or Poland were showered with credits, Romania had to beg, and sometimes it felt it was being treated like a second-class country. [Audibert] Is the real reason not the fact that you oppose economic reform? [Iliescu] But this is crazy! I am not stupid, I am a realist. On the contrary, I believe we need to get rid of any ideological prejudices to tackle new national and international realities. As soon as I was reelected in 1992, I put forward a project to foster national unity between all parties and to promote reform and see the country through the transitional period. My position remains the same today. There is no alternative to a free and competitive market economy, but it must include a veritable safety net. The real difficulty is reconciling these three imperatives. [Audibert] What causes the deadlock, then? [Iliescu] We have three groups of enemies. First, people longing for a return to the previous system, who take advantage of an obvious social reality: Since 1989, life has been very difficult and, for most people, democracy without any improvement in daily life has no value per se. Yet, that old system which ensured everyone a minimum wage and which those people want to reinstall is pure fiction in an open economy. Second are those who would return us to pre-war Romania, who cannot see that the real challenge is to integrate the country into the European mainstream. Last, there is a mafia whose only concern is getting rich by taking advantage of the difficulties encountered during any period of transition, and which increases corruption. I for one do not have ties with any of these groups. [Audibert] What do you think of the return to power of former Communist parties, as in Poland, or their increased popularity, as in Hungary or Slovakia? [Iliescu] This stems from a feeling of disappointment from people who had applauded the democratization but are disappointed by the way right-wing parties have managed the transition. So they turn to left-wing forces in the hope that they will know how to protect them better. But one should not overestimate this phenomenon and its extent. I do not believe in any possibility of reverting to the previous system. [Audibert] You were the first to adhere to the "Partnership for Peace" formula offered by NATO. Do you think it is enough of a security guarantee for Central and Eastern European countries? [Iliescu] No, it is not, but it was the best way to avoid being discriminated with regard to the Visegrad group (Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland), for instance. In future, this Partnership also needs to become an economic development partnership. This is a crucial aspect for security in Europe, one that has not been properly dealt with yet. The military Iron Curtain is no more, but the economic Iron Curtain may yet turn out to be even more damaging, a new source of tensions. Instead of indulging in navel-gazing over its small internal problems, Europe would do well to become more open to the East and to study ways to go beyond such disparities. [Audibert] Many of your neighbors fear new hegemonic pretensions from Russia in the region. What about you? [Audibert] Such pretensions exist, there is no doubt about it. The Russian problem will remain for a long time a hot issue both for Europe and with respect to the global balance of power. Russia is and will remain a large country with a huge economic and military potential. In such a large entity, transition and stabilization are much more complicated issues than in Romania, so one sees nationalistic movements cropping up as well as a kind of imperial nostalgia -- which is understandable in a country which long held a superpower status equal to that of the United States. In such a context, the worst mistake one can make would be to isolate Russia and exclude it from the general process of European partnership and integration. [Audibert] Do you believe in a sustainable solution to the Yugoslavian conflict? [Iliescu] Romanians feel strongly about Yugoslavia, which was always our best neighbor. We are deeply affected by the tragedy of this heroic people, and we have maintained ties with all parties. However, I consider that the international community must be more attentive and balanced with respect to all parties. There is an anti-Serb attitude that is inappropriate. This war is a tragedy for everyone, and the Serbs have been suffering as much as the others. The only sustainable solution is for the belligerents to reach a political settlement, with the support of the international community. We all know that there cannot be a purely military solution. In any event, one thing is certain: the Yugoslav problem cannot be solved at the Serb's expense.
