FR940223-2-00028 FR940223-2-00021 The Department has published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on August 23, 1993, (58 FR 44583) to amend the furnace test procedure, which addresses the above issue. Previous waivers for this type of time blower delay control have been granted by DOE to Coleman Company, 50 FR 2710, January 18, 1985; Magic Chef Company, 50 FR 41553, October 11, 1985; Rheem Manufacturing Company, 53 FR 48574, December 1, 1988, 56 FR 2920, January 25, 1991, 57 FR 10166, March 24, 1992, and 57 FR 34560, August 5, 1992; Trane Company, 54 FR 19226, May 4, 1989, 56 FR 6021, February 14, 1991, 57 FR 10167, March 24, 1992, and 57 FR 22222, May 27, 1992; Lennox Industries, 55 FR 50224, December 5, 1990, and 57 FR 49700, November 3, 1992; Inter-City Products Corporations, 55 FR 51487, December 14, 1990, and 56 FR 63945, December 6, 1991; DMO Industries, 56 FR 4622, February 6, 1991; Heil-Quaker Corporation, 56 FR 6019, February 14, 1991; Carrier Corporation, 56 FR 6018, February 14, 1991, and 57 FR 38830, August 27, 1992; Amana Refrigeration Inc., 56 FR 27958, June 18, 1991, 56 FR 63940, December 6, 1991, and 57 FR 23392, June 3, 1992; Snyder General Corporation, 56 FR 54960, September 9, 1991; Goodman Manufacturing Corporation, 56 FR 51713, October 15, 1991, and 57 FR 27970, June 23, 1992; The Ducane Company Inc., 56 FR 63943, December 6, 1991, and 57 FR 10163, March 24, 1992; Armstrong Air Conditioning, Inc. 57 FR 899, January 9, 1992, 57 FR 10160, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 10161, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 39193, August 28, 1992, and 57 FR 54230, November 17, 1992; Thermo Products, Inc., 57 FR 903, January 9, 1992; Consolidated Industries Corporation, 57 FR 22220, May 27, 1992, Evcon Industries, Inc., 57 FR 47847, October 20, 1992; and Bard Manufacturing Company, 57 FR 53733, November 12, 1992. Thus, it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted for blower time delay. In those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated based upon DOE having granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested and rated for energy consumption on a comparable basis. Therefore, based on the above, DOE is granting Goodman an Interim Waiver for its GMPV series central furnaces. Pursuant to paragraph (e) of Section 430.27 of the Code of Federal Regulations part 430, the following letter granting the Application for Interim Waiver to Goodman was issued. Pursuant to paragraph (b) of 10 CFR part 430.27, DOE is hereby publishing the ``Petition for Waiver'' in its entirety. The petition contains no confidential information. The Department solicits comments, data, and information respecting the petition. Issued in Washington, DC, February 10, 1994. Christine A. Ervin, Assistant Secretary, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
