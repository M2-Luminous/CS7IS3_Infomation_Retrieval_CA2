The meeting was joined by Premier Vladimir Meciar after his return from Brussels, where he signed the Partnership for Peace plan at NATO's headquarters. The Slovak parliament was stalemated last week when the deputies from the government Movement For a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS) walked out of the parliament at the moment when the coalition's and the opposition's balance of forces was 75-75. Ivan Laluha, former chairman of the HZDS Group, told journalists that "this situation cannot prevail. It is not possible that a decision on whether or not the government remains be made at every parliamentary meeting, because this hampers the process of transformation. Early elections are one of possible solutions." Laluha as well as Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik came out against Meciar's proposal to solve the situation through a referendum. In it citizens would decide on whether or not the deputies who left the parties and movements for which they had been elected to the parliament should leave the parliament. In this way, the government camp would gain back the parliamentary majority.
