"If changes are to be made, this is definitely a responsibility of the commander in chief which is clearly established in the Law Governing the Armed Forces," Discua stated. Discua Elvir asserted he will meet this week with commanders individually "to define forces' organization," work plans, and the changes that will be made. The military chief described as errors and speculation the reports on the ratification of all military chiefs in the northern part of the country. According to the general, there will be few changes and no "shakeups," as happened last year. Additionally, the Armed Forces chief said the new national defense and public security minister will be named by President-elect Carlos Roberto Reina, not by the military leadership, as has always occurred in the past. Discua Elvir ruled out a rebellion by officers against him in view of the announced changes or the situation prevailing within the institution. Although he said he does not exercise control over everybody, he has his "working team," because a man is unable to have more than 10 people under his command. These 10 men, he stated, "are responsible for disseminating all the information an executive can give." Meanwhile, Discua Elvir explained that the election of the new congressional president is an internal affair of the Liberal Party of Honduras [PLH], but he said he hopes "everything is done to benefit" the people and that political party. Discua Elvir concluded that the PLH will initiate a strong government, "with clear ideas and objectives."
