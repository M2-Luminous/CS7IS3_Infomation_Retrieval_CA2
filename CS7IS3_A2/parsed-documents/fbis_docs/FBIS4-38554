The president said this Monday in an answer to reporters' questions about the publication of allegations of a parliament member being a KGB informer dubbed Varis. He also denied having received the letter containing such information as suggested by its author, Viktors Alksnis, a former Soviet Supreme Council deputy. "More serious provocations may face the president and the government in the future" because the Baltic states and Latvia are still trying to gain international prestige, Ulmanis said. The media were acquainted with the letter by the Interfax and Baltic News Service news agencies.
