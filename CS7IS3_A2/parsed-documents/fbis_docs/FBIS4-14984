He said Estonia's position is that the document is "ripe enough" for signature. Malk said Estonia now also had more grounds to expect that Russian troops will be pulled out from the country by Aug. 31, 1994. "It seems to me that after the past round of talks at Lohusalu the Russian side is more definitely expressing the final deadline for the withdrawal as Aug. 31," the Estonian diplomat said. Russia, however, insists that the troop withdrawal agreement must be initialed together with an agreement on social guarantees for its retired officers living in Estonia, similar with the document initialed between Russia and Latvia. The head of the Russian delegation, Vasiliy Svirin, in an interview with BNS ahead of the talks said that if no agreement on the retired military is signed, the deadline of Aug. 31 will lose its actuality and the withdrawal will continue under a timetable to be determined unilaterally by Russia. Malk in his far more optimistic remarks said that Moscow authorities recently had taken a more clearly defined stance in their assessment of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact era. Attempts are in evidence, however, he said, not to acknowledge the legal aspects of how Estonia became a part of the Soviet Union. Therefore, if Russia wishes to become a full member of the Council of Europe, she ought to read the rulings of this European body on the topic of Estonia's annexation into the Soviet Union. He said these rulings contained clear formulations which Estonia's position on the issue was based upon. Speaking about the border dispute, Malk said work on the issue was currently in a stage of a very difficult exchanging of opinions. He added that he saw the solution for the problem as also an "optimistic" one.
