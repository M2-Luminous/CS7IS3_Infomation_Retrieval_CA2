The Failure Analysis Committee (FAC), constituted to look into the cause of failure of the first development flight of PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) (PSLV-D1) which took place on September 20, has submitted its report to the Chairman, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The national level committee, chaired by Mr. N. Pant, member of the Space Commission, included experts from academic and R&D institutions in the country, besides ISRO. The analysis and the recommendations were reviewed in detail by Prof. U.R. Rao, Chairman, ISRO along with senior experts from both within and outside ISRO. Based on the analysis of the extensive telemetry data from the flight, the committee has confirmed that all the major systems, which had been integrated in the PSLV, including the giant solid booster and the liquid propulsion systems flight tested for the first time, had worked as planned and that there were no serious lacunae in the design of the vehicle: PSLV-D1 would have achieved the intended orbit but for a minor deficiency. The committee has said the failure of PSLV-D1 to reach the intended orbit was primarily due to a software error in the pitch control loop of the onboard guidance and control processor, which occurs only when the control command exceeds the specified maximum limiting value. The present limit value was exceeded due to the disturbances experienced during transition between the second and third stages of the rocket. These disturbances were caused by the programmed gimbal pulling of the second stage, 3.7 seconds before the ignition of the third stage, leaving the disturbances during the above period of the second stage tail-off uncorrected. Also the failure of two small retro rockets led to a contact between second and third stages, during the separation of the second stage. The committee has further said that in spite of the disturbances, the PSLV rocket design is so rugged that it would have reached the intended orbit but for the software error. The major recommendations of the committee, consequently are to rectify the software implementation error and to delay the pulling of the second stage by about 2.0 50 2.5 seconds. [sentence as published] The committee has said that the deficiencies noted and the modifications suggested are quite normal for the first few developmental flights of a large complex system like PSLV and ISRO should have no difficulty in operationalising the PSLV launch vehicle very soon. Preparations have begun for the next developmental flight of PSLV targeted for the third quarter of 1994, after implementing the committee's recommendations.
