FR940429-2-00029 FR940429-2-00024 [OPPTS&hyph;62138A; FRL&hyph;4779&hyph;9] Lead Renovation and Remodeling Guidelines; Notice of Availability AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of Availability. SUMMARY: This notice announces the availability of EPA's final renovation and remodeling (R&R) guidelines document entitled ``Reducing Lead Hazards When Remodeling Your Home.'' This document was developed pursuant to Title IV, section 402 (c)(1) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Section 402 (c)(1) specifically mandates that EPA develop guidelines for homeowners and other persons who may engage in renovation and remodeling activities. EPA developed the R&R guidelines in response to Congressional concerns about the public's knowledge of lead hazards when conducting R&R activities in homes. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For a copy of the final R&R guidelines document, ``Reducing Lead Hazards When Remodeling Your Home,'' contact: the National Lead Information Center Clearinghouse, at 1&hyph;800&hyph;424&hyph;LEAD or fax your request to 202&hyph;659&hyph;1192. For technical information, contact Darlene Watford, Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Chemical Management Division, Technical Programs Branch (7404), 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Telephone: 202&hyph;260&hyph;3989. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the Congressional mandate in section 402(c)(1) of TSCA, EPA has developed guidance for homeowners and building occupants to alert them to potential lead hazards associated with renovation and remodeling activities. Congress specifically required that these guidelines be developed for homes and buildings constructed prior to 1978. On March 18, 1994 (59 FR 12913) EPA announced the availability of the draft R&R Guidelines in the Federal Register . In the announcement, EPA opened a 30&hyph;day public comment period and received comments on the R&R Guidelines document. In addition to soliciting public comment, EPA conducted a series of focus group tests on the draft R&R guidelines document to evaluate the effectiveness of the reading level, content, and graphic presentation. A summary of the focus group's test results, copies of the public comments received and EPA's disposition on the comments, may be viewed in the TSCA Nonconfidential Business Information Center, NE Mall Room B607, Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20460, Telephone 202&hyph;260&hyph;1595. When requesting to view the comments, refer to TSCA Docket Number OPPTS&hyph;62138. EPA recognizes that this lead hazard information may be important in some communities that may have a limited ability to utilize information provided in English. For that reason, EPA is developing a Spanish-language version of the Guidelines document as well. The Spanish-language R&R guidelines document will be available at a later date. EPA plans to disseminate the guidelines as mandated under TSCA to State and local government agencies, paint and hardware stores, employee organizations and trade associations. Individual copies of the final R&R guidelines (in English only) is now available from the National Lead Information Center Clearinghouse (1&hyph;800&hyph;424&hyph;LEAD). Dated: April 22, 1994.
