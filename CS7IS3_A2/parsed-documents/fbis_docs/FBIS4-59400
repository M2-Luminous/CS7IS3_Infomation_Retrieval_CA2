FBIS4-59400 "drnes093_m_94005" FBIS-NES-94-093 Daily Report 12 May 1994 JORDAN U.S. Stand on Inspections Said `Positive' Step U.S. Stand on Inspections Said `Positive' Step JN1205155694 Amman AL-RA'Y in Arabic 12 May 94 pp 1, 25 JN1205155694 Amman AL-RA'Y Arabic BFN [Editorial: "A Positive Change"] [Text] The U.S. response to Jordan's request to suspend the inspection at sea of ships bound for the Port of al-'Aqabah is a victory from the Jordanian point of view. These inspection operations are unjustified. They are an unacceptable encroachment on the rights of Jordanian navigation and trade. Although the U.S. decision does not fully respond to the primary request to suspend the inspection operations, this decision in itself is a very important step to remove the political cover given to the multinational interception of ships bound for al-'Aqabah. This task was assigned to an independent, not-for-profit British company. This will not obstruct navigation because inspections will take place in the Port of al-'Aqabah, not at sea. Goods will be inspected after they enter the port, not at sea. This will save companies and ship owners from losses and delay. Without doubt, this measure is an important retreat. It restores the regional role and importance of and confidence in the Port of al-'Aqabah. Persistent efforts to achieve this objective were realized in the end. There is increasing and renewed international satisfaction with Jordan's commitment to international resolutions. There is also belief in this country's need for compensation for the losses it suffered as a result of the Gulf crisis and the sanctions imposed on it, and that it does not need additional unjustified losses. The U.S. response to the Jordanian request is a positive change and a very important step in the right direction on the road to ending all aspects of inspection. Jordan, along with most of the international community, hopes the U.S. stand will take the form of a more general and comprehensive stand to end the various effects and repercussions of the Gulf crisis. This is long overdue, now that the objectives and causes of the crisis have ended. Jordan hopes this will be a chance to offer compensation to the countries and peoples of the region that have suffered serious losses and damages as a result of the negative repercussions of the crisis, in order to open a new chapter of security and stability.
