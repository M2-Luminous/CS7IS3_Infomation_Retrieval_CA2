People are concerned by the fact that the automobile exhausts, considered a main offender in this regard, will continue to increase with the growth of GNP. In order to suppress CO<inf> 2</inf> emissions and to encourage people to use public transportation, it will be essential to promote widespread use of low-pollution vehicles. In carrying this out, we must be aware of the fact that batteries, serving as an energy source for electric vehicles, must be much larger in scale than existing ones, requiring greater amounts of resources. Consequently, in order to promote the wide acceptance of electric vehicles, it is necessary to construct a system designed to provide a stable supply of such component elements as batteries. For this reason, we surveyed the availability of material resources used to produce batteries and evaluated battery performance in actual use. Based on these data, we computed the required amount of resources from the standpoint of performance. Moreover, (3) we designed a model for battery supply system, and, based on this model, we calculated the amount of resource which will be consumed during a certain period and studied the feasibility of battery installation at the time when a large number of electric vehicles will hit the market. 2. Trial Calculation Method and Its Example At present, various types of promising batteries for automobile application are being proposed; however, for the survey, we focused on lead, nickel-cadmium, nickel, and nickel-zinc batteries because of their development status. (1) Concerning these batteries, we first of all surveyed their electrode materials considered to have a tremendous impact on the number of sales of electric vehicles. Its findings are shown in Table 1. Since cadmium is a byproduct of zinc, zinc reserves are by no means plentiful, in addition to the fact that it will be difficult to provide a stable supply of these two metals when widespread use of electric vehicles should become a reality and large quantities of these materials are required. Moreover, lead and cadmium are toxic metals and should not be introduced into the environment. If we are to consider an additional problem of resource, then construction of a recycling system of these metals will be essential. Table 1.

The method of this computation is shown below. Also an example of the computational result is shown in Table 2. A<inf> ijk</inf> (N) : Based on N-year's battery performance, the amount of element i (t) required for an electric vehicle k equipped with a battery j (i, j, and k represent the type of an element involved, type of a battery, and the size of a vehicle - i = lead, nickel, cadmium, iron, and zinc j = lead battery, Ni-Cd battery, Ni-Fe battery, and Ni-Zn battery k = large-size vehicle (approximately the size of a garbage truck), a medium-size vehicle (light van), and compact vehicle (about the size of an average passenger automobile)) A<inf> ijk</inf> (N) = (P / PD<inf> j</inf> (N)) x X<inf> 6</inf> (1) P :Output demanded of a battery (vehicle weight, traveling speed, air resistance, overall efficiency, etc. will be parametized<sup> 3)</sup> ) PD<inf> j</inf> (N): Battery j's output density for N years X<inf> ij</inf> :Weight ratio of battery j's element j At this time, the battery's output density will be greatly changed and with it the amount of resource required. Actual vehicle's traveling pattern is complex. Since performance evaluation of a stand-alone single battery does not agree with that of a battery installed in a vehicle, further study on performance estimates will be required. As for computation examples shown in Table 2, in order to make comparison with computations based on standard capacity, we used output density based on general battery catalog performance<sup> 3),4)</sup> . As for the lead battery, there is an example of computing the required amount of lead from a battery's weight energy density; however, judging from the result showing the 1,700-1,800 tons per 10,000 electric vehicles equipped with 40Wh-kg<sup> -1</sup> batteries, we can see that an extremely rigid condition is imposed on the calculation arrived at from the output density. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

The method of calculation is shown in the following equations, (2)-(5), and examples of the computational results in Figs. 2-4. Fig. 1. Model Diagram for Electric Vehicle Battery EQUATION Take a cumulative total of this Y (N) and compare it with the amount in reserve. Fig. 2. Remaining Amount of Estimated Reserve When 100,000 Fig. 3. Remaining Amount of Estimated Reserve When 100,000 Fig. 4. Remaining Amount of Estimated Reserve if 100,000 Lead is frequently used in automobile batteries. At present, in more than 90% of cases, the Japanese use lead in batteries. As for its recovery, even in terms of the entire amount used, over 40% is recovered. Advanced recycling technology mostly likely will facilitate construction of recycling systems. However, at the present juncture, estimated reserves by no means are abundant. Moreover, since battery capabilities are reaching a saturation point, use of a large amount of lead most likely will be restricted. As for iron and nickel, we see no problems insofar as the availability of these material resources are concerned. For the supply of zinc and cadmium, however, we will have to depend largely on recycling if demands will begin to rise for greater quantities of these metals. Especially with cadmium, even if recycled, if an annual demand is for use in over several hundred thousands vehicles, there will be a danger of drying up its resource unless the mining of cadmium rock bed, which is not part of current commercial undertakings, is now in progress. However, since our estimates for resource requirements are extremely generous, actual usage ratio and drastic future improvements, viz., possible reduction in automobile body weight, will contribute to lowering of our resource requirements, thereby heading off the depletion of resources to some extent. Although recovery and recycling of nickel-cadmium batteries are being undertaken recently, these are yet to be recycled to produce new batteries. Figures 2 and 3 indicate that at the level of approximately 1 million vehicles, since use of elements other than cadmium is directed more in products other than electric vehicle batteries, new production of elements for use in batteries does not increase an overall annual production figure greatly . However, in view of the scarcity of mineral resources in Japan, if these resources are going to be used extensively worldwide, Japan must see to it that the use of recycled resources will not depend on raw materials, and a recycling system to be constructed must reflect this requirement. Since the model shown in Fig. 1 is conceptual, in order to construct an effective system which is achievable, it will be necessary to make a detailed study of recovery and recycling routes as well as of cost.
