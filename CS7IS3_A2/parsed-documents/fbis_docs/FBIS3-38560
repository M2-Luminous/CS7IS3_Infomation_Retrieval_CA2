Within this large slice of the population, three-fourths are also in favor of the involvement of Italian troops in a possible UN intervention, whereas only 17 percent -- faced with the possibility of Italian troops being used -- change their minds and say no. This is the altogether surprising result of a survey conducted by Doxa on behalf of TG3 [TV news], which broadcast the results yesterday evening. Fifty-one percent, therefore, want air raids and a UN intervention to take place. Among the male population, this percentage rises to 58. The more educated the interviewees are, the more they like the idea of intervention. Only 32 percent of Italians are against intervention, while 17 percent did not express any preferences.
