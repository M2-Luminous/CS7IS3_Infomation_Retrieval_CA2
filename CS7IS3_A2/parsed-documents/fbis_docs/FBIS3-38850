Do you favor military intervention in Yugoslavia? Are we to wage war or not? [Pasqua] What I think is that, if we continue to stay under the current conditions, we shall bear a responsiblity, not only [words indistinct], we already take great responsibility in what is happening -- but we shall also suffer dishonor. So, either NATO decides to intervene -- or else I don't see what we are still doing in Bosnia. There will be only one thing left to do, and that is to leave. I think that is what [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe said last night: Everyone must be made to face up to their responsibilities. We cannot stand and watch with indifference what is happening, content ourselves with counting the dead, and say: Yes, well, Sunday wasn't very nice, there were 65 dead, 200 injured, children and so on; it's all very sad, but we cannot do anything about it. No, that isn't true. I think the time has come for everyone to face up to their responsibilities. [Ardisson] What does that mean? [Pasqua] It means.... [Ardisson, interrupting] Does it mean: Let's go? [Pasqua] It means we have to call on the Serbs to withdraw their artillery positions from around Sarajevo; if they do not, we have to intervene with air strikes. Otherwise, we should leave. What's the point of it? We have already had 30 dead. We already have 30 French soldiers who have been killed, and we have had 300 wounded. And all of that for what? For nothing. [passage omitted]
