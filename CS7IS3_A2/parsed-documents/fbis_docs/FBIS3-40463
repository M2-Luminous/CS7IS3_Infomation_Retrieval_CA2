The goal is to prevent the proliferation of weapons to volatile regions of the world. Under this system, seven types of equipment such as freeze dryers and ultracentrifuges, and 63 types of pathogens and toxins such as the Japan encephalitis virus will be restricted. The system will require exporters to report to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry the destination, user, intended use, etc., and export will be denied if there is a chance that these items might be used to make biological weapons. The Diet will revise the Export Trade Control Ordinance on 15 June. It was decided to place restrictions on biotech-related equipment and pathogenic organisms at the meeting of the Australia Group (currently comprised of 25 nations including Japan, the U.S. and Europe) held in December 1992 in Paris.
