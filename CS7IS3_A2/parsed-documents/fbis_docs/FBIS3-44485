If judged by absolute figures, China has a total of 3,199,100 (by the end of 1991) active servicemen, first in the world. Compared with a population of 1.17 billion, the proportion is not big, accounting for around 0.3 percent. Let us look at the proportions in other countries: The former Soviet Union, 1.9 percent; the United States (active and reserves), 1.3 percent; United Kingdom, 0.59 percent; France, 0.94 percent; Germany, 0.79 percent; Japan, 0.24 percent; and India, 0.19 percent. Of the eight countries mentioned, China's armed forces rank sixth. In terms of potential wars during the 21st century, the following "advanced offensive weapons" will be deployed: General Trend of Advanced Weaponry During 2000 1. Strategic and tactical nuclear weapons and missiles of mass destruction, such as intercontinental missiles, strategic missiles, and cruise missiles; 2. Space defense systems; 3. Aircraft carrier and their planes; 4. Submarines; 5. Bombers and fighters which have the long-range capacity to penetrate enemy defenses; and 6. Armored vehicles, such as tanks and infantry vehicles. An advanced command, control, communications and information system (C3I) [C cubed denoted as C with superscript three] is required for the high-efficiency operation of the above weaponry. Both the United States and the former Soviet Union believe that C3I "is the multiplier of military strength" and regard development and improvement of C3I as an urgent strategic task in military building. Meanwhile, they have accelerated the pace of making conventional weapons more intelligent and invisible, and have vigorously developed kinetic and directional weapons. This is the general trend of weaponry in all countries. What is the situation with the above-mentioned weaponry in China? The following is a brief analysis of each item: What is the Situation in New Chinese Weaponry? 1. Nuclear weapons and missiles of mass destruction. Regarding limited wars, the nuclear capacity of the Chinese military is sufficient to check nuclear threats from its opponents. The offensive capacity of its ballistic missiles can cover almost all neighboring countries. It is thought that the armed forces can be equipped with cruise missiles by the year 2000. 2. Space defense systems. Space is today's "high border" and tomorrow's "battlefield." It is thought that China will lead the world in space technology in the 21st century. By then, China is expected to have its first space shuttle, which will enable China to establish its own space defense system, and will have improved its defense network composed of various underground and space-based facilities, and will even be able to attack flying objects or enemy facilities in space. 3. Aircraft carrier. An aircraft carrier and its jets can form an all-directional comprehensive combat force. The aircraft carrier group is usually composed of the following different types of vessels: An aircraft carrier escorted by two cruisers, four to six destroyers or escort vessels, and two attack submarines. In order to ensure supplies, there is also a supply vessel. As a result, aircraft on the carrier can be offensive and defensive. The combined and comprehensive combat effectiveness of the aircraft and escort vessels prevail over the simple multiplication of these weapons. As is known to all, China does not yet have an aircraft carrier or cruisers, the main components of the escort fleet. Three key technologies are required to build an aircraft carrier: First, carrier-borne aircraft and landing and take-off technology; second, air defense, which includes the functions and development of anti-radar and intercept weapons; and third, the development of antisubmarine technology and removing underwater threats to the aircraft carrier. However, the three key technologies are precisely the weak point of China's defense industry. Seize International Opportunity To Assimilate Advanced Technology China's defense industry has benefited a lot from the flexible diplomacy adopted by the CPC in the 1980's, which enabled it to obtain advanced foreign technology to improve its weaponry. Following the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1992, Russia reduced the price of sophisticated weapons and some technology, which enabled the CPC to considerably improve its weaponry and equipment. The CPC purchased advanced Su-27 jets from Russia. The Su-33, an improved model of the Su-27, is a carrier-borne jet. It has been reported that the CPC plans to purchase the "Minsk" antisubmarine aircraft carrier from Russia's Pacific Fleet, which will serve as a research model. Provided that China's growing economic situation does not suffer serious setbacks, it is estimated that China will have enough financial resources and technology to build a viable aircraft carrier within 10 years, and will be able to render it combat effective within three to five years after it becomes operational. 4. Nuclear submarines. China now possesses nuclear submarines, but in limited numbers. There are no indications so far how many more nuclear submarines the CPC will build. 5. Long-range airborne troops. The "Hong 6" bombers, which the CPC now possess, is based on the Soviet model Tu-16, which is technically outdated and inferior in penetrating enemy defenses. The new generation of the "Jianhong 7," which is still under development, is more or less the same as the "Tornado," jointly developed by Britain, Germany, and Italy. It can penetrate enemy defenses at low altitudes. Equipped with air-to-air refueling equipment, it has a long range. It is estimated that the military will be equipped with the "Jianhong 7" by 1996. 6. Tanks and armored vehicles. The rate of the CPC infantry's equipment with armored vehicles is not high. Troops are still equipped with outmoded "T-59" tanks. However, the newly developed "85 II M" tank, which is a rival to Russia's T-72, has gone into mass production. The functions of the latest "90" model surpass the T-72, but because of a lack of funds the tank is not yet produced in large numbers. First Step Taken in Satellite Weapons and Space Warning Systems In armored equipment, it seems that the CPC is not interested in the armored infantry vehicles used by the developed countries. Instead, the CPC is still developing armored vehicles of the previous generation, which will inevitably affect the combat effectiveness of its ground forces. Regarding command, control, communications, and information systems, which play an overall role and increase the efficiency of all types of weapons, CPC equipment in this regard functions relatively poorly. But it is believed that this situation will improve remarkably when its space technology develops to an extent sufficient to deploy satellite weapons and space warning systems. It is estimated that guided weapons will enter a practical stage in 2008. Conventional Troops Make Preparations for Reunifying Taiwan As China is a defensive nation, the fundamental purpose of its conventional troops is to safeguard national security and resist foreign aggression. So far, China has no intention of expanding its military influence outside its territory. The CPC's defense is based on ground forces. The Navy is a relatively weak factor and it does not have the comprehensive combat effectiveness to undertake the strategic tasks entrusted by the state. Although the Air Force is not small, its quality is not high, aircraft categories are not complete, and its ability to offer air cover and support land and sea operations is relatively low. As pointed out previously, CPC troops account for only 0.3 percent of the country's population, which is not a big proportion. Moreover, there is still a gap in offensive weapons between China and the developed nations. Therefore, the military strength of the CPC does not exceed its defensive needs. In fact, there are still outstanding problems related to the duties performed by CPC troops to defend the country, such as the Nansha [Spratlys] Islands, Diaoyutai Islands, and the Sino-Indian border. It is noteworthy that the CPC has never promised not to resort to force on the Taiwan question. One of the main tasks of its conventional troops is to make preparations in this regard. Navy Plans Offshore Development The open economic policy has boosted mainland China's maritime exchanges and economic activities with other countries. Mainland China's economy is effecting a change from "internal trade" to "external trade." Thanks to these developments and changes, the security of shipping and marine communications lines will be increasingly important. The CPC's Navy is gradually developing towards the direction of enhancing its offshore combat effectiveness. In the next decade or so, China's Navy will be capable of controlling Chinese waters and relevant shipping routes. When necessary, the Navy will escort important shipping and oceanic scientific observation activities. By then, China will be capable of sending troops abroad, which will exert an influence on the world's military situation.
