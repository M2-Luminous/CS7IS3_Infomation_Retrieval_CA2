FR940728-2-00118 FR940728-2-00082 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,574] Martin Marietta Magnesia Specialties, Inc., Manistee, MI; Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration On July 7, the company requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on May 25, 1994 and published in the Federal Register on June 14, 1994 (59 FR 30617). The company submitted additional information showing a reduction in the production of refractories in the first six months of 1994 compared to the same period in 1993. This reduction was accompanied by substantial increases of company imports of refractories in the same period. Conclusion After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted. Signed at Washington, D.C., this 19th day of July 1994. Stephen A. Wandner, Deputy Director, Office of Legislation & Actuarial Services, Unemployment Insurance Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18418 Filed 7&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
