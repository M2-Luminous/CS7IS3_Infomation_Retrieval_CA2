He was commenting on the prospects of such a deal being struck during the a forthcoming summit in Moscow between the Presidents of Russia, the U.S. and Ukraine. In his words, though the company has vested interests in Ukraine, these have nothing to do with the dismantling of nuclear weapons. More importantly, said the official, Gasprom is not a state but stock company and that is why all crucial issues linked to its financial standing are subject to discussion by its shareholders. Kiev's debt for gas imports from Russia runs at more than Rbs 1 Tn, about a third of its total debt to Moscow. But it owes only Rbs 30 Bn for oil imports. However, one other company official in an interview with Interfax did not rule out the possibility of a gas-for-weapons swap following "a decision on the highest level." In this case, he said, the government will have to compensate Gasprom for financial losses which is very problematic given that it has no such money. The official says a mere write-off of Kiev's debt without compensation to Gasprom will cause anger in Russia's gas producing regions and result in "several Nadyms". The country's large gas producing region of Nadym was almost brought to a standstill at the end of last year after local workers went on strike because of not being paid wages for several months due to defaults by Gasprom customers.
