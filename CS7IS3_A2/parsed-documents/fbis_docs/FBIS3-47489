The resumption apparently means that Ozawa has agreed to Shinseito officials' requests that he meet with reporters. "We hope to respect and understand each other by resuming the press conferences," the office said. Ozawa had refused to hold press briefings since early November as negotiations between him and the media organizations deadlocked over his ban of journalists of two major dailies -- the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN and the SANKEI SHIMBUN -- from his press meetings. Ozawa, a powerful figure of the coalition government led by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, in late October began excluding the two papers' reporters from his news conferences, saying their news coverage on him had been inaccurate. Ozawa's office said the two papers will be allowed to attend the Monday meeting. The Monday meeting will be held for the first time since November 8, when Ozawa held a press conference to tell reporters that he had accepted 5 million yen from scandal-plagued Kajima Corp. as a legal political donation. The Tuesday edition of the South Korean daily TONG-A ILBO carried an interview with Ozawa, in which he was quoted as saying that the Japanese mass media are mean and inhuman hordes that only criticize.
