FR940720-2-00013 FR940720-2-00007 Request for Comments From Interested Parties The scope contained in this investigation, which has been slightly clarified in the above ``Scope of the Investigation'' section, contains the clause that products used in standard, line or pressure pipe applications be included in the scope, regardless of whether they meet A&hyph;106, A&hyph;335, A&hyph;53 or API 5L standards. Implementing this clause would require some type of end-use certification. Given the burden on Customs and the difficulty involved in administering end-use certifications, the Department generally avoids end-use as a scope criterion. See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Alloy and Carbon Hot-Rolled Bars, Rods, and Semifinished Products of Special Bar Quality Engineered Steel from Brazil, 58 FR 31496 (June 3, 1993). However, because petitioner has alleged that circumvention may occur if end-use is not part of any order resulting from this investigation, we are requesting comments regarding end-use as a criterion for the scope of this investigation. Petitioner has based its allegation on circumstances that occurred in the investigations of Preliminary Affirmative Determination of Scope Inquiry on Antidumping Duty Orders on Certain Circular Welded Non-Alloy Steel Pipe from Brazil, the Republic of Korea, and Mexico, 59 FR 1929 (January 13, 1994). Petitioner has identified specific possible substitution products for the scope merchandise. Petitioner has also indicated that, while it is not aware at this time of substitution occurring, it may occur in the future should countervailing duties be assessed on seamless standard, line and pressure pipe. Therefore, we are including end-use in the scope for purposes of initiation; however, we intend to consider its appropriateness further and we invite comments from interested parties regarding the scope information presented above under the ``Scope of the Investigation'' section of this notice. Specifically, we will examine comments that address ``end-use'' as a scope criterion. Interested parties are invited to comment on the following: (1) Whether or not end-use is an appropriate criterion for the merchandise described in the ``Scope of the Investigation'' section of this notice; (2) how the Department would be informed when substitution is occurring, i.e., a trigger mechanism; (3) at what point the Department should implement suspension of liquidation and use of end-use certificates for products meeting the physical parameters described in the scope other than those stenciled A&hyph;106, A&hyph;335, A&hyph;53 and/or API 5L; (4) what specific characteristics or factors the Department should evaluate regarding end-use as a scope criterion; (5) what information should be provided on an end-use certificate; (6) precise details as to how the Department and Customs should administer any countervailing duty orders that result from this investigation given end-use as a scope criterion; and (7) the universe of products that could possibly be substituted for the subject merchandise. Finally, we invite comments from parties on whether the products within the scope of this investigation constitute more than one class or kind of merchandise. Parties should include an analysis using the following factors: (1) The physical characteristics of the merchandise; (2) the expectations of the ultimate purchaser; (3) the channels of trade; (4) the ultimate use of the product; and (5) the cost. Parties interested in commenting on the items mentioned above should submit their comments no later than close of business October 21, 1994. Rebuttal comments will be accepted no later than close of business October 31, 1994. Allegation of Subsidies Section 702(b) of the Act requires the Department to initiate a countervailing duty proceeding whenever an interested party files a petition, on behalf of an industry, that (1) alleges the elements necessary for an imposition of a duty under section 701(a), and (2) is accompanied by information reasonably available to petitioner supporting the allegations. Initiation of a Countervailing Duty Investigation The Department has examined the petition on seamless pipe from Italy and found that it complies with the requirements of section 702(b) of the Act. Therefore, in accordance with section 702 of the Act, we are initiating a countervailing duty investigation to determine whether manufacturers, producers, or exporters of seamless pipe from Italy receive subsidies. We are including in our investigation the following programs alleged in the petition to have provided subsidies to producers of the subject merchandise in Italy: 1. 1988/89 Equity Infusion. 2. Subsidized Loans under Law 675/77. 3. Grants under Law 193/84. 4. Retraining Grants. 5. Preferential Export Financing under Law 227/77. 6. Exchange Rate Guarantee Program under Law 796/76. 7. European Coal and Steel Community (``ECSC'') Loans and Interest Rebates. We are not including the following programs alleged to be benefitting producers of the subject merchandise in Italy:
