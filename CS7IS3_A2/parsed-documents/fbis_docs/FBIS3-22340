Deadline for Their Destruction May Not Be Met"] [Text] Saratov Oblast -- Around now a terminal was to have been built on the banks of the Volga in Saratov Oblast to strip out [peretarivaniye] chemical agents from their containers [yemkosti] and subsequently detoxify them. That at least is what the draft first stage of the state program for the destruction of chemical weapons envisages. However, local residents, worried by leaks at stores that have been here a long time, have sounded the alarm and are objecting to new installations with this kind of specialism. Russia's president signed the Paris Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons a year ago, in January 1993. According to the Convention, the first installation for the destruction of chemical agents must be tested within two years at most. Half this time has already elapsed and Russia still has no laws, no concept, no approved state program for chemical weapons destruction. Meanwhile leaks of poisonous substances from containers that have eroded have been recorded at the arsenal sited on the territory of Saratov Oblast. The village of Gornyy, where 690 tonnes of mustard gas, 225 tonnes of lewisite, and 210 tonnes of their compounds are stored, is not far from the Volga. The chemical weapons that have been here for ages, packed in metal barrels and railroad tankers, pose a potential danger. The strength of the harmful chemicals will be reduced by a factor of 1,000-10,000 when the chemical agents are stripped out at the new terminal. The plan is to reprocess the reactive matter obtained in Shikhany, 100 km from Gornyy, where the top-secret State Institute of Organic Synthesis Technology [SIOST], which developed chemical weapons in the recent past, is located. Doctor of Sciences Aleksandr Kochergin, the institute's director, said that several technologies have been developed for the destruction of the stocks from the arsenal in Gornyy. Whereas the situation is clear with regard to the mustard gas, a choice has not yet been made with regard to the lewisite and its compounds. In the opinion of SIOST scientists, the most preferable option is for this kind of chemical agent to be recycled [utilizatsiya] since it contains costly arsenic used in microelectronics, laser technology, optics, and pharmaceuticals. In other words, the recycling technology presupposes not only expenditure on chemical weapons destruction but also considerable income from the reprocessing of chemical agents into particularly pure arsenic, which Russia does not currently produce. This technology can also be used to recycle arsenic-containing adamsite -- an irritant chemical agent produced early this century, which has been shipped to Shikhany from throughout the former Union -- of which more than 8,000 tonnes have been buried straight in the ground at the testing range of the military institute next to SIOST. The huge Russian adamsite dump is a source of great worry not only to the public but also to scientists, who are voicing misgivings over the possible environmental contamination from these stocks. It may seem to the uninitiated that there are no particular problems with the destruction of the Saratov arsenal. It is only the choice of technology and the construction of a terminal and recycling installations that are holding things up. However, one must not forget that we are talking about chemical weapons, which are to be destroyed in densely populated areas right next to the Volga. This is a very sensitive subject for the residents of the area since the environmental background here is unfavorable enough as it is. In the city of Volsk, for instance, which is no more than 5 km from Shikhany as the crow flies, the arsenic content in the soil is already several times in excess of the maximum permissible concentrations owing to three local cement plants using so-called pyrite cinders, which contain arsenic, in their manufacturing process.
