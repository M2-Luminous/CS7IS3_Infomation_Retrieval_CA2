In its public statement on the joint declaration by the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Croatian Social Liberal Party [HSLS] stresses that there is no justification for a policy which seeks an ally in an aggressor and an enemy in a second victim of aggression. The HSLS maintains that the priority task of Croatia's policy should be an agreement with the political leadership of Bosnia-Herzegovina's Muslims whereas the joint statement by Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will render such an agreement more difficult. The HSLS believes that relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia can be normalized once it has recognized the Croatian state within its internationally recognized borders, the HSLS says in its statement. The statement was signed by its chairman, Drazen Budisa.
