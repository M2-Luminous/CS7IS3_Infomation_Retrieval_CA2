What happened was that air strikes were delivered without consultations with us. As a result, the situation aggravated sharply. Why? Because the party of war on both sides was probably just waiting for those air strikes. Our Western partners do not realize that they do not know the situation. I have to say that at present the situation is literally at a crossroads. There is a chance for a breakthrough toward ending hostilities, to be followed by separation of the sides, sending in peacekeeping forces there, and later a comprehensive political settlement, and naturally some steps in the Serbs' favor, with regard to sanctions. The second option is a rampage of the party of war inside Bosnia, the continuation of bloodbath, shelling, possibly even seizure of hostages from among the UN forces, possibly further air strikes. But of course all this will grow like an avalanche, the tragedy of a conflagration of war. Unfortunately, I cannot as yet say with complete confidence whether we can secure the first option and avert the second. [Announcer Sergey Medvedev] The Russian minister gave this interview to our program this afternoon. Two hours ago he flew to Belgrade to back Churkin's peace efforts.
