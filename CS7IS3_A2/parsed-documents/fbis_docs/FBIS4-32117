Cvetanovska: "Serbian Soldiers Are Entrenching"] [Text] The thick fog around the border region near the village of Cupino Brdo, in the district of Kriva Palanka, prevented us from seeing the Serbian soldiers who, after penetrating 250 meters into Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] territory, now control a strategic height 1703 meters above ground level. If there had not been a strong wind blowing toward the seized zone, we might even have heard their voices. We managed to approach them to within some 120 meters. This was the farthest point that we could reach, and we were escorted there by Dusko Spasevski, one of the members of the Macedonian Army [ARM] camping near the border -- about 40 minutes away on foot. The ARM patrols usually come to 100-200 meters from the strategic point on the Straza mountain, where the Serbian soldiers of the regular Yugoslav Army are being entrenched. They have already dug trenches and positioned machine-gun nests there. When the weather allows, the Macedonian soldiers can see the Serbian patrols changing over. Sometimes they communicate for a whole hour, but the conversations go as follows: "Do not approach, this is Serbia." Sometimes they send invitations for discussions: "Come to negotiate, let us agree." The members of our army do not react. In the vicinity we also met a five-member Macedonian patrol headed by Lieutenant Enver Jakupi. It seems that this point is of importance for the Serbian army because of its strategic character, and not because it is allegedly on "Serbian territory." Actually, the district real estate registry offices have always worked diligently, and therefore this border belt has never been disputed. The essence is that this point is a good observation point for a large stretch of Macedonian territory. From there it is possible to observe the border posts at Ramna Niva, German, and Kopriva (with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), Deve Bair (with Bulgaria), and up to the mountains of Osogovo. The previous position of the Serbian army was behind this elevation, near a settlement in Yugoslavia by the name of Cuka, which did not offer such possibilities. According to some information, the Serbian soldiers have been here for a whole month. Their patrols are usually composed of eight members. They carry some small arms, but some claim that they have also deployed mortars. At this moment, it is probably the surveillance equipment that is the most important weapon in use, and this is surely also directed at UNPROFOR members. We have also found out something else that is exclusively revealed in our newspaper. Namely, the Serbian soldiers have not penetrated 250 meters into our territory, but 300 meters. To be more precise, when approached by Macedonian military patrols, the Serbian soldiers descend 50 meters from the elevation and take up a new position more suitable for attacks and for defense. Before taking over this strategic elevation, the Serbian army had deployed some reservists near the villages of Surlica and Prolesje in Yugoslavia. On the Macedonian side the nearest settlements are the villages of Podrzikonj and Luke, whose inhabitants are deeply worried. A number of them have land just on the border. They cannot go to this now. The Serbian soldiers do not allow them, and the ARM is advising them not to go until the situation is resolved. Half an hour before the arrival of our team, at some hundred meters from the ARM camp, some dozens of UNPROFOR field vehicles of the "Hammer" type arrived, with U.S. soldiers on board. We could see that their intention was to stay there for a while, because they were setting up tents. Compared with two days earlier, yesterday there were not a large number of ARM or police there. Actually, that had been a preventive measure because of the traditional rally organized in memory of Cupino Brdo, where Macedonian and Serbian partisans waged a joint battle against the Bulgarian occupier during World War II. This time, however, Serbian war veterans did not show up. It is obvious that the Serbian Army does not intend to withdraw.
