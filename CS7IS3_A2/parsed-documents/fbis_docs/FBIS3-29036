[passage omitted] Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan, in his personal capacity, hosted a party for the Taiwan president and his delegation at the Dusit Laguna Hotel last night. Chen Youhan [Thai name: Chatri Sophonphanit; president of the Bangkok Bank], Hu Yulin [Thai Name: Saman Ophatwong; chairman of the Thai Rice Exporters Association], Li Guanglong [Thai Name: Wisit Lilasithon; chairman of the Wall Street Finance & Securities Company and the Wall Street Tower], and Chen Zhuohao [Thai name: Sumit Loetsumit; chairman of the board of directors of the Si Thai Superware Company] were among the Thai-Chinese businessmen invited to attend the banquet. An informed source told our correspondent that Li Teng-hui's visit resulted from mediation by Gu Liansong, who has close relations with the Thai-Chinese business community and once was chairman of the Taiwan-Thai Business Committee and advisor to Taiwan's Executive Branch. Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai met President Li while attending an international monetary meeting in Taiwan late last year. Yesterday's meeting was the second between Amnuai and Li Teng-hui in seven months. Meanwhile, a Chinese National People's Congress [NPC] delegation led by Zhu Liang, chairman of the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee, may delay or cancel its visit to Thailand as a result of Li Teng-hui's visit. The delegation is scheduled to visit Thailand at the end of this month at the invitation of Parliament President Marut Bunnak.
