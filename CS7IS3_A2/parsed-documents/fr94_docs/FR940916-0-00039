FR940916-0-00039 FR940916-0-00016 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Maritime Administration 46 CFR Part 298 [Docket No. R&hyph;150] RIN 2133&hyph;AB09 Obligation Guarantees AGENCY: Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Maritime Administration (``MARAD'') is issuing this final rule which amends its regulations for Obligation Guarantees implementing Title XI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (``Act''). This rule will carry out the provisions of Subtitle D of Title XIII, Public Law 103&hyph;160, enacted on November 30, 1993. Subtitle D authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (``Secretary'') to guarantee obligations issued to finance (1) the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of eligible export vessels, and (2) advanced shipbuilding technology and modern shipbuilding technology of a general shipyard facility located in the United States. While Title XI of the Act is applicable to financing assistance for all types of vessel construction, that part of the Title XI program related to fishing vessels is administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the Department of Commerce, (NOAA), pursuant to NOAA regulations, which appear at 50 CFR Part 253. Subtitle D of Title XIII directed the Secretary to prescribe interim regulations within 90 days after the date of enactment and a final rule within 270 days after enactment. MARAD published an interim final rule on March 31, 1994, and is now issuing this final rule that reflects its consideration of only those comments received that addressed the specific subject matter of the interim final rule. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective September 16, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mitchell D. Lax, Director, Office of Ship Financing. Telephone 202&hyph;366&hyph;5744. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Title XI of the Act, 46 App. U.S.C. 1271 et seq., authorizes the Secretary to provide guarantees of debt (``obligation guarantees'') issued for the purpose of financing or refinancing the construction, reconstruction or reconditioning of vessels built in United States shipyards. Applications for obligation guarantees are made to MARAD, which acts under authority delegated by the Secretary to the Maritime Administrator (``Administrator''). Prior to execution of a guarantee, MARAD must, among other things, make determinations of economic soundness of the project and the financial and operating capability of the applicant. Prior to amendment by Public Law 103&hyph;160, guarantees could be issued only for debt incurred by United States citizens for vessels to be operated under the U.S.-flag. Now, guarantees may be issued with respect to debt obligations for certain vessels flying foreign flags.
