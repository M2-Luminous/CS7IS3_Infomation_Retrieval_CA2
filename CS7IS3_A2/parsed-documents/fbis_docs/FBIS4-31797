Konya said it was especially startling because it affected the parliament building, the symbol of democracy in Hungary. "This event warns us to devote more attention and money to the protection of our public buildings," Konya continued. "I have already directed the chief police commissioner and the commander of the Government Guard to elaborate a proposal on improving the protection of the parliament and the representatives' office building. But this is basically a question of money and I intend to present a proposal on the issue to the Cabinet at its next session." Asked whether there could be any connection between today's terrorist action and the recent explosions in Szeged and Szabadka, the minister said, "The chance of some connection cannot be excluded but I do not wish to make guesses concerning the background of the action while investigation is still under way." However, he said there is no information on any political group in Hungary that could be connected to the case. [passage omitted]
