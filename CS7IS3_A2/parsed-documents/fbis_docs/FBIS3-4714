FBIS3-4714 "dreas040_d_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-040 Document Type:Daily Report 1 Mar 1994 South Korea * Specialist Analyzes Kim Chong-il Power Base 942C0043A Seoul MAL in Korean No 89, Nov 93 pp 68-75 942C0043A Seoul MAL Language: Korean Article Type:CSO [By researcher Chon Hyon-jun] [Excerpt] Kim Il-song Death, North Korean Collapse Scenario [Passage omitted] Up to now, the scenarios for a North Korean [DPRK] collapse have called for popular uprisings, a military coup d'etat, invasion of the South, and so on, but these have all been centered around Kim Il-song's demise. The common ground of these assertions is that despite Kim Chong-il's lack of ability as a supreme ruler, he became heir with the absolute support of his father, the supreme authority. Using Kim Chong-il's lack of ability, that is his lack of legitimacy, doubts about his crisis-management ability, personality defects, and so on, as the basis of their assertions, those arguing for an early collapse of the Kim Chong-il regime in particular say that immediately after the death of "godlike" Kim Il-song, or within two to three years thereafter, the DPRK people and bureaucrats will drive out Kim Chong-il because they link the causes of their economic stagnation with the 1973 decision within the party to make Kim Chong-il heir. Thus, to present a counterargument to the scenarios dealing with the collapse of the DPRK system, we must examine the following questions. First, is the DPRK economy really in so bad a state as to make recovery impossible, even if there were a turnaround in circumstances? Second, does Kim Chong-il lack authority as "Suryong [leader]," is he incompetent, and is the support he receives from the party, government and military bureaucracy and from the people, the ruled, voluntary or is it forced? Third, are the general characteristics of socialism as strong in the DPRK as they were in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe or are the special characteristics of the DPRK strong? Of course, a strict distinction must be made between systemic and governmental change. North Korean Economic Crisis Is the DPRK economy really in so bad a state as to make recovery impossible? Proponents of a DPRK collapse due to economic backwardness say food riots have been continuously occurring recently due to the following: The DPRK economy entered a gradual decline beginning in the mid 1970s. It recorded a growth rate [as published] of 3.7 percent in 1990, 5.2 percent in 1991 and 7.5 percent in 1992, and its factory-operation rate was only 30-40 percent. Grain production was a mere 4.812 million tons in 1991, 1.6 million tons short of the total demand of 6.4 million tons, and it was short 2 million tons in 1992. The DPRK has not officially published economic statistics, however, so is not asserting that the DPRK economy is in the worst state possible based on estimates derived from a "New-People's-Account [Sin Kukmin Kyejong]" computation method excessively "our-style capitalistic" reasoning? Experts on the DPRK economy set forth obstacles to an accurate understanding of DPRK economic reality generally for the following reasons: first, due to the closed nature of DPRK society, the DPRK does not officially publish statistical data on its economy every year; second, due to differences in economic systems, statistical concepts and standards are different; and third, exchange-rate problems between DPRK currency and foreign currency are not clear. Because in the DPRK, prices are artificially decided by the National Price Committee, not by the principles of a market economy, the functions and roles of currency are different from those of a market economy and this makes objective analysis difficult. In actuality, statistics on the DPRK GNP differ with each research organization. The DPRK GNP estimates calculated by the Unification Board, CIA (U.S. Central Intelligence Agency), IISS (Institute for International Strategic Studies), and SIPRI (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute) are all different. The figures of these research organizations differ by as much as 200 percent. This suggests that, ultimately, theories on the continuous negative growth of the DPRK economy may differ according to the statistical method used. Of course, these differences are not a basis for denying the backwardness of the DPRK economy. What is important, however, is that the backwardness of the economy itself is not a sufficient condition for the collapse of the DPRK Government. There is a deep relationship between a change in government and economic backwardness, the degree of corruption among the power elite, and the extent of efforts by the bureaucracy to revive the economy. Only if the bureaucrats live well and corruption is rampant while the DPRK people shed their blood and sweat to surmount economic hardships, will the people certainly revolt. We will discuss the issue of change, therefore, by examining the corruption of the power elite and by examining what efforts the DPRK has made to revive its economy. To what extent are the DPRK bureaucrats really corrupt? In 1991, Kim Chong-il criticized the corruption and bureaucracy of government officials with the statement, "Our style of socialism centered in the masses of the people will certainly be victorious." This was a warning concerning the easygoing attitude, inertia, and corruption of the bureaucracy. Many defectors give witness to the corruption of the DPRK bureaucracy. Concerning the degree and scale of that corruption, however, they make conflicting claims. At least, they say, the corruption of the DPRK bureaucracy is not as bad as that of the former Soviet Union's nomenclatura or of East Europe's communist parties. Moreover, their claims that systemic mechanisms for preventing corruption are exhaustive are important. That is, due to the development of a "ratification system" (a promotion-screening system) at each level to guarantee strictness in supplementing personnel, the development of a mutual surveillance system of criticism and self-criticism, consistent penalties, etc., the extent of bureaucratic corruption is probably not "general," contrary to what has been reported. Thus, it would be a more realistic analysis to say that the corruption of the DPRK bureaucracy is not serious enough to give rise to a change in the system. North Korean Government Efforts at Economic Revival Next, let us look at what efforts the DPRK bureaucracy has been making to revive the economy. In a speech given in the "Industrial Zealots Rally [Kongop Yolsongja Taehoe]" held in 1975, Kim Il-song stressed the need for foreign trade and economic cooperation with the West: "...Although until now, we have generally traded with only socialist countries, we must now do a great deal of trade with newly independent nations and with capitalist nations as well. Under conditions of rapid economic development and the appearance of new economic sectors, we cannot satisfactorily obtain what we need by depending on socialist markets alone." Based on this "teaching," trade with the West jumped. As a result, in the mid-1970s the percent of overall DPRK trade made up by trade with the West increased rapidly, up from 11.1 percent in 1965 to 40.6 percent in 1975. In the 1980s, the DPRK showed more aggressiveness in its foreign-trade policy. In the Thirrd Session of the 7th Supreme People's Assembly held in January 1984, by adopting a bill entitled, "On Developing Trade by Strengthening North-South Cooperation and the Foreign Trade Enterprise," it made a clear switchover in its external economic policy. After 1982, the DPRK leadership started to show interest, for example by visiting China's special economic zones, in the results of the economic development achieved by China through its publication of the 1979 "Foreign and Domestic Joint-Stock Enterprise Law." This series of events is the background behind the establishment of North Korea's "Joint Management Law." Its basic strategy is to import foreign capital and advanced technology without shouldering the burden of repaying foreign debt and to use this in economic development. Although it is true that, contrary to the DPRK's original intention, the results of the Joint Management Law were slight due to inadequate economic conditions and to political and economic inflexibility, by establishing the "Foreigner Investment Law [Oegugin Tuja Bop]" and other laws supplementing the Joint Management Law between 1992 and 1993, the DPRK expressed a continued intention toward a "misquito-net [bangchungmang]" style of opening to foreign countries. Since July 1989, along with its pursuit of developing special economic zones in Najin, Sonbong, and Nampo, DPRK announced its "Sonbong District Trade Zone" development plan in accordance with the Tumen River Basin Development Plan begun under the management of the UNDP in 1991. The main gist of this plan was to develop the area into a center of Northeast Asian economic cooperation and transportation by expanding harbor facilities in Chongjin, Najin, and Sonbong in the northeastern coastal region and by building highways as well as supplementing existing railways and roads connecting to this region in China and the Soviet Union. Also, development of this region entailed accepting the public investment, technological exchange, joint management/production of neighboring countries, and attracting partners for marine-products processing, clothing manufacturing, electronic-product assembly factories, etc. The DPRK actively encourages participation by South Korea also, and Deputy Prime Minister Kim Tal-hyon even visited the ROK directly, inspecting various industrial facilities. We can assess that the DPRK elite have thus been doing their best to break through the economic crisis, even if only within the limits of what would minimize influences that might cause the collapse of the system. Although this has not produced results worthy of particular note due to the contradictions of the socialistic system itself and the excessive caution of the DPRK ruling class--that is, due to efforts to minimize the side effects of economic liberalization, it is maintaining the economy at a level where the DPRK people can lead at least a minimally acceptable life. More important, however, is that these efforts by the ruling class are acting in a purely functional way to create in the people a sense of unity with the state. Also, the reason DPRK economic backwardness does not lead into dissatisfaction with the system is to be found in the fact that the DPRK people invest more time and passion in working to overcome poverty than in criticism about it. Not only is this because of the DPRK people's low level of political culture, but it is also because they show an accommodating attitude, accepting reality as fate, which results from a loss of opportunities for comparison due to social control. We must not overlook the fact that the DPRK's surrounding circumstances could be worse. Despite all obstacles, including the nuclear-inspection issue, China continues economic aid to the DPRK because it does not want a DPRK collapse; Russia also gives tacit approval to unofficial economic dealings with the DPRK; and even the U.S. exported about 250 thousand tons of grain to the DPRK in 1993 alone, justifying it as humanitarian aid. Also, although not an official relationship, the DPRK continues unofficial economic exchange with Japan. Even its trade with the ROK reached about $200 million in 1992. If the nuclear issue is concluded satisfactorily, the DPRK will gain improved relations with the United States and Japan, and because economic cooperation with other countries, including the ROK, will increase, the DPRK economy could take a turn for the better. Thus, we must conclude that, depending on the external environment, the DPRK economy always has potential for improvement. Kim Chong-il's Policy To Make Himself "Suryong" Next, the scenario predicting the collapse of the Kim Chong-il regime after the death of Kim Il-song is in error in that it attempts to distinguish between Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. According to this position, although Kim Il-song secured his status as "suryong" through his armed resistance to Japan, socialist construction and "victory" in the Korean War, Kim Chong-il has no such record and the economy actually began to deteriorate after he came on the scene. The people, therefore, pretend to support him while Kim Il-song is alive. After the death of Kim Il-song--the controlling power maintaining the system, however, the people will pull down the Kim Chong-il regime, either immediately or within 2-3 years. The questions here are: Is it really possible to distinguish between Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il; and has Kim Chong-il secured status as "suryong." The transfer of power in the DPRK is, in a strict sense, the handing over of the mantle of leadership as "suryong." For Kim Chong-il, it is securing this invisible authority as suryong, rather than possessing visible and institutionalized authority such as the position of president or secretary general of the party, which is his essential task. There is no office called suryong in the DPRK system. However, the conclusion of Chuche Thought, the basic ideology guiding DPRK, is the "theory of the suryong," and because it is not through the offices of president or general secretary that Kim Il-song rules, but through his "authority as suryong," the key to a smooth succession is for Kim Chong-il to inherit this authority. What, then, has Kim Chong-il done to secure authority as suryong? First, he has worked to highlight his image as a great thinker. This is to emphasize his talent as a philosopher, second only to Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong and Kim Il-song--all of whom considered themselves philosophers. To do this, besides his many writings on art, including A Study on Cenematographic Art [Yonghwa Yesul Ron], he published works such as On Chuche Thought [Chuchesasang e Taehayo] in 1982, On Several Problems Presented By Chuche-Thought Education [Chuche Sasang Kyoyang eso Chegidoenun Myochgaji Munje e Taehayo] (a completion of his ideas on the social and political organism) in 1986, Our Style of Socialism Centered on the Masses of the People Will Certainly Be Victorious [Inmindaejung Chungsim ui Urisik Sahoejuui nun Pilsungbulpaeida] in 1991, The Historical Lessons of Socialist Construction and Our Party's Overall Line [Sahoejuui Konsol ui Yoksajok Kyohun kwa Uridang ui Chongnoson] in 1992 and Slander of Socialism Is Impermissible [Sahoejuui e Taehan Hwebang un Hoyongdoel Su Opda] in 1993, supplementing the core value system of the DPRK, Chuche Thought, at the right time. Thus, there is no harm in assessing his ability to reinterpret Chuche Thought as "high level." Second, he concentrated his efforts on highlighting his image as a statesman. By exercising "working-level leadership" of large-scale construction sites, such as light and heavy industry factories and "private homes [Sallim Chip]," and of export-product exhibition halls, he worked to highlight his image as a "construction genius." Also, by stressing the importance of consumer products through working-level leadership in 1984, he injected vigor into the production of consumer products. It appears that the liberalization policy for raising the people's standard of living presently in progress is being carried out centered on Kim Chong-il and the elite surrounding him. Although his liberalization efforts are probably "selective," it appears they will continue in the future as well. Of course, this effort to revive the economy is an essential stage for casting off the criticism that the economy worsened as he began to take control of the party in the early 1970s and for securing his authority as suryong. Another important point is that the above series of policies to make Kim Chong-il the suryong were not developed in isolation from Kim Il-song. That is, the fact that Kim Il-song policy and Kim Chong-il policy are not independent from each other, but are progressing as a unity is important. Ultimately, the attempt to divide Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il, whose relationship can be referred to as "One mouth, two heads" or "Duality in one body," is the product of a lack of understanding of the "the leader's [suryong] unified system of rule." Kim Chong-il's Leadership Ability With this, one thing that must be discussed is the question of the extent of Kim Chong-il's actual political ability. Up to the present, the assessment of Kim Chong-il's character has been divided into two groups, positive opinions and negative opinions. We will examine the negative opinions first. First is criticism of his ability. According to this, he was chosen as successor despite his total lack of personal ability, merely because of the glory of the absolute ruler, Kim Il-song. Almost without knowledge of areas other than art, Kim Chong-il authorizes most papers presented by his secretaries without correction, the claim goes. Those with this outlook assert that because Kim Chong-il does not have his father's crisis-management experience, the people do not trust him. Second is the problem of his style of rule. He is criticized for his lack of character as a leader. As a movie enthusiast, he wastes foreign currency on importing movies and reminds people of a capitalist bum, whiling away his time watching movies. There is also criticism of the policy decisionmaking process and the problem of a crippled distribution of power. That is, because Kim Chong-il prefers a "reception-center political style" (kitchen cabinet), rather than through the normal process of debate, impromptu decisions are made. Because these are more influential that normal decisions, bureaucrats unable to participate in this group remain as a potentially dissatisfied force, it is argued. Third is the problem of his character. It is argued that because he lost his mother early and grew up under a stepmother, his character became fastidious and twisted. People began flattering him early on, so he is insolent and behaves arrogantly, such as by holding his arms behind is back even in front of Kim Il-song, it is asserted. Conversely, there are also those giving a positive assessment concerning these problems. First, some assert that, hidden by the might of the political giant, Kim Il-song, he has been unable to receive a just evaluation. The reason he is not popular, according to this analysis, is that in being extremely [as published] loyal to his father, Kim Chong-il refrains from any political activity that might hurt his father's authority. Second is a problem related to movies--after graduating from Kim Il-song University in 1964, the first area he started gaining experience in was propaganda and agitation. Ideological theory was an important means of maintaining the system. Movies were, given the cultural level at the time, the quickest and most convenient medium capable of conveying the state's objectives and stirring up emotion, mobilizing the masses toward the goals fixed by it. He could not help, therefore, but naturally become interested in this area, the argument goes. Of course, his talent for art is actually reported to be outstanding. Third, an assessment of Kim Chong-il's arrogant attitude is also different. Kim Chong-il's concern for not only the first-generation revolutionaries, but also for the children of dead revolutionaries is said to be out of the ordinary. For military veterans in particular, he is said to protect their livelihood, even promoting them; he is so polite to veteran revolutionaries, he even goes around visiting them on New Year's Day, offering them the traditional bow of respect and presenting them with presents of hairdye. According to the testimony of defected diplomat Ko Yong-hwan, when the Ministry of People's Armed Forces Minister O Chin-u had a traffic accident and was near death, Kim Chong-il took quick action, saving him. Through such examples, we can see that Kim Chong-il's attitude toward the revolutionary generation is not as haughty as is reported. This writer's position is that Kim Chong-il may not be greatly troubled by formality but is more concerned with substance and may possess an open personality due his artistic character. This writer believes that there is a high probability that the extreme assessments of the wild extravagance of Kim Chong-il are biased. Of course, this is not a personal justification of Kim Chong-il himself. Despite the many skeptical perceptions of him, given the fact that in the 30 years since 1964, Kim Chong-il has accumulated political statesmanship and, even at present, he exercises actual, absolute authority, it is the conclusion of this writer that he has political ability and is likely to exercise strong authority in the future as well. This is particularly the case since in 1993 when he declared a state of semi-war (8 March), declared the DPRK's withdrawal from the NPT, and so on, and now appears to have passed the "national-crisis-management test." Because there is a high probability that this was an internal following of precedent for his accession to the position of supreme ruler, this writer believes that as long as the DPRK does not suffer a preemptive attack by the U.S. or other countries, Kim Chong-il will not attempt a militarily adventuristic, first strike on the ROK. Party, Government, and Military Bureaucracy Support for Kim Chong-il What must be discussed next is the degree of support for Kim Chong-il in the party, government, and military bureaucracies. In a system of strong, one-man rule such as in the DPRK, having a wide reputation is an absolute precondition for the successor to inherit power. In this aspect, Kim Chong-il is perfect. The proof of this is the repeated confirmation by the DPRK's supreme ruler Kim Il-song of Kim Chong-il as his successor and his securing of the necessary offices. Anyone who would become supreme ruler in the DPRK, a country maintained by a triune governing structure of party, government, and military, must gain control of these ruling organizations. This means that, by whatever means, he must secure the power elite as a support base. Thus, since the 1960s Kim Il-song has in fact devoted his energies to securing the support of the power elite, the basis of rule, for Kim Chong-il. As a result, he was able to secure the support of the 1.5 and second-generation revolutionaries. The 1972 decision on Kim Chong-il as successor was possible because he had the approval of the first-generation revolutionaries. There are those who actually assert this. A division of Kim Chong-il's support base is as follows: first, Kim Il-song's partisan comrades; second, party and government bureaucrats in their 50s and 60s who are well-trained through foreign schooling or travel; third, graduates of Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute and Kim Il-song University; fourth, former members of Three-Revolutions Teams; fifth, the "Korean Socialist Workers and Youth League [Sarochong]", a party auxiliary organization composed of youth ages 14-30; sixth, military forces around him and numerous party organizations within the military; and lastly, relatives and in-laws. The Kim Chong-il power base is thus "comprehensive." Horizontally, it includes the party, government, and military, all three elements sustaining power. Vertically, it takes in each sector, from the top to the very bottom. Also, not only does Kim Chong-il's power base include people from each sector horizontally, scholars, scientists and technicians, party bureaucrats, soldiers, vertically, it contains the older (60s and 70s), middle-aged (50s) and younger (30s and 40s) generations. In the DPRK, predominated by a party, control of the party is essential for securing and maintaining power. Here we can say that control of the party signifies complete command of both the Politburo and the Secretariat. This is because the authority of the Secretariat is almost absolute. Article 26 of the "Korean Workers Party Regulations" reads, "When necessary, the Secretariat deliberates and makes decisions on problems within the party, such as party personnel changes and pressing problems, and organizes and guides the execution of its decisions." In the October 1980 sixth party conference, this party regulation was created as Kim Chong-il was appointed to secretary so he could "grab hold" of the reins of the party, government, and military. Afterward, he organized and reshuffled party organizations as he saw fit. Ultimately, we can see that the Secretariat actually surpasses the Politburo, given the fact that the supreme ruler Kim Il-song holds the office of general secretary and number-two man Kim Chong-il acts as agent of his authority. By gaining control in the Secretariat of the organs of physical coercion, the National Defense Commission, the Social Safety Commission, the People's Armed Forces and General Bureau of National Security [Howi Chongguk], through the "Organization Leadership Commission [Chojik Chido Pu]"--the key to maintaining power, thus controlling the elite, Kim Chong-il secured the position of actual, supreme ruler. All positions in the Secretariat are filled with Kim Chong-il's royal-guard group of technocrats: Kye Ung-tae, Chon Pyong-ho, Han Song-ryong, Choe Tae-pok, Kim Chung-rin, Pak Nam-ki, So Kwan-hui, Yun Ki-pok, Kim Yong-sun, Hwang Chang-yop, Kim Kuk-tae, and Kim Ki-nam. Kim Chong-il has used well a policy of identification with is father: his father becoming absolute is his own becoming absolute. This policy was clearly seen in his recruitment of personnel into the power elite. Kim Chong-il politically weeded out beforehand anyone who might be able to oppose the Kim Il-song-Kim Chong-il hereditary regime by adopting a "ratification system." Ultimately, only relatives, in-laws, and children of revolutionaries with good backgrounds received preferential treatment. They gained power by "carrying on the family line." We can say that, ultimately, the power elite of the Kim Chong-il system realized a firm, united organization centered around the "leader [suryong]" Kim Il-song and the "little leader [chagun suryong]" Kim Chong-il. The Establishment of Kim Chong-il's Leadership of the Military In this context, we will do a deeper analysis of the military's attitude concerning the hereditary system and whether it will "carry on the family line" and be loyal to Kim Chong-il after the death of Kim Il-song. The Kim Chong-il regime will be a period of transition. Behind the question of what attitude the DPRK military will take during that time are questions, related to the issue of the hereditary system, of whether the armed forces will bring about change in the system through a coup d'etat either before or after the death of Kim Il-song and, in the event of trouble between pro-Kim and anti-Kim factions in the course of Kim Chong-il's succession to power, of which side the military will support. As the DPRK system was being prepared for Kim Chong-il to become heir in the early 1970s, the problem of establishing his control of the military naturally came up. To eliminate this, his weak point, Kim Il-song had Kim Chong-il lead the "Three-Revolutions Team Movement" beginning in 1974. In 1973, he expanded the "Three-Revolutions Red Flag Movement" to the military, strengthening its solidarity with ground-level elements within it. The "Three-Revolutions Red Flag Movement" could not but succeed as a means of controlling the military. Not only was it a government movement strongly supported by Kim Il-song, but Kim Chong-il also worked passionately for its success. The basis for this conclusion can be found in the papers published by high-level generals every year since 1975 at every important military function, praising the movement and calling for strong solidarity oriented around Kim Il-song and the party center (Kim Chong-il). Even in the 1980s, the military continued its oath of allegiance to the hereditary regime continuing from Kim Il-song to Kim Chong-il. In the ceremony commemorating the 48th anniversary of the founding of the People's Army, O Kuk-ryol emphasized Chuche Thought, saying, "The soldiers of the People's Armed Forces and all the people must go on, emphasizing and fulfilling the teachings of the great leader and their embodiment, the policies of the party." To stir up the moral of the troops, Kim Il-song reorganized the MPAF and the National Defense Commission in the April 1982 First Session of the Seventh Supreme People's Assembly, taking them out from under the Cabinet, making them directly subordinate to the Central People's Committee. In April 1985, he promoted MPAF minister O Chin-u from general to vice marshal and Colonel Generals O Kuk-nyol, Paek Hak-nim, Kim Tu-nam, Yi Ul-sol, Chu To-il, Kim Pong-yol, Kim Kwang-chin and Yi Tu-ik, eight veterans [an honorary title], to general. In 1988, he restored Choe Kwang, who had lost his job in 1968, making him Chief of Staff of the People's Armed Forces and after the 1990 Ninth Supreme People's Assembly, in December, he made him the third-ranking candidate member of the party Politburo. To commemorate his 50th birthday (16 February 1992), Kim Chong-il gave special promotions to the next higher rank to officers ranging from junior lieutenant to major, to promote their loyalty. On 20 April 1992, he and O Chin-u were promoted to marshal. At the same time, he promoted Choe Kwang, Yi Ul-sol, Chu To-il, Choe In-tok, Paek Hak-nim, Yi Tu-ik, Kim Pong-nyul, and Kim Kwang-chin, eight military veterans, to "vice marshal." As the supreme commander of the Korean People's Armed Forces, he issued an order on 23 April 1992 promoting his supporters: Tae Pyong-nyol and 15 others to general, Kim Ha-kyu and 27 others to colonel general, Kim Tae-sik and 95 others to lieutenant general, and Yi Hyong-sop and 523 others to major general. Thus, he firmly established his military base of support. Later, commemorating the "40th Anniversary of Victory," on 17 July 1993, Kim Chong-il appointed, through "marshal" O Chin-u, Choe Chun-kil and 13 other Korean War veterans to lieutenant general and Yom Tae-kyong and 84 others to major general, stimulating their moral. In the "Old Soldiers' Rally [Robyong Taehoe]" held on July 23, 1993, People's Armed Forces Chief of Staff Choe Kwang said concerning this, "Taking as our example that conviction, that spirit with which we served the great leader, making our bodies guns and bombs, we must defend to the death our supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, no matter what violent gale blows," pledging to be loyal, "carrying on the family line." It appears that, ultimately, the military bureaucracy will continue to be loyal even after the death of Kim Il-song as long as Kim Chong-il does not do anything "strange," such as rapid reform, that would endanger the preservation of the system. What of the people's support of Kim Chong-il? Of course, this is very difficult to assess given the present circumstances. However, the DPRK people generally believe there will be a smooth transfer of power to Kim Chong-il, according to an analysis of questionnaires given to defectors. Because the DPRK people perceive their leaders, beginning with Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il, to have been born possessing special "innate" abilities, challenge to authority and denial of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il are considered forbidden, according to defector testimony. Also, the DPRK people are believed to think of Kim Chong-il, not as the son of Kim Il-song, but as a "comrade" always near, listening to and solving all their problems. Concerning "being loyal, carrying on the family line," it is said that because they think of it as a kind of family-property system in which a son inherits and continues father's work, they understand it just as they do the idea that a miner's son must become a miner and a latheman's son must become a latheman. As we observed above, Kim Chong-il can be said to be doing his best to raise the people's standard of living within the limits of his authority. What is important is that the people have no great interest in the hereditary regime itself. That is, due to a lack of experience in voluntary participation and to political indifference caused by their patriarchal political culture, the people accommodate to the system. This writer thinks wrong the conclusion that, without Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il will ultimately awaken the DPRK people from their myths and that this will lead into the collapse of the DPRK regime. Special Characteristics of the North Korean Power Structure Next, we will discuss special characteristics of the DPRK power structure distinguishing it from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The special characteristics of the DPRK system can be organized as follows. First, it is a long-term, father-son hereditary structure. Unlike the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the DPRK overcame the ideological quarrels of the early regime, establishing a unified system of rule comparatively early. Later on, Kim Il-song appears to have thought the only way to ensure that his existence as father of the nation is passed on to later generations was to see that his family was idolized and, as in a patrimonial patriarchy, to pass on his power to his eldest son Kim Chong-il. Of course, there were artificial attempts to inherit power in some socialist countries also, such as the former Soviet Union and some countries of Eastern Europe, but these all failed. Even these were only attempts to hand over power to an associates or subordinate, not to a son. Thus, we can say that DPRK's father-son transfer of power by inheritance is unique. Due to fears of a coup d'etat and general revolution, during their time in power, dictators arrange for the power elite to thoroughly hold each other in check, watching and controlling them through organs of violence. They tend not to cultivate a number-two man while in office because they fear conspiracy. As a result, the designation period of the number-two man is short. Thus, the predecessor dies without giving his successor sufficient time to strengthen a power base, resulting in his fall from power. There are also situations in which the designation of a successor occurs unofficially, only between those concerned; remaining leaders refuse to acknowledge the legality of this, resulting in his fall from power. To prevent this, in 1972 when he was 60 and Kim Chong-il was 30, Kim Il-song unofficially designated Kim Chong-il as his successor in the party; during the 20 years since then, he has strengthened a firm power base for him in the party, government, and military. Second, it is a structure of relatives and in-laws and of individuals holding multiple positions. One of the unique characteristics of the Kim Il-song power structure is the fact that most of his relatives and in-laws appear in key posts, differing from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Filling key positions, these relatives and in-laws of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il support the Kim Il-song-Kim Chong-il hereditary regime more faithfully than any other of the elite. Unlike the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, DPRK had no experience of freedom before communization. Thus, patrimonial traditions remain across the whole of society, making rule by "blood relatives [yukchinjok]" possible. Power in the DPRK is amassed and concentrated in the hands of about 40 of the power elite. High-ranking elite hold multiple key positions in the party, government, military, and Supreme People's Assembly, making for easy harmony between the party, government, and military and raising the effectiveness of policy. From this aspect, it is apparently difficult for factional strife due to differences in group interest or line, or strife between reformists and conservatives, to arise. Strife is unlikely to arise in the DPRK for the following reasons: First, succession of power is going to the oldest son in accordance with patrimonial tradition. Also, because preparation for the succession has been going on over the long period of the last 20 years, it is unlikely that there will be a movement to downgrade the predecessor or revolutionary change as in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Second, because the present power-elite structure is already firmly behind the Kim Chong-il succession, it will be difficult for trouble to form within the elite group even after the death of Kim Il-song. Third, as for the pluralism which appeared in the Soviet Union after Khrushchev's campaign to downgrade the status of Stalin, it seems unlikely to appear in the DPRK. This is because strife is not permitted due to a political situation permitting only one philosophy, one system, and one line; the rest are purged. Fourth, although in the DPRK too there have been small changes in the character of the power elite, such as a gradual increase in the number of specialist bureaucrats, the extent of these changes is minuscule compared to the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Not only this, but because the ranks are filled with "double-natured bureaucrats," based on the principle, "party member first, specialist second," their loyalty to Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il is high. Thus, although there may be developing a weak foundation from which trouble can form, expression of such strife as was seen in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is still unlikely in the DPRK. More important is the fact that the DPRK power elite will not stir up trouble over the regime's line even to maintain their own positions. Given the degree of cohesion among the DPRK power elite, spontaneous, external expression of strife related to reform and liberalization appears improbable. Even if they were to understand that opening up to the outside world as a response to changes in their surrounding environment is unavoidable, their method would be to pursue a very careful, "mosquito-net"-style, selective liberalization. Looking at the Kim Chong-il Regime Rationally Additionally, North and South Korea experienced the horrible tragedy of fratricidal war called the Korean War. The ROK's "red complex" and the DPRK's "Yankee complex" are greater and deeper than can be discovered in any other divided country. In a relatively inferior position, the DPRK's anxiety is incomparably greater than that of the ROK. Thus, even if the "Two Kims" (Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il) did not exist, the next supreme ruler, whether in an authoritarian system, a military dictatorship or the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, will try to maintain the DPRK as a nation. Even in the worst-case scenario in which Kim Chong-il is overthrown and an unexpected figure becomes leader, it is possible he will call himself the successor of Kim Il-song and do his best to maintain the DPRK as a nation, even making use of "Kim Il-song-resurrection theories [Kim Il-song puhwal ron]" if need be. In this context, even if the DPRK does not carry out a first strike, in the event an extreme situation develops, such as a bombing of the DPRK by the United States and other countries, we cannot preclude the possibility that the DPRK will choose to "fight to the death [okswae]" rather than abandon its nationhood. In conclusion, in the past, there was an era when, clinging to the "Fake Kim Il-song Theory," even bringing up his name was considered taboo. Yet, Kim Il-song is unshakable despite the sudden changes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Far from falling from power due to internal rebellion, he is actually more revered by a people enveloped in a fear of sudden change. Thus, our "Fake-Kim-Il-song-Theory" understanding of and policies toward the DPRK have been proven unrealistic. By responding while overlooking Kim Il-song's ability and suitable research on the special characteristics of the DPRK system, we have been unable to come up with effective measures to counter the DPRK's unification policy toward the South. Looked at in the above context, our evaluation of Kim Chong-il may be the same. He may not compare to the "unique" leader, Kim Il-song, but he will manage the system in his own way, based on the support of the people and bureaucracy resulting from over 30 years of public life and the special character of DPRK's suryong-centered system. It is the conclusion of this writer that in the future, through gradual, selective reform and liberalization, he will satisfactorily solve the problems of economic backwardness, the DPRK's relationship with the U.S., North-South relations, and so on. Therefore, by excessively stressing only his irrational side, we are only preparing measures based on the theory that the Kim Chong-il regime will collapse soon after the death of Kim Il-song, neglecting the preparations for gradual unification that would be needed in the event of long-term survival by the Kim Chong-il regime. This would be to repeat the same blunders caused by the "Fake-Kim-Il-song Theory."
