FR941025-0-00020 FR941025-0-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;122&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9047; AD 94&hyph;21&hyph;05] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 737&hyph;300, &hyph;400, and &hyph;500 Series Airplanes Equipped With CFM International CFM56&hyph;3 Series Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 737&hyph;300, &hyph;400, and &hyph;500 series airplanes, that requires modification, adjustments, and tests of the thrust reverser system; and repair, if necessary. This amendment is prompted by results of a safety review of the thrust reverser system on these airplanes, which revealed that the installation of additional features to further minimize the likelihood of an in-flight thrust reverser deployment is necessary. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent deployment of a thrust reverser in flight and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane. DATES: Effective November 25, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of November 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen Bray, Aerospace Engineer, Propulsion Branch, ANM&hyph;140S, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2681; fax (206) 227&hyph;1181. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 737&hyph;300, &hyph;400, and &hyph;500 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on October 15, 1993 (58 FR 53457). That action proposed to require modification, adjustments, and tests of the thrust reverser system; and repair, if necessary. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One commenter supports the proposed rule. One commenter requests that paragraph (c) of the proposal be revised to specify that the paragraph applies to airplanes identified in the effectivity listing of Boeing Service Bulletin 737&hyph;78&hyph;1058. The commenter indicates that paragraph (c), as proposed, would require modification of airplanes on which the sync-lock was installed in production, but on which no additional rework was required. Further, as proposed, paragraph (c) would include airplanes that are not listed in the effectivity listing of Boeing Service Bulletin 737&hyph;78&hyph;1058. The FAA concurs, and has revised paragraph (c) of the final rule accordingly. However, airplanes on which the sync-lock was installed during production continue to be subject to the repetitive integrity test required by paragraph (d) of the final rule. Paragraph (d) of the final rule has been revised to clarify that requirement, and a new paragraph (e) has been included in the final rule to specify the compliance times for accomplishment of that requirement.
