Yesterday, the party executives of both French-speaking parties unanimously approved a statement to that effect. The word amnesty is not pronounced, but during a press conference after the weekly meeting of the PS party executive, PS Chairman Philippe Busquin used the word without any hesitation. This had never happened before within the PS. The PSC is willing "to examine the family consequences of the postwar measures case by case." The PS party executive subscribed to the words of Arthur Haulot, "the conscience of the resistance to fascism." In an appeal published in LE SOIR, Arthur Haulot stated he was no longer opposed to a "case by case investigation of those who ask for compassion," in a spirit of peace on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of our Liberation. As a resistance fighter, Haulot was arrested by the Gestapo in 1941, and survived three and one-half years at the concentration camps of Mauthausen and Dachau. By referring to the very old Haulot to tone down its implacable position on amnesty, the PS secures itself the best possible guarantee against protests by its rank and file. The PS statement says that "social consequences for the relatives of the condemned people can be seriously examined case by case." This sentence is very similar to that of the PSC text. In the PS' and PSC's view, amnesty is rejected for collaboration with the enemy, and only applies to the social and family consequences of collaboration. The PS also emphasizes that it continues to be committed to "the democratic values." Busquin explained that after the elections, the PS will not form any coalitions with ultra-rightwing parties.
