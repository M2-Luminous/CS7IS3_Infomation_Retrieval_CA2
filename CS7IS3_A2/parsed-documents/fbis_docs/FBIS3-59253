The Belgian minister also admitted, however, that obstacles remain, as Syria has not serviced its foreign debt for several years now. Although for Belgium this debt is under 500 million Belgian francs, this situation has resulted in Syria being unfavorably appraised by the National Export Guarantee Office, which has refused to cover the "Syrian" risk. Minister Urbain, who met with the principle ministers responsible for the economy (economic affairs, foreign trade, plan, energy) while in Damascus, has suggested that the debt problem should be the subject of exploratory discussions in Damascus between the National Export Guarantee Office and the Syrian authorities in order to rapidly reach solutions acceptable to both parties. If the debt problem could be solved -- either within the "Paris Club" or in any other way -- trade would then quickly intensify, he believes. In the meantime, Minister Urbain can only observe that there is a clear trade balance in favor of the UEBL [Belgo-Luxembourg Economic Union]. In 1992, the UEBL exported goods worth 3.6 billion Belgian francs to Syria, and worth 2.9 billion Belgian francs during the first nine months of 1993 (foodstuffs and manufactured goods). The UEBL imported goods worth 432 million Belgian francs from Syria in 1992, and worth just 76 million Belgian francs during the first nine months of 1993. There is therefore a clear imbalance. The need to correct this is made even more evident as Syria's economic and financial situation has shown a marked improvement over the last two years: The Gulf countries have stopped their aid to the country and domestic oil production has increased. Also, Damascus is conducting an open foreign policy and has even started a process to privatize the economy. Syria's needs in the infrastructure and energy sectors -- both sectors of interest to Belgian industry -- are major. During the recent mission, contacts were already established between Syrian partners and Belgian companies in the construction and telecommunications sectors. A UEBL-Syria economic cooperation agreement will be signed shortly, Minister Urbain has announced. This will make it possible to arrange regular sessions of a joint economic committee with representatives from the three countries. Damascus has also shown interest in a financial cooperation between the two issuing authorities (the Belgian National Bank and the Syrian Central Bank), in the following sectors in particular: staff training, bank note printing, financial transactions between banking institutions.
