FBIS4-50358 "drchi096_d_94006" FBIS-CHI-94-096 Daily Report 15 May 1994 Northeast Asia Group Conveys Hata Message Group Conveys Hata Message OW1505135294 Tokyo KYODO in English 1310 GMT 15 May 94 OW1505135294 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Beijing, May 15 KYODO -- A delegation of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ], Japan's second largest opposition grouping, arrived in Beijing on Sunday [15 May] and conveyed a conciliatory message to China from Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. The eight-member delegation headed by SDP General Secretary Wataru Kubo met with Ding Guangen, chief of the Chinese Communist Party's Propaganda Department, and expressed Hata's assurances that Japan will remain mindful of its past aggression in Asia, delegation sources said. The message follows Hata's letter last week to Chinese Premier Li Peng, in which he tried to repair damage done earlier this month when then Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano denied Japan's aggression during World War II and asserted that the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a fabrication. Nagano has since resigned. Hata restated in a policy speech on May 10 that Japan recognizes its "past actions, including aggression and colonial rule, had caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for many people." Ding was quoted as telling the delegation that "a correct understanding of history is the basis of friendly China-Japan relations." He added it is undeniable that the two nations have deviated from that aim during the 22 years of re-established diplomatic ties. The SDP delegation, which will meet on Tuesday with General Secretary Jiang Zemin, is on an eight-day visit to mark the 10th anniversary of exchanges with the Chinese Communist Party. The mission will return on May 22 after visiting Dalian and Changchun.
