Following is a report by correspondent Cha Man-sun from Vienna: [Begin Cha recording] The IAEA is in a dilemma that it could not easily show dissatisfaction although inspections on North Korean nuclear facilities, which had been resumed after much effort, were insufficient. The IAEA had a meeting this afternoon presided by Director- General Hans Blix to evaluate inspection activities on North Korea after receiving a general report from the inspection team which has just returned. It has been learned that during the meeting, the inspection team reported that although inspections on North Korea do not meet the requirements of IAEA's check list but, compared with past inspections, there had been improvement in inspection activities, including the replacement of surveillance devices, and that the continuity of inspections can be recovered if such inspections continue regularly. The inspection team also reported that not enough samples were extracted to prove whether or not North Korea had used nuclear materials for other purposes. It is not yet known whether Director-General Hans Blix has concluded the inspection to be satisfactory or not after receiving the inspection team's report. It is analyzed that the Director- General will have difficulty to make an immediate conclusion because he has to take into account both the inspection's technical aspect and international political aspect. The 35 member states of the IAEA will hold an emergency nonofficial Board of Governors meeting late tonight to receive a general report from the Director-General and to discuss follow-up measures for the inspection results.
