He described China as a strong supporter of the Third World countries in the United Nations. The minister made these remarks in an interview with XINHUA before the visit to Sudan by Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen . The Sudanese minister said that despite the reforms in both countries and changes on the regional and international arenas, the ties between the two countries follow a correct course of development. This is due to their commitment to the five principles of peaceful coexistence in their foreign policies, he said. The minister added that the visit to Sudan of the Chinese vice- premier constitutes a strong push to the relations between the two countries and is highly appreciated by Sudan. Salih pointed out that Sino-Sudanese relations have a long history. The two countries established diplomatic relations in 1959 and Sudan was one of the first countries backing China's admission into the United Nations. In 1993, the two countries signed an economic, technical and commercial agreement covering a wider range of bilateral cooperation, he added. The minister stressed Sudan will never forget the assistance China has rendered in the past. The forthcoming visit to Sudan by the Chinese vice-premier will open new spheres for cooperation between the two friendly countries, he said. During his stay in Sudan between January 13 and 15, the senior Chinese official will meet with a number of Sudan's prominent figures, including President of the Republic 'Umar Hasan Ahmad al- Bashir, and discuss with Sudanese officials bilateral, regional and international issues of common concern. He will also visit a number of enterprises initiated by China in Sudan.
