"If neutrality were really to be abolished one day, the decision would have to be made by parliament and not in a referendum," the foreign minister emphasized in the interview. Legally, it is clear that neutrality is not an intrinsic law of the Constitution, and it is only such laws that require a referendum. In an earlier news conference, Mock explained the confusion created through his address to the Greens conference in the following way: He would not be told not to think ahead. All he did was discuss possibilities that might become relevant in a few decades. Not many things, apart from God, are forever, Mock said. In another news conference, Austrian People's Party [OeVP] Chairman Busek also gave assurances that this question was not currently on the agenda. "We will join the European Union [EU] as a neutral country. Everything else will depend on whether there will be changes in the EU, and what changes. If such changes were to affect an intrinsic law of the Constitution -- which we do not know today -- then we are obliged to put the issue to a referendum in Austria; but everything in its time." Mock's statements at the Greens' Federal Congress were described by Busek as "technically most upright." Yet the Greens deliberately misinterpreted Mock; moreover, some of Mock's statements were quoted in a condensed version. The vice chancellor once more stressed "the clear course of the OeVP," which "has always advocated a collective security system for Europe." The "logical development" is a collective security system, about which there is "absolutely no dissent" even with Chancellor Vranitzky -- "That is government policy," Busek said. Yesterday, on the sidelines of a news conference, Heide Schmidt, chairwoman of the Liberal Forum, described the Government's position on the issue of neutrality as "two-faced and cowardly." She said she saw no need to raise the question now of whether a referendum might become necessary at a later time.
