That became clear yesterday following negotiations between the leaders of the three parties, Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo respectively. The VVD and the PvdA have serious differences in viewing the future of health care. The PvdA wants to avoid people on the lowest incomes paying much more for health care. The PvdA wants to make any personal contribution dependent on earnings. If that does not seem possible, the PvdA wants a risk insurance linked to incomes. The VVD believes that the risk insurance must be the same for everyone. Last night Kok described the talks on health care as "a test case for the `purple' coalition." Kok believes that extra charges for the lowest paid in this area must be "limited as much as possible" because "they already find it difficult to meet these costs." Yesterday, Kok and D66 leader Van Mierlo did not reject VVD leader Bolkestein's suggestion to form the new government on a 5-5-4 basis: Five ministers for the PvdA, including the prime ministership, five for the VVD, and four for the D66. Van Mierlo described Bolkestein's proposal as "workable and conceivable." Kok stated that "the negotiations must first be concluded in terms of content before considering the question of the allocation of ministerial posts." The PvdA has 37 seats in the new parliament, the VVD 31, and the D66 24. Kok: "Working on the basis of 14, a 5-5-4 split seems logical in a way, but other forms of reasoning are perhaps possible." Bolkestein repeated yesterday that he would not be a member of the new cabinet. "I do not want to commit myself, but my preference is to be party leader, for the simple reason that I am a supporter of dualism and my hands would be tied too much as a minister." He stated that if Kok were to be prime minister, it is likely that he would be assisted by two deputy prime ministers, one from the VVD and one from the D66. The negotiators were again hopeful yesterday on the progress of the talks. Van Mierlo: "It is getting more difficult, but we are getting there." Bolkestein: "I have become steadily more optimistic in recent weeks." Prime Minister Lubbers said in Leiden yesterday that "the party leaders and the politicians who have been appointed by the Crown to assess the feasibility of the various coalitions, should try to complete their work this month. I am not against a `purple' coalition, but it is desirable for it to be achieved in the short term. The country needs a government," Lubbers stated. A "purple" coalition is considered to be a good outcome on the basis of the election results.
