FBIS4-5267 "dreas069__a94002" FBIS-EAS-94-069-A Daily Report 10 Apr 1994 ANNEX Inter-Asian Affairs DPRK Reportedly Supplies Arms to Cambodia DPRK Reportedly Supplies Arms to Cambodia OW1104023394 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN in Japanese 10 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 4--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1104023394 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [By Akihiko Ota] [Text] Phnom Penh, 9 Apr -- It was disclosed on 9 April that North Korea (DPRK) had supplied, as a grant to Cambodian Government forces, armored personnel carriers and tons of arms, including shells. It was further reported that in late march Government forces used the arms to successfully seize Pailin, the Pol Pot faction's major stronghold. The disclosures to the SANKEI SHIMBUN came from a Cambodian Army source in Phnom Penh, and it can be seen that in doing this favor to the Cambodian Government, North Korea aims to secure a beachhead which it can use to break free of international isolation in the future. The Cambodian Army source said six armored personnel carriers and tons of arms, including shells for howitzers, mortars and small weapons, were and supplied to Cambodian Government forces as a grant. The vehicles and arms were flown to Cambodia in mid-February. He said North Korea has decided to provide tons of additional ammunition by early April. Cambodian Minister of National Defense Tie Banh has reportedly flown to Pyongyang in profound secrecy to express gratitude. With North Korea's military assistance, Cambodian Government forces started intensive shelling of the Pailin area in mid-March and were able to seize Sala Krau, one of the Pol Pot faction's strongholds, on 19 March, and then Pailin on 21 March. The same source said: "Making a low assessment of the morale and ammunition supplies of the government forces, the Pol Pot faction stationed only 280 guards in Pailin city. The government forces were, therefore, able to bring the city under their control very quickly by surprise attack. Without North Korea's supply of ammunition, it would have been impossible for the government forces to subdue Pailin, and without its additional assistance, they would not have been able to maintain control over the city." The same source disclosed that government forces worked out a plan to attack Anlong Veng, a stronghold in the northern province of Siem Reap, and Pailin, the major stronghold in the south, to mop up those members of the Pol Pot faction that rejected any form of dialogue. Anlong Veng was attacked first. However, lax discipline within the government forces caused weapons and ammunition to flow out onto the black market in large amounts. They subdued Anlong Veng, but paid the price for allowing weaponry to be sold off when they lost it again in February due to a shortage of supplies. The government, meanwhile, tried to get assistance from neighboring allies, Vietnam and Laos. However, they turned down the request, saying "nothing can be done to help Cambodia." Desperately, the Cambodian Government called on North Korea to assist by supplying arms through the North Korean embassy in Phnom Penh. North Korea's response was to say that it would provide "two shipments of arms in the form of a grant." Asked why North Korea decided to provide arms to Cambodian Government forces, the same source said: "Due to the nuclear inspection issue, North Korea has become further isolated in the international community. By doing a favor to Cambodia, which is now the focus of international attention in Southeast Asia, North Korea intends to obtain a future ally." North Korean President Kim Il-song and Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk have long maintained a relationship as allies since President Kim provided support for King Sihanouk when he was forced to flee the country because of a coup. Every year King Sihanouk would visit Pyongyang and stay at a luxurious villa reserved exclusively for him. North Korea's decision to supply of arms to Cambodia at short notice was likely made against the background of the "honeymoon relationship" between President Kim and King Sihanouk.
