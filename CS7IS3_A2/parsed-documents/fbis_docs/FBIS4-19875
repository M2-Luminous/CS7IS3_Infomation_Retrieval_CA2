Then it will be up to Prime Minister Carl Bildt to decide if we should go or whether we can put our divergent view on record." Olof Johansson, environment minister and Center Party leader, has his strategy clear. This was apparent in an interview with SVENSKA DAGBLADET. [Johansson] I have the biggest responsibility to the party conference. I have not yet discussed in the circle of ministers what a no will mean for our actions in the government. But I did think the thing through carefully when we joined the government. We might be offered the possibility of putting our reservations on record. In the event of a no to the EU, the question whether we should do that or resign raises its head. This is something the prime minister must decide. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] But could you stay and be opposed to one of the cornerstones of the government declaration -- membership of the EU? [Johansson] The question is no longer quite so important because it is to be decided in a referendum, after the Riksdag election. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] The possibility of a government party expressing its reservations on an issue where it takes a divergent view was brought back onto the agenda in connection with the conflict surrounding the Oresund bridge -- an issue which will soon be back on the government's desk. Now Olof Johansson is pointing to the same possible solution in the even of an EU no from the Center Party. The Center Party leader has taken part in four local party meetings. How do you see the outcome of the extraordinary party congress vote on the EU, now that the local party organizations have had their say? [Johansson] Reporting is loudest when the answer is a no.... But I believe that we will see the same positions as at past party congresses -- only a little clearer. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] However, Olof Johansson expects that now that the question is being brought to a head, uncertain delegates could slip over onto the no side. Has the result of the negotiations influenced Center Party opinion in the direction of a yes? [Johansson] I myself have not drawn attention particularly strongly to the result from the negotiations. But I think that it can give greater credibility. It is important that people do not undermine this result here at home by implementing spending cuts in the national support for agriculture and regional policy. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] The Center Party's government colleagues are cautious when it comes to drawing any conclusions about continued government cooperation, before the party's congress has reached a decision. Christian Democratic Party [KDS] secretary Dan Ericsson said that up to now the government has been united in working for membership. [Ericsson] And Center Party ministers in particular have worked to achieve a good agreement with the EU countries. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] During the membership negotiations, the Center Party's ministers were responsible for some of the most heavyweight areas -- the environment, agriculture, and regional policy. Dan Ericsson is amazed that Olof Johansson is thinking in terms of resignations. [Ericsson] A remarkable situation is arising. The Center Party is not itself coming to a decision about the continued existence of the government. It is leaving it to the government head to think about what should happen if the government suddenly contains a party that argues against membership. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] KDS sympathizers are just as divided in their attitudes to the EU as Center Party voters and Social Democrats. But the party leadership has methodically worked for a yes. At the three most recent KDS national conferences, the party's active members have voted for Swedish membership. Dan Ericsson pointed out that Christian Democrats elsewhere in Europe have been in favor of a European community ever since the creation of the coal and steel union, the first step toward what today is the EU. Moderate Coalition Party secretary Gunnar Hokmark takes a much more wait-and-see approach than Dan Ericsson. [Ericsson] We are assuming that the Center Party will follow in full the policy we agree on in government cooperation. If something different happens, we will have to reach a decision then. [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Hokmark stressed that the ultimate goal of Swedish membership has been part of the package ever since the nonsocialist four-party government's first government declaration in the fall of 1991. In it Prime Minister Carl Bildt (Moderate Coalition Party) said that the first major task "is to lead Sweden fully into European cooperation through negotiations on membership of the European Community." Liberal Party secretary Peter Orn was unwilling to comment on the Center Party's internal processes. "They must be allowed to see to them in peace. I have always disliked the way Carl Bildt has attacked the Social Democrats because they have not yet reached a decision on EU membership." Sten Olsson, the opposition Social Democrats' assistant party secretary, thinks that a situation in which a government's composition can remain the same if Center Party delegates vote no to the EU is difficult to reconcile with Sweden's parliamentary principles; Swedish ministers have a collective responsibility for the work of the whole government. "It is the same debate as the debate about the Oresund bridge. Can the government reserve judgment on a question of such central importance?" Sten Olsson asked, answering his own question by saying that this is hardly possible because of the demand for joint responsibility. For his own part he is happy with the way the Social Democrats have handled the EU question -- the Social Democratic leadership has come out in favor of membership. On 18-19 June the adjourned congress will then recommend to to voters whether to vote yes or no. "If we receive the support needed to form a government in the election in September we will already have put our cards on the table on the EU question," Sten Olsson said, adding that as a result the party does not find itself in the same boat as the current government.
