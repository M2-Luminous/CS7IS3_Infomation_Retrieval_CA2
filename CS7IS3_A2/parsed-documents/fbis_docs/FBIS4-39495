"What the Bolsheviks hoped for so much has actually happened," was the comment of Mykola Horyn, chairman of the oblast council, at a press conference held yesterday. How will the the situation develop? Given the present situation, the oblast council chairman said, the 26 June elections will definitely take place throughout Ukraine, and in Lvov Oblast in particular. Those elections will legally eliminate the presidential structure all across Ukraine -- something that the left forces fought for since the very first day after the last presidential elections. Another important fact produced by the elections, I believe, will be the consolidation of the old-style system of soviets in Ukraine which is becoming a communist reserve. In an unprecedented event in history of democratic development, we will have the elections to a government structure that is not legally defined or acknowledged by the country's highest legislative body. This enables the left majority in the parliament, on the eve of the elections, to forge a power system well suited for the communist majority in Ukraine. If the present tendencies in parliament continue, one can only imagine what is awaiting us in the immediate future. A number of questions arise here. Why did the communists care so much about legality and virtually unanimously vote to cancel our decision? I am also tormented by the question why did our "national hero" Stepan Khmara, who shook his fist in front of Moroz two days ago, ally himself with those people and, on top of it, demand that the Supreme Council resolution include a paragraph promising severe punishment for the oblast's leadership if it moves to torpedo the 26 June elections? Is it possible that none of our deputies wanted to take the rostrum to examine this important problem and, as of two days ago, raise a question of the communist coup and sovietization now under way in our country? The decision by the oblast's council regarding suspension of electoral commissions was intended to attract massive puhlic attention to the situation in Ukraine. Unfortunately, it failed to receive this attention, and the media in Kiev practically blocked it for three days. With tacit approval on the part of the group of democratic deputies, the Supreme Council managed to adopt this decision. This is another victory of the communist majority. I do not understand the position of some political forces in Lvov Oblast. I appreciate efforts by the Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party and Ukrainian Republican Party who supported the oblast council's decision. I am especially grateful to the Lvov Oblast Council which boldly kept its ground and saved its moral and political face, living up to expectations of the people that elected it four years ago. However, political haggling has already started in other political organizations staged by specific groups of people and interests. They also helped prevent this decision from becoming a political act. I am concerned about innuendoes spread by the media to attribute specific names to the decision by the oblast's council. Over time, everyone will realize what a big mistake we made by not transforming this even into a political action. Stepan Davymuk, the Ukrainian president's representative in Lvov Oblast, noted: "Many of our politicians thought that proimperial and communist forces will resign from politics and power. It was naive to think that way. We see those forces forming their political organizations and rapidly gaining influence over certain levers in the economy and the hinterland. ``We deal here with the restoration of the orthodox communist force in various options -- as the Socialist, Agrarian Party, etc. As a matter of fact, the idea of resuscitating the old Soviet Union is being restored. This is the most dangerous thing. Ukraine is being driven into a blind alley.'' The journalists asked questions primarily about the recent events in the Supreme Council. Mr. Horyn, do you think that this decision, even if canceled, can still wake up the consciousness of the electorate and politicians? [unattributed question] I was expecting that at least the consciousness of our Supreme Council deputies would be awakened. I hoped this would be used as a serious chance of countering sovietization and communization of Ukraine, now under way. Unfortunately, thanks to the consolidation of the right and left forces, the decision was adopted. This revealed the parochial interests of certain political organizations. They say that chessmen have already been arranged on the chessborad, and [communists] decided to go all the way, no matter what the outcome of this game will be.
