According to him, the new regulations should enable the EBRD to fulfill its mandate in the best manner possible--that is, by assisting the reform process in Central and East Europe. We would like to come closer to the local private sector, to focus on support for its development, and to be active in all of the countries of the region, said de Larosiere. In his opinion, the EBRD should be more involved in the capital inputs into the enterprises, and it is also necessary to emphasize the significance of the financial sector for the successful course of the reforms. Support for the development, first and foremost, of private business initiatives in the infrastructure sphere, which is the driving force behind an economy's growth, remains a priority. In his speech, the president confirmed the EBRD's intention to become capitally involved in developing the financial sector in Central and East Europe. The bank has already confirmed its intention to invest a total of 111 million European Currency Units in 11 financial institutions in eight of the region's countries. "We were asked by the management of the Czech Komercni banka [Commercial Bank] to become involved in purchasing some of the shares from the forthcoming issue," said de Larosiere. However, in his opinion, it would be a greater success for the Czech economy if the entire issue is absorbed by the local market. The policy of the European Union [EU] toward the countries of East Europe in the trade issue should be more liberal since the EU's policy still seems too shortsighted and egoistic in this respect. This statement was made by former British Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont after he delivered his speech to the European Banking Forum. Norman Lamont added that enterprises in some postcommunist countries are frequently supported less by the state than, for example, Italian or Spanish enterprises, and, consequently, this issue should not prevent these countries from being admitted into the European Union. In his speech to the European Banking Forum, Zdenek Drabek, an adviser to the governor of the Czech National Bank, referred to the similarity of the measures introduced by the East European states in reforming the banking sector. The European Banking Forum sessions held at midday and in the afternoon of Tuesday [22 March] concentrated on the establishment and activity of the East European commercial banks and the issue of the influx of foreign capital into the transforming economies.
