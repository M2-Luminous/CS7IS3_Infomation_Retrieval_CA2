He told the London-based Arabic daily AL-HAYAH that police identified and monitored the extremist groups after tightening control of desert areas, shanty towns, and Nile islands, where those groups had their secret hideouts. Al-Alfi stressed that foreign quarters are involved in the terrorist operations in Egypt. He said police are constantly directing abortive blows at terrorist schemes. The arrest of those involved in recent bank bombings in Cairo and al-Jizah comes within this context, he said. The interior minister renewed rejection of a dialogue with the terrorists. He said terrorists try to create what he described as "media furor." Some foreign news media help them by inflating their operations, he noted. Al-Alfi said Egyptian security agencies are watching developments in the structure of the terrorist groups on every level, beginning with relations among them and ending with the splits and alliances that affect changes of membership. He said Egypt is in constant touch with foreign states where some extremist leaders reside. Al-Alfi said the lack of indictment against Ayman al-Zawahiri, an al-Jihad organization leader now living in Switzerland, in the case of the attempt on Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi's life concerns the interrogation authorities. Perhaps those authorities don't have enough evidence for an indictment, he said.
