There are also [non-Arab] Shiite minorities in Iraq such as the al-Kurd al-Filiyah [as published] and the Turkoman Shiites. 3) The persecution of the Shiites of Iraq is being carried out not be Sunnis, whether Arabs or Kurds, but rather by a small tribal minority that is exercising absolute control over the nation. The reason for the organized persecution is to be found in some basic contradictions. We find the majority of the people totally excluded from participating in the formulation of the nation's policy and the major administration of this policy. The nation's authority is a sectarian, tribal authority, the identity of the ruling party is secular, the state religion is Islam, the Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs is in the hands of those whose doctrine is Sunni Hanafi, and most of the country's people are Shiite Muslims. The Shiite Muslims are being subjected to a process of impoverishment and exclusion from government institutions, and they are being subjected to campaigns that have the aim of tearing them apart as individuals, families, and as a community, whether they are in cities or in the marshes. This sectarian persecution is not limited to those who are religiously committed people or to religious establishments. It includes the Shiite masses of people in general, even those who have served in some of the government agencies, the army, the party, and the labor unions on the lower levels. The Shiites have suffered more from the dictatorship, because their numbers are greater, and because the ruling regime has made persecution of the Shiites a daily and all-encompassing practice. Deprivation of the Shiites has become a reality on which the instruments of higher authority [of the state] are based. It is difficult to bring up the topic of persecution of the Shiites in Iraq because of its extreme sensitivity and because of the hateful feuds of sectarianism that might be aroused. The person who benefits the most from not having this topic brought up and discussed is the dictator himself, and the only ones adversely affected are the people who are persecuted. We feel that the first step toward dealing with a problem is to acknowledge its existence, then assign a name to the problem, then define it in order that ways of dealing with it can be determined, and then begin solving it. Work should be done patiently and quietly with the parties concerned. The issue should be discussed and set forth in detail, and a dialogue should be opened in order to bring up the political, social, and religious problems that afflict the Shiites of Iraq. Then action should be taken to eliminate the historical and political injustice that has afflicted them. This action should be taken within the framework of a single nation and an advanced and civilized society which would permit freedom of expression and freedom of religion and guarantee civil and political rights to everyone. Frank discussion about the crisis of the Shiites in Iraq and open admission of one's Shiite affiliation does not mean that the identity of others will be assaulted or that discord will be stirred up. Any individual has the right to define himself in terms of his national origin, tribe, religious beliefs, or homeland. This does not constitute an assault upon, or provocation aimed at, others. Bringing up the problem of the Shiite crisis, assigning it a name, and demanding that the people of the nation solve it, does not mean that dealing with the crisis involves the creation of another type of political sect. The solution is not to be found in mounting a counterattack, nor do we call for a sectarian constitution. What we are calling for is to safeguard the freedom of individuals and the institutions of society within the framework of a single nation and to safeguard the civil, political, and religious rights of all sects. We feel called upon to do justice to the truth, because we know that the Shiites are not a group of people with a new and heretical doctrine that has just come upon the scene. Their doctrine is one of the oldest in Islam and one of the most all-embracing schools of thought in terms of clarification of the faith, and they constitute the great majority of the people of Iraq. In public life, they have been like other people in that some of them are open-minded and others are fanatical, some of them are guilty of excesses whereas others believe in brotherhood [with others], and some of them are tolerant whereas others are zealots. But, in general, Shiites act as people who are oppressed and ruled, and thus they are inclined to call for the holding of a dialogue, casting fanaticism aside, and submitting to the logic of reason, equality, justice, love, and peace. In spite of the fact that the Shiites constitute a very old and authentic sect in Arab and Islamic history, they have remained far from the limelight of the world throughout this century. Also, there has been [in terms of information] a blackout against them in the countries where they live and among their compatriots, such that people have only very limited and faulty knowledge about them. During the last few years, the word "Shiite" in most countries has become synonymous with extremism, violence, terrorism, etc. Furthermore, another view, which is mistaken and which is no less important than the one mentioned above, has become predominant, and it is a view from which the Shiites still suffer. It is the fact that Shiites' patriotism is questioned and they are accused of being loyal to Iran, and the Shiite masses are looked upon as extremists and terroristic minorities who threaten the security and stability of the Middle East. It is for this reason that Saddam Husayn has utilized these mistaken views and unfounded fears concerning the Shiites to his own benefit, he has acted with great skill to feed these views and to attempt to prove that they are true, and he has committed crimes against humanity and accused the Shiites of having committed these crimes. The result of all of this has been that a thick curtain has obscured the importance of the Shiites' positive presence, unjustified questions have been raised, and sanction has been given to attempts to create a distorted image of the people who belong to this branch of Islam. At the very least, they are approached with wariness and caution, and at the worst they are treated very negatively and are the victims of suppression and torture. The most prominent example of this extreme negative approach was the crushing of the rebellion of the people of Iraq in February of 1991. For them this was a human and historic catastrophe in which the religious centers, mosques, Shiite gathering places, holy shrines, institutions of learning, clergymen, and the Shiite masses were subjected to destruction and genocide and their vital centers were crushed, and the world has hardly seen anything like it during modern history. The world looked on with silence while this great tragedy was happening to our Shiite Muslim Arab brethren on all levels. Anyone who reads the history of modern Iraq will find that the Shiites of Iraq and their clergymen played a major role in the struggle against foreign occupation and imperialism and participated in the liberation of Iraq. And the fatwas [religious orders] issued by Shiite clergymen dealing with the holy war against foreign occupation in Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, and Arab North Africa greatly influenced the feelings of the Shiite people. Historically it is a fact that the Shiite clergymen played a pioneering role in the process of human and cultural development in the Arab world. Anyone can attest to the fact that the Shiite clergymen and imams wrote all sorts of works in the fields of science and literature and works in the field of religion that dealt with Islamic jurisprudence, principles of the faith, interpretation of the Koran, and [Islamic] philosophy. And now we are bidding farwell to the 20th century in which we saw the occurrence of the world revolution in communications between nations that has led to constant human activity and caused the nations of the world to become opened up to each other. We also saw the establishment of the UN, which brought up the issue of human rights and freedoms, and dozens of public organizations and bodies were established to defend the rights of the oppressed. Also, public conferences and councils have been held in order to help curtail the injustice that has been the lot of those who generally have been people who have been deprived, by virtue of their tragic situation, of even the most basic opportunities--available in some nations--to have their complaints and cries against injustice be heard. In spite of all this, the Shiites of Iraq still are suffering the greatest hardships, in addition to what they used to suffer because of the gulf between them and the ruling regimes. It is very unfortunate that this feeling has not been restricted to political establishments and governments. It has also been found in many civil and religious circles and even in some establishments that are characterized by open-mindedness such as universities and other organizations that usually sympathize with oppressed peoples. There is no doubt that the atmosphere that accompanied the birth of the Islamic Republic in Iran played a major role in causing these negative and tense attitudes to become worse than they were previously. With no justification at all, the Shiites of Iraq have had to bear the brunt of this. They have even been hit with the accusation, in general and in particular, that they constitute a danger, that they are terrorists, and the like. The oppressed [Shiite] nation has paid, and still pays, the price of this. The Shiites of Iraq today are being subjected to persecution, expulsion, suffering, slow death, mass killings, and deprivation of the most elementary human rights and the right of citizenship because the world still is indifferent to their suffering, due to sectarian, political, and geographical considerations. In spite of informational blackout attempts, the world has clearly witnessed the use of incendiary bombs and lethal weapons by the Iraqi regime [against the Shiites]. They have been used to commit genocide against peaceful communities of inhabitants of a particular ethnic or religious origin, and human communities have been destroyed by artillery shelling and draining the waters of the marshes in southern Iraq. The world has also seen tanks crush and destroy academic and cultural establishments and public libraries, it has seen holy shrines, places of worship, cemeteries, and Shiite gathering places desecrated, and it has seen the killing and arrest of clergymen, tribal chieftains, and ordinary people in vicious and all-encompassing attacks against the Shiites and the cultural heritage and legacy of the members of the Shiite community. In addition to all these crimes, there has been followed, on the pretext of the economic boycott, a policy of plunging most of the Shiites into a condition of starvation because of the sect to which they belong, while a very small minority of them live in comfort, oppressing the others. Iraq's prisons are still full of thousands of innocent people, including more than 100 Shiite clergymen from the Imam al-Khu'i School in al- Najaf, which is one of the most venerable of Islamic schools in terms of its heritage and contributions to civilization, and is on a par with the university of al-Azhar. Saddam Husayn's regime proceeded to destroy this thousand-year-old school, burn its public libraries, and imprison those from the institution. It is clear that what is happening to the Shiites of Iraq today constitutes a clear violation of the paragraphs of the International Declaration on Human Rights and the rights of minorities that appear in the documents of the UN. We hope that this exceptional situation will be studied and dealt with, and that the necessary proposals will be put forth in order to prevent the repetition and continuation of this tragic situation in Iraq and other countries.
