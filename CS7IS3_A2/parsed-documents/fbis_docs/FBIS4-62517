The mediation effort by Russia and the CSCE to restore peace in the region has begun to yield positive results. The cease-fire agreement, which will be signed at the talks between the defense ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan and the representatives of the NKR Defense Army to be held in Moscow today, will be a step in that direction. However, several forces, establishments, and organizations opposed to the leading officials in Azerbaijan have seriously criticized that republic's signing of the Bishkek protocol. It is no coincidence that, compared with the situation of a few days ago, the number of intensive combat operations in the region has considerably decreased. However, exchanges of fire have not completely ended. Undoubtedly, many military officials in Azerbaijan support the opposition forces in that republic. We stressed earlier that the Armenian side is trying not to return fire in order to avoid worsening the present situation. In fact, it is trying to counter any activity that may violate the Bishkek protocol. However, the Azerbaijani forces have maintained intensive operations. Nevertheless, to be fair we must note that the present operations are in the form of positional fighting. The situation is complex. The NKR Defense Army Headquarters Press Service has disclosed that the NKR positions in Mardakertskiy, Agdamskiy, and Askeranskiy Rayons were fired by various types or arms last night and this morning. Two NKR freedom fighters were wounded. The NKR defense forces remained committed to the NKR Defense Army Headquarters' order to refrain from opening fire. They refrained from launching retaliatory operations. Meanwhile, intelligence units have reported that Azerbaijan is presently massing reinforcements and military vehicles in the northern part of Mardakertskiy Rayon. No incidents occurred on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan last night and this morning. Nevertheless, the situation is tense.
