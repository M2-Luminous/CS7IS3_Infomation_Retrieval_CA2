The commission stressed that the enrollment work must be carried out properly and its management strengthened. According to an official from the commission, though the enrollment scale will drop slightly this year, it does not mean that development of higher education in the country would be limited nor does it mean that there would be a drop in the entrance rate of students enrolled into higher learning institutions. Since the number of graduates this year will be fewer than that of freshmen, the actual number of students studying in universities and colleges will be up to 2.79 million, an increase of nearly 260,000 or about 10 per cent over last year. According to an education development programme drawn up by the commission set for the year 2,000, China will see 3.5 million students studying in such institutions by the year 2,000, showing an average annual growth of 6.5 per cent. The actual growth in the number of students during the past two years was higher than the planned figure and so do such growth to be seen in this year. [sentence as published] Students who will graduate this year are expected at 2.15 million, a drop of 160,000 while the entrance rate of high school graduates to be enrolled into these higher learning institutions will grow by 1.7 percentage points. The official pointed out that the country had in recent years seen some violation of state policy on education including illegal enrollment of students and running of schools. In order to keep the running of these higher learning institutions in good order across the country, governments as well as departments in charge of student enrollment at various levels must strengthen their administration of enrollment plans. The commission would make public a number of universities and colleges qualified for the enrollment of students on their own. Other universities not included in this list can not enroll students on their own.
