Francisco Acosta says this new trend will allow the modernization of the electricity sector because it is not fair for the state to reserve for itself the tasks of regulation, normalization, and control when it performs none of these functions under optimum conditions because it does not have adequate resources to update its obsolete equipment. The energy and mines minister also said that oil production will increase to 400,00 barrels per day this year. This increase in production comes from the (Boyi-Capiron), Tivacuno, (Amo), (Daimi), (Ginta), and (Ori) oil fields operated by the Matsu company, which will produce an additional 16,500 barrels of oil.
