Minister Santamaria said the information available is still vague, but he added that those who might be targeted have already been alerted. Minister Santamaria said the government abides by the principles of respecting human rights and rejecting violence, and, therefore, it is illogical to think any government official is involved in the recent attack against the bodyguards of FMLN candidate Nidia Diaz. Santamaria stressed that whenever the government has received information of this nature, it has warned those who might be targeted. [Begin Santamaria recording] I believe no one could receive this kind of information without reporting it, because it would be tragic if anything happened to a person who could have been alerted. [end recording] Santamaria said in light of the fact that the information received is sometimes sketchy, it is difficult to arrest the people reportedly involved in plans to attack political figures. [Begin Santamaria recording] When a person is arrested, the arrest has to be based on evidence and not on simple information that cannot be used as a basis for detention. In addition, we have taken other measures. [end recording] According to Santamaria, whenever the FMLN has asked for assistance from government organizations, it has received assistance without any problems. He recalled that the Investigations Division of the National Civilian Police is investigating the attack on Nidia Diaz's bodyguards.
