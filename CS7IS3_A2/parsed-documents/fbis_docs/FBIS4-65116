Bernard Bosson has said he does not believe it is in keeping with the regulations in force and expressed the strongest possible reservations concerning the consequences that attempts to operate flights outside the law could have. Yet the European Commission recently gave its agreement, and the company TAT was even preparing to open up this route. Michel Polacco: [Polacco] [passage omitted] The European Commission's decision of 27 April makes it obligatory for Orly to be opened up to competition, and TAT -- which has become a subsidiary of British Airways -- pleased with this decision, has decided, like British Airways and Air UK, to enter this market niche. [passage omitted] The French Government has lodged a complaint with the European Court of Justice, and in the meantime has banned the first three flights scheduled to leave Orly from Monday for three reasons: Orly is overloaded, and to add to this burden would cause environmental problems; Heathrow, which is the Orly of London, is not offering any slots to new companies -- Air France, for example, who would be interested; third, the time limit set by the Commission does not make it possible for the carriers to prepare these flights properly. The plans of the three airlines have thus not been approved. The flights are not authorized for the time being. [passage omitted]
