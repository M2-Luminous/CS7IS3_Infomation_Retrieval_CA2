At least for now, apart from official statements, this concern is not getting any answers from politicians. The law requiring a partial reform of the National Constitution (24.309), resulting from the Menem-Alfonsin accord, leaves the issue open, but no agreements have been reached about addressing it. Given the present paralysis on the hazardous wastes law because of the refusal by some provinces to adhere to a standardized legal system covering the entire nation, nobody in the political arena dares think that the "federal plan" may be incompatible with this new situation. The statement has been heard that "it is politically unworkable to demand that the provinces turn over control of the environment to the national government." In recent statements, criminal law expert Miguel Angel Aguilera has emphasized the need to "prioritize the environmental system by granting it adequate protection in our Constitution" and by criminalizing actions detrimental to the environment. He described environmental crimes as "white collar" crimes. The legal specialist said that "with the exception of some types of water pollution (which is, par excellence, the old environmental crime), in general Latin American criminal codes lack provisions designed to protect the environment." Earlier Aguilera had said that "Argentine society, acting through its institutions and nonprofit foundations or organizations, has expressed its concern." He then urged members of Congress to respond to this concern by enacting legislation. As the constitutional reform approaches, Aguilera cited the examples of Panama and Spain. Their constitutions speak of the "state's fundamental duty to ensure that the population lives in a healthy environment free of pollutants, where the air, water, and foods fulfill the requirements for the adequate pursuit of human life." Aguilera's statements reflect a "principle-based" concern that is common in the environmental community. But some analysts want our new Constitution to contain more than just a formal statement. Although later laws will actually enact regulations and implement the principles defined in the Constitution, the new "Magna Carta" should be explicit in one aspect: it should not contain any elements that might become obstacles to environmental protection. As an example: the rigid federalism of our present Constitution has become an insurmountable obstacle, blocking adequate legislation on the management of "hazardous wastes," something which is absolutely essential from this time forward.
