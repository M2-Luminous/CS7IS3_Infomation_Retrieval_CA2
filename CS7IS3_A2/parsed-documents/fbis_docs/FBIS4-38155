The call for the strike was given by the Pakistan Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry to protest against certain taxation proposals in the federal budget. Our correspondents from major cities and towns say that as compared to yesterday, most of small traders today carried out their business. The impact of strike was however witnessed in major shopping centers, big business establishments, commercial houses, and industrial estates. Our representatives say most of small traders opened their premises in the morning, but under pressure from chamber's representatives they pulled down their shutters later in the day. Like yesterday, transporters and petroleum dealers remained averse to the strike call and carried on their normal activities. Fruit and vegetable markets remained open and normal rush of buyers was visible. The life was normal as strike did not affect the common man who was least concerned by the shutdown in the major markets and shopping centers.
