The decision is in accordance with the policy that government will make the Team Spirit suspension announcement on condition that the inter-Korean dialogue is resumed and that an International Atomic Energy Agency inspection team arrives in Pyongyang. Proposing to North Korea on Monday that the working-level meeting be held on Tuesday, the government decided to make the Team Spirit suspension announcement at the Defense Ministry on Tuesday.
