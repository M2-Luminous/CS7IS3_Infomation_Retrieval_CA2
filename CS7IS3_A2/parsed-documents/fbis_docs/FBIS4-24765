The observations came in XIANDAI JIANCHUAN (MODERN NAVAL VESSELS), which ran a feature on Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force. The monthly magazine is published by the Research Institute of Naval Vessels, a think-tank associated with the Chinese Navy. It said Japan's naval strategy evolved from a defense of neighboring waters in the 1960s and 1970s to active defense of distant waters from the early 1980s. The change in orientation was attributed not only to Japan's desire to protect its status as an economic superpower but to its alleged "militaristic desire." The article cited recent developments as suggesting that Japan is probing world opinion regarding its embarkation on a "new militaristic path." It cited Japan's dispatches of forces abroad for United Nations peacekeeping operations and minesweepers for operations in the Persian Gulf area as well as its participation in Rimpac exercises with the United States and other countries. The article apparently indicates the Chinese military leadership still harbors strong doubts about Japan's intentions despite the official pronouncements in Beijing and Tokyo of friendly relations.
