In the first part of his speech, he spoke about the results achieved by his government. In the second part, he expressed his view on his conflict with the president, whose speech of 9 March led the opposition to propose a vote of no-confidence in the government. Vladimir Meciar emphasized that the president had no constitutional right to control the government and initiate its dismissal. Vladimir Meciar proposed that either the controversy should be forgotten or the president should resign. One minute after [the president resigns], Meciar would resign as well. Meciar also said that, if no early parliamentary election were held by the end of June, a referendum would be carried out, as a result of which there might be 90 government deputies in a parliament with 150 seats. The prime minister offered alternative solutions to the situation: the government staying in power till the early elections or an agreement between the political parties or forming a coalition with the Party of Democratic Left [SDL]. He said that if the Cabinet is dismissed and a new government formed, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] would go into opposition and its ministers would not take part in the new government. Vladimir Meciar warned against the interruption to continuity should he be dismissed and expressed the belief that, after the elections, he would return to government.
