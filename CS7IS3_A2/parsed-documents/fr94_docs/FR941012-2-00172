Introduction This Long Range Plan is designed to orchestrate the use of funds allocated by Congress under Title IV for services to be provided to missing and exploited children and their families. OJJDP will use the Long Range Plan to establish a series of goals, strategies, and programs. In total, the Plan will help OJJDP set annual priorities, develop program goals and objectives, select applicants for award, and deliver technical assistance and training to the field. The Proposed Long Range Plan was developed by evaluating documents such as research reports, program publications, and working papers available from Title IV fund recipients that address issues related to Title IV. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) provided the results of two focus groups involving parents and law enforcement personnel who have been involved in family abduction cases reported to NCMEC. Two work sessions were held involving a multi-disciplinary group of attendees who were asked to identify critical issues that should be addressed by a Title IV Long Range Plan. Those sessions included Title IV grantees as well as representatives from other Federal agencies who deal with programs and services related to missing and exploited children. Input gathered through these work sessions was given great weight in developing the plan. Nature of the Problem Much has been written by practitioners and researchers regarding the three major problem areas addressed by Title IV: family abductions; non-family abductions; and child exploitation. The Long Range Plan takes into account current knowledge about these three major categories of child victimization and the impact these events have on children and families. The statistics and analysis on the following pages were obtained from the 1990 National Incidence Study of Missing, Abducted, Runaway and Thrownaway Children in America (NISMART). Family Abduction There are an estimated 354,100 family abductions a year. Forty-six percent of these (an estimated 163,200 abductions) involve concealment of the child, transporting the child out of state, or an intent by the abductor to keep the child indefinitely or to permanently alter custody. Of this more serious category of abductions, a little over half are perpetrated by men, noncustodial fathers and father figures. Most victims are children from ages 2 to 11. Half involve unauthorized takings while half involve failures to return the child after an authorized visit or stay. Fifteen percent of these abductions involve the use of force or violence and 75 to 85 percent involve interstate transportation of the child. About half of family abductions occur before the marital relationship ends. Another 41 percent did not occur until two or more years after a divorce or separation, usually after parents develop new households, move away, develop new relationships, or become disenchanted with the legal system. Over half occur in the context of relationships with a history of domestic violence. An estimated 49 percent of abductors have criminal records. A significant number have a history of violent behavior, substance abuse, or emotional disturbance.
