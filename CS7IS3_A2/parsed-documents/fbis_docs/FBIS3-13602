High-level diplomatic sources told INA that French Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee met with the nonaligned states' ambassadors at the UN Security Council yesterday afternoon and discussed with them the UN Security Council's relations with Iraq. He told the ambassadors: Yes, Ekeus is a gentle, diplomatic, and diligent person, but, frankly speaking, I say to you that Ekeus must be changed as the Special Commission chairman because his actions depend on one viewpoint, which is the U.S. viewpoint, without taking into consideration the viewpoints of the other states at the UN Security Council. The INA correspondent has verified the French Ambassador's remarks from other diplomatic sources that took part in yesterday's meeting.
