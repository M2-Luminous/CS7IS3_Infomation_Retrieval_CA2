In a telephone conversation with our newsdesk correspondent Suhayl Khuri, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs, who is taking part in these meetings, spoke about the results of this session: [Begin recording] [Khuri] Good evening Your Excellency. [Al-Hasan] Good evening. [Khuri] What results did you achieve during the meetings of the Arab League Ministerial Council in Cairo? [Al-Hasan] During the four meetings held yesterday and today, the Arab League Council discussed a number of important issues and reviewed the agenda items. Foremost of these issues were the Palestinian cause and developments in the peace process. Moreover, the ministers discussed the horrific Israeli crime perpetrated in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in the middle of the holy month of Ramadan and its following coercive measures against the defenseless Palestinian citizens. At the council, I explained His Majesty King Husayn's immediate efforts in the wake of this crime and the Jordanian Government's measures and contacts. Through these measures and contacts, the Jordanian Government expressed its clear condemnation of this crime, held Israel fully responsible, demanded that the international community shoulder its responsibilities and force Israel to provide necessary international protection for the Palestinian people, and stressed that racist settlement building and settlements must be removed as they represent an obstacle to peace. The council also reviewed developments in the peace process and the resolutions we adopted in the past to support this process since it is a strategic Arab choice to solve the Arab-Israeli conflict. The council discussed joint Arab action. It decided to postpone making decisions on the issue of pan-Arab security. Jordan had presented a detailed study on this issue during the council's previous session proceeding from Jordan's concern about this issue and since it is considered a priority issue. The council also decided to postpone the issue of amending the Arab League's charter because it is closely linked to the issue of pan-Arab security. [Khuri] When do you expect the Ministerial Council to end its discussion of the agenda items and issue a final statement? [Al-Hasan] Of course, the council will hold a meeting in a short while to review all the decisions after the committees have ended their meetings. The council will hold a general session to review all these decisions. [Khuri] Your Excellency: How do you assess the atmosphere of the Ministerial Council's meetings? [Al-Hasan] I can say that this meeting was positive. [Khuri] Thank you Your Excellency. [Al-Hasan] You are welcome. [end recording]
