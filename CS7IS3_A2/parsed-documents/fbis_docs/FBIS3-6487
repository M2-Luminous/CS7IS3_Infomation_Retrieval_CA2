The "Youth Science and Technology March" is a mass movement of young people to rapidly develop the country's science and technology by accelerating the technical revolution. Starting in 1989, the movement set it as its goal to guide each young man and woman to acquire one or more kind of scientific knowledge and technique, elevate his or her level of technique and skill to a higher grade and realise at least one invention or one innovation and rationalization proposal. Young people at industrial establishments and scientific research institutions across the country have developed and introduced more than 100,000 inventions and innovation proposals in the past five years, greatly contributing to the economic development of the country and the improvement of people's livelihood. The technical innovation youth shock brigade and the automation youth shock brigade play a very big part in the movement. More than 2,850 technical innovation youth shock brigades and 850 automation youth shock brigades are active in the country involving tens of thousands of young people. Nearly 10,000 new technological successes are annually introduced by them. Production and technical processes have been further modernized and much workforce, materials and fund have been saved thanks to their contributions. The vigorous movement has produced a great many engineers, assistant engineers and experts and more than 3,000 inventors.
