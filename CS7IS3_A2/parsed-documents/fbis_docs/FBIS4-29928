The Indonesian government yesterday banned TEMPO, the country's leading news magazine, and the popular publications DETIC and EDITOR. Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, said that the prime minister, Paul Keating, would go ahead with his visit to Indonesia next week despite a call that the trip be cancelled. Senator Evans told parliament Mr. Keating would choose how he conveyed Australia's concerns during his talks with President Suharto and senior Indonesian ministers. [Begin Evans recording] It must be said without qualification that this is a very disappointing development indeed. In recent times with the support or acceptance of this government Indonesia has been making very rapid progress to a genuinely free and open expression through a free media, reflecting in that respect the rapidly growing openness which has been developing in the country's economy and society more generally. Yesterday's decision is in sharp contrast to that trend so far as the media is concerned. We hope that it doesn't signal any wider ranging impositions and that the magazines will, sooner rather than later, be permitted to resume publication. [end recording]
