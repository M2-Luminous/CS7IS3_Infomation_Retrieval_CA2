A total of 274 lawmakers voted for creating such a body, 46 voted against, and 20 abstained from voting. The motion was put forward by Sergey Baburin, the leader of the "Russian Way" Duma faction and chairman of the All-Russia National Union. In backing up his proposal, Baburin stressed that the Duma had neglected "its moral duties to those who died," and until the circumstances of the events in Moscow last October are properly investigated, "the blood will be not only on the government but on the State Duma as well." Russia's Choice member Gleb Yakunin argued that since a formal investigation was under way, the motion on a parliamentary commission should be postponed until the end of the inquiry. Stanislav Govorukhin (the Democratic Party) noted that since the events were being investigated as a crime, it is hardly possible to assess "the scale of the tragedy, and the political motives and circumstances that led to the dissolution of parliament in October 1993."
