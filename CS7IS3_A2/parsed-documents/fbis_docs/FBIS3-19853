The year 1994 must become "a year of consolidation" for the Wiesbaden police authority, BKA President Hans-Ludwig Zachert said in an interview with DIE WELT, formulating the strategic targets for the next few months. "The view is directed forward." Zachert is firmly convinced that the planned new organization of the BKA's command structure, including the trimming of the department echelons, will have a positive effect. On the basis of this restructuring, the president is to get three main departmental heads as a leading team at his side. The current 12 departments are being reduced to nine so that one main departmental head always heads three sections. In this connection, the BKA chief categorically rejects the impression that these organizational changes are effectively aimed at "depriving" the president "of power." Such claims in public are completely unfounded. After talks with FRG Interior Minister Manfred Kanther it is clear: "The BKA president retains his full power of direction. The ultimate responsibility rests exclusively with him. And anyone who has this responsibility also has the final say; this was also stressed by Minister Kanther in this way." According to Zachert, the BKA's internal consolidation phase must be supplemented by having the federal authorities "move closer toward each other." This is particularly necessary regarding the Federal Intelligence Office. Here there will have to be far more intensive forms of cooperation on a new legal basis, in particular in the fields of combating drug trafficking and international terrorism. As a "very personal concern" Zachert cited the further expansion of the "traditionally good relationship" with the chief federal prosecutor. The first contacts with the new chief federal prosecutor, Kay Nehm, in Karlsruhe were "extremely positive." Zachert and Nehm have known each other for years. In Zachert's view, the necessary consolidation in the BKA also includes efforts in investigations against left-wing terrorism that "are not just intensified when there have been attacks." Much rather, it is necessary to act anticyclically, showing intensified vigilance in particular when there have not been any attacks for a long time. Furthermore, Zachert thinks it is a "signal" that the Antiterrorism Department, which has so far been located in Wiesbaden, will be transferred to the state protection authority in Meckenheim. The BKA chief hopes that this will lead to an increase in the efficiency of work and a more flexible use of personnel. In the parent office in Wiesbaden the free capacities will be used for intensifying the fight against organized crime, the highest-ranking German policeman announced. Zachert said that it is "deplorable" for the intended consolidation period of his authority that the new BKA law can obviously not be passed by the end of this legislative period. Therefore, new regulations concerning preliminary investigations, the protection of witnesses, and the internationally organized fight against terrorism unfortunately cannot yet develop the hoped-for "positive feedback effects on the new organization."
