Brothers and sisters in unionist Aden: The army of unity, democracy, and constitutional legality now stands poised at the approaches of the patient Aden to rid you of this tyrannical coterie in the Socialist Party leadership and cleanse it of the squalor of this mutinous gang that has been fiddling with the city and its population, violating sacred values, appropriating your freedom and rights, nationalizing your property, and authorizing the shedding of the blood of your fathers, brothers, and sisters. To the worthy population of the proud city of Aden: Be the red-hot spears of unity, democracy, and constitutional legality that pierce the chests of the traitors, agents, and plotters of the gang of apostasy and secession. Reach out to your brothers and sons in the forces of unity and democracy and constitutional legality, who are coming to you in response to your unionist and patriotic appeal to be saved from this murderous gang that has spread corruption and played havoc with the land and people and hatched plots against your unity, security, stability, and freedom that was restored to you by the young unitary state on 22 May, 1990, after you had been denied them for the 27-year duration of the rule of this rotten gang that can only live in a quagmire of repression, terror, agentry, conspiracy, sacrilege, disregard for women's honor, and looting and confiscating property. Brother officers and soldiers of the military in our precious city of Aden: In unity lies your dignity, freedom, and salvation from the cycle of revolutionary violence. Be the first ranks of the soldiers of unity and democracy and constitutional legality. Pound the strongholds of the murderous gang in the city of Aden, and reduce them to rubble, because this battle is your battle, this is your hour, and time is on your side. Do not believe the ravings and hallucinations that the gang of apostasy and secession has been spewing from Aden radio since it took office 27 years ago. Brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers, sons and daughters in our beloved Aden: The forces of unity, democracy, and constitutional legality are jealous of your women's honor, your blood, freedom, property, security, and stability, and dignity. You are called upon to be the best support and guide for these forces. Act as their seeing eye and their hand that hits the remnants of the gang of apostasy and secession. Disgrace to the forces of apostasy and secession; victory and glory to the homeland, unity, and constitutional legality.
