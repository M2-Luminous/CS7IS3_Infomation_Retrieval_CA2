FR940722-1-00061 FR940722-1-00012 (c) During the landing distance determination required by §23.75, the pressure on the wheel braking system must not exceed the pressure specified by the brake manufacturer. * * * * * (e) In addition, for commuter category airplanes, the rejected takeoff brake kinetic energy capacity rating of each main wheel brake assembly must not be less than the kinetic energy absorption requirements determined under either of the following methods_ (1) The brake kinetic energy absorption requirements must be based on a conservative rational analysis of the sequence of events expected during a rejected takeoff at the design takeoff weight. (2) Instead of a rational analysis, the kinetic energy absorption requirements for each main wheel brake assembly may be derived from the following formula_ KE=0.0443 WV2/N where, KE=Kinetic energy per wheel (ft.-lbs.); W=Design takeoff weight (lbs.); V=Ground speed associated with the maximum value of V 1 selected in accordance with §23.51(c)(1); N=Number of main wheels with brakes. 10. A new §23.745 is added to read as follows: §23.745 Nose/tail wheel steering. (a) If nose/tail wheel steering is installed, it must be demonstrated that its use does not require exceptional pilot skill during takeoff and landing, in crosswinds and in the event of an engine failure; or its use must be limited to low speed maneuvering. (b) Movement of the pilot's steering control must not interfere with the retraction or extension of the landing gear. 11. Section 23.775 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (c), by redesignating paragraph (d) as (e) and paragraph (e) as (d), by revising the newly designated paragraph (e), and by adding a new paragraph (h) to read as follows: §23.775 Windshields and windows. (a) The internal panels of windshields and windows must be constructed of a nonsplintering material, such as nonsplintering safety glass. * * * * * (c) On pressurized airplanes, if certification for operation up to and including 25,000 feet is requested, an enclosure canopy including a representative part of the installation must be subjected to special tests to account for the combined effects of continuous and cyclic pressurization loadings and flight loads, or compliance with the fail-safe requirements of paragraph (d) of this section must be shown. * * * * * (e) The windshield and side windows forward of the pilot's back when the pilot is seated in the normal flight position must have a luminous transmittance value of not less than 70 percent. * * * * * (h) In addition, for commuter category airplanes, the following applies: (1) Windshield panes directly in front of the pilots in the normal conduct of their duties, and the supporting structures for these panes must withstand, without penetration, the impact of a two-pound bird when the velocity of the airplane (relative to the bird along the airplane's flight path) is equal to the airplane's maximum approach flap speed. (2) The windshield panels in front of the pilots must be arranged so that, assuming the loss of vision through any one panel, one or more panels remain available for use by a pilot seated at a pilot station to permit continued safe flight and landing. 12. Section 23.783 is amended by revising paragraph (b) and by adding a new paragraph (g) to read as follows: §23.783 Doors. * * * * * (b) Passenger doors must not be located with respect to any propeller disk or any other potential hazard so as to endanger persons using that door. * * * * * (g) If lavatory doors are installed, they must be designed to preclude an occupant from becoming trapped inside the lavatory. If a locking mechanism is installed, it must be capable of being unlocked from outside of the lavatory.
