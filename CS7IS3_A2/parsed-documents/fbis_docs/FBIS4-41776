Does this mean that currently you do not test new military equipment? In general, where do you buy weapons, technology, uniforms, fuel, spare parts, and foodstuffs? [Kazlowski] I like your question. You should have asked the same question to some of our deputies who blame all sins on our Army. Yes, earlier the Armed Forces were centrally supplied. The BVO was considered the best in the USSR. Moscow supplied us with everything. Currently, the situation has changed. The rigid system of centralized supply does not work. We have to seek bilateral agreements with Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and other states to maintain the Army's combat readiness. Again, we experience difficulties with funds. I wish that the state would provide us with sufficient resources to fulfill our needs. However, alas! We have to trade, even though we are severely criticized for conducting such activities. Sometimes, this criticism is justified. You must agree with me that trade is not a top priority activity in the Army. [Mirgorodskiy] The banner of the unit is sacred to all servicemen. Its loss is considered a great shame. What about our old banners? Will you abandon them or exchange them for "white-red- white" banners? [Kazlowski] We have filed a petition with the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet to keep the old combat banners, medals, and unit names. This is our history, our memories. There has still been no final decision on this issue. The proposal regarding the national banner of the Belarusian Armed Forces with its accompanying attributes is under consideration. In our opinion, two banners -- old and new -- should be used side-by-side in the ranks. [Mirgorodskiy] Could we imagine an enemy attacking our state? Will the Belarusian Army be able to protect us? [Kazlowski] Our troops are in a state of combat readiness. This is unquestionable. The point is in something else. Can the Belarusian Army alone repulse a potential enemy? Everything depends on the scope of the conflict. The Army will fight, however, it is better to fight alongside some other friendly states. At least, this is more reliable. [Mirgorodskiy] How much money will the Defense Ministry receive this year? [Kazlowski] Some 4 percent of the overall state budget. This is only enough to keep the Army afloat. By the way, the Russian Armed Forces receive 20 percent of the state budget. [Mirgorodskiy] According to you, we are short of military hardware. However, judging by recently published complimentary articles, we are successfully dismantling tanks, planes, and missiles. This is not logical... [Kazlowski] This is logical if common sense is at all characteristic of our society. We are implementing the international agreements. However, we have the right to use some of the equipment -- subject to dismantlement -- as exhibits. This is our sore point. Still, there is practically no one who wants to buy vehicles which have been converted to civilian use. In addition, we can sell only a specified number of tanks while the remaining tanks must be dismantled. [Mirgorodskiy] How do you use the metal? [Kazlowski] It is further smelted in Zhlobin.... [Mirgorodskiy] Pavel Pavlovich, how do Belarusian servicemen react to the use of the Belarusian language, which is being currently introduced in the Army? It would be interesting to hear how military orders sound in Belarusian. [Kazlowski] The reactions of privates and officers to this issue are different. However, the people understand the importance of this novelty and do not express added emotions. The language is being taught and we do not want to accelerate this process. Everything should be done thoroughly. However, graduates of our military colleges must speak fluent Belarusian. [Mirgorodskiy] We spoke about the shortage of fuel and lubricants, spare parts, and ammunition. What about military training? Have you cut down on this program? [Kazlowski] This is a separate question in itself. Military training is being fulfilled according to a program. We use various types of training equipment, including equipment produced at Belarusian factories. We only try to restrict the redeployment of troops. [Mirgorodskiy] Belarus does not train officers in all disciplines. Where does the Defense Ministry recruit experts? [Kazlowski] We are short some 1,500 officers. A national Academy is being established and some colleges are being respecialized. In addition, we provide for the training of experts abroad. One month of training abroad costs us between $300 and $500. Is this expensive? Of course. We exchange students with some states, however, so this eases the problem. Currently, the cadets who entered our military colleges in the time of the USSR are completing their education. Very few of them, however, are eager to perform their service in Belarus because the monetary allowance of an officer in Russia is twice as high as that in Belarus. By the way, the allowance of a Belarusian private is half the current minimum wage. [Mirgorodskiy] What is the price of a cartridge for a Kalashnikov assault rifle? [Kazlowski] The cost of one artillery round -- depending on the type of shell -- is between $100 and $600. A cartridge for a Kalashnikov assault rifle costs $0.25. So, you can calculate and compare. [Mirgorodskiy] We cannot raise all issues in one interview. Still, we are worried about the hazing of conscripts in our Army. It would seem that only Belarusian youth are in active service but this shameful phenomenon does not disappear. [Kazlowski] Yes, to my regret. Groups representing various regions -- "Vitebsk," "Grodno," "Minsk," "Gomel," and others -- have been established. Yes, we have conflicts. Please, understand me: The Army is not separated from the state and all our conflicts are reflected in the Army. We are fighting against legal violations in the Army. However, can the Army reeducate a person, can it break him of his harmful habits? It is no secret that up to 30 percent of our conscripts have a criminal record. They are the ones who initiate the hazing of conscripts. I would like to stress that whatever we used to say about our former political instructors in the Army, their work produced definite results. It happens that commanders cannot fulfill the functions of instructors. They cannot become fathers to privates.... [Mirgorodskiy] The last question is not very pleasant. At the coordinating meeting of leaders of law enforcement agencies dealing with the fight against crime and corruption, the Defense Ministry faced criticism from the prime minister. For example, you were criticized for not participating in the strengthening of public order. What can you say about this? [Kazlowski] Currently, some 170 servicemen are patrolling the streets of Minsk. They have taken some 800 people into custody. I would like to know what became of these people later.... In addition, the attitude of some militiamen to us is different. It is up to experts to define how many servicemen are required to patrol the streets. Minsk may require more, while Mogilev or Bobruysk -- fewer.
