The 10-point proposal in the runup to the NATO summit at the beginning of next year is based on preventive strategies. In view of the ``cooperative approach,'' coercive measures are only conceivable as a ``last resort'' and with the approval of the United Nations. The foreign minister's initiative is seen in connection with U.S. plans to develop new weapons that can be used to intervene against ``irresponsible states'' or terrorist groups. The Europeans have so far only shown little interest in participating in such a concept. The Foreign Ministry announced that the U.S. considerations start where the those of the Germans end. Thus, there it does not see such a big contradiction. Kinkel stressed that the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons represents one of the biggest dangers for world peace after the end of the East-West conflict. North Korea's refusal to allow inspections threatens peace in the entire region. In Ukraine, a new de-facto nuclear state might also develop. According to recent findings, up to 20 states are currently developing nuclear carrier systems, and 10 are developing chemical weapons. Kinkel pleaded in favor of a global agreement on the nonproliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. The existing treaty should be extended indefinitely. International coordination should be aimed at first freezing the potentials of states that are suspected of spreading weapons. The CSCE was recommended as a model of regional nonproliferation policies. Other points are stronger export controls, with particular emphasis on the new supplying countries in the Third World, and much higher funds for the destruction of weapons of mass destruction. Kinkel also suggested an international plutonium control system, a nuclear weapons register with the United Nations, and a comprehensive agreement on a nuclear test stoppage. Whereas the United States wants to achieve a deterring effect with specific intervention threats, Kinkel's initiative is designed to integrate possible adventurers and to exert preventive pressure on them.
