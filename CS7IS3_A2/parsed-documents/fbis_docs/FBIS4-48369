The workers are also demanding the abrogation of a law adopted by the National Assembly regulating the right to strike. Civil servants have already launched two strikes, from 12 to 14 April, and from 10 to 12 May for the same reasons. On 16 April, government authorities decided on a 5- to 12-percent increase, adding that they would not offer any more. "Workers are determined to multiply strikes to obtain complete satisfaction for their demands," Ibrahim Mayaki, the secretary general of the Federation of Labor Unions of Niger. Despite troubles due to sporadic power cuts, banks and business were operating normally this morning in Niamey and airport traffic was normal.
