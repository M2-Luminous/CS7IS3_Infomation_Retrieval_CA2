Famine and insecurity are making the lives of people hell and they are trying to leave the city of Malange at all costs. Malange Provincial Governor Flavio Fernandes has described the situation in the following manner: [Begin recording] [Fernandes] The political and military situation continues to be very serious in this province. The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] has increased its operations against the people. It has been mining paths which access farming areas and it has been abducting and ambushing people. Furthermore, UNITA has also carried out several raids on strategic parts of the city to destroy infrastructure. We can say that we have practically not had a single day without fighting. To us, therefore, the situation continues to be very serious and we are doing everything in our power to change it. [Unidentified reporter] Could you comment on social conditions here? [Fernandes] Well, the people continue to experience a very serious situation. We are going through a time of serious famine. You, the correspondents, who have taken the care to visit the distribution centers, know we are experiencing high levels of serious malnutrition, running at about 34.5 percent. [sentence as heard] These days, and in our modern world, such figures are inadmissible. [Reporter] Are there any plans to turn the problem around and ensure that people do not have to survive on aid grants? [Fernandes] Yes. In addition to the work that we are doing with nongovernmental organizations and the international community, we are working with UNICEF and plans were recently approved concerning an estimated $2 million in aid for children. We are also preparing our proposals, which will obviously be included in the government's plan of action. [Reporter] While that does not happen, though, people will have to continue living on humanitarian aid? [Fernandes] Unfortunately, that is the case. I must tell you frankly that we have had very little support from the central government so far. Basically, we are surviving on international aid. [end recording] [passage omitted]
