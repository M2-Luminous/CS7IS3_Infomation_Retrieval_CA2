Threatening trade sanctions against Japan for a transgression of dubious validity, namely, failing to ensure that a U.S. company, Motorola, won a certain quantitative share of the Tokyo cellular phone market is bad enough. To also say, as Mr. Clinton did, that yes, sanctions could trigger a trade war but the United States is "willing to take that risk" borders on recklessness and irresponsibility. Already, stock and currency markets in Asia are reeling. They have nothing whatsoever to do with the U.S.-Japan trade spat. And there are consumers and producers, buyers and sellers, and traders and investors all over our economically interdependent world who would be hit. It is tragic and hugely unfair that their fortunes should be buffeted by willful economic saber-rattling. The operative word here is willful. According to a NEW YORK TIMES report, the administration's strategy is to create uncertainty and anxiety in Japan so as to drive up the value of the yen and thus pressure the Japanese to return to the bargaining table on American terms. If true, this suggests a cynicism that is misguided and dangerous. It is misguided because, first, a sudden and unexpected appreciation of the yen without consultation with Japan would undermine the effects of the economic stimulus package which the United States Government lobbied for and the Japanese Government worked so hard to deliver. A prolonged Japanese recession is the last thing U.S. producers need if they want to sell more to Japanese consumers. Second, a yen appreciation would indeed raise Japan's export prices and blunt it competitiveness. But there is a downside: Japanese-made parts and components which account for a large proportion of Japan's exports to the United States would also be more expensive. This would undermine the competitiveness of many U.S. industries. Third, even if a stronger yen were a great idea, there is not much sense talking the currency up without any mechanism to keep it there. The administration's strategy is therefore at best, a short-term gamble. And like many gambles,it could be dangerous. Far from forcing the Japanese to dance to an American tune, it could inflame nationalistic sentiment in Japan and stiffen resolve to resist U.S. pressure. If the conflict then escalates, the Japanese could even be tempted into retaliatory action -- and they are not short of options. For now, good sense seems to have prevailed in Tokyo. Japan has shown no signs of upping the ante. On the contrary, it has said it will take unilateral steps to open its markets -- which it must do, because there is truth in much of what the United States is complaining about. But Japan has done the responsible thing by saying it will take its case to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This is, after all, the rightful place to settle disputes of this sort -- disputes that may be bilateral in origin but are in today's world, multilateral in their effects. It is to the Clinton administration's discredit that despite having just recently signed the Uruguay Round, it has chosen to disregard it totally.
