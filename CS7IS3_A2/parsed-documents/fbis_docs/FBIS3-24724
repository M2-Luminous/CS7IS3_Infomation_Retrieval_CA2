Addressing a rightwing gathering in Pretoria, Gen Viljoen said such a decision, however, would have to be accompanied by the greatest degree of responsibility as it would have far-reaching implications for South Africa. The assembly earlier adopted a resolution insisting on the Afrikaner's right to self-rule in his own territory and that all methods--including what was termed the "minimal use of violence"--should be pursued as a last resort to attain this ideal.
