The expectation is that it will become an accelerating element of the entire transformation and restructuring process in Slovakia. Although the government discussed this report of the Ministry of Privatization, the precise amount of state properties destined for voucher privatization is not yet known. The Minister for the Management and Privatization of the Slovak Republic [SR] National Property, Milan Janicina, set the target too high, and, in the list of enterprises to be sold for vouchers, he included assets in the face value of 170 billion Slovak korunas [Sk]. At the same time, he himself expects that the offer will include properties in the value of Sk80-100 billion. The definite number will become known only after a register of shares is worked out with the founding ministries and after an agreement is reached with the SR National Property Fund [FNM], which administers stock in the value of Sk20 billion, which can also be offered to the citizens for their vouchers. The application of the voucher method, for which the know-how of Czecho-Slovak--and therefore also Slovak--economists is being put to use, has its advantages as well as disadvantages. Among the disadvantages of the voucher method can be mentioned especially the subsequent unavoidable concentration of economic power of key owners in individual companies and the laborious process of acquiring the means for investments. If it is the objective of the state to also contribute money for privatization, then the voucher privatization brings another disadvantage--it will not fill the FNM coffers. In the current state of crisis in the Slovak economy, when many state enterprises are on the brink of collapse, privatization (even by means of bankruptcies) appears as the only solution that will achieve long-term rectification. The oppressive global economic climate in which independent Slovakia found itself, and almost two years of marking time without any concept about what to do (not only) in privatization, is dragging into bankruptcy even many promising private enterprises. Privatization is inevitable because, as has been true from time immemorial, people value and improve only private property. The voucher method today is seen as an inevitability. There are three reasons for that. First of all, its advantages outweigh its disadvantages: voucher privatization is relatively quick, clear-cut, just, and undemanding of domestic credit resources. It makes it possible to avoid putting a financial burden on the new owner, who, when a standard method is used, must pay for the purchase of the privatized property. For a broad application of the standard methods--direct sales, public competitions, and auctions--there is simply not enough domestic credit, interest from abroad, and, unltimately, even time. The second reason is the necessity of introducing a firm and conceptual approach into the transformation process. The Ministry of Privatization as well as the other ministries, when approving plans for the second wave of voucher privatization, will finally be faced with having to make a decision on how to privatize the Slovak state enterprises. It does not mean that all of their assets will be sold for vouchers. In each individual case, as M. Janicina emphasizes, individual decisions will be made, which will often call for the use of the standard methods as well. The important thing is that, after two years of unjustifiable foot-dragging, such decisions will finally be made. That will at the same time solve the problem of strategic interest of the state in individual branches of the economy, when the highest executive power will have to define what is the intended permanent share of the state in the assets of selected enterprises. That will indirectly force the government to define the economic orientation of Slovakia in future years. The third, no less important, reason for using the voucher method is to generate public confidence in the transformation process. If the citizen has the possibility of sharing in the privatization, he will get the justified feeling that the state is treating him fairly. In addition, he will also gain materially. And social peace is one of the few favorable entry elements on which the macroeconomists and politicians in Slovakia can count. [Box, p 2] Voucher privatization today appears to be inevitable. There are three reasons: 1. For direct sales, public competions, and auctions there is not enough domestic credit, interest from abroad, or time. 2. Transformation requires a resolute and conceptual approach. 3. The voucher method will instill in the citizens confidence in the transformation process.
