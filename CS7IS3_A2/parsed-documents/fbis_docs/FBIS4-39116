About 70 voters attended the meeting, which was addressed by Akaki Asatiani, chairman of the Traditionalists' Union. He used offensive terms when referring to the policy of the present government, to Eduard Shevardnadze, and to rayon police employees, whom he called traitors because they served the authorities. This prompted a negative reaction from participants in the meeting. A large proportion of them left the building in protest following a heated argument and oral exchange. After a short while, a group of outraged citizens moved toward the building while the visitors were still there. In order to avoid a serious incident, the police fired several warning shots in the air. The chairman of the Traditionalists' Union and union members were forced to leave the building and then the rayon. Criminal proceedings have been instituted in connection with the incident. An investigation is under way.
