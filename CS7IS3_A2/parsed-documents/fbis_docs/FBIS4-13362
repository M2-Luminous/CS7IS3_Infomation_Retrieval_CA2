It was a tragic accident that the Kurdish people deeply and bitterly regret. The two helicopters were carrying UN officials and military personnel from the international protection force that was set up by the United Nations for the Kurdish people. The U.S. President was deeply distressed when he announced the tragedy to the American people and all other nations. The Kurdish people's distress is deeper because it has lost a group of friends who came from every corner of the earth to give it relief, help it live in peace, and also help in rebuilding liberated Kurdistan. The Kurdish people do not want their friends to die on Kurdistan's soil or in allied and friendly planes that fly over Kurdistan. How splendid it was when the U.S. President said that these men were performing their duty of providing protection for the Kurdish people and died while performing this duty. The incident has military and strategic significance too. Regardless of the confusion or technical error that showed the two helicopters on the two fighter planes' radar screens as hostile targets -- and investigations will of course reveal the cause of this technical error -- the incident has an extremely important strategic significance; namely, that it is an unambiguous signal to the ruling dictatorship in Baghdad confirming that the international protection force is always vigilant and actively present and that any hostile move against the Kurdish people, territories, and air space will be immediately crushed. The international protection force operating in Kurdistan has firm and clear orders to abort any hostile adventure that the regime of death and crime might think of mounting against the Kurdish people. We have the right to regard these courageous men, the victims of humanitarian duty, as martyrs of the peaceful Kurdish people who are faithful to their friends. How nice it would be if the Kurdistan region's government and parliament were to issue a resolution to this effect. How nice it would be if the Kurdish parties were to lower their flags in mourning. How nice it would be if we were to erect a monument for them and for all our friends and allies who had been killed and martyred, a monument that would immortalize them and would be an expression of gratitude and a memorial to friendship between man and his brother.
