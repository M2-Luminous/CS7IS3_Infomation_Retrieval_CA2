The U.N. Security Council imposed comrehensive and mandatory sanctions on Yugoslavia in May 1992 for the country's alleged involvement in civil war raging among the local Moslems, Serbs and Croats in the neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of the 45.117 billion dollars, the loss to the national product accounted for 38.136 billion dollars, lost net earnings from the abroad for 1.415 billion, lay-over compensation for 436 million, and humanitarian and economic assistance to the refugees and the Serb states in the breakaway Yugoslav republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, for a further 5.130 billion dollars, the centre's officials said at a press conference. The figure does not include losses incurred through a halted scientific and technological development and a brain-drain, explained the centre's director Misa Jandric, assistant minister for science and development. Furthermore, incalculable damage has been done to Yugoslavia's reputation in the world and in international fora and to the health, education and culture of the population, which have been brought down to an alarmingly low level, said Jandric. Should the sanctions remain in place, Yugoslavia stands to lose 147.33 billion dollars by the year 2011, the centre estimates. A study prepared by the centre indicates that Yugoslavia cannot hope to regain the level of economic activity recorded in 1990 before the year 2012, which brings with itself the threat of a slowed development of its neighbors and of Europe as a whole. In 1990, Yugoslavia's gross national product stood at 26.6 billion dollars, to dwindle down to barely 12.57 billion dollars in 1993.
