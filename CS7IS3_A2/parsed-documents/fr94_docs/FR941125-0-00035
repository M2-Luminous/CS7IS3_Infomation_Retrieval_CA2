FR941125-0-00035 FR941125-0-00016 The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by these species in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list Eugenia haematocarpa and Pleodendron macranthum as endangered. Eugenia haematocarpa and Pleodendron macranthum both occur at only a few localities and there are fewer than 75 individuals of each species. Due to their low numbers and limited distribution, any adverse impact is likely to have a serious effect on their survival. The precarious status of Eugenia haematocarpa and Pleodendron macranthum makes extinction a distinct possibility and warrants their classification as endangered species. The reasons for not proposing critical habitat for these species are discussed below in the ``Critical habitat'' section. Critical Habitat Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary propose critical habitat at the time the species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Service's regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)(1)) state that designation of critical habitat is not prudent when one or both of the following situations exists: (i) The species is threatened by taking or other human activity, and identification of habitat can be expected to increase the degree of such threat to the species, or (ii) Such designation of critical habitat would not be beneficial to the species. Designation of critical habitat for the species would not be prudent for both reasons. The number of individuals of Eugenia haematocarpa and Pleodendron macranthum is sufficiently small that vandalism and collection could seriously affect the survival of the species. Publication of critical habitat descriptions and maps in the Federal Register would increase the likelihood of such activities, which are difficult to enforce against and only partially regulated by the Act. Additionally, no Federal activity is anticipated as being likely to affect these species except possibly on U.S. Forest Service lands and lands owned by the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy. Critical habitat also would not provide additional protection for the species under section 7 of the Act. Regulations promulgated for the implementation of section 7 provide for both a ``jeopardy'' standard and a ``destruction or adverse modification'' of critical habitat standard. In the case of E. haematocarpa and P. macranthum , the only known suitable habitat is where these species currently occur. Because of the highly limited distribution of the species, any Federal action that would destroy or have any significant adverse effect on their habitat would likely result in a jeopardy biological opinion under section 7. Under these conditions, no additional benefits would accrue from designation of critical habitat that would not be available through listing alone. The Service believes that any Federal involvement in the areas where these plants occur can be identified without the designation of critical habitat. All involved parties and landowners have been notified of the location and importance of protecting these species' habitats. Should Federal involvement occur, habitat protection will be addressed through the section 7 consultation process, utilizing the jeopardy standard. Available Conservation Measures Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, Commonwealth, and private agencies, groups and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the Commonwealth, and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. No critical habitat is being proposed for these three species, as discussed above. Federal involvement is anticipated for populations of Eugenia haematocarpa and Pleodendron macranthum located in the Caribbean National Forest. The Act and its implementing regulations set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered plants. All prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export any threatened or endangered plant, transport it in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer it for sale in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduce the species to possession from areas under Federal jurisdiction. Seeds from cultivated specimens of threatened plant species are exempt from these prohibitions provided that a statement of ``cultivated origin'' appears on their containers. In addition, for endangered plants, the 1988 amendments (Public Law 100&hyph;478) to the Act prohibit the malicious damage or destruction on Federal lands and the removal, cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying of endangered plants in knowing violation of any Commonwealth law or regulation, including Commonwealth criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions to the prohibitions apply to agents of the Service and the Commonwealth conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63, also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered plants under certain circumstances. It is anticipated that few permits for these species will ever be sought or issued, since the species are not known to be in cultivation for commercial trade and are uncommon in the wild.
