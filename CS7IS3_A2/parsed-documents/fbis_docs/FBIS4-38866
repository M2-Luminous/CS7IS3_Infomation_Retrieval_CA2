Chairman of the Chamber's Budget Committee Nikolay Gonchar told ITAR-TASS during the break that the mps would spend as much time on this problem as necessary. "This is the main item on today's agenda," he added. Gonchar explained that the deliberations were held behind closed doors because the chamber was discussing defence allocations. "The search for compromises is proceeding against the background of a very keen debate, because everybody is short of money," he stated. The mps plan to offer the state duma, which approved the draft budget in first reading, to discuss anew several items in the spendings part of the draft. "Faced with the choice of whether to have good relations with the government or to uphold the interests of the state, the mps will definitely choose the latter," Gonchar believes. He stressed that "there is no factional or political struggle in the upper chamber, but merely a dispute over regional interests". "We are apparently faced with the need to redistribute the available means, and this is a very painful process," he added. Gonchar also said that his committee was backing the stand assumed by the chairman of the Duma Committee for Economic Affairs Sergey Glazyev, but several economic acts were needed to implement his proposals and this would take time.
