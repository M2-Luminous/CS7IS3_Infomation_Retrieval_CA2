The "bottom turning point" has been reached or perhaps already crossed, but 1994 will remain a "transitional year" in which output and sales will only grow by 2 percent in real terms. "Domestic business, the investment climate in Germany still remains the Achilles heel," said Jan Kleinewefers, president of the Association of German Machine-Building Enterprises (VDMA), speaking to the press in Frankfurt. One only expects negative trends in Germany to end in the second half of the year. Thus, domestic orders might increase by between 2 and 3 percent for the year as a whole, whereas foreign orders are to rise by about 10 percent. The expected increase in output and sales will come solely from abroad. In the case of exports, the VDMA expects a rise of 4 percent while domestic sales are expected to stagnate. The VDMA president bases his confidence in the worst already being behind us in the latest trends: Over the past few weeks, reports on trends from abroad have indicated a sustained improvement and negative trends in Germany have been declining slowly, but clearly. Engineering has suffered "from the erosion of its customers profits more than any other branch of industry." A net yield on manufacturing sales of currently less than 1 percent is not sufficient to stimulate investment, create new jobs, modernize the economy, and bolster the economy's competitiveness. In engineering, another 100,000 jobs will be lost in 1994, of which about 50,000 will be in western Germany. Since 1990, the number of employees in the old laender has declined by 250,000. Kleinewefers said he was pleased that with demand growing, German engineering industry products were still very much in demand internationally. Overseas export orders have been rising again for almost a year, but over the past few months "a shift in a positive direction" has also occurred in some West European countries. In 1993, output fell by 11 percent and sales by 9 percent (11 in real terms) to 209 (230) billion German marks [DM]. Thus, over the course of the three-year recession, this branch of industry has lost almost 20 percent of its production volume. Orders fell by 8 percent in real terms (domestic orders fell by 15 percent and foreign orders rose by 1 percent). Exports fell by 5 percent to DM110 (116) billion. With imports totalling DM59 (71) billion (a decline of 13 percent), the balance of trade surplus amounts to DM51 (45) billion, which is significantly higher than the total German balance of trade surplus of DM34 billion.
