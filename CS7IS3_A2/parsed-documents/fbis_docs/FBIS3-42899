The Reform Fund is directed by Academician Stanislav Shatalin and the department of economics of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences]. IEPP experts called the plans to improve the economic situation in the country with the help of the ideas set forth in the report "purely illusory." Specific proposals of the authors are frequently contradictory. Thus, a gigantic increase in state financial investments in the economy is being proposed and, simultaneously, a significant slowing down in inflation; the stimulation of labor activity is adjacent to progressive taxation; the fight against monopolism is right alongside the creation of huge concerns and financial-industrial groups. Concerning the main postulate of the academicians about the decisive role of the state in the transition to a market, specialists of Mr. Gaydar's institute ascertain "a departure not only from the level of economic science" in the period of reform, but "even from the world outlook of the most radical reformers of the 1960's." IEPP experts note the outright bias of the authors of the academic work. This is in reference to the indices of incomes and wages in October 1993 that are compared not with October 1991, but with December, when advance compensations were paid. If, however, the indices are compared correctly, then it turns out that they fell not by a factor of three, but by 30 percent, and the real incomes of the population were cut by 25 percent. Institute critics also do not agree with the theses of the report about the "breaking of the historically established structure of consumption of the population" and the "hyperintensity of the flow of the process of stratification of society"--they are either not confirmed by statistics or they are poorly reasoned. According to data of the Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics], in the last two years the share of outlays for food in consumer expenditures did not exceed 48 percent, while the report cites 60-70 percent. Regarding the "state regulation of the subsistence minimum" proposed by the academicians, the IEPP experts indicate that the question rests not on the methodology of measuring this "minimum," but on the financial capabilities of the treasury. But to the Gaydar experts the term "subsistence minimum" itself "evokes unpleasant associations with the notorious `assortment minimum' of the food stores of the epoch of the rayon organization for trade in food products, which "they preferred not to mention in the 10 prereform years." The idea of progressive taxation of incomes also did not meet understanding among Mr. Gaydar's employees, inasmuch as this would prompt their concealment, the development of a shadow economy, and the criminalization of life. As early as 1993, the level of unaccounted incomes, according to Goskomstat data, amounted to approximately 15 percent of what was officially taken into account. The section on regional and structural policy, in the opinion of the analysts of the institute, represents mainly a set of general propositions. This conclusion of the academicians is cited as typical: "The adoption of any kind of measures on the federal level is expedient only in the event that the implementation of the indicated measures can lead to a definite load on the regional budget." As for the structural policy that has been conducted up until now by the Russian Government, its shortcomings are, as the experts think, not a defect of the approach itself, but a consequence of the objective difficulty of changing the deformed structure of the national economy. The IEPP specialists also think that the proposals of the academicians on the regulation and establishment of fixed prices will also not stand up under criticism. The experience of 1989-1991 demonstrated that such attempts will lead "to an intensification of imbalance in all spheres of production and consumption." The experts are particularly put on guard by that place in the work of the Reform Fund where the stimulating role of price proportions and a rational correlation of prices are proclaimed. Besides the fact that the concept of "rational" is in principle subjective, practice in the two recent years showed that the rates of growth of regulated prices are by no means lower than free prices and, in fact, fixed prices were the initial impulse for "subsequent inflationary spirals." According to the comments of the critics, the proposal of the teachers of economics concerning the profitability of enterprises reeks of the same naivete. "At first glance," the employees of Gaydar's institute write, "the establishment of limits on profitability should lead to an acceleration of turnover. But it is most likely of all that enterprises will take the tested path of escalating costs." In the concluding part of their analysis, the IEPP experts dwell on one of the presently most discussed questions--the restoration of the manageability of the economy. Here they note the main flaw, from their point of view, of the work of the academicians--the declatoriness and lack of specific mechanisms for the implementation of the proposals: "It is absolutely unclear from the report where the boundary of state interference will be placed, and how its relations will be built with the already existing market infrastructure and administrative agents with their already established stereotypes of market behavior and independence."
