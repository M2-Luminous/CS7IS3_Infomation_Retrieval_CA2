This can be concluded from the cadastre of the Kriva Palanka Geodesy administration. The sketches of this region, according to the Kriva Palanka Geodesy administration, were made in 1967, and processed in 1968. According to these sketches, that is, the one from the cadastre county of Luke, of the Kriva Palanka local assembly, the peak Straza, with [words indistinct] elevations at 1,702 and 1,703.5 meters above sea level, is at a distance of 550 meters air line from the neighboring cadastre county of Surdulica, which is on FRY territory. Today's VECER writes that there is still no official information as to what is happening on the peak Straza and when the Serbian soldiers came there. It is found out that the members of the Macedonian Army, who control the border region, have sent information to the Defense Ministry, however, it has still not been officially issued. There are some assumptions that the Serbian soldiers have been at these positions for about a month, and they were first noticed by the villagers from Podrzikonj and Luke, who were not allowed by the Serbian soldiers to approach their land parcels, which are in the immediate vicinity of the border. After the news about the Serbian positions on Macedonian territory, NATO observation patrols, made up of U.S. soldiers, stationed themselves near the Macedonian Army camp, two days ago, and their intention is to stay in this volatile region for a while.
