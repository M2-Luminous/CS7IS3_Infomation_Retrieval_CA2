But the grassroots are more intelligent than the leaders." Bossi was also working out a forecast: "Given that there are 320 constituencies in the north, let us assume 70 of them will go to the left or -- let us be extra generous -- even 100. That leaves 220. How much is 70 percent of 220? Let us be absolutely pessimistic, and forecast an even smaller figure. In any case, we will have more than 100 deputies. Therefore, the north is our domain, not [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi's." Racing toward Udine in his Thema, Bossi had no kind words for the Knight [Berlusconi nickname]. From Milan came the news of Berlusconi's statements at the convention: "Bossi is losing his credibility. I, Berlusconi, am being targeted by terrorists." The League's leader replied drily, without mincing his words: "Let him say what he likes, Berluscone (Bossi now calls him in this way, with a final `e' -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) is not interested in truth. As far as the attempt on his life is concerned, I do not believe in that story. This guy is aiming to recycle the Five-Party System. Bombs are placed by those who are in power, and it is those who are in power who are doing the recycling...." Bossi did not finish his syllogism, but what he had in mind was clear. "More than anything else, this looks like an advertising campaign. What is he trying to become now? A victim?" However, it was on the night between Saturday [12 March] and Sunday that Bossi launched his most scathing attack. While his "enemy" and coalition fellow-traveler [Italian Social Movement Secretary] Fini -- an "ally" for whom the Knight only has words of praise and appreciation -- was soundly sleeping on the fourth floor of the Trieste Savoia Excelsior Hotel, the Senator [Bossi nickname], sitting in a small red armchair in the lobby, was prolific in jokes and political considerations, all of which were aimed in the same direction. It was four in the morning. Milan town councillor Pino Babbioni, who accompanies Bossi on all his trips, was sleeping in an armchair, and the supporters from Bergamo who make up Bossi's escort were drinking one Coke after the next, while the Senator carried on undaunted. [Passalacqua] Why do you not appear on TV, like Berlusconi, who does so every second day? [Bossi] I know that he appears on TV with [the secretary of Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] Occhetto. So I phoned [Northern League lower house floor leader] Maroni and told him: "Arrange an appointment for me with Occhetto on the last day of the electoral campaign." I will not leave the last word to Berlusconi. [Passalacqua] For some days now, you have been suggesting that you suspect the Knight and the PDS of having reached a post- electoral agreement. Why is this? [Bossi] I have seen Occhetto legitimizing Fini on TV. So I told myself: What if he now tries to talk to the fascists via Berluscone? On the other hand, Berluscone was demonized by the PDS, and now they find it somewhat difficult to speak with him. [Passalacqua] Do you speak with him? [Bossi] Sometimes. He must be made aware that the League is keeping an eye on him. He must be made to hear the thunderstorm of the League. In fact, he is part of one of the families that count in Italy. He is part of the information twofold monopoly. Wake up people, wake up! Berluscone does not represent working people. Do you want to know what he said when I told him that we want serious antitrust legislation, enforced through the ordinary magistrature? He told me that he wants commissions to be set up... Commissions? We want antitrust legislation. [Passalacqua] Deputy Bossi, they are saying that you are the new Ghino di Tacco [Craxi penname]. [Bossi] Ghino di Tacco? What a joke! Behind "Berluscaz," I mean behind Berluscone, there is Craxi. I know he is looking for me, but if he calls me, I will make him hear the noise made by the drum of my revolver. [Passalacqua] In short, what sort of future do you envisage for Italy after the elections? [Bossi] If an institutional government is formed, and Berlusconi stays outside, then it is the end. [Passalacqua] But if the pole of freedoms wins, have you already considered the problem of the premiership? It would be logical for Berlusconi to take up this post. [Bossi] Never, never. [Passalacqua] It is said that Berlusconi has also vetoed yours and Maroni's entry into Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's office]. Is this true? [Bossi] I presume this is a case of canceling vetoes. [Passalacqua] So everything is blocked. [Bossi] Easy, my friend: On 29 March, we will be raising a 30-meter flag in front of Palazzo Marino [Milan city hall], in Piazza della Scala -- the flag of federalism. [Passalacqua] Is that all it boils down to -- a flag? [Bossi] My friend, the government of this country will be born under such a flag. Under such a flag we will conduct negotiations. [Passalacqua] What about Berlusconi? [Bossi] He will know in Pontida [League rally venue], on 10 April. My friends, the north has a very powerful defender. [Passalacqua] All your arguments are based on the assumption that the League will play a central political role, and that Berlusconi will not have a hegemonic position within the coalition. But what if Berlusconi achieves an overwhelming victory? What will happen then? [Bossi] Overwhelming victory? How can he possibly achieve an overwhelming victory? The north is our domain. Do not forget that we have put him in a straitjacket. Seventy percent of the constituencies in the north will go to the League. I am not afraid of the pasteboard world created by Berluscone. [Passalacqua] Are you sure? The opinion polls say the opposite... [Bossi] If you find people bothersome, you cannot represent people. [Passalacqua] If I may say so, you are speaking of someone who is supposed to be your ally.... [Bossi] Machiavelli says that when you cannot beat an enemy you should have him as an ally.... [Passalacqua] Some League supporters are against an alliance with Forza Italia, for example here in Veneto -- a good example is the Montebelluna section. However, there are also some who would like closer links with the Knight. [Bossi] The answer to those who are against is that we must try to understand the situation, rather than clown around. I said so at the rally in Treviso. As far as the others are concerned, that story is old hat. If it had happened a year ago, our movement could have been broken in two. A few months ago I could feel that a venom was seeping in through the fringes, but then it stopped. Faxes and phonecalls are not enough to break the League. Fininvest tried to trap me, but it did not manage to do so.
