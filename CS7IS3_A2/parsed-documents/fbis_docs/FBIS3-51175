Since the people's revolt in Santiago del Estero, this is the first sign of alert made jointly in disagreement with Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo. The meeting was attended by the economy ministers of Tucuman, Raul Paulino Rios; Catamarca, Herman Colombo; and Jujuy, Daniel Gomar; La Rioja Finance Secretary Pablo Manuel Aguilera; and Salta Public Works Secretary Julio Guzman. The meeting was not attended by the representative of Santiago del Estero, where the revolt took place and whose government has been intervened by the federal government. After analyzing the social conflicts that are nearly permanent in their respective provinces, the growing unemployment in the public sector, and the recent demonstrations staged by tobacco workers, the ministers drafted a critical diagnosis of the consequences of the national economic policy. At the meeting's end they released a short communique. The most important paragraph of the joint declaration states "the need to adapt the public sector's national reform policy to the provinces' reality."
