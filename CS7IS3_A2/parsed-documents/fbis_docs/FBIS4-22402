Ishkhan Martirosyan, deputy minister of agriculture, reported how this sector had disposed of the humanitarian assistance it had received last year from overseas and on anticipated assistance in 1994. It was noted specifically that 72 tonnes of chemically treated sunflower seeds, 1 tonne of which had been allocated to Talinskiy Rayon, had been received along Armenia Assistance Fund lines. As ascertained, it was these seeds that were being sold on the streets of Yerevan, as a result of which instances of poisoning were recorded. The commission noted that criminal proceedings had already been instituted in this case. It was resolved at the meeting to render assistance in 1994 to orphaned children and certain strata of society, specifically, single retirees, schools and preschools of the city of Yerevan, cities of the disaster zone and area schools, cultural organizations, members of the staff of certain vocational-technical schools of Yerevan, and others. It was also noted at the meeting that there is currently a multitude of nongovernment charitable organizations rendering humanitarian assistance to various strata of the population of the republic. But their work is uncoordinated, and the aid is frequently received by the same recipients. In this connection the Central Commission for Humanitarian Assistance of the Republic of Armenia requests that the nongovernment organizations coordinate their operations with the commission.
