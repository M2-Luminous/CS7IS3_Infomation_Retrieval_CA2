All of our efforts in the field of foreign policy are directed toward living up to this responsibility. We Germans have an unfortunate tendency to worry about ourselves first and foremost. But be sure that we are reminding ourselves the whole time that we now have this special responsibility." This is how German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel explains the difference between the new Germany's past and present, between self-repression and newly found self-confidence, using a formula that typically enough also aims at reassuring its neighbors, which include Denmark. In everything that he does Klaus Kinkel must the whole time bring in this element of reassurance. Its neighbors look critically and closely at the enlarged Germany at the heart of Europe with its 80 million inhabitants and enormous economic power. In a meeting with a group of foreign correspondents, including BERLINGSKE TIDENDE's, in Bonn yesterday Kinkel took a grand tour through a number of today's major foreign policy questions. The thread running through his remarks is that Germany is not what it was, but that at the same time there will always be limits to what it can become. No one should think that Germany wants to play the role of a world power. "Today we are able to take on a responsibility which we could not only a few years ago. We are contributing to the UN peacekeeping forces in several countries. But there are still remnants of the conditions which used to prevail. Our constitution forbids us to take part in NATO's out-of-area actions and there will always be historically determined restrictions. For example, German troops will never be able to take part in either peacekeeping or peace-enforcing missions in the former Yugoslavia. "Germany will never become a world power. This is also true in the financial field. Many people take the view that Germany should give extra economic support to the world's crisis regions. Let me remind you that Germany is the third largest contributor to the United Nations. Germany meets 26.5 percent of the EU's [European Union] budget. We have signed up for 60 percent of the aid to the former Soviet republics. There is a limit and we have reached it. We cannot be the whole world's banker," Kinkel said. He puts the integration into Europe of the states of Eastern and central Europe high on his agenda. "You are hardly likely to find a West European foreign minister who pleads these countries' case so unambiguously. I can understand that they think that things are moving too slowly in relation to NATO and the EU; that they are not satisfied. On the other hand new walls must not be built in Europe. We must also take the former Soviet republics into consideration. This is a peculiar balancing act for Germany. We are being subjected to particularly great pressure, because people think that we have a particular duty. I would say to all parties: Things cannot move more quickly than they are doing at present." Kinkel said that he is following developments in Moscow with a certain amount of concern. In particular Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who by turns has threatened Germany with nuclear war and promised the return of East Prussia, is giving cause for concern. "He has made a series of fairly unusual statements. We think that the reformist forces in Moscow should take him on politically themselves. This is an internal Russian problem. I as foreign minister am responsible for the fact that Mr Zhirinovskiy cannot get an entry visa for Germany. And I stand by this decision." Germany's view of the war in the former Yugoslavia was given great prominence. The Bonn government's traditionally good relations with Croatia are often criticized; even by NATO partners such as France and Britain. However, Kinkel made it clear that Germany's policy toward the Balkans is being reformulated: "It is correct that we saw Serbia as the driving force behind the incomprehensible tragedy that is taking place. But little by little it has become more difficult to differentiate." Kinkel is unwilling as yet to comment on reports that Croatian government forces are taking part in the fighting in Bosnia. He was unwilling to say whether, if this is true, Germany will be involved in introducing economic sanctions against Croatia. He was also reluctant to call for bomb attacks on Serbian positions or UN intervention: "We Germans cannot allow ourselves to hand out too many pieces of good advice. We cannot after all take part in such actions. My basic view is that without a desire for peace on the part of the parties involved it is impossible for others to create a lasting peace." Kinkel stressed European policy as the nucleus of Germany's overall foreign policy. He could not even bring himself to comment on the suggestion that the signals have been somewhat confused recently as a result of Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber's tough attacks on Brussels. Germany's place is in Europe and the Union. We will never see Germany going it alone again, he said. "Germany takes over the EU presidency in the latter half of the year. At the moment the most crucial thing is to get the four applicant countries (Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Austria) into the Union. I am optimistic. There are special problems in the case of all four. But just think how nervous people were prior to the referendums in France and Denmark. But things turned out well! On 1 January 1995 these four countries will be members of the EU. I am sure of it. For none of them can allow itself to remain outside. And we on our side have a clear interest in their joining. But we must also be allowed to say that the four countries themselves must have a desire to join." Kinkel made the following comment on the particularly Danish, slightly foot-dragging behavior in EU cooperation: "It was clear to me the whole time that Denmark really could not allow itself to remain outside Union cooperation. Particularly not when it became apparent that the other Scandinavian countries were standing in line to join." According to his own diagnosis, Kinkel is a clear friend of the Nordic area. "I feel very at home in the Nordic countries. In this respect I as a southern German am fairly northern European. I often take vacations there. The fact that I attach so much importance to this region's joining the EU is due to considerations of internal balance in the EU. The Union will benefit from being properly balanced because of the Nordic countries' membership." Kinkel rejected categorically the suggestion that German reunification could drive a wedge between Germany and the United States, because Germany's interests can be said to have shifted to the east. "German-U.S. relations are so good that they will be able to withstand all disturbances. Personally I still remember how, immediately after the last war, American trucks rolled into the school yard and distributed food. That's how I got my first football. We will never forget the Berlin airlift (in 1948 -- editorial note) or the unreserved U.S. support for reunification. "The United States is the world's only remaining superpower. It is true that after the Cold War both the United States and Europe are seeking their roles more in domestic policy. But this does not mean that we are disconnecting ourselves from each other. There will also be increased economic competition -- think of GATT, for example. But this will not put a political burden on transatlantic ties. The United States and Europe, the United States and Germany belong together."
