FR941107-1-00027 FR941107-1-00007 2. Rule 2(e) Proceedings The Commission also solicits comment as to whether filers should be required to disclose all administrative actions brought by the Commission against a designated person pursuant to Rule 2(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice. 98 Rule 2(e) provides for the suspension or disbarment of certain professionals, usually attorneys and accountants, from practicing before the Commission. 99 Where Rule 2(e) orders relate to violations of the federal securities laws, 100 disclosure would be required under both the current and proposed rules. Should the requirements be expanded to encompass Rule 2(e) orders based on lack of professional qualifications, 101 lack of character or integrity, or unethical or improper professional misconduct, 102 the conviction of a felony or of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, or the disbarment or revocation of a license to practice as an attorney, accountant, engineer or other expert? 103 If not, commenters should provide specific reasons for any recommended exclusions. If it is determined that all Rule 2(e) orders should be disclosed, should disclosure of disciplinary sanctions imposed by other federal and state authorities or non-government professional associations, such as bar associations, for violations of standards of professional conduct also be required? 98 17 CFR 201.2(e). 99 ``Practicing before the Commission'' is defined in Rule 2(g) [17 CFR 201.2(g)] to include ``transacting any business with the Commission'' as well as ``the preparation of any statement, opinion or other paper by any attorney, accountant, engineer or other expert, filed with the Commission in any registration statement, notification, application, report or other document with the consent of such attorney, accountant, engineer or other expert.'' 100 See Rule 2(e)(1)(iii) [17 CFR 201.2(e)(1)(iii)], allowing the Commission to suspend or disbar a professional that has been found by the Commission in a Rule 2(e) proceeding to have violated federal securities laws, and Rule 2(e)(3) [17 CFR 201.2(e)(3)], which provides for a summary disbarment or suspension by the Commission where a court has enjoined the professional from future violations of the federal securities laws, or where the person has been found by a court or by the Commission in a separate proceeding to have violated those laws. 101 Rule 2(e)(1)(i) [17 CFR 201.2(e)(1)(i)]. 102 Rule 2(e)(1)(ii) [17 CFR 201.2(e)(1)(ii)]. 103 Rule 2(e)(2) [17 CFR 201.2(e)(2)]. E. Disclosure Period Expansion to 10 Years The Commission proposes to expand the time during which disclosure is required from five to 10 years, 104 and to delete in most instances the provisions allowing registrants to omit information they determine is neither material to an evaluation of the ability or integrity of the designated person 105 nor to a voting or investment decision. 106 Based on its experience since 1978, when the original disclosure period was reduced from 10 to the current five years, 107 the Commission believes that many legal proceedings remain material beyond five years. 108 Of course, the inclusion of the information would continue to be required beyond 10 years where necessary to render statements otherwise made in the registration statement, report or document not misleading. 109 104 Proposed Item 401(f)(1). 105 Current Item 401 and Item 8(d) of the Regulation A offering circular (Model B). 106 Current Item 401(g) (1) and (2). As discussed in Section III.A.1, above, the materiality provision would be retained with respect to bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings. 107 See Section II, above, for background relating to this requirement. 108 This comports with the President's Commission on Organized Crime's 1986 recommendation that disclosure of all legal proceedings required by Item 401 of Regulation S&hyph;K be extended to at least 10 years to provide adequate notice to investors and government agencies as to the background of corporate officials. See President's Commission on Organized Crime, THE EDGE: Organized Crime, Business, and Labor Unions; Report to the President and the Attorney General p. 345 (March 1986). 109 Rule 408 [17 CFR 230.408] under the Securities Act, Rule 12b&hyph;20 [17 CFR 240.12b&hyph;20] under the Exchange Act, and Rule 8b&hyph;20 under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.8b&hyph;20] require registrants to disclose, in addition to the information expressly required to be included in a registration statement or report, any further material information as may be necessary to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Cf. Releases No. 33&hyph;5758 (November 2, 1976) [41 FR 49493] and No. 33&hyph;5949 (July 28, 1978) [43 FR 34402] stating that information regarding events occurring outside the five-year period may be material and should be disclosed. For examples of civil actions finding legal proceedings over five years old to be material, see SEC v. Scott , 565 F.Supp. 1513 (S.D.N.Y. 1983) (prospectus deemed materially false and misleading, in part because 1961 Canadian fraud conviction not disclosed in 1980 prospectus); Bertoglio v. Texas Int'l Co. , 488 F.Supp. 630 (D. Del. 1980) (1964 Commission bar should have been disclosed in 1979 proxy materials notwithstanding five-year disclosure requirement). See also Calderon v. Tower Associates Int'l , Civil No. 88&hyph;1240&hyph;FR (D. Ore. March 28, 1989) (order compelling answers to interrogatories) (criminal securities law violations occurring in 1977 and 1979 deemed material and discoverable notwithstanding Item 401(f) five-year provisions). Since some types of legal proceedings may have a greater impact on voting and investment decisions than others, the Commission requests comment as to whether there are specific actions that should be disclosed for periods less than 10 years. For example, should misdemeanors be described for a lesser period than felony convictions? Commenters favoring that approach should specify the types of proceedings to which the current five-year provision should continue to apply. On the other hand, disclosure may be appropriate for periods longer than 10 years with respect to certain types of legal proceedings_for example: criminal fraud convictions; civil, administrative and SRO actions based on fraud involving securities, commodities, financial institutions, insurance companies or other businesses; actions involving mail and wire fraud; and, proceedings resulting in the removal or bar from acting in a decision-making capacity in connection with a financial institution or other business. Should these types of legal proceedings be disclosed for longer periods, such as 15 or 20 years, or indefinitely? Should disclosure be required so long as the designated person is subject to the order? Commenters should provide an analysis in support of any specific time period recommended.
