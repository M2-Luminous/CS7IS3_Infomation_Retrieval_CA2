But They Are Solvable"] [Text] We have to admit with regret that trade between Russia and India had been steadily declining lately, and in 1992 fell off by more than half. Last year, however, the decline in mutual trade was halted. Having given up on clearing, we have developed a new legal base that allows us to move to a flexible system of reciprocal payments. The trading partners now have a choice of the form most acceptable for them, in particular, payments in convertible hard currency, or clearing through barter and exchange of goods. The main factor that determines the prospects for the development of Russian-Indian trade and economic relations and promises an increase in bilateral trade is the expansion of direct ties between commercial structures of both countries. I hope that this year the trade turnover between our countries will increase to approximately $2 billion. We are happy to see that more than 500 Indian companies currently work rather actively in the Russian market. Also, in my opinion, the companies that compete most successfully are those that take the risk of using trade forms that are most progressive in the existing conditions: selling goods from warehouses, deliveries with extended payment terms, and combining export with import. To our chagrin, we also have to mention a number of negative points, which lately are becoming an increasingly frequent phenomenon. I mean shipments to Russia from India of goods of low, and sometimes unacceptable, quality--tea not fit for drinking, tobacco that does not meet the standards stipulated in the contracts, footwear that does not meet the norm, and so on. All of this, alas, causes a prejudice against all Indian goods among Russian consumers. This is a very dangerous trend, capable of seriously damaging our trade and economic relations. Some measures have been taken to stop such incidents. When I was a trade representative in Delhi, we made official representations to India's Ministry of Trade. So far, unfortunately, there is no change for the better. Because of the complexity of the issue, work is dragging on forming a system of utilizing the means coming from India as payments on credits provided in the past by the Soviet Union. This year we will be able to utilize more than 30 billion rupees, or about $1 billion, to purchase goods in India and complete payments on goods shipped to Russia earlier but not yet paid for, as well as give Russian organizations the ability to use the money previously frozen in the Foreign Economic Bank's accounts. We gave to the Indian side tentative lists of goods we are planning to buy in India as centralized purchases. In the near future, we expect to complete the selection of trade organizations that will handle such purchases. A serious obstacle in this respect is the shortage of means on the part of Russian customers to cover in rubles the rupees received from the state. The most realistic way of overcoming these difficulties, in my opinion, is for Indian partners to arrange for installment payments--naturally, on mutually profitable terms agreed upon in each particular deal. And one more, completely new, point in the matter of utilizing the Indian debt. This year, for the first time, there is a plan to sell a certain amount of state money through an experimental auction in Indian rupees to Russian organizations and firms for subsequent purchases of goods in India. The mechanism for such an auction is being worked out now, but this will take some time--as I said, this is a completely new undertaking. I think, however, that it is not advisable to link the development of trade relations just to the utilization of debt. Our aim should be to expand direct contacts between commercial structures of both countries. There is also a rich potential in working with Russian regions, as well as in deliveries of machinery and technical equipment from Russia to India. In addition, we do not want Indian businessmen to limit themselves to trade alone, but rather to invest capital more actively in Russia's production sphere, despite existing difficulties. We, in turn, are ready to buy in India for rupees not just traditional goods but also machinery and technical products, as well as, for instance, semifinished footwear or woolen knitwear. At this point, however, we cannot do it in needed quantities, because the Indian Ministry of Finance has set a 100-percent value-added tax on imported components, as compared to the 33 percent for exporting analogous goods for hard currency. Essentially, with respect to such goods, the Russian market found itself in a discriminatory position. I hope that this problem also will be resolved soon. We have to somehow untie another knot as well. Russian exporters have two types of accounts in Indian banks--the so-called escrow account and the special-rupee account. For some reason, unlike the former, the latter does not allow Russian importers to re-export Indian goods. Of course, development of ties between us is being constrained by unresolved transportation issues. As is known, in the past the main flow of freight in the Russian-Indian trade went through Odessa and Ilyichevsk. Now it is difficult for Russia to work with these ports. Therefore, the department of maritime transport decided to allocate two piers in Novorossiysk specifically to support mutual shipping. True, these piers need reconstruction in order to handle containers there. Nevertheless, representatives in the Indian Embassy who have visited Novorossiysk believe that, thanks to these two piers, the transportation problem can be resolved. As you can see, there are quite a few issues to deal with. But all of them can be overcome--all we need is enough will on both sides. Which, I am sure, both sides have. This material has been prepared on the basis of the report at the recent seminar "Trade and Business Relations Between India and Russia," organized by the Indian Embassy in the Russian Federation, the Russian Foreign Policy Foundation, and the Association of Indian Business in Moscow.
