FR940414-0-00079 FR940414-0-00029 The degree to which a permit is actually used may be referred to as effort. The goals and objectives of Amendment 6 clearly identify ``capacity'' of permits, not the effort with which they are applied, as being the focus for constraint in the limited entry program in general, and the formula for combining permits in particular. Thus, even though effort may increase as permits are transferred from less intensive to more intensive operations, in terms of fleet capacity, it makes no difference whether a vessel combines permits from ten 60-foot (18.3 m) vessels that each landed 1 mt the last 5 years, or from ten 60-foot (18.3 m) vessels that each landed 5,000 mt over the same period. The relevant question for determining capacity is what an individual could have caught with the permit, using a quality vessel of the same length, with a knowledgeable skipper and an efficient crew. The fact that potential highliners will increase overall effort and production in the fishery by obtaining permits from individuals who are making little use of them is not surprising; this likelihood is addressed in the analysis for Amendment 6. The Council could have reduced the potential for increases in effort resulting from permit transfers by establishing more rigorous minimum landing requirements for initial qualification for permits, but the Council's final action did not include different minimum landing requirements for vessels of different length. Alternatively, Amendment 6 could have constrained outputs (landings) by, for example, attaching landing endorsements to the permits, rather than length endorsements. In order for a vessel to increase its landings, it would have had to buy a permit endorsed for an appropriate amount of tonnage. This would have prevented little-used vessels from being transformed, through permit sale, into highliners, without production having been reduced by someone else. However, in constraining inputs to the fishery (vessel length and gear) rather than outputs, the Council was aware that increases in effort and production might occur. One example given by a commenter to justify concern about unproductive permits being transferred to a highline vessel was that, for example, a 300-foot (91.4 m) factory trawler, producing about 400 mt per day, could obtain a limited entry permit by obtaining 13 permits from thirteen 65-foot (19.8 m) shrimp vessels that historically caught an aggregate of less than 400 mt of whiting over a whole year. However, it is also true that, if each one of those 13 permits was sold to a highline 65-foot (19.8 m) vessel making at-sea deliveries of whiting, the 13 vessels could easily deliver an aggregate of more than 1,000 mt per day, based on data from the 1991 whiting fishery. As this example illustrates, the potential for increasing effort in the whiting fishery is not simply an issue that arises with regard to factory trawlers combining permits in order to enter the fishery. Quite the contrary, historically unproductive permits for vessels under 110 ft (35.5 m) could generate as much or more additional catch in the whiting fishery if they were transferred/combined to highline vessels within the same size range than if they were combined to accommodate the use of a factory trawler. NMFS agrees that fishing effort will tend to increase with the combining of permits for factory trawlers in the whiting fishery. Likewise, the amount of capacity utilized in the whiting fishery will increase as permits issued for vessels with no historical whiting catch are transferred to vessels that fish for whiting. Those transfers represent a transfer of capacity from the non-whiting fishery, or alternatively the groundfish fishery as a whole, into the whiting fishery. However, it cannot be ignored that permits that are combined to support 100-foot (30.5 m) catcher boats, or even those that are transferred between vessels of the same size, will also lead to increases in effort, and, if transferred into the whiting fishery, to increases in capacity in the whiting fishery. Regardless of the size of her/his vessel, an entering highliner will always attempt to purchase permits as cheaply as possible, and that will involve seeking out permits that are generating the least amount of money for their current owners. Comment 2: Nine commenters argued that NMFS' use of a 60-foot catcher vessel in the whiting fishery for comparison with factory trawlers was flawed, because the average length of catcher vessels delivering whiting is closer to 85 ft (25.9 m) or 90 ft (27.4 m) in length. They argued that, if the same comparison were done using a 90-foot (27.4 m) vessel length for a catcher vessel, the results would show that the NMFS preferred approach was not conservative enough to prevent harvest capacity from increasing.
