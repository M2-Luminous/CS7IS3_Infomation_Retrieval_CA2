(Posco) and Vietnam Steel Corp. (VSC) at a cost of 56 million U.S. dollars. Attending the ground-breaking ceremony were Posco President Kim Chong-chin, Vietnamese Heavy Industries Minister Tran Lum and VSC chairman Ngo Huy Phan. The 18,000-pyong (59,400-square-meter) VPS (VSC-Posco steel), due to be completed by September next year, will produce 70,000 tons of rebar, 70,000 tons of round bars and 60,000 tons of wire rods. Posco and its affiliate Keoyang Co. hold respective 45 percent and 5 percent stakes in the company with 34 percent and 16 percent holdings by VSC and the Hai Phong People's Council (HPC). Posco has run a joint-venture factory called "Posvina" with an annual output capacity of 30,000 tons of corrugated steel sheet since April 1992 in Ho Chi Minh City, and is almost finished with work on a pipe mill with an annual capacity of 30,000 tons in Hai Phong. Korea's steel-making reached 33 million tons last year, compared with Vietnam's 210,000 tons, and the Vietnamese Government hopes to boost the industry as a major state project by joining up with Posco. Due to increased steel demand brought by various infrastructure programs, Vietnam imported more than 60 percent of its steel bars -- 67 percent of its steel imports. Encouraged by various joint ventures with Vietnam, Posco plans to advance into other Southeast Asian countries like Myanmar and Malaysia.
