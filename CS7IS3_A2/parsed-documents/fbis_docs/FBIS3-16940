MSF which is responsible for space communications and satellite intelligence gathering plans a rebuilding of the first of the 60 silos left after the destruction of SS-11 ICBMs for launches of a new generation booster developed on the basis of an SS-19 missile by 1996. As many as five such silos will be rebuilt, said the spokesman. Russia's SS-19 two-stage missiles with a payload of 105.6 tons each are to be destroyed by the year 2003 as envisaged by the START-2 agreement between Moscow and Washington. It is also known that MSF plans an environmentally safe general purpose launch pad for a new generation heavy duty Angara-24 missile. An MSF official said that since the new booster "can be transformed depending on a payload and altitude", the new launch pad would operate on the principle of "a changeable circus arena". The new booster is to undergo trial tests during 1998-1999 before being fired into outer space a year or two later.
