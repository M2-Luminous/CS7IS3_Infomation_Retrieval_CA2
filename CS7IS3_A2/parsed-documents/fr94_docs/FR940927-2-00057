FR940927-2-00057 FR940927-2-00042 Notice of Changes in Status of Extended Benefit (EB) Periods for the States of Alaska, Rhode Island, and Washington This notice announces changes in benefit period eligibility under the Extended Benefit (EB) Program for the States of Alaska, Rhode Island, and Washington. Summary The following changes have occurred since the publication of the last notice regarding States' EB status: •August 6, 1994␣Alaska's 13-week insured unemployment rate for the week ending July 16, 1994 fell below 6.0 percent and was less than 120 percent of the average for the corresponding period for the prior two years, causing the State to trigger ``off'' EB effective August 6, 1994. •August 13, 1994␣Rhode Island triggered ``off'' EB. The EB trigger mechanisms for Rhode Island had been below the thresholds necessary to be triggered ``on'' to EB since the week beginning June 5, 1994. However, Section 203(b)(1)(A) of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 specifies that no EB period shall last for less than 13 consecutive weeks, regardless of whether or not the necessary thresholds are met. That 13-week period ended for Rhode Island on August 13, 1994. •August 27, 1994␣The State of Washington triggered ``off'' EB. The EB trigger mechanisms for the State had been below the thresholds necessary to be triggered ``on'' to EB since the week beginning June 12, 1994. However, as stated above, Section 203(b)(1)(A) of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 specifies that no EB period shall last for less than 13 consecutive weeks, regardless of whether or not the necessary thresholds are met. That 13-week period ended for Washington on August 27, 1994. Information for Claimants The duration of benefits payable in the EB Program, and the terms and conditions on which they are payable, are governed by the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, as amended, and the operating instructions issued to the States by the U.S. Department of Labor. In the case of a State ending an EB period, the State employment security agency will furnish a written notice to each individual who is filing claims for Extended Benefits informing them of the ending of the EB period and its effect on the individual's right to Extended Benefits (20 CFR 615.13(c)(4)). Persons who believe they may be entitled to EB benefits, or who wish to inquire about their rights under the programs, should contact the nearest State employment service office or unemployment compensation claims office in their locality. Signed at Washington, D.C., on September 21, 1994. Doug Ross, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employment and Training.
