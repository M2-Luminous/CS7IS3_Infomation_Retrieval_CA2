What would your European policy look like? [Stoiber] Germany is basically pursuing a very good and responsible European policy. It has to be made clear to people that the European Union [EU] is a community for peace. Yet, in the almost 40 years of the history of the EU there have also been bureaucratic and misguided centralist developments, which is what I criticized. Unfortunately, those who criticize certain structures of the EU are deliberately misinterpreted -- as if one were an anti- European. Yet, no responsible politician can be anti-European. I am calling for more transparency, more subsidiarity.... [Plott] ...as was laid down in Maastricht. [Stoiber] Yes, but it also has to be put into practice. The problem is the deficit in democratic transparency of the Council of Ministers, the complacency of the Commission, which is absolutely detached from opinionmaking in the Parliament and control by the Parliament; the strict regulations that even determine whether or not people are permitted to swim in the Isar River -- everything is being decided in Brussels. There are many things that we do not need, things that increasingly annoy the people, who then, based on this annoyance, question Europe in general. That must be avoided. We must fight against this annoyance, try to change things, and take people along with Europe. Otherwise, we will drive them into the hands of the anti-Europeans. [Plott] How do you explain that Heiner Geissler, who is deputy chairman of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag Group, accused you of high treason? [Stoiber] I no longer take Geissler politically seriously. [Plott] It has been said again and again that you are trying to return to the nation state. [Stoiber] That is wrong. I want to make clear that this Europe is absolutely unable to progress without nation states and without the nations' feeling of belonging together. A nation state would constitute a piece of centralism and would end national characteristic features, which would destroy Europe. People are always insinuating that I want the nation state as such, based on the experience of the past. Yet I am thinking further than that. Those who underestimate the cohesive strength of the nation today and think that this strength could be replaced by Europe will be in for a nasty surprise. Thus, our Europe can only be one of nations and regions, a confederation of states. [Plott] Could one say that the Germans are becoming unreliable fellows in European policy because they are seeking the right to resign from the confederation? [Stoiber] No, I have never asked for that. All I did was to point out the difference between a federal state and a confederation. One cannot resign from a federal state, whereas from a confederation of states one can. Besides, the Federal Constitutional Court put it in exactly the same way. [passage omitted] [Plott] Will Austria manage to enter the EU in time? [Stoiber] I hope so, and I hope that the EU will show greater understanding for Austria's cause. We have greatly emphasized the need for Germany to support Austria's position in the negotiations. For us, Austria's accession is of vital importance. The problems in the sphere of agriculture can be solved. The most difficult issue will certainly be the transit agreement. However, I think that a settlement can be found that is acceptable for all sides. [Plott] Would you recommend that the Austrians vote "yes" in a referendum? [Stoiber] Yes, by all means. Austria can progress for its own good only when its ties with the neighboring countries become closer and closer. [passage omitted]
