Whereupon Liao Yao-chu [1675 3852 3796] immediately submitted to the convention three amendments in writing on the draft's "mainstream plan," i.e., he submitted the following three amendments to the plan to be voted on at the convention: 1) That the number of directly-elected legislative seats for 1995 be increased from 18 to 20. 2) That the counting of votes by group be limited to motions and amendments to motions made by legislators. 3) That the proportion of legislative members not of Chinese ancestry be raised from 15 to 20 percent. Zhou Nan immediately expressed support for this in a statement at a group meeting. I thought that these three amendments "suggested" by Liao Yao-chu had probably been agreed on by both the Chinese and British, and sure enough, the draft was amended essentially according to Liao Yao-chu's suggestions. But the job of "persuasion" that Ji Pengfei had handed over to me was very unsuccessful. Li Chia-ch'eng took a negative approach to the counting of votes by group. I discussed it with him three times, with Li Chia-ch'eng persistently opposing it the first time, saying that it could be considered the second time, but then saying again that he could not endorse it the third time. Several of the Hong Kong members of the Drafting Committee behaved in accordance with Li Chia-ch'eng's approach, regularly exchanging views with him during the course of the convention. So unless we won over Li Chia-ch'eng's support, the negative votes would not be limited to his alone. When I reported Li Chia-ch'eng's attitude to Ji Pengfei, Ji finally sought out Li Hou. But it was considered that even if the counting of votes by group was voted against by those, such as Li Chia-ch'eng, it might still win the necessary two-thirds majority for approval, so that a few less votes would be no obstacle. While Huo Ying-tung also dissented with the counting of votes by group, he did agree to support it after an exchange of views. But he suggested to me that Article 142 of the Basic Law draft, on "the Hong Kong SAR Government setting its own sports policy, with private sports groups being allowed to continue according to law to exist and develop," might have the "private sports groups" part preceded by the two words previously existing,' in order to emphatically safeguard the rights and interests of Hong Kong's previously existing private sports groups. Huo Tung-ying said that while he had suggested this view repeatedly, it had not been paid attention to, about which he was very displeased. So I reported this to Ji Pengfei, suggesting that he consider Huo's view. Li Hou and Lu Ping were present at the time, and Li Hou disagreed, holding that the existing words already had this meaning. I said that: "This is simply a matter of words, certainly not an issue involving principles, as it involves simply the addition of the two words previously existing.' But to Huo Ying-tung, it is not just a matter of words. As Huo Ying-tung has said that this is not just his view alone, I wonder if such a matter involving no principles might not satisfy them?" But my suggestion was not accepted. As the particular responsibility for the drafting of the Basic Law belonged to Li Hou and Lu Ping, and Ji Pengfei did not take a clear stand either, Li Hou and the others still dealt with the matter according to their own view. Their inability to deal flexibly with even purely technical matters made it impossible for me to meet with Huo Ying-tung again to give him a response. I also exchanged views with several other Hong Kong members of the Drafting Committee, discovering that their views coincided roughly with Li Chia-ch'eng's. When the draft proposals were voted on one by one at the convention on the 16th, the balloting results were that all were passed with majority votes. While the article on the counting of votes by group got seven dissenting votes, it still passed. And I guessed that these seven no votes were cast by Li Chia-ch'eng and the Hong Kong members of the Drafting Committee under his influence. After the Basic Law draft was passed, Ji Pengfei feted the whole Drafting Committee at the Beijing Hotel Guest House, where those meeting with Ji Pengfei, Li Hou, Lu Ping, etc., were jubilant, toasting and singing, with the whole place aflutter, except for me, who was at a loss and distracted, so could not share in the jubilation.
