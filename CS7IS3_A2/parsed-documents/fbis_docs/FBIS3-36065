Kazimirov, who recently travelled to Khankendi [Stepanakert] and Yerevan arrived in the late evening on January 30 to Baku with the Russian plan for regulating the Armenian-Azeri conflict. An official from the Azeri Presidential Cabinet told TURAN that the plan proposed a withdrawal of Armenian forces from six occupied south-western regions of Azerbaijan and the stationing of buffer-forces all along the line of hostilities. The question about the fate of the two other occupied Azeri regions, Lachinskiy and Kelbadzharskiy, and the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, will be discussed at a later date. The first stage of implementation of the plan would be a 2-3 week long cease-fire which was scheduled to be signed on February 1. However, Geydar Aliyev rejected the proposal and told Kazimirov yesterday that "we will discuss the question of a cease-fire only after the complete withdrawal of Armenian forces from the occupied Azeri territories." He also said, "Azerbaijan will not be humiliated by such cease-fire terms." One Azeri diplomat said, "The regulation of the conflict can be discussed seriously only if the plan provides for a complete withdrawal of Armenian troops from all the occupied regions and the return of Azeris to the Shushinskiy Region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Under these conditions, Azerbaijan would guarantee the restoration of road travel between Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia", one Azeri diplomat said. The fact that Kazimirov left with an unagreed upon plan, postpones the settlement of the question for an indefinite period of time. In this connection, reports of the Russian media about today's scheduled meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and the Foreign Ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan, and with the representatives of the Armenian community of Nagorno- Karabakh are appear to be premature. Moreover, Azeri Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov did not leave for Moscow. This morning he received the UK ambassador Thomas Young.
