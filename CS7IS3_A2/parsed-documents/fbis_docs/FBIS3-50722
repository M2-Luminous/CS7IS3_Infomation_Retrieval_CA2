From 25 to 28 January, Cuba will once again be the stage for the largest expression of intercontinental solidarity when it welcomes the participants to the Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Meeting for Solidarity, Sovereignty, Self-Determination, and the Lives of our Peoples. The precedents for the meeting in Havana are similar meetings held in the capitals of Ecuador and Colombia in 1988 and 1989, respectively, as well as the Sao Paulo summit in 1991. The impact of the new political, economic, and military realigning of the world for the people and nations of Latin America and the Caribbean; U.S. policies on the threshold of the 21st century; and the role of people's movements in establishing democratic alternatives, among other things, are some of the political issues to be discussed in the meeting. In terms of the economy, the organizers of the event have scheduled debates and conferences regarding regional reinsertion into the global economy; the effects of neoliberalism on the Latin American and Caribbean peoples; and the peoples' alternatives for development and integration and their experiences and action programs. More than 1,000 people will attend the event, which will be fully underwritten by the participants. They will be lodged in the Pan American Village. The event will be held in the Convention Center. In order to give direction to all the actions and results of the meeting, the continental organizing committee has called for the reactivation and strengthening of national committees. The national committees have among their main goals collecting funds to cover transportation costs and to fully underwrite the event, which is an expression of solidarity and material support for Cuba.
