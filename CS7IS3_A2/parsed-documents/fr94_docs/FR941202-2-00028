Rita D. Hayes, Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements November 28, 1994. Commissioner of Customs, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229. Dear Commissioner: Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854), and the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles done at Geneva on December 20, 1973, as further extended on December 9, 1993; pursuant to the Export Visa Arrangement, effected by exchange of notes dated September 20, 1993 and June 8, 1994, between the Governments of the United States and Qatar; and in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, you are directed to prohibit, effective on January 1, 1995, entry into the Customs territory of the United States (i.e., the 50 states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) for consumption and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of cotton, wool, man-made fiber, silk blend and other vegetable fiber textiles and textile products in Categories 200&hyph;239, 300&hyph;369, 400&hyph;469, 600&hyph;670 and 800&hyph;899, including part categories and merged categories 338/339/638/639, produced or manufactured in Qatar and exported from Qatar on and after January 1, 1995 for which the Government of Qatar has not issued an appropriate export visa fully described below. Should additional categories, merged categories or part categories be added to the bilateral agreement, the entire category(s) or part category(s) shall be included in the coverage of this arrangement on an agreed effective date. Goods exported during the period January 1, 1995 through January 31, 1995 shall not be denied entry for lack of a visa. A visa must accompany each commercial shipment of the aforementioned textile products. A circular stamped marking in blue ink will appear on the front of the original commercial invoice. The original visa shall not be stamped on duplicate copies of the invoice. The original invoice with the original visa stamp will be required to enter the shipment into the United States. Duplicates of the invoice and/or visa may not be used for this purpose. Each visa stamp shall include the following information: 1. The visa number. The visa number shall be in the standard nine digit letter format, beginning with one numerical digit for the last digit of the year of export, followed by the two character alpha country code specified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)(the code for Qatar is ``QA''), and a six digit numerical serial number identifying the shipment; e.g., 5QA123456. 2. The date of issuance. The date of issuance shall be the day, month and year on which the visa was issued. 3. The signature of the issuing official. 4. The correct category(s), merged category(s), part category(s), quantity(s) and unit(s) of quantity in the shipment as set forth in the U.S. Department of Commerce Correlation (e.g., ``Cat. 340&hyph;510 DOZ''). Quantities must be stated in whole numbers. Decimals or fractions will not be accepted. Merged category quota merchandise may be accompanied by either the appropriate merged category visa or the correct category visa corresponding to the actual shipment (e.g., Categories 347/348 may be visaed as 347/348 or if the shipment consists solely of 347 merchandise, the shipment may be visaed as ``Cat. 347,'' but not as ``Cat. 348''). U.S. Customs shall not permit entry if the shipment does not have a visa, or if the visa number, date of issuance, signature, category, quantity or units of quantity are missing, incorrect or illegible, or have been crossed out or altered in any way. If the quantity indicated on the visa is less than that of the shipment, entry shall not be permitted. If the quantity indicated on the visa is more than that of the shipment, entry shall be permitted and only the amount entered shall be charged to any applicable quota. The complete name and address of a company actually involved in the manufacturing process of the textile product covered by the visa shall be provided on the textile visa document. If the visa is not acceptable then a new visa must be obtained from the Government of Qatar, or a visa waiver may be issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce at the request of the Government of Qatar, and presented to the U.S. Customs Service before any portion of the shipment will be released. The waiver, if used, only waives the requirement to present a visa with the shipment. It does not waive the quota requirement. If import quotas are in force, U.S. Customs Service shall charge only the actual quantity in the shipment to the correct category limit. If a shipment from Qatar has been allowed entry into the commerce of the United States with either an incorrect visa or no visa, and redelivery is requested but cannot be made, U.S. Customs shall charge the shipment to the correct category limit whether or not a replacement visa or visa waiver is provided. Merchandise imported for the personal use of the importer and not for resale, regardless of value, and properly marked commercial sample shipments valued at U.S.$250 or less, do not require a visa for entry. A facsimile of the visa stamp is enclosed with this letter. The actions taken concerning the Government of Qatar with respect to imports of textiles and textile products in the foregoing categories have been determined by the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements to involve foreign affairs functions of the United States. Therefore, these directions to the Commissioner of Customs, which are necessary for the implementation of such actions, fall within the foreign affairs exception to the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). This letter will be published in the Federal Register . Sincerely, Rita D. Hayes, Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements.
