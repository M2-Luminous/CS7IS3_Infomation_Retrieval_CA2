"A number of measures taken by the government allowed to stabilise the situation in the economy to a ceratin extent", Deputy Economics Minister Sergey Vasilyev told a conference in Moscow on Tuesday. Among the measures he listed the strengthening of the rouble in comparison to the national currencies of other former Soviet republics, curtailing monthly inflation to 8-9 per cent and cancelling easy-term crediting, import subsidies and export quotas. However, Vasilyev believes that it is necessary to introduce a fixed rouble exchange rate to further strengthen the Russian currency. To stipulate production it is necessary to attract finances of the population, he said and added that in order to stabilise the rouble in general and return to it the trust of most depositors it is necessary to introduce a fixed rouble exchange rate. The fight with inflation remains the main task of the government this year, according to Vasilyev who said that it is necessary to decrease the budget deficit to achieve the goal. The deficit currently amounts to 10 per cent of the gross national product, according to him. However, he said it is impossible to cut state expenses. The deficit can be decreased through restructuring the state spendings which would take some two-three years. Vasilyev also urged to improve tax collection which dropped to 10 per cent of the gross national product last year. He admitted that tax dodging sharply went up from the middle of 1993. The total amount of collected taxes should reach 16 per cent of the GNP to stabilise the situation in the sphere, according to him.
