Karadzic came to Moscow on Monday night [28 February] on the Russian initiative for negotiations on Bosnian settlement. The negotiations were very frank but difficult as the problem is complicated and the war has lasted for two years, said Kozyrev. In his opinion, the peace initiative of Russian President Boris Yeltsin has played an exclusively positive role in settlement around Sarajevo as "it created conditions for a crucial turn in regional developments". Kozyrev plans to discuss with Boris Yeltsin the Russian holding of operation at the Tuzla airport. He said the agreement to the effect reached with the Serb side opens way to more steps for regional settlement. Kozyrev hopes other states will participate in negotiations with other parties to the conflict in order to reach accord and compromises. In his turn, Karadzic praised Yeltsin's initiative as a good sign for other sides to follow the path of peaceful settlement. He said Bosnian Serbs agree to open the Tuzla airport in the immediate future for the delivery of humanitarian cargo. They also want Russian observers to control non-military uses of the airport, which, in the words of Karadzic, correspond to wishes of representatives of the U.N. secretary-general and the European Union in former Yugoslavia. A statement for the press issued by the sides notes that the arrival of Russian peace-makers in the area of Sarajevo and precise and objective fulfilment of their duty as part of the U.N. Protection Force in former Yugoslavia are a weighty and stabilizing contribution that creates prerequisites for normalization in Sarajevo and around it. The Bosnian Serb leader welcomed the Russian president's initiative to hold a summit in Moscow in order to reach the soonest peace agreement, settle crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina and lift sanctions against former Yugoslavia. When discussing the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Russian side stressed the need for maximum restraint and full cooperation with the U.N., says the statement.
