The researchers synthesized oligomer salts of m-carboranedicarbonic acid and the following bivalent metals: Mg, Ca, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ba, and Pb. According to x-ray analysis, all of the m-carboranedicarbonic acid salts except for the Ba slats were crystalline substances. Most dissolved readily in water, as well as in alcohol and acetone in the presence of water. The infrared [IR] spectra of all of the salts produced were analogous to one another and contained absorption bands characteristic for a BH-carborane grouping (2,620/cm) and COO[.sup]-[/]-salt (1,590-1,650 and 1,270-1,300/cm) bond. According to the elemental analysis performed, every link of the salt, except in the case of the Pb salt, contained one or two molecules of crystallization water that can be removed by vacuum heating at temperatures above 100�C. The water may also be easily replaced by materials such as acetone, diethyl ether, and diethylamine. The Ba salt proved to be unstable in an aqueous solution because of its reaction with the CO[.sup]2[/] in air. The IR spectra of the Ca salt after treatment with diethylamine also contained absorption bands in the 2,959-2,980/cm range (characteristic of CH[.sup]2[/] and CH[.sup]3[/] groups). When heated in a vacuum to 220�C, all of the salts studied decomposed and released varying amounts of hydrogen depending on the individual metal involved. Upon thermal decomposition, the Cu salt released the most hydrogen, and the Mn and Mg salts released the least. X-ray phase analysis established that heating the Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd salts to 220-380�C for 2-4 hours resulted in the formation of pure metals. Pure metals were also formed when the Cu, Pb, and Cd salts were added to polyiminoimides or phenol-formaldehyde resins in the amount of 30 weight percent. The size of the metal particles thus produced ranged from 50 to 300 angstroms depending on treatment temperature. The researchers expressed the hope that the m-carboranedicarbonic acid salts studied can eventually be used to dope various polymers with unoxidized metals in a finely dispersed state so as to produce metal-containing polymers with interesting electrical, magnetic, and other properties.
