This is a flagrant violation of the agreement reached in Geneva by the two warring sides to refrain from military activity and which entered into force on June 10. The Moslem forces strongly attacked with all kinds of weapons including heavy artillery the area of Srbobran (former Donji Vakuf) and Mt Vlasic in central Bosnia-Herzegovina, TANJUG learns from Serb military sources. A number of attacks were also registered in the area of Teslic, Doboj, Ozren, Gradacac, Orasje and Trebava, in northeastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. Moslem armed action was also registered in other northeastern parts of Bosnia -- in the Olovo-Kladanj direction, in the area of Mt Majevica and in the Zvornik area. Moslems launched artillery and mortar attacks on the town of Teslic without inflicting any casualties but causing considerable material damages on civilian facilities. Joint forces of the Croat Defense Council (HVO) and the regular Croatian troops use anti-aircraft guns in their attacks on the Orasje front. The Moslems tried to inflitrate a sabotage-terrorist group in the Orasje part of the front Saturday morning but the group was routed, the press center of the First Krajina Corps of the Bosnian Serb army reports. Moslem action did not stop along the Bihac-Krupa confrontation line in western Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serb military sources state. Moslems also continued attacks on Serb territory from the direction of Gorazde, Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia which has been declared a safe area by the United Nations.
