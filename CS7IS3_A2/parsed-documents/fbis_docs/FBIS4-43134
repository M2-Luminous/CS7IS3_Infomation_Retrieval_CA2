Only this year, a strong revival can be registered. The development in Germany, Austria's largest sales market, was completely different because of the boom in the wake of German unification. In an interview with DIE PRESSE, Jan Stankovsky, foreign trade expert of the Economic Research Institute, says that the decline in exports to West Europe (without the FRG) was due to the recession on the Old Continent. In addition, in 1993 the devaluation that took place in many West European countries in autumn 1992 had a very negative effect. In particular, the deliveries to the devaluating countries Scandinavia, Great Britain, and Italy, registered a strong slump in 1993. On the other hand, the decline in exports to France, which hardly changed the exchange rate of the franc, was limited. Good Economic Development Stankovsky thinks that the upswing in exports to West Europe this year is due to a general revival of the economic development. However, the disadvantages arising from the currencies continue to have an effect because, this time, inflation did not skyrocket so much in the devaluating countries as was the case when the currencies were devalued in the past. "This is a new challenge to the Austrian export industry," Stankovsky says. Therefore, Austria must keep a close watch on its competitiveness. One must observe cost discipline. In addition, one must try to eliminate the existing discriminations on the West European markets by, for instance, joining the European Union. Shifts to the East Cooperation with the young countries in East Europe also offers itself as an opportunity. Domestic companies could shift their wage-cost-intensive productions there and buy cheap subcontractor parts from there to be competitive in West Europe, Stankovsky says. In view of the boom in the wake of German unification, Austrian exports to Germany also developed well in 1991 and 1992. Only in 1993 did the economic situation in the FRG deteriorate all at once, which entailed a decline in Austrian exports. In 1993, Germany had a share of 39 percent of all Austrian exports. West Europe's share of overall exports was 72.9 percent. In the 1990-93 period, imports from West Europe went down only by 1 percent. In 1993, West Europe's share in Austria's overall imports was 74.2 percent.
