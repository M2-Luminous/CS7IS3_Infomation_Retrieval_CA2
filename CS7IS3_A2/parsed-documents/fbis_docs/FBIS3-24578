Shelkovnikov; UDC 535.417:773.93] [Abstract] Organic lightsensitive material GFPM-633, designed for recording phase holograms in a real time mode by He- Ne laser radiation (_l_=632.8nm) with diffraction efficiency upto 90% has been developed. Results are provided on reconstruction experience of phase holograms using this material. It is pointed out that it has a 20mJ/cm[.sup]2[/] sensitivity, for 50% diffraction efficiency and the features of the recording mechanism are examined. It is determined that the material does not provide a high diffraction efficiency of the recorded holograms for a long time. The feasibility is demonstrated of recording on this material Fourier holograms of test images with a diffraction efficiency 9-15% and 50:1 average contrast of the image and also with 10 superimposed holograms. One possible application area of the examined photopolymer materials (PPM) lies in producing phase copies of amplitude templets of synthesized holographic elements. Experience of working with the PPM demonstrated the feasibility of efficient application of theses materials for model experiments on holographic interferometry and for optical information processing.
