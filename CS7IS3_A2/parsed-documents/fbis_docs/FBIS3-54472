Why was the answer from the Voice and Vision organization heresy? There are two main reasons: 1) The repeated interruption of national radio network programming to answer the Majles; 2) Clear insults and accusations against the Majles deputies and the Inquiry and Investigation Group, and consequently the Majles, as the nation's most important body. Of course, the precedent for this was the insult against Mr. Yahyavi, deputy from Tehran. Mr. Yahyavi spent 10 years of his life in the black pits of the Iraqi Ba'thist regime, and the people of Tehran appreciated him greatly. However, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization dealt with him in this way, and used the tools of the Voice and Vision organization as a personal tool. The preliminary step for all votes taken in the Majles is the expression of views by supporters and opponents, and the Voice and Vision organization does not have the right to broadcast a statement supporting one against the other. The things the Voice and Vision organization did during the vote of confidence for the government were done in the interest of one government minister, and after a long time it broadcast an answer. But what is the greater heresy? In its last answer to the Majles public relations office the Voice and Vision organization laid the groundwork for these instances: 1) Preventing the direct broadcast of Majles proceedings; 2) Preventing the publication of pre-agenda speeches, research and investigation reports and anything that has to do with Majles supervisory responsibilities. In his answer, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization mentioned Article 69 of the Constitution[.sup]1[/], and he emphasized the broadcast of Majles proceedings. "If the Constitution had intended the broadcast of proceedings and sessions, it would not have used the term `report,' and instead of that, for example, it would have been written that `proceedings should be broadcast by radio without alteration for public information.'" Now there is the supposition that the broadcast of a "report" on Majles proceedings by a radio announcer during the "direct broadcast" of Majles proceedings could prepare the way for not broadcasting the proceedings directly. Are such masterpieces really the work of one person, or is something afoot to bring despotism back by putting pressure on the Majles and limiting its legal prerogatives? Of course, one person or even a movement are too small to destroy the fruits of 15 years of freedom for the aware nation of Iran. All the nation's forces are under the supervision of the vice-regency of the chief jurisconsult and the way to dictatorship and despotism is closed. The firm principles of the Constitution bespeak this important truth. However, with regard to the latest answer from the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization, one must note the following points: A. In this answer the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization sees himself as being much larger than his true size. Playing the role of the Guardian Council, he has set out to interpret Article 69 of the Constitution, he does not consider the full publication of Majles proceedings to include the pre-agenda speeches and other things, and he wants to stop the direct broadcast of the proceedings. In his answer to the Majles, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization also plays the role of the judiciary, saying: "The Voice and Vision organization is legally required to stop the broadcast of accusations and incorrect statements by the Inquiry and Investigation Commission during the direct broadcast by the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic." Then he adds, "since the research and investigation report was broadcast directly on the radio, the possibility for us to monitor it, obey the law and do our job was taken away from us." That is, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization must determine where there is a problem in the research and investigation report and prevent its broadcast! In his prior answer, he also interfered in the work of the Majles. He asked the Inquiry and Investigation Group to dismiss some of its members. He implied that those who oppose him would be accused of being members of minigroups and being opposed to the Imam! B. Instead of apologizing to the Majles, the Inquiry and Investigation Group and the deputies, against whom he made heavy accusations, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization continued with his illegal and religiously unlawful activities by trying to make justifications and interpretations. It would be better if he would explain which of the above authorities prevented the radio broadcast of the answers from the Voice and Vision organization in order to make these kinds of obstinate activities clear to everyone. It must be noted that Iran's Islamic government rests firmly on the basis of the vice-regency of the chief jurisconsult and the firm principles of the Constitution. The vice-regent has the last word in all affairs. No person or organization can interfere in the work of the government organizations and create confusion. C. In the Constitution the Majles has such a high position that anyone who has a complaint about the work of the Majles, the executive power or the judiciary can submit his complaint in writing to the Majles and the Majles is required to investigate these complaints and to announce the result. Therefore,the Voice and Vision organization does not have the responsibility to investigate the oppression of individuals and it cannot act in accordance with a measure enacted by the Supervisory Council of the Voice and Vision organization, which has been eliminated in the revised version of the Constitution.
