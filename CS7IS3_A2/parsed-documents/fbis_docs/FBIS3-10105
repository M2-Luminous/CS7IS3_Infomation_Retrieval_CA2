In the latest magazine edition, Aracelis Careaga, vice president of the National Commission of Social Attention and Security, attributed black market related crimes, such as robberies and misuse of resources, to the lack of controls. The official also cited as a cause of the phenomenon "the slackness of those who must guard the people's properties, coupled with the existence of unscrupulous individuals who take advantage of the situation in which we find ourselves to enrich themselves." Cuba is facing a serious economic crisis characterized by a lack of products, rampant inflation, an excess of financial liquidity, and a resulting increase in black market activity. Nearly 11 million Cubans receive a reduced basket of basic foodstuffs at subsidized prices via a ration card which has been limited in the last few years as a result of the economic crisis. According to analyses made by independent economists, the people barely satisfy 40 percent of their food needs via the ration card, but they are forced to resort to the black market for the rest. "There is no doubt many of the items that are sold at exorbitant prices on the black market come from state-owned stores, enterprises, and units that are supplying that market," Careaga affirmed. "The social cost of these actions is so high that if no authority exists, we must look for one to act against it, but we must do it urgently," the official remarked. Cuban authorities have been maintaining since last August a police offensive against crime, particularly against the illicit economic activity of robbery and speculation.
