First, I would like to ask you about an issue that draws international attention. The international community has continued discussion on North Korea's (DPRK's) suspected nuclear arms development, with China playing a leading role. I would like to ask how China intends to resolve the issue. [Jiang Zemin] We follow current events with great interest. Patient efforts are necessary to solve complicated issues such as the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The more difficult the issue, the more we need to keep calm. We are calling on all parties concerned to exercise restraint. In solving the issue, the ultimate objectives are to secure stability and peace on the peninsula and to achieve denuclearization there. As long as we do not deviate from these two basic objectives, it is possible to find a way of resolving the issue properly, whatever temporary difficulties may arise. What we should see is that the door to negotiations has not been completely closed and that there is still room for dialogue. All nations concerned need to take active measures to prevent the crisis from intensifying, and they should not let their efforts over the past year be wasted. China does not approve of sanctions. Sanctions will not help us resolve the issue. On the contrary, they will escalate the situation and bring about a result which no one wants to see. The only way for resolving the issue is to continue dialogue. [Takashima] I would like to ask an additional question. Mr. President, you said the door to negotiations has not yet been closed. In concrete terms, what kind of talks do you think will be held in the future? [Jiang] We have consistently hoped that talks among the four concerned parties, including North Korea, will be held. [Takashima] The Japanese people have come to share a stronger belief that relations with China have become more important in view of various issues, including North Korea's nuclear issue. Mr. President, what is your view on the current situation of relations between Japan and China and on future relations? [Jiang] We saw several great changes in Japan's political scene. However, the friendly cooperation between China and Japan in various fields is steadily developing. The Japanese ruling and opposition parties, as well as many Japanese people, share the view that friendly cooperation between Japan and China should be developed. Sino-Japanese friendship is full of great vitality based on common interests, long historical and cultural origins, and a solid foundation of the masses. As a politician, I would like to fall in line with the historical trend of the times and do some solid deeds to help build bilateral relations. The 20th century is coming to an end soon. Between China and Japan, there is a civilian organization called the 21st Century Committee for China-Japan Friendship. This indicates that both the Chinese and Japanese peoples wish to look forward to the 21st century by building Sino- Japanese relations based on mutual understanding, mutual trust, equality, cooperation, and common prosperity. I am fully confident about the future of Sino-Japanese relations. [Takashima] Next I would like to ask you about Sino-U.S. relations, which must be very important in regards to China's foreign affairs. While the United States has extended China's most favored nation [MFN] status, it is also a fact that there is some opposition to it in the United States. Mr. President, how do you feel about the current state of bilateral relations with the United States, and how do you feel about future relations? [Jiang Zemin] President Clinton recently announced his decision to extend China's MFN status and pledged not to link the human rights issue to the MFN status in the future. This decision will help strengthen and expand cooperative ties in economics and trade between China and the United States. It will also conform to the basic interests of the two countries and their peoples. As long as both sides look toward the future, the global situation as a whole, and their basic interests; adhere to the principles set in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, enhance trust, develop cooperation, and avoid confrontation, Sino-U.S. relations will develop smoothly. [Excerpts] [passage omitted on NHK commentators restating what is about to be discussed in the actual interview] [Takashima] Fifteen years have passed since the social market economy and the reform and open-door policies were introduced. The Chinese economy is now making remarkable progress. How do you assess this situation? [Jiang] Major changes have been made during the past decade since we launched the reform and open-door policies. We have formed a versatile economic framework centered around public ownership systems, including the state ownership system. The market has already started to play the fundamental role of distributing [word indistinct]. The areas directly controlled by the government are already shrinking. The 14th Communist Party of China [CPC] National Congress in 1992 confirmed the socialist market economy's goals. We adopted a resolution regarding the establishment of the socialist market economy at the 3d Plenary Session of the [13th] CPC Central Committee, which was held in November last year. We are preponderantly solving problems on the basis of these decisions. The socialist market economy is linked to socialism's fundamental systems. There is no precedence for making such a system. It is creative work and, needless to say, we face various problems. For example, we have to find solutions to how we will maintain a balance between reform, development, and stability; regulate the roles of macro control and market; bring about the enterprising spirit in the urban and local areas; link material culture with spiritual culture; realize overall social progress centered around economic construction; and etc. We already have some experiences in the field of recognizing and treating these problems. Our tasks, or the framework of the CPC's tasks, are moving toward a new direction on the basis of the policies designed to find a chance, promote reform, expand the open- door policies, promote progress, and maintain stability. We can fulfill this historic responsibility through the party's unified guidance and joint efforts by the people of each nationality across the nation under Comrade Deng Xiaoping's ideology of socialism, which is peculiar to China, and the CPC's fundamental line. We will establish the social market economic system by the end of the 21st century and will complete the building of an affluent and democratic socialist nation by around the middle of the 21st century. [Excerpts] [Takashima] In the remarks you have just made, Mr. President, you mentioned that problems of various types have surfaced in the Chinese economy. There are such problems as disparity between urban and rural areas and corruption, which has been reported in several localities. You said that positive measures will be taken to deal with these problems. I would like to hear what practical plans you have in mind to resolve these domestic problems that China is now facing. [Jiang] All those problems that I have just mentioned are connected with each other. First, further efforts should be made to build a clean government and to get rid of corruption. These are the conditions required for establishing the socialist market economic system, and at the same time, they will affect the success or failure of our reform policy. Our party and government maintain a very clear-cut position on this issue. The economy will be developed and the government will become a clean one. Generally speaking, the large majority of our cadres are good. Only a small number are corrupt, and severe disciplinary actions will be taken against them in accordance with party discipline and state laws. Various measures have already been taken and some results have been gradually achieved through educational, administrative, juridical, and other measures. Efforts will be made to get rid of corruption and our determination is supported by the general public. With the economy's development, disparity has come to exist and expand between urban and rural areas as well as among various localities. There are various reasons for such a phenomenon. The basic objective of socialism lies in eliminating poverty and sharing prosperity. And therein also lies the objective of efforts to promote reform and development. It is also an important factor for maintaining stability of our society and unity of our nation. In the course of attaining this objective, there naturally exists differences in the speed of achievement among various localities, with some developing faster than others. We encourage those localities with favorable conditions to promote development at a faster speed. At the same time, we encourage other localities that are developing at a slower pace to speed up their development by making good use of their strong points. We encourage those localities developing at a faster speed to assist other localities developing at a slower pace with funds, technology, and talented people. The government will also provide sufficient assistance to those localities developing at a slower pace in such areas as policy, finance, and materials. At present, we are engaged in promoting a mid-term 7-year program to eliminate poverty. We intend to resolve problems in seven years for 80 million people who have not solved such basic necessities as food and clothing. We are convinced that through such measures, the disparity between urban and rural areas and among various localities, will be gradually reduced. Such disparity between urban and rural areas and among various localities also exist in various countries of the world. We are willing to learn from other countries' useful experiences in resolving this problem. At the same time, we will basically and eventually resolve this problem with the strength of socialism and our own practice and experiences. The superiority of the socialist system lies in the idea of all people sharing prosperity and making progress. When viewed from a long-term standpoint, the disparity existing between urban and rural areas and among various localities will gradually be reduced, but will never expand. Otherwise, stability in our society and country cannot be maintained. We have a very clear understanding of these problems. Measures to deal with these issues are being perfected day by day. [Excerpts] [Takashima] Mr. President, it has been widely reported that you visited Shanxi Province last January and firmly stated your resolve to stamp out absolute poverty, as you have just mentioned, within this century, and that you also said the development of rural districts and their stability hold the key to China's development and stability. Do you think there is sufficient time to solve the problem by the end of the century? It has been said that there are concerns in some quarters that the gap between cities and rural districts may cause social unrest in China. How do you feel about this? [Jiang] Regarding this problem, we have already explained our policy. That is, while acknowledging the disparity that actually exists among regions, our job is directed toward reducing such gaps. These problems can be solved through our efforts and through appropriate measures and policies. [Takashima] One last question. Mr. President, you are also the commander in chief of the Chinese military. Let me ask you about the future of the People's Liberation Army [PLA]. What do you have in mind regarding plans to reform the PLA? Also, looking at China from the outside, it has been pointed out that China has been building up its military. For example, it has been noted that China increased its defense spending by 22 percent this year. Please let us hear about your views regarding the PLA's future. [Jiang] To protect our sovereignty and our territories, preserve the nation's unity, ensure our people's safety, and ensure socialism can be modernized and constructed in a safe and stable environment, the PLA is burdened with heavy responsibilities. The basic policy regarding military buildup at a certain period in the future is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea on military buildup in a new age -- that is, China's unique way of modernizing its military and improving its quality, in particular, improving hi-tech defense capabilities. We will gradually change the PLA into a modern regular revolutionary army. The Chinese Government's investment in military construction is very limited. This year's defense budget is 52 billion yuan, which is around 1.7 percent of the gross national product. It is about 6 billion U.S. dollars and less than one-fifth of Japan's [defense budget]. The amount of Japan's [defense budget] exceeds $30 billion. Military expenses per person is even less. The small increase in the military budget is purely for defense purposes and will not pose a threat to other countries. All knowledgeable people in the world admit that stability in China will serve for stability in Asia and the world. The Chinese people, who went through difficulties during wartime, truly want peace and stability while promoting socialism's modernization. China will not take part in an arms race, form military alliances, nor engage in power disputes. [passage omitted on NHK commentators restating what has just been discussed in the actual interview]
