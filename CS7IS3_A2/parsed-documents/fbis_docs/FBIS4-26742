First, the state-owned enterprise provides part of its assets to establish a new enterprise with the overseas investor, and the state-owned enterprise -- being one partner of the joint venture -- continues to exist. Most joint ventures launched by state-owned enterprises and overseas investors have adopted this form. Second, the state-owned enterprise contributes the whole of its assets to form a joint venture with overseas investment, and the original state-owned enterprise does not exist independently after being merged into the joint venture. Not many Chinese-foreign joint ventures have adopted this second form yet. Using external capital is a major measure for accelerating the process of modernization in our country, and further increasing the use of external capital is also an invariable policy laid down by our government. The joint ventures launched by state-owned enterprises and overseas investors will promote the reform and development of our state-owned enterprises. In general, joint ventures are set up according to the modern enterprise system, and they will provide useful experience for the reform of the state-owned enterprises. Some state-owned enterprises are facing "two systems," and directly feel the competition pressure from the joint ventures so that they have accelerated the transformation of the management mechanism. The use of foreign capital also will play a role in prompting state-owned enterprises to make technological progress, enhance the management level, and upgrade products. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to support the joint ventures launched by state-owned enterprises and overseas investors. At present, using external capital to accelerate development has become the consensus of all the people, and state-owned enterprises in all localities have great enthusiasm for launching joint ventures. Some localities even proposed that foreign investment be grafted onto all state-owned enterprises, thus turning them into joint ventures, and some localities offered excessive favors to the joint ventures in order to achieve quick results, and the loose management over the joint ventures led to the loss of state assets. In the course of using external capital, should all state-owned enterprises be turned into joint ventures? How should we prevent the loss of state assets? We need to understand these questions correctly and approach them seriously. Continuing to expand the use of external capital and to support the joint ventures launched by state-owned enterprises and overseas investors does not mean that everything has to be based on a joint venture. Still less does this mean that all state-owned enterprises have to be turned into joint ventures. The market economy we are pursuing is a socialist market economy, which will continue to maintain the predominant position of socialist public ownership. Of course, this does not mean that state-owned enterprises will monopolize all trades in all localities without discrimination. Rather, this means primarily that the public assets will account for a predominant proportion in gross social assets and that the state-owned economy will control the lifeline of the national economy and play a leading role in economic development. This is explicitly expounded by the decision adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. We should try to use as much foreign capital as possible, but it is unnecessary and also impossible for us to turn all state-owned enterprises into joint ventures. We should continue to expand the scope of foreign investment, but this does not mean that we will completely open all sectors of the economy -- especially the lifeline of the national economy -- to foreign investment. Some industries may be completely opened to foreign investment, some industries may be opened with certain limits, and some industries may not be opened at all. Some localities and enterprises are anxious to seek external investment and set up joint ventures because they think that they may spend money to "buy a good mechanism." In fact, launching joint ventures is not the only way to invigorate state-owned enterprises. As long as we quicken the reform of the state-owned enterprises, establish a modern enterprise system, and further transform their operational mechanisms, state-owned enterprises certainly will increase their vigor and dynamism, and will play a great role in economic development, especially in the lifeline scope of the national economy. The joint investment made by state-owned enterprises and overseas companies should be made positively and also prudently. Attention should be paid to preventing the loss of state assets. It should be made clear that the joint investment itself does not mean the loss of state assets. No matter whether the state-owned enterprises provide part or all of their assets for the joint ventures, being shareholders, they will continue to earn dividends. The development of the joint venture also will increase state assets. Even if the original state-owned enterprises are merged into the joint ventures in the form of auctions, the state assets involved will simply change from materials into monetary value and the quantity of state assets will not decrease. The Chinese side may have monetary income through the auctions and may make reinvestment in other enterprises. We must pay attention to preventing any loss of state assets in the process of launching joint ventures. Some localities gave excessive favors to external investors in violation of the state policies, as they were anxious to set up more joint ventures. They sold land at low prices, offered repeated tax exemptions and reductions, and failed to evaluate or underestimated the value of the Chinese side's assets. On the other hand, some external investors overestimated the value of the equipment they invested or took equipment of poor quality as advanced equipment, thus encroaching on the Chinese side's assets. Such things must not be allowed to happen. It is necessary to more effectively manage the work of inviting external investment, to establish perfect regulations, and to enhance the quality of investment invitation work. Equality and mutual benefit is a basic principle in our use of foreign capital. The legitimate rights and interests of external businessmen should be protected; the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese side must not be harmed either.
