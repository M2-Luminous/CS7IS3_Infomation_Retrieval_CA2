FR940620-0-00051 FR940620-0-00017 33 CFR Part 165 [COTP St. Louis 94&hyph;009] RIN 2115&hyph;AA97 Safety Zone; Upper Mississippi River, Mile 685.5 to Mile 688.5 AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone on the Upper Mississippi River. This regulation is needed to control vessel traffic in the regulated area to prevent erosion of the pilot channel. The regulation will restrict general navigation in the regulated area for the safety of vessel traffic and the protection of life and property along the river. EFFECTIVE DATES: This regulation is effective on June 10, 1994 and will terminate on July 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LT Siddall, Operations Officer, Captain of the Port, St. Louis, Missouri at (314) 539&hyph;3823. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The drafters of this regulation are ENS Andrew Cheney, Project Officer, Marine Safety Office, St. Louis, Missouri and LCDR A.O. Denny, Project Attorney, Second Coast Guard District Legal Office. Regulatory History In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, a falling river has contributed to shoaling and necessitated creation of a pilot channel for safe navigation of the area. As a result, the Coast Guard deems it to be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation immediately. Background and Purpose Lowered river levels have reduced navigational channel depths in this section of the Upper Mississippi River. Shoaling has resulted in several groundings and the subsequent establishment of a narrow pilot channel. This regulation is designed to protect the integrity of the pilot channel and to ensure safe navigation of this part of the river. Immediate publication is required to sustain commercial vessel operation. Regulatory Evaluation This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal; that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10E of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary because the restrictions are anticipated to be of short duration. Changes will be announced by Marine Safety Information Radio Broadcast on VHF Marine Band Radio, Channel 22 (157.1 MHZ). Mariners may also call the Port Operations Officer, Captain of the Port, St. Louis, Missouri at (314) 539&hyph;3823 for current information. Small Entities The Coast Guard finds that the impact on small entities, if any, is not substantial. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq ) that this temporary rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq ). Federalism Assessment The Coast Guard has analyzed this regulation under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that it does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
