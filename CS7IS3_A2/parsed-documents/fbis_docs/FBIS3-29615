The request was made at a meeting of deputy finance ministers in Washington. Kosuke Nakahira, the Japanese representative at the meeting held at the U.S. Treasury Department, told reporters he told his G-7 colleagues that volatility in foreign exchange rates is not desirable. Nakahira, vice finance minister for international affairs, also said he explained the state of the Japanese economy and the government's series of actions to pull it out of the prolonged recession, including the 15 trillion yen pump-priming package unveiled earlier this month. He did not give any indication, however, of whether the so-called G-7 deputies reached any agreement on his request. The finance officials met to prepare for next Saturday's meeting in Frankfurt of the G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors. The G-7 groups Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. The Frankfurt talks were originally expected to be focused on aid to Russia, but Japan now hopes that the G-7 countries will send some signals to the market that they do not desire further wild swings in the yen's value. The Japanese currency gained as much as 6 yen at one stage in last week's trading, propelled by speculation that the collapse of Japan-U.S. "Framework" trade talks may prompt the U.S. to deliberately guide the yen higher to slim its colossal trade deficit with Tokyo.
