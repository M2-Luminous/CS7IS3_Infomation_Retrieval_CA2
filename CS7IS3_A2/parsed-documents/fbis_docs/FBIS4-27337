Ordinary profit for the nine companies decreased 21 percent, the first decrease for three consecutive terms since the war. With the prolonged sluggish economy, major divisions such as machinery have had a hard fight, and a decline in sales due to the high yen has had an effect. With the drop in interest, the financial balance has improved, but it has not been able to compensate for the drop in regular business. The major trading companies have depreciated a large amount of bad assets across the board. The period ending in March 1995 will also have a grim business environment and there is a great probability that there will be no more than a weak profit. Sales for the nine companies in the previous term were about 103 trillion yen, a decrease of about 7 percent. The erosion of sales due to the high yen amounted to 1 trillion yen for Mitsubishi Corp. and 860 billion yen for Sumitomo Corp.; Mitsui & Co. increased its precious metal dealings and was the only one to have higher earnings. Gross sales profits were down for all companies, decreasing 6 percent, a total of 1,434.7 billion yen, for the nine companies. With the drop in interest, Mitsubishi Corp. at 7.1 billion yen and Mitsui & Co. at 4 billion yen turned to a financial surplus, and Marubeni and Itohchu also reduced their deficit margin. However, the slump in regular business has had an effect and ordinary profits decreased in seven companies. Since the heavy electrical and plant division exports for Asia have progressed steadily, Marubeni has had an increase in ordinary profits on a real basis except for stock sales profits, and Tomen had a slight decrease in profits on a real basis. The scale for depreciation of bad assets reached the highest level in the past for all such as Mitsubishi Corp., Itohchu, and Marubeni. In particular, they are hastening the liquidation of the financial engineering that expanded in the bubble era, and specified money trusts [tokkin] and fund trust balances that embrace latent losses have become half that of a year ago at a little over 600 billion yen in the nine company total. The move to dispose of unprofitable group companies at home and abroad also has been conspicuous. They have squeezed out stock and real estate sales profits, but aftertax profits of the various companies have been greatly reduced, and Mitsubishi Corp. and others have disposed of internal reserves to maintain dividends. As a result of full-scale depreciation of bad assets, it has been emphasized by various companies that "the operating burden has been alleviated" (Tetsuro Kitaoka, Marubeni director) and "we are approaching healthiness, and a system to undertake new commercial right acquisitions is ready" (Tetsuo Uemura, Mitsubishi Corp. director). The various companies are anticipating an economic recovery this term from the second term, but it seems that it is possible that the nine-company total for ordinary profits will decline for four consecutive terms if the recovery scenario breaks down.
