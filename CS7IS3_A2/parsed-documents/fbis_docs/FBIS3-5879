"The ministry saw no problems under the current telecom rules after investigations based on the complaint, virtually dismissing it," the official told KYODO NEWS SERVICE. The information was offered by "reliable government sources," said Toshio Kawakami, president of USF Pacific Inc., a Tokyo-based agent for us Fibercom Network Inc. in New York. Three Japanese common carriers led by KDD, a former international phone monopoly, lodged the petition in January, requesting the ministry conduct a probe into the "call-back" discount services which they claimed use their lines unfairly, free of charge. A KDD spokesman said his company has not heard of the decision from the ministry, and noted that the complaint filed in January did not involve any requests for concrete measures. "Its nature was to explain the problems and not something that the ministry would reject." The other Japanese concerns involved in the petition were International Digital Communications Inc. and International Telecom Japan Inc. Under the call-back system, users call a switching center in the United States and hang up after two rings. After a few seconds, the center calls back and the users dial the actual number they want to call, the country of "origin" of the call now being the United States, where rates are lower. Stressing that the services are not illegal, either domestically or internationally, Kawakami said, "imposing restrictions was from the outset impossible because the Telecommunications Law would have to be revised to do so." He added that the ministry would not want to create new regulations now that Japan is pushing ahead with deregulation to allow better access by foreign firms, in an attempt to address trade disputes with the U.S. After the complaint was filed, USF Pacific and some other Japanese agents of U.S. discount operators issued a statement in January, saying they were ready to talk if the Japanese operators offered a "reasonable" line-usage charge. They also warned that they were prepared to file a counter petition with the U.S. Government if their services were blocked. The KDD spokesman said the discount service is becoming an international problem, and "we just wanted the ministry to recognize this." He noted, "We also want to solve the problem through talks, and if they fail, actual actions will be taken such as filing a petition with the ministry to allow changing our rules stipulated in contracts with users." There still are no plans to start talks with the discount service operators, the spokesman said, adding that KDD is now consulting with U.S. common carriers including American Telephone and Telegraph Co.
