The UN nuclear watchdog warned that if Pyongyang fails to issue entry visas to IAEA inspectors by month's end, the director-general will call a special board meeting to discuss the issue. North Korean Counselor Yun Ho-chin said his government had offered March 1 as the date for IAEA inspectors to arrive in Pyongyang at a working-level meeting with the United States in New York on Tuesday. The IAEA's 35-member board of governors ended its first regular meeting of 1994 here amid concerns about North Korea's delay in issuing visas for IAEA inspectors, releasing a statement calling on Pyongyang to follow up on its decision to allow IAEA inspections, including issuing the visas. Board Chairman Ronald Walker said it had asked Director-General Hans Blix to immediately convene an extraordinary board meeting "in the absence of satisfactory developments in connection with the inspection, notably if a firm, early date for the start of the inspection had not been settled by the end of this month." A U.S. delegate said that in order for the third round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks to take place, Pyongyang must meet all IAEA inspection requirements, adding that an extraordinary board meeting would likely resolve to turn over the issue to the UN Security Council. Over 40 national delegates spoke during the two-day meeting, many of them criticizing North Korea for failing to issue visas to IAEA inspectors by the final day. The IAEA moved the North Korean issue from the first-day agenda to the second day, hoping that Pyongyang would issue the visas by then. Not only the West but also pro-North Korea nations, such as Cuba and Syria, have charged Pyongyang with trying to resolve the nuclear issue outside the IAEA, linking the matter to improving relations with the United States, IAEA sources said. Speaking at the meeting, North Korean delegate Yun warned that if the IAEA continued to apply "unreasonable pressure" on North Korea, it would invite "grave results, including cancellation of the decision to suspend withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty." But Yun, disclosing his government had offered March 1 as the date for IAEA inspectors to arrive in Pyongyang at the meeting with the U.S. Government in New York on Tuesday, said visas would be issued on Thursday at the earliest, depending on the results of another North Korea-U.S. contact in New York on Wednesday. Noting that Pyongyang must still negotiate the U.S. demand for an exchange of special envoys between North and South Korea as a condition for further high-level North Korea-U.S. talks, the North Korean delegate warned his government would reconsider its decision to accept IAEA inspections if a special IAEA board of governors meeting was held. The meeting adopted a resolution urging North Korea to implement its Feb. 15 agreement to allow IAEA inspections of its declared nuclear facilities and meet all obligations of the nuclear safeguards pact, including permission to inspect undeclared nuclear sites.
