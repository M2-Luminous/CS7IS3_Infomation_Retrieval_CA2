[Al-'Anani] We hope that this agreement will be a step toward a comprehensive solution that will enable the Palestinian people to enjoy their full rights on their national soil and establish peace and future regional prosperity. Of course this step required much discussion and passed through many stages. I believe that the signing of the agreement in Cairo, with the backing of Egyptian foreign policy and political assistance at the highest Egyptian levels, constitutes an important step that gives us fresh hope that the peace negotiations will eventually produce practical results. Although some problems exist and some people take a different view of the matter, we see it as a good step and as a prelude to better future steps, God willing. [Riyad] Dr. al-'Anani, as Your Excellency noted, these negotiations took a long time and some problems remain unresolved. However the major issues pertaining to the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles have been settled and solutions satisfactory to both sides have been found. Negotiations on other points and details will resume in Taba and Paris. Do you believe that the time factor is important at this stage? [Al-'Anani] The time factor is certainly important because the people must be continuing to hope that the entire peace process is proceeding toward practical implementation. I believe that a long time has passed since the Madrid conference. Additionally, the Declaration of Principles of 13 September 1993 specified a timetable for actual measures. The specified Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho should have taken place in December 1993. Delay produces frustration among the people and encourages the feeling that the peace process is slow and might lead nowhere. However, this recent and specific achievement bodes well, shows that matters are proceeding toward actual implementation, and that people will regain their lawful rights. [Riyad] Do you believe that progress on the Palestinian-Israeli track will give impetus to the negotiations on the other tracks, particularly the Syrian track? [Al-'Anani] In Jordan we always believe that progress on any track will eventually have a positive impact on the other tracks. In the short term, this might not appear true because the so-called Israeli public opinion does not appear able to cope with progress on more than one track at a time. This gives the impression that progress on one negotiating track might be at the expense of another. I believe, nevertheless, that any success must necessarily produce hope and reinforce the credibility of the negotiations on the other tracks. [Riyad] Dr. al-'Anani, perhaps there is stagnation now on the Syrian track, contrary to what was expected immediately after the Clinton-al-Asad Geneva meeting. Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres is urging that the level of talks with Syria be raised. He believes it is necessary to hold a summit between Rabin and al-Asad. Do you think the time is propitious to hold such a summit? [Al-'Anani] Of course we leave the answer to this question to our brothers in Syria. They know better. I believe they have given a reply to this Israeli proposal. Certainly it is not a question of raising or lowering the level of the talks. Everything has its own symbols and significance. We believe that the negotiations conducted by the Syrian and Israeli delegations for two years in Washington did not produce definite results. As a result of Israel's intransigence, the talks fell into a vicious circle. We believe it is time to get things moving. The heads of the delegations will hold consultative meetings starting next Tuesday [15 February]. If Rabinovich, the head of the Israeli delegation, is willing to make constructive proposals to Mr. al-'Allaf, the head of the Syrian delegation, and the Syrian leadership judges that these proposals need to be discussed at a higher level and that a possibility exists to make definite progress, then I believe that the Syrian leadership will decide to raise the level of negotiations. If things remain unchanged, however, I do not believe there will be sufficient reason to raise the level of negotiations. [Riyad] Dr. al-'Anani, one last question. Do you expect progress on the Jordanian negotiating track at this stage? [Al-'Anani] At this time? [Riyad] Yes. [Al-'Anani] According to the statements we heard from Israeli officials, it appears that, following the progress on the Palestinian front, they are focusing on the Syrian track. We in Jordan have no objections at all. We believe that progress on any Arab negotiating track is an achievement serving the objective of the comprehensive peaceful solution that we constantly advocate. It is still possible for progress to occur on the Jordanian track. Our position is perfectly clear. It is necessary to begin by solving the water and border issues. So far, the Israelis do not seem willing to discuss these issues with sufficient clarity. They might be somewhat flexible on the water issue, but we have seen no movement on their part in connection with the border issue. If they show a willingness to make progress on this point and expedite measures to return the occupied Jordanian territories, this will open the way to reasonable solutions on the other points on the Jordanian-Israeli agenda. [Riyad] Dr. al-'Anani, thank you. [Al-'Anani] You are welcome.
