The feasibility plan anticipates an income of $200 million during the satellite's 11-year life span. The joint venture founded by the Antenna Hungaria Company plans to start a satellite program called Magyarsat, we reported yesterday. The Hungarian regional telecommunication satellite could insure comprehensive and unified broadcasting and telecommunication in the region. According to the plans, the light telecommunication satellite of the Amos family, weighing less than 1,000 kg, would be launched by the French carrier rocket Ariane. Currently in Europe, apart from international programs, two or three countries have their own national satellites. There is great demand on the market for free channels, largely because recently Eutelsat attempted to launch two new satellites, but the devices were destroyed. Magyarsat will be insured, so that investors would suffer no loss because of possible errors in the system. The range of Magyarsat would completely cover Mid-Central Europe. Apart from broadcasting satellite television programs, it would aid business communication. Moreover, because it would cover the entire country, it could also alleviate telephone problems in areas which are hard to reach by cable. The control center of the satellite would be in Hungary, and Hungarian specialists would be in charge of its technical supervision. Viewers could receive the television programs using a satellite dish with a diameter of 70-90 cm.
