Zhirinovskiy was invited to the Czech Republic at the beginning of February by the extreme right Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC), which has 8 out of the total of 200 parliamentary seats. Havel said on February 6 that "Mr. Zhirinovskiy has a diplomatic passport, he can come here and then it will depend on him what he says here and whether or not our authorities find it suitable to possibly expel him." Zhirinovskiy announced in Warsaw on Monday that he would arrive on Sunday, March 20, for a two-day visit to the Czech Republic. The Czech Foreign Ministry said on Monday it did not think that Zhirinovskiy's possible visit could help promote Czech-Russian relations. Marek Skolil, the ministry's press department director, told CTK the ministry learnt about Zhirinovskiy's intention to visit the Czech Republic from the media. The chairman of the government coalition Christian Democratic Party (KDS), Ivan Pilip, told CTK it would be better if Zhirinovskiy did not visit the Czech Republic. "Political extremism has radiated many times and most clearly from Zhirinovskiy's statements, and it would not be good not to counter it only because he does not have real executive political power at the moment," Pilip said. He added that this could change given the current situation in Russia. Otakar Vychodil (Civic Democratic Party), a member of the parliamentary foreign committee, told CTK that he personally did not think that Zhirinovskiy's visit could influence the political situation in the Czech Republic. Miloslav Vyborny (Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, KDU-CSL), chairman of the parliamentary constitutional-legal committee, said he was not enthusiastic about Zhirinovskiy's forthcoming visit. "Nevertheless, I do not think that we could prevent the visit in any way." The opposition Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) is ready to call on the public to stage demonstrations to express disagreement with Zhirinovskiy's visit, CSSD Deputy Chairman Pavel Novak told CTK. He said "it is not only up to the government, but to all democratic political parties to use all possibilities of expressing their disagreement with his [Zhirinovskiy's] fascist views," Novak added. Jaroslav Ortman, chairman of the parliamentary deputies' group Left Bloc (LB), told CTK that the Republicans' invitation to Zhirinovskiy was an expression of contempt for both the Czech Republic and humanism in politics. The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) does not agree with many of Zhirinovskiy's statements which it considers to be extremely nationalistic, the party's spokeswoman Vera Zezulkova told CTK. But she added that it should not be forgotten that Zhirinovskiy's party "has to a certain degree narrowed the maneuvering scope of those political groups and the economic lobby hidden behind them which directly promoted foreign interests in Russia and which wanted to treat Russia as a mere colony." "It will be decisive for the development of our relations to Zhirinovskiy... whether he will respect the principles of equality and full sovereignty of all states and nations," Zezulkova said.
