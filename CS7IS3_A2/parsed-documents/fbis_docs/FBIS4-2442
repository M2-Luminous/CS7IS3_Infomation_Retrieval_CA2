A U.N. military spokesman in Sarajevo said that two NATO F-16s, which are U.S. war planes based in the northern Italian town of Aviano, attacked the Serb positions after a request by the United Nations. The U.N. officials said two Serb tanks were hit during the attack. It was the first time during the two-year Bosnian war that the United Nations requested attacks on ground positions. In late February, NATO war planes shot down four Serb aircraft which violated the "no fly zone" over Bosnia.
