Katyusha rockets slammed into the districts of Khur Maksar close to Aden airport, Ma'allah near the port and Shaykh 'Uthman in the northern suburbs, killing four people and wounding 28 others, hospital officials said. In fierce fighting on the northwest front at B'ir Ahmad, 15 kilometres (nine miles) from Aden, four soldiers were wounded, they added. Northern troops, who have kept up a barrage of rockets and artillery fire on the southern stronghold for more than a week, advanced overnight into the town of Bi'r Ahmad after seizing the entrance on Thursday, an AFP correspondent reported. Fighting had died down earlier Friday but southern troops were massing armoured cars to launch a counter-offensive on their northern rivals loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. At least 113 civilians have now been killed and about 400 wounded since the north unleashed its assault on the city last Thursday, according to a toll by hospital officials. Thirty people, mostly civilians, were killed and close to 150 wounded on Thursday as rocket and artillery fire rained on the city in the fiercest day of shelling so far. In Aden residents still have to queue up at 72 wells for water, even though southern authorities have managed to reconnect supplies from the main pumping station at Bi'r Nasir, close to the northern front, hit by northern fire several days ago. International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) officials said water supplies were "vulnerable" to contamination. They are helping the city authorities install proper pumps, so residents do not throw plastic containers directly into the water supply. Both the ICRC and a spokeswoman for Medecins Sans Frontieres said there were no signs of any epidemics breaking out in the city. By advancing from the northwest, northern troops are hoping to cut off Aden from the power station in Hiswah, 10 kilometres (six miles) from Aden and the oil refinery at Little Aden, 15 kilometres (nine miles) from the city. Military sources said the south had inflicted heavy losses on northern troops at Bi'r Ahmad, where "a large number" had been killed, 23 tanks destroyed and another seven captured. The rival troops exchanged artillery fire on all fronts round the embattled city, but southern warplanes continued taking off from the airport, despite the shelling. A military spokesman in the city said two northern missiles fired on "economic targets" were blown up by southern anti-aircraft fire. Meanwhile, southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid was holding more meetings with tribal leaders in a bid to get them to help repel the northern forces. On Thursday southern leaders pleaded for foreign intervention to break the tightening stranglehold on Aden. They said the north was violating a UN ceasefire call adopted in a Security Council resolution on June 1. Northern Planning Minister 'Abd-al Karim al-Iryani left Sanaa Thursday for New York, where he is to meet with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to discuss the situation in Aden. UN special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi failed to broker a ceasefire in a 10-day tour of the region. Four ceasefires have collapsed since the war erupted on May 5, shattering a four-year uneasy union between the former tribal, conservative North Yemen and the Marxist South.
