Guess who is going to Strasbourg? The man with the most votes, Silvio Berlusconi, is not going there, despite almost three million personal preference votes in the five electoral districts in which he headed the list. As prime minister, Berlusconi cannot be elected to the European Parliament, but the plebiscite is nonetheless impressive. To give an idea, the second person is Gianfranco Fini, with two million preference votes (but the National Alliance leader received most of his votes in the South); while in third place we find PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] Secretary Achille Occhetto, for whom obviously 1,100,000 personal votes obtained in three--not five--voting districts, were not enough to avoid his resignation yesterday. Cut down in size but elected were all the other leaders, from Umberto Bossi [Northern League] to Mario Segni [Pact for Italy], from Marco Pannella [Radical] to Carlo Ripa di Meana [Greens], from Fausto Bertinotti [Communist Renewal] to Pierferdinando Casini, coordinator of the Christian Democratic Center, who, campaigning in the south under the Forza Italia banner, came immediately after Berlusconi with another 200,000 votes. Even more notable was the feat of Leoluca Orlando who had the satisfaction -- unique in Italy -- of beating Berlusconi in Palermo, the city of which the Rete leader is mayor. Remaining with the mayors, the following have become members of the European Parliament: Marco Formentini of Milan (Northern League); Salvatore Tatarella of Cerignola (National Alliance); the brother of Deputy Prime Minister Giuseppe; and Giancarlo Cito of Taranto, the owner of the local TV6 television station, elected at the head of his own list, the Southern Action League. Also elected was Bologna's mayor Renzo Imbeni (PDS). [passage omitted]
