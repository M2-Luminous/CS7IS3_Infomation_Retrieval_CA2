He added that one should not be very optimistic about the NATO announcement that it does not deem it necessary to launch an air raid on the Serbian positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina at this stage. In an assessment to Turkish Radio and Television following the NATO announcement that it does not deem it necessary to launch an air raid on Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cetin recalled that the regions outside Sarajevo are also under siege by the Serbs. Pointing out that NATO should take action on that issue as well, Cetin said Turkey will take steps to achieve this end. Noting that he discussed the NATO ultimatum by phone with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, Cetin said: Our goal is not to launch an air raid at all costs. Our goal -- everyone's goal -- was to end the siege on Sarajevo. Now, are we faced with a delaying tactic or have physical conditions prevented it? This will be clarified in the coming hours. In our view, what is more important is that one should not view this development too optimistically. Cetin stated that if, in the aftermath of recent developments, the Bosnian Muslims are attacked and cannot defend themselves, then the world and NATO will be responsible for the consequences. Cetin added: By not lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the world, which bears moral responsibility for all the tragedy that has been caused so far, will now be directly responsible for what happens. I do not even want to think that NATO will permit such a thing to happen at this stage. I believe NATO will do what is necessary. Cetin concluded by saying that the necessary pressure should be applied to the Serbs and Croats to secure the just requests of the Bosnians and that [words indistinct].
