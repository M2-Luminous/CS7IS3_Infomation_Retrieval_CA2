Gherman said that the PDSR had a very clear point of view on snap elections. "Although we are not afraid of early elections, we deem they are counterproductive, it may even be dangerous to favor them," mentioned the politician. The PDSR chairman expanded by saying that huge sums of money would be necessary for the organization of early elections this year, which is decisive for the reform and characterized by financial shrinking. Gherman opined that the political spectrum had not changed considerably since 1992 and mentioned that a new electoral law should be drafted. The 1992 polls were held in keeping with a law written uniquely for them, added Gherman. According to the PDSR chairman, favoring early elections is tantamount to political frivolity.
