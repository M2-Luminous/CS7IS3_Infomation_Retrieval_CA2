FR941227-0-00031 FR941227-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;25&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9100; AD 94&hyph;26&hyph;04] Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Model 4101 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes, that currently requires inspections to detect damage of the ball bearings in the aileron quadrants, replacement of damaged ball bearings with new ball bearings, and adjustment to the secondary stops. This amendment requires installation of new swivel bearings in the aileron quadrants, which, when accomplished, will terminate the inspection requirement. This amendment is prompted by the development of a modification that eliminates the need to inspect repetitively. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the bearings in the aileron quadrants, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane. DATES: Effective January 26, 1995. The incorporation by reference of Jetstream Alert Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A&hyph;27&hyph;026, Revision 2, dated January 17, 1994, and Jetstream Service Bulletin J41&hyph;27&hyph;027, dated January 17, 1994, is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of January 26, 1995. The incorporation by reference of Jetstream Alert Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A&hyph;27&hyph;026, Revision 1, dated December 7, 1993, was approved previously by the Director of the Federal Register as of March 28, 1994 (59 FR 11531, March 11, 1994). ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Jetstream Aircraft, Incorporated, P.O. Box 16029, Dulles International Airport, Washington, DC 20041&hyph;6029. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Schroeder, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2148; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, Amendment 39&hyph;8849 (59 FR 11531, March 11, 1994), which is applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes, was published in the Federal Register on May 4, 1994 (59 FR 23031). The action proposed to require installation of new swivel bearings in the left and right aileron quadrants (Modification JM41307A) as terminating action for the currently required inspections. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years in calculating the economic impact of AD activity. In order to account for various inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per work hour to $60 per work hour. The economic impact information, below has been revised to reflect this increase in the specified hourly labor rate.
