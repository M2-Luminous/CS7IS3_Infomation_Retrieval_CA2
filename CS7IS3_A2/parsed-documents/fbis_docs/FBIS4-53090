"The Japanese economy will likely get onto a path of full-fledged recovery during fiscal 1994," which started on April 1, said Yoshio Terasawa, director general of the Economic Planning Agency [EPA]. The economy will receive a boost from brisk housing investments and income tax cuts, which will help reduce inventories of durable goods, he said. He predicted consumer spending will pick up, thereby improving private-sector sentiment, and that capital investments will eventually start recovering. Consumer spending and corporate capital investments are two main driving forces for the economy.
