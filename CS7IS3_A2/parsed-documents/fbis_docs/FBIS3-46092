The exchange, sponsored by the Ministry of Internal Trade and the Sichuan provincial government, will admit domestic and overseas enterprises, brokerage companies and financial institutions as members for a fee of 200,000 yuan (about 23,000 U.S. dollars). The transactions will be managed by public bidding with the aid of computers. China's biggest wholesale meat market was set up in Chengdu in October 1991. So far, the volume of business totals 1.368 million tons, worth 6.61 billion yuan. However, officials in charge of the market said meat futures need separate handling to stabilize prices and reduce the risks to pork producers.
