After 30 years of unit building, growth, combat, and glorious victory led by the glorious Communist Party of Vietnam, solicitously cared for by esteemed Uncle Ho and helped and assisted by the people, various generations of cadres, combatants, and civilian national defense employees of the regiment have constantly developed the character and glorious tradition of the Vietnam People's Army as well as the tradition of the heroic Vietnamese Air Force. They have always remained united and singleminded and have resourcefully and bravely overcome all difficulties, hardships, and tough ordeals. They are noted for having invented many wise and audacious combat tactics and for having defeated the enemy right from the first battle, shooting down many of their modern airplanes and scoring countless outstanding combat expoits during aerial battles, thus contributing duly to the causes of national liberation and unification and of building a socialist Vietnamese fatherland. In whatever conditions, junctures, and situations the cadres and combatants of the regiment have always strived to display the lofty qualities of Uncle Ho's soldiers. The regiment therefore deserves the title of Heroic Unit of the People's Armed Forces and the many other lofty awards given to it by the state and the Armed Forces. I would like to avail myself of this opportuniry to commend the regiment for the many achievements it has scored over the past 30 years. I wish you, comrades, good health and more outstanding achievements in the new revolutionary stage so as to eternally deserve the trust and love of the party, the people, and the Armed Forces. My cordial and determined-to-win salutations.
