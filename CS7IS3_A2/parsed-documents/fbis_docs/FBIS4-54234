On behalf of the National Assembly Standing Committee, I wholeheartedly welcome and extend my wishes for the good health of the party and state leaders, National Assembly deputies, distinguished guests, members of the diplomatic corps, international friends, and all people and friends present at this solemn opening session of the National Assembly. [applause] Dear National Assembly deputies, in the past few months our national situation has experienced many positive changes. The socioeconomy has continued to stabilize and develop, creating the opportunity to achieve and overfulfill key targets in the 1994 duties outlined in the National Assembly resolutions. National defense and security have been maintained. Foreign relations and other areas have been making significant progress. Many legal documents and resolutions issued by the National Assembly have been implemented in real life, thereby positively serving the renovation undertaking. This is the result of the efforts exerted by our entire party, people, and Army as well as the implementation of a foreign policy of openness to increase relations with countries in the region and expand relations with all the countries of the world, both near and far. This is also the result of the efforts exerted by the government, sectors, and echelons in their concentration on guidance and management for the successful implementation of targets set by the National Assembly resolutions. We still face many difficulties, however, because of the slow process of overcoming long-term shortcomings and problems as well as the higher demands in the new development period. The new situation requires more and greater efforts on our part to fulfill the 1994 goals and duties outlined by the National Assembly resolutions. The renovation undertaking requires the National Assembly to accelerate and heighten the quality of its legislative activities aimed at gradually building a uniform and complete legal system to serve the undertaking of national construction and protection effectively, maintain order and discipline, and truthfully carry out state and social management according to law. [end recording] Chairman Nong Duc Manh clearly stated that in this session the main duty of the National Assembly is to examine and pass the labor code and five other laws. The five laws are: the revised law on the organization of people's councils and people's committees, the revised law on the election of people's councils, the law on the promotion of domestic investment, the law to levy a tax on the transfer of land use rights, and the law to revise and amend some articles of the Law on Military Obligation. The National Assembly will also offer its views on the planning of the civil law. Also in this session, the National Assembly will hear a government report on the implementation of the National Assembly resolutions during the first half of this year. It will also consider supplementary government reports on the implementation of the National Assembly resolution on practicing thrift and fighting waste, corruption, and smuggling; the allocation and execution of the state budget for 1994; the situation regarding foreign investment in Vietnam and the effectiveness of using investment capital; and our government's foreign relations activities during the first half of this year. The National Assembly will examine reports by the National Assembly Standing Committee, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Organ of Control, the Nationality Committee, and other National Assembly committees on their activities during the first half of 1994. On the basis of those reports, the National Assembly will discuss, analyze, and correctly evaluate the true national situation from the beginning of this year to the present in order to determine effective lines and measures to continue the successful execution of its duties in the second half of 1994. In response to the state president, the National Assembly will consider and approve the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. It will also consider, discuss, and decide on some other important issues. Lastly, National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh said: [Begin Nong Duc Manh recording] Dear National Assembly deputies, the Ninth National Assembly's Fifth Session is opening at a time when people throughout the country are enthusiastically welcoming major national anniversaries in the 1994-95 period. Recently, our compatriots countrywide jubilantly marked the 40th anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu victory. This provided an occasion for our compatriots at home and abroad to review our glorious national history, uphold the national tradition of unsubmissiveness, further consolidate the universal solidarity bloc, and continue to take the renovation process to a higher stage of development. We also marked the 104th birthday of the great Uncle Ho. Once again, our compatriots and combatants nationwide became even more profoundly aware of Uncle Ho's distinguished services. Let us be determined to follow the socialist path chosen by our party, people, and Uncle Ho. The resolutions of the seventh party congress and the midterm national party congress entrusted our entire party and people with new and important tasks. Let us grasp all advantages, overcome all dangers, and do all we can to serve the cause of national construction and defense and the task of making the people rich and the country powerful, as well as of bringing about social justice and civilization. In view of the new situation, and as members of the highest-level organ of power, National Assembly deputies have a very heavy duty to fulfill; namely, building a law-governed Vietnamese state that truly belongs to, comes from, and works for the people. Acting in line with that spirit, I solemnly suggest that National Assembly deputies develop democracy, contribute views, seek solutions, and suggest ways to carry out the agenda of the National Assembly successfully. I would like to declare the Fifth Session of the SRV's Ninth National Assembly open. I wish the session success. Thank you, comrades and deputies. [applause] [end recording] Dear friends, following Nong Duc Manh's opening speech to the National Assembly, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai delivered a report on behalf of the government and the prime minister on the fulfillment of the tasks for the first six months of 1994 as set forth by the National Assembly's resolutions, and on a number of important issues that need to be resolved in the days ahead to implement successfully the National Assembly's resolutions on the tasks for 1994. In evaluating the current situation, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai pointed out the following four outstanding traits: 1. The tempo of economic and financial growth of previous years continued to be maintained and developed in the first six months of 1994, thus producing relatively good progress in production, goods circulation, finance, money, and external economic relations. The growth rate than that of the same period in previous years. 2. Along with economic growth and an increase in the income of the vast majority of the population, cultural and social activities also made marked progress. 3. Our country's diplomatic relations continued to be broadened and strengthened in accordance with the need for multilateralization and diversification. 4. Changes for the better were made in the direction and supervision of the state management system. Regarding the first outstanding trait, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said: [Begin Phan Van Khai recording] The fine economic and financial achievements of the past several years continued to be maintained and developed in the first six months of 1994, thus producing relatively good progress in production, goods circulation, finance, money, and external economic relations. The growth rate was higher than the same period in previous years. It is expected that the winter-spring grain output will reach a record volume of 1 million tons more than last year, an increase of 10 percent. The rural economy continued to show an increase in industrial and special crop yields as well as in the development of animal husbandry, aquaculture, and non-agricultural occupations. Industrial output in the first six months of the year increased by 12 percent over the same period last year. The target set for the whole year was 11 percent. With the relatively harmonious development of various economic elements, cities, and industrial centers, a number of major electrical power and transport projects have been completed and put in use. These include the last group of generators of the Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Plant, the electrical power plant in Ba Ria, the 220-kilovolt power grid of Ba Ria-Long Binh, the road section from North Thang Long to Noi Bai, and so forth, The most significant project, the 500-kilovolt power grid, has been completed on schedule following two years of construction despite countless difficulties and obstacles. It reflects a high level of effort by all parties involved to ensure stable and safe operations. Experimental operation started on 20 May and the network will be officially switched on by early June to carry electricity from north to south, an indication of mutual development in the national economy and people's lives. The increase in export value was estimated at 27 percent; the target was 20 percent. Import value increased by 23.4 percent. The amount of official development aid, or ODA, signed in the first quarter of this year nearly doubled compared to all of 1993. Direct foreign investment projects licensed in the first six months may reach a total of $2 billion in registered capital, or two-thirds of all of last year. The amount of capital actually put in use increased by 60 percent over the same period last year. Total retail merchandise sales were estimated to increase by 37.6 percent to respond to the diversified demands of the people, who now have better incomes and purchasing power. The transportation of goods and passengers, services for domestic and international tourists, and other services have proceeded to new heights. The retail sales index of goods and service for the first four months of the year increased by 5.4 percent, mainly due to an increase in the price of food staples during the Tet festival. Prices have returned to normal since March. According to reports from the Statistics General Department, the consumer goods index in May 1994 increased by 0.6 percent over April; food staples increased by 1.1 percent, non-food goods by 0.2 percent, and services by 0.4 percent. If we compare May 1994 with December 1993, the price index has increased by 6 percent; food staples have increased by 11.1 percent, other goods by 1 percent, and services by 5.9 percent. In short, prices this year increased more rapidly than the same period last year, though the increase mainly affected food staples, a trend that suits the government's policy of not letting the price of food staples fall too low. Domestic budget expenditures were planned to increase by 50 percent over the same period last year. The annual increase was planned at 31.5 percent. Phase two of the new wage policy, which would introduce an increase of 25 percent to the wage fund, has been developed since early this year in a way that will not cause sudden changes in prices or strain the cash flow, and will ensure smooth monetary circulation. The exchange rates and gold price did not suffer any sudden fluctuations. The credit system was significantly expanded, and the balance surplus was estimated to increase by 23 percent over late 1993. The rate of credit loans to the non-state sector -- mainly to farming households -- increased from 30 percent in 1993 to 40 percent in first half of this year. [end recording] In the second part of his report, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai outlined the major tasks that need intensive guidance in the last six months of the year. These tasks are: 1. To continue to maintain a healthy and stable financial and monetary market with the main aim of balancing the budget. 2. To ensure the constant progress of major projects and create conditions to increase investment in various economic sectors. 3. To expand external relations and external economic activities. 4. To continue to implement the National Assembly resolution on practicing thrift and fighting waste, corruption, and smuggling. 5. To widen and improve the efficiency of scientific, educational, cultural, and social activities. 6. To speed up economic reform in tandem with administration reform. In the last part of his report, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai commented that after the first half of 1994, reality clearly shows that opportunities and risks are entangled. This requires new actions for a new stage of development. Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai affirmed: [Begin Phan Van Khai recording] As a result of good socioeconomic development, the cultural and physical lives of our people have been improved to a higher level. The vitality of the society has been enhanced, as demonstrated by the strong progress of many business establishments, entrepreneurs, and families in both urban and rural regions and plains and highland regions. This strength can be further developed along with the wider and more in-depth continuation of renovation, the most concrete task of which is to combine economic reform with administration reform. This is the foundation for the effective motivation of all outside sources. In the new situation, the implementation of the policy of the great national unity bloc will reach a higher level of importance, with a concrete step being the upcoming conference of the Vietnam Fatherland Front. This conference will motivate the talents and manpower sources of all Vietnamese -- domestic and overseas alike -- to contribute to the undertaking of building the fatherland. It will surely bring great potential toward accomplishing the objectives of a rich people, powerful country, and equitable and civilized society. The government, National Assembly, Fatherland Front, and other mass organizations should endeavor in their positions and responsibilities to organize, encourage, guide, and help the people strive to fulfill and exceed all targets and duties for 1994 as stipulated by the resolutions of the National Assembly, thus preparing well for 1995 and later years. [end recording] Dear friends, after listening to the government report, the National Assembly continued its work and heard the following reports: -- Tran Dinh Hoan, minister of labor, war invalids, and social welfare, read a report on behalf of the government on the draft labor code. -- Bui Ngoc Thanh, vice chairman of the National Assembly's Committee for Social Issues, read an investigative report on the draft labor code. -- Finance Minister Ho Te read a report on behalf of the government on the draft law on land use transfer tax. -- Tran Van Nhan, vice chairman of the National Assembly's Economic and Budget Committee, read an investigative report on the draft law on land use transfer tax. This afternoon, the National Assembly deputies met for group discussions to prepare for the plenary discussion on the draft labor code. The National Assembly will resume its work in the conference hall tomorrow morning.
