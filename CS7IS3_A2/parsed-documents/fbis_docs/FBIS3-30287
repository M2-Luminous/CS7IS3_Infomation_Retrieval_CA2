The first point of the agenda was an examination of the documents adopted by the North Atlantic Council summit in Brussels on 10-11 January, that is the declaration of the heads of state and government and the Partnership for Peace [PFP] documents. The discussions on this agenda point were also attended by Messrs. Oliviu Gherman and Adrian Nastase, presidents of the two parliamentary chambers, as guests. The communique received by fax from Cotroceni Palace, points out that, by adhering to the PFP Romania, along with the other partners, is thus reiterating its commitment to fulfill, in good faith, the obligations included in the UN Charter and the principles of the Human Rights Declaration, as well as the commitment to observe the CSCE Final Act and other CSCE documents. Unanimously endorsing Romania's adherence to the PFP as a transitory stage toward full integration in the North Atlantic Organization, the Supreme Defense Council also endorses further cooperation with NATO to achieve the goals stipulated by the basic document. The Supreme Defense Council adopted a number of preparatory measures to facilitate the fulfillment of the obligations incumbent upon Romania through the adherence to the PFP. It was also decided that, in working out the presentation document, the established team of experts -- consisting of representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of National Defense -- should consult with specialists nominated by NATO. Similarly, consultations should be conducted with the heads of the political parties represented in Parliament in order to finalize the document. Also today, the Supreme Defense Council examined and endorsed a report on the strategy and program for mobilizing the national economy in case of emergency and suggested that the government should correlate these documents with Romania's reform program and the special PFP program. The Supreme Defense Council also endorsed a report on the activity carried out by the country's Supreme Defense Council in 1993, which will be submitted to Parliament. At the same time, the Council's activity plan for the current year was also approved. The latter will be completed with certain activities resulting from the need to schedule various other actions and obligations devolving on Romania from the special PFP program, after its content is known. The Council also endorsed the proposals on establishing the legal status of military cemeteries and commemorative war monuments at home and abroad as well as the legal status of foreign soldiers buried on Romanian soil.
