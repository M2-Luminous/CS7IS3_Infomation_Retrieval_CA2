FR940324-0-00014 FR940324-0-00004 (b) The cabin altitude-time history may not exceed that shown in Figure 4 after each of the following: (1) The maximum pressure vessel opening resulting from an initially detectable crack propagating for a period encompassing four normal inspection intervals. Mid-panel cracks and cracks through skin-stringer and skin-frame combinations must be considered. (2) The pressure vessel opening or duct failure resulting from probable damage (failure effect) while under maximum operating cabin pressure differential due to a tire burst, engine rotor burst, loss of antennas or stall warning vanes, or any probable equipment failure (bleed air, pressure control, air conditioning, electrical source(s), etc.) that affects pressurization. (3) Complete loss of thrust from all engines. (c) In showing compliance with paragraphs 4(a) and 4(b) of these special conditions (Pressurization), it may be assumed that an emergency descent is made by approved emergency procedure. A 17-second crew recognition and reaction time must be applied between cabin altitude warning and the initiation of an emergency descent. Note: For the flight evaluation of the rapid descent, the test article must have the cabin volume representative of what is expected to be normal, such that Cessna must reduce the total cabin volume by that which would be occupied by the furnishings and total number of people. 5. Oxygen equipment and supply. (a) A continuous flow oxygen system must be provided for the passengers. (b) A quick-donning pressure demand mask with mask-mounted regulator must be provided for each pilot. Quick-donning from the stowed position must be demonstrated to show that the mask can be withdrawn from stowage and donned within 5 seconds.
