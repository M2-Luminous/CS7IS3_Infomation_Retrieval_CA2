The first shipment contains six Patriot missile batteries, with a total of 48 launchers, the South Korean news agency YONHAP said. Normally, a Patriot battalion has three to six batteries, with eight launchers each. Each launcher carries four missiles. These missile launchers are expected to be deployed at military bases in South Korea by April 29, YONHAP quoted military sources as saying. The 13,000-ton "Comet" and 16,460-ton "Meteor" left the U.S. Navy base in Oakland on March 23. Earlier reports said a total of 192 Patriots would be sent to South Korea. The patriot anti-missile missiles are a more advanced version than those used in 1991 Gulf war, according to the sources. The missiles will considerably reinforce the air defense capability in South Korea, a ministry official said, adding that "it is the most effective defense system against possible air attack." U.S. President Bill Clinton has ordered the patriots to South Korea to boost its defense capabilities during a growing confrontation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) over Pyongyang's nuclear issue. The DPRK strongly opposes the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea, saying the missiles are designed for offensive purposes. Two weeks ago, some 1,000 students staged a demonstration here to protest against the deployment of the U.S. weapons. Patriot missiles, which were requested by U.S. commander in South Korea Gary Luck, gained fame during the Gulf war for intercepting Iraqi Scud missiles.
