In her interview given to the German weekly FOCUS, she clarified once again the fact that our nuclear program is for peaceful purpose and that Pakistan was willing to discuss some kind of agreement on this issue with India. However, it is not willing to accept this responsibility unilaterally. The prime minister said that we will not accept any conditions that are imposed on Pakistan only. In response to a question about economy, she said that her government was successful in reducing the trade deficit by $260 million, increasing foreign investment by $540 million, and increasing foreign exchange reserves from $200 million to $1.2 billion. In response to another question, she said that the countries in South Asia will have to show discernment in order to establish lasting peace in the region. The first attention must be given to the lingering problems faced by the Kashmiri people. Pakistan, she said, was very serious about resolving the Kashmir issue and wanted the Kashmiri people to have the right to self-determination given to them by the UN resolutions so that they can make decision about their future. Countries in this region have to do their duty in order to establish lasting peace in South Asia. Refusal to resolve the Kashmir issue peacefully and the race to stockpile weapons have forced South Asia into a war-like situation. The Indian leadership is responsible for the present situation. During the last three years, more than 20,000 Muslims have been killed in occupied Kashmir and an equal number have been wounded. The Indian troops sent to crush the freedom struggle in the Valley have gang raped women, burned places of worship and personal property, and have set new records for making people invalids by torture. The United Nations, international human rights organizations, Europeans nations, and other international agencies have done nothing except making verbal statements about this situation. The people of Kashmir are trying to keep this struggle alive by giving their blood. Pakistan has never refused to discuss the Kashmir issue and has played an important role in all such efforts. Opposed to it, the Indian leadership cannot free itself of obstinacy and its emotional stand about Kashmir being its integral part. Pakistan still insists that India and Pakistan should hold talks for a peaceful resolution of Kashmir. However, it is important that India stop the atrocities it is committing in occupied Kashmir immediately, lift its siege outside places of worship, and set free the thousands of freedom fighters now in its jails and special torture cells. Pakistan's position on Kashmir and the nuclear program is clear to the countries within the United Nations. It is important for establishing peace in South Asia to seriously attend to the burning questions there. Referring to Pakistan's peaceful nuclear program, the prime minister represented our national position to the German weekly in her interview. This has been expressed in Pakistan for a long time. Pakistan's nuclear program is purely for energy production. India, on the contrary, has not only blasted an atomic bomb in the seventies but its Tarapur nuclear plant has attained the capability of making atomic bombs. India's expertise in ballistic missiles is far ahead of Pakistan's. In the present situation where India has the capability to make atomic bombs, imposing restrictions on Pakistan over nuclear program is blatant injustice. The major powers and international organizations should review their approach. Pakistan supports the idea of making South Asia a nuclear free zone. It has not refused signing the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] or any other direct agreement. However the question is: Why should Pakistan alone do all this? Why do not the United Nations and other international organizations convince India to give up its nuclear program, sign the NPT, and have a direct agreement? Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has represented Pakistan's national stand on Kashmir and the nuclear program. The question of moving from this position just does not arise. If the United Nations is serious about establishing peace in South Asia and making it a nuclear free zone, then it should put pressure on India not only to stop atrocities on Kashmiris but also to let them decide on their future and sign the NPT. The whole situation will remain the same until India agrees to these points.
