C. Huang, T.T. Lu and Lilian Wu] [Text] Tegucigalpa, Jan. 27 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan will change his itinerary and visit the Bahamas after winding up his trip in Honduras Friday [28 January], Jason Hu, director-general of the Government Information Office, said Thursday. Lien originally planned to leave Tegucigalpa Friday and return home via San Francisco. The Bahamas, however, had been keen to have Lien visit while he was in Latin America, and so Lien agreed to a one-day stopover, according to Chang Ping-nan, the ROC ambassador to the Bahamas. Lien and his 17-member entourage attended the inauguration of new Honduran President Carlo Roberto Reina on Thursday. The ceremony was held at Tegucigalpa National Stadium and lasted four hours. Lien later met with Nicaraguan President Violeta de Chamorro. He greeted Chamorro on behalf of President Li Teng-hui and expressed his appreciation for Nicaragua's support of the ROC in the international community. Nicaragua and six other Latin American countries submitted a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Butros Butros-Ghali, asking that the ROC's UN bid be put on the agenda for the General Assembly in September. The request was later voted downed. Chamorro said that she was honored to be able to speak up for the ROC in the international community and said she would continue to do so. She also invited Li and Lien to visit Nicaragua. Lien also met briefly with Belize President Manuel Esquival and Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio. Esquival expressed the hope that relations between Belize and the ROC could be cemented. He also said that Belize's vice premier and foreign minister will visit the ROC soon.
