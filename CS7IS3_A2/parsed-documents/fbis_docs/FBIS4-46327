Hossein Shahriarifar, 26, however, allegedly implicated two other Iranians arrested with him in the southern tourist town of Hat Yai on Friday as taking part in falsifying passports, Pol Lt-Gen Chaisit said. Shahriarifar and another Iranian suspect, Mohammadi Lotfollah, who is still at large, were sought under arrest warrants issued by the police last week on charges of conspiring to commit premeditated murder, robbery resulting in the death of others, and making and possessing explosives. [background passage omitted] [see item BK0306124894 in previous Terrorism Report] Nine witnesses yesterday identified Hossein, detained at the Metropolitan Police Private School in Bang Khen, as the truck driver, according to Pol Lt Gen Chaisit. Shahriarifar and his two Iranian friends, Babak Taheri and Basr Kazemi, were caught early Friday morning at the Inthra Hotel in Hat Yai. A source at an immigration office in Songkhla's Sadao district said Shahriarifar held a valid passport issued by Iran under the name Pajiri Mahmed and entered Thailand through the immigration checkpoint on Thursday. Since Shahriarifar's photo in the passport allegedly looked similar to a sketch produced by Lumphini police station and distributed to immigration offices across the country, an immigration officer advised Hat Yai police to keep a close watch on the man who checked-in at the hotel later on Thursday. The source said Shahriarifar had entered and left Thailand through the immigration checkpoints in Sadao and Su-ngai Kolok districts more than 10 times under different names. The immigration officers, however, earlier could not identify him because they did not have his photograph. Pol Lt-Gen Chaisit said Shahriarifar, believed to have left the country after his failure to allegedly bomb the embassy, came back because he had fallen in love with a Thai woman in Hat Yai. The suspect also might have thought that the Thai police had called off their investigation. Pol Lt-Gen Chaisit said Shahriarifar did not implicate the other suspect as being involved in the embassy bombing plot. He said the police found the gang had its command centre in Malaysia where one of its leading members had been caught by Malaysian police on charges of falsifying documents. The Metropolitan Police Bureau is looking for additional witnesses and evidence against Shahriarifar in Bangkok and southern provinces. Investigations will be completed in seven days and the suspect will then be charged in the Criminal Court, Pol Lt-Gen Chaisit said. Metropolitan Police Bureau deputy commissioner Sophon Waratchanon dismissed concern that Shahriarifar might try to kill himself, saying the suspect did not seem under stress. Neither the Iranian nor the Israeli embassies have contacted the police since the arrest of Shahriarifar, he said. Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut said in Cha-am yesterday that the car-bomb attempt was connected with some "Thai people in Bangkok." "I thought there would be a lot more to come. Something strange would happen," Gen. Chawalit said. He did not elaborate. He said the Interior Ministry had told the Iranian Embassy that the Thai police were proceeding with the case.
