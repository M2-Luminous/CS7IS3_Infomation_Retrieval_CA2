While supporting the plan of the parliamentary delegation that is negotiating in Washington, they say President Aristide must appoint a new prime minister to fill the power vacuum. The following is a report by Daly Valet: [Begin recording] [Valet] [passage omitted] "But in Haiti the ACP parliamentarians do not agree with the plan proposed by Aristide. According to Pierre Simon Georges, the head of this bloc, they remain committed to the plan of the Haitian parliamentary delegation asking that the president of the country appoint a new head of government as soon as possible." [Georges] "It is normal that.... The prime minister has resigned." Besides, the resignation was announced long before. The president is duty bound to fill this vacuum as soon as possible. But this has not been done. "So I believe the first point in whichever agenda, whichever plan" is the designation of the prime minister. "What can be included in the plan after the designation of the prime minister? All the other things they [not further identified] want." [Valet] So you do not agree with Aristide's plan which speaks of the departure of the military officers first? [Georges] Not at all. "I am one of the parliamentarians who do not agree that Cedras or any other military should step down if the amnesty law is not first passed. Besides, that is what gives me a feeling of security to discuss at the chamber as a deputy. That is what gives me the feeling of security to use a microphone to say whatever ensues from my political options." [Valet] "As regards Aristide's return 10 days after the appointment of the head of government, Deputy Pierre Simon Georges says he has no objection to that, provided that head of government would have time to establish social peace in the country. But the deputy has a reservation in that he does not believe there can be social peace in the country 10 days after the appointment of a head of government. [passage omitted] ``The stances are not different within the GS. Deputy Edmonde Supplice Beauzile of the Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary Party of Haiti [Panpra] advises that they have no comments to make on the plan proposed by President Aristide because GS President Duly Brutus signed, jointly with the parliamentary delegation, a plan to be delivered to Aristide. This parliamentary plan is supported by Panpra coordinator Serge Gilles, according to Deputy Beauzile.'' [Beauzile] "At present, there is one member of my group who signed another plan. So I do not need to give my opinion about the plan set up by President Aristide." [Valet] "So, as a parliamentarian who is affiliated to a political party evolving within a [political bloc], you do not share the outlines of this plan which provides for the return of Aristide 10 days after the appointment of the prime minister?" [Beauzile] "Let me tell you, Daly, you know that one of the characteristics of the GS is our coherence. If we have made a statement saying that we have accepted a plan, we cannot accept one today, then accept another that comes tomorrow, and then accept another that comes the day after tomorrow. By doing so, I would give you an opportunity to say that I belong to an incoherent group." [passage omitted] [Valet] "Whereas several parliamentarians in Haiti, the delegation of parliamentarians, the United Nations, and the U.S. Government are putting pressure on Aristide to appoint a new prime minister and whereas, for his part, the president has made a counterproposal in which he asks for the departure of the military officials before he chooses a new head of government, the office at the Senate of the Republic that is presided over by Bernard Sansaricq is working toward the establishment of a new government, an exceptional government, according to what he said."
