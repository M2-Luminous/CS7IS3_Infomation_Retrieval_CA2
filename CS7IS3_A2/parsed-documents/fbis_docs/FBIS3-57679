According to the parliamentary speaker, such a development of events is possible if parliamentary elections in Moldova scheduled for February 27, will be won by the parties coming out in favor of the unification with Romania. "If the parliament adopts the decision on the unification with Romania, then the Dniester region and Gagauzia will secede from Moldova, and hotbeds of tension will arise in Chisinau and Beltsy (city in the north of Moldova), as well as in some northern areas with concentrated population of national minorities," Petru Luchinskiy stressed. The chairman of the parliament believes that strengthening of state independence of Moldova is now the only possibility to evade bloodshed in the republic where almost one third of the population is represented by other nationalities. "Moldova is supported in this by the world community which is interested in the preservation of peace and stability on the Balkans where the war is raging," the speaker pointed out. Petru Luchinskiy believes that a crisis situation is forming in the left bank districts of Moldova. Commander of the 14th Russian Army, General Lebed, accused the Tiraspol leaders of corruption but in response to this the Tiraspol leaders imposed a special state in the region "seeking to isolate themselves from the outer world." At the same time, the head of the Parliament of Moldova is convinced that the crisis in the Dniester region may be settled in the near future.
