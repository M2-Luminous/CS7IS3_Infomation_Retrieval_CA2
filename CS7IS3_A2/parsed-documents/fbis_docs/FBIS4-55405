At the end of the month, according to the Zubak-Silajdzic [Croat-Bosniak] agreement, the Vienna agreement will be crowned with the election of the president and prime minister of the federation and the passing of several laws on the constituent assembly. At a Croat-Bosniak meeting with the U.S. team, which included, apart from Warren Christopher, Ambassadors Charles Redman and Victor Jackovich, U.S. ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kresimir Zubak, president of the Herzeg-Bosna Presidential Council, thanked the U.S. side, which is hoping for better coordination between the Croats and Bosniaks in their international statements and during the peace process. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President [addressing Zubak], what did you say to Mr. Christopher? [Zubak] I only said that we have once again confirmed--by signing the Vienna agreements--the readiness of both peoples to live together in a common state, but at the same time, we indicated that we could solve our problems in a dignified way by political means; this confirms that our two peoples can also resolve, in this way, the problems with the third people [Bosnian Serbs]. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Do you know what people are interested in most? What is going to happen with the Serbs? Are they still being offered entry into the federation or what? [Zubak] They have already refused to, you know. They have rejected the idea. We want to offer this to them every day, of course. It was a serious offer. If I may put it this way, it was a noble offer, after everything that has happened. They have rejected it. Those representing the Serb aggressors at the moment could be replaced by others. It is possible that we could make very rapid progress in our work with some other Serbs who want to live with us. [end recording]
