Having reached this stage in the debate, I think all the groups have assumed their responsiblities and that the positions are now clear. I thank the members of Parliament who proposed confirming confidence in the Government. I acknowledge that the deputies who tabled the no-confidence motion eventually withdrew their signatures. On the other hand, the motion itself -- considering the way it was tabled and its origin -- shows that there are conflicting and diverging opinions in Parliament on what it is necessary to do. I also would like to thank all the groups which, from different political sides, have expressed their approval of the program that the Government has implemented, or of the way the Government has worked. However, we cannot help considering the fact that, in spite of the widespread approval of the Government's action, there have also been deep divisions on the future of the 11th legislature, which were confirmed by the debate. In some respects the divisions have become deeper. This schism also casts doubts on whether there are the necessary conditions for Parliament to continue productive work. This question, which concerns the future of the legislature, is a crucial point. It cannot be overcome with a vote. This is not a matter which concerns the Government, either in the political or in the institutional sphere. In order to allow all the constitutional responsibilities to be fully implemented, so that a definitive clarification may be obtained, after a Cabinet meeting, I will go and see the head of state in order to brief him on what emerged from this debate. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, esteemed honorable deputies, for the example that this assembly has given to all citizens through this debate. An example of absolute loyalty [words indistinct] to our republic and to its history, and hope for its future. Thank you.
