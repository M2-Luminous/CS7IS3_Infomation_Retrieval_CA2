They even threatened to use guns if the foreigners insisted on entering the area without permission. Seemingly, the action comes as a call for more attention to preventing poaching cases in other waters of this archipelago, right from its westernmost province of Aceh to the easternmost province of Irian Jaya. The fishermen's action has caused some officials to urge the government to take necessary measures. Aceh regional House of Representatives' Commission B secretary Fuad Zakaria said the government should pay special attention to the problem. "It is now high time that security forces intensify their patrol of Aceh waters and if poaching continues, the central government in Jakarta should send protests to countries concerned," he added. Aceh is not the only victim of poaching. Foreign fishermen have also intruded into North Sumatra's waters and South Sumatra's Bangka and Belitung Islands. Reports from Bangka said that tens of foreign fishermen were left unrestricted to operate in the region. Apart from the indiscriminate exploitation of marine resources, their operations also destroy the fish's natural habitat and frustrating local fishermen from their income. Head of South Sumatra police public relations chief Lieutenant Colonel Syahrifudin Madri Gumay said that action has been taken with the arrest of a foreign trawler. "Together with the special waters police, we constantly supervise the waters around Bangka and Natuna Islands and will continue to seek more information on the foregin fishermen," he said. An official of the local waters police, Police Captain R. Nasution confirmed that there have been reports of the increased poaching by foreign fishermen in Indonesian waters. He said a Task Force has caught a foreign trawler red handed with a dead weight of 99 tonnes. It carried a number of foreign crewmen. "We found tonnes of fish catch, large trawling nets and corals as evidence," he said, adding that other fishing ships managed to escape. Nasution noted that the local police's equipment was almost no match for the foreigners who got away. Director general of fishery at the Agriculture Ministry Mokhtar Abdullah said that marine exploitation in Malacca Strait should not be allowed to threaten international relations as many countries have their own interests at stake. According to biological resources director Sukoco Adi Sutrisno, speaking in a meeting recently, said that the Malacca Strait is part of the Exclusive Economic Zone and a crowded international sea lane. It contains a fish resource of about 332,000 tons per year including shrimps and coral fish. "They are already being exploited by fishermen from Aceh, North Sumatra, Riau and those who have license to operate from the central government in Jakarta. Meanwhile, reports from the eastern part of Indonesia said that foreign poachers in the region are equipped with modern and comprehensive facilities such as fish location detector. Many of their trawlers fishing ships are like "floating factories": catching fishes and directly manufacturing them in the ship, so that when they anchor at a port they only have to sell their goods. Reports from Central Maluku said that some 16 foreign fishermen were jailed in Halmahera last year for illegally entering Indonesian waters. Sulawesi, Irian Jaya and Nusa Tenggara waters are also among the targets of foreign poachers. The reports should therefore be sufficient enough evidence that poaching by foreign fishermen in Indonesia exists and they harm the interest of the country, particularly our own fishermen.
