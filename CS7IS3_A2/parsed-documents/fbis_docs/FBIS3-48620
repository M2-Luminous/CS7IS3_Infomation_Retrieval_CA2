"The (NDF) is willing to resume exploratory talks on the basis of firm adherence to The Hague Declaration," said a faxed statement signed by Connie Ledesma, executive director of the leftist group's international office in Utrecht, The Netherlands. Ledesma said that NDF negotiator Luis Jalandoni wrote Ambassador Howard Dee, head of the government panel, stressing the need for preliminary talks before the conduct of exploratory talks "to adequately resolve" some issues. The NDF office in Utrecht is demanding that the government rescind Executive Order [EO] 125 which the rebels said limits the scope of the talks to the confines of the Constitution. The NDF also demanded that the government stop "coddling" breakaway communist leaders. The NDF statement also said the "deadline" set by the government was "totally unacceptable" to the NDF. Dee earlier said that if nothing happens to the negotiations by the end of the first quarter, the government may start talking with the other factions in the communist movement. Ledesma said that the NDF panel's position was based on a memorandum on the conduct of exploratory talks issued by NDF Chairman Manuel Romero, believed to be the alias used by rebel leader Antonio Zumel who, together with Satur Ocampo, represented the NDF in the failed 1986 talks. In the memorandum, Romero reportedly warned the current NDF negotiators not to be tricked by the "objectionable" EO 125 which he said "delimits the... talks to the existing Philippine Constitution." "(EO 125) must be withdrawn if the NDF is to proceed with the talks," Romero was quoted as saying. Romero recalled that the same strategy was adopted by the Aquino administration in 1986, but the NDF panel "correctly rejected the proposition." The NDF leadership, too, reminded Jalandoni that it should insist having equal say in all aspects of talks, including the choice of venue.
