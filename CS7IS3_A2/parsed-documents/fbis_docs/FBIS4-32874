The PLRA [Authentic Radical Liberal Party] congressman emphasized that Wasmosy does not have the slightest possibility of constitutionally dissolving Congress, and he therefore "must understand that he can dissolve it through a coup d'etat alone, thus violating the Constitution." De Vargas warned the chief executive that if he carries out his threat, he must be aware of the fact that he will challenge the Paraguayan people. De Vargas noted: "As we challenged [former dictator General Alfredo] Stroessner with all our strength, with thousands of comrades killed and hundreds of thousands of comrades deported and tortured, he must be aware of the fact that we will challenge him with the same strength and determination with which we challenged Stroessner, if he decides to become a dictator through a coup d'etat." De Vargas noted that the citizens have changed their attitude and that over the past five years citizens have become used to freedom, the right to assemble, and the right to demonstrate. De Vargas pointed out: "Therefore, the chief executive must assess all these facts very thoroughly before daring to make a decision, but if he wants to make a decision, he is free to make the decision he wants." Among other things, the lower house president expressed his surprise over Wasmosy's remarks "because I consider him too intelligent and well-educated a man to make those remarks."
