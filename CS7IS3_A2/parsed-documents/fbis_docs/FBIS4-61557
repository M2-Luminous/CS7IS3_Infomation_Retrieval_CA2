He told a press conference in the Federation Council that some 15 thousand Russian servicemen are now engaged in peacekeeping actions. This is a heavy burden for Russia, but some politicians accuse the country of imperial ambitions, Shumeyko said. According to him, it is necessary to build peacekeeping forces which comprise representatives of all Commonwealth countries. This view is shared by parliamentarians of a number of the Commonwealth states. Shumeyko said this would reduce wrong ideas concerning Russian troops in public mentality and dispel allegations about Russia's intervention in the internal affairs of the Commonwealth member-states.
