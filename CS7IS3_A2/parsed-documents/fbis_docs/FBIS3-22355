Special inspectors monitor compliance with the stipulations in Finnish ports and violators can be prosecuted. In practice, ships that have no concern in this regard, can dump the wash waters from their cargo space straight into the sea almost without any peril of being held accountable. The inspectors do not always, not even nearly always, know where to search for concealed wash water. In suspicious cases expert advice is available only during office hours, and the vessels cannot be detained in port merely on suspicion, as is the case in Central Europe. If a violator is occassionally brought to court, the possible fine is insignificant when compared to the profit gained through the environmental crime. By neglecting to comply with Baltic Sea protection measures, violators take over the markets from law abiding suppliers. The lack of concern by the responsible seafaring and environmental authorities is incomprehensible, considering how an exceptionally fragile marine ecosystem is being polluted. Finland has obligated itself, together with the other Baltic coastal countries, to prevent and decrease the environmental pollutant burden on the Baltic Sea. Even the mere improvement in conveying information between unloading port and loading port would prevent vessels from matter-of-factly dumping the tank wash waters on their voyage.
