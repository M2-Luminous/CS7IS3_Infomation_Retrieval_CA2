Maklov, nuclear-powered submarine commander, by Capt 1st Rank B. Tyurin: "Is the Ship Ready for Patrol?"] [Text] Strange as it may seem, although the number of combat patrols sailed by ships of the Russian Navy had decreased dramatically, patrol service has not only become more intensive for the crews, but most importantly, it has become harder. The reasons for this were explained to me at the headquarters of one of the nuclear-powered submarine formations of the Pacific Fleet. The truth is that because hundreds of ships of the fleets, including several dozen nuclear-powered submarines, were retired in recent years, and because of the insufficiency of repair support to the few survivors needing repairs, the numbers of which are constantly growing, we are forced to make more active use of ships that are technically serviceable, and use their life right up to the limit. After all, the country hasn't relieved Black Sea Fleet submariners of their mission of "keeping their powder dry," or all the more so the strategic nuclear forces of their mission guaranteeing stability in the world. This is why we saw several different submarines being prepared simultaneously for combat service at the Far Eastern submarine base we visited in fall of 1993. One of them is under the command of Captain 1st Rank K. Maklov. He is an experienced submariner who spent his entire career under water, and he has commanded this particular crew for over two years. Our short interview (the ship was being made ready to set out to sea) occurred in the control room. The main thing I wanted to clarify was this: Did the commander feel his ship to be fully ready for patrol? Konstantin Gennadyevich said the following. There were more than enough problems before, but now they've become extremely worrisome. They concern both people and equipment. The thing I'm most concerned about as a commander is the youthfulness and, consequently, the lack of experience of the crew. And although it is 78 percent manned by "our own" people and only 22 percent manned by men "commandeered" from other submarines of the same class, which isn't bad by today's yardsticks, hardly any of them underwent training at a special training center. Before, such training was carried out a minimum of twice a year, but now that this center is on the territory of another state, and is being disbanded, the training has not been conducted for several years. As for when a new center will be ready, no one knows. At the old center, the crews underwent training for almost two months, purposefully and continuously, which did a great deal to raise the level of knowledge and training of all categories of personnel, and which improved operation and ensured accident-free use of the ship's weapons and equipment. The one saving grace is that there are experienced officers and warrant officers in the crew who have participated in many cruises. But today they are doing everything they can to get posted ashore, or even to demobilize. Consequently, what we have basically are young officers (with ranks of senior lieutenant and captain-lieutenant); moreover four are last year's graduates and nine are this year's. Who is going to teach them, and transmit experience to them? The older comrades of course, who had undergone the normal course of training. But aboard our submarine such officers are few and far between. Yes, today neither department commanders nor service chiefs are interested in further service aboard ship. It has become much more difficult to serve here, mainly because experienced warrant officers are leaving, and the young replacements exhibit an increasingly lower level of both general educational and special training, and most importantly, a progressive indifference towards service. Thus, while in former times officers of our formation had to compete for appointments to higher positions, today such competition simply no longer exists, because officers are not aspiring for career advancement. For example, quite recently there was only one applicant in the entire formation for a vacant gunnery department commander's position of a ship just like this one. And so, before setting out to sea or on combat patrol, we are forced to beef up each other's crews with more-experienced submariners. And those who are required to serve on other than their own ship do so reluctantly. As a result, all of this leads to shortcomings in servicing the equipment, and even to its breakdown. In turn, the equipment is also aging. We can fulfill only up to 70 percent of the required volume of restoration work through our own efforts. When it comes to drydock inspection of the hull and systems, plant workers have recently been doing this work in the so-called "limited" variant. Consequently, we find the condition of the ship's personal conveniences something to be concerned about today, even on the eve of setting out to sea. We are witnesses to the change that has occurred in the attitude of the leadership of our local naval ship repair plant to fleet orders. Today it is much more concerned with "hard currency" repairs, while submarines, and particularly their dry-docking, have been relegated to secondary importance. It is no longer a secret to anyone that the problems that have accumulated in maintaining the technical combat readiness of ships, especially missile-carrying submarines, are reaching a critical point. Certain routine maintenance operations are not being carried out at all today on some of our special equipment. Such work is within the means and abilities only of special production personnel representing the manufacturing organizations and enterprises, which had previously been fully responsible for the promptness and quality of such work on items of equipment, weapons or apparatus of their own manufacture. Only these specialists, and not ship personnel, are permitted to carry out such work, or all the more so to repair the products of these enterprises. Now that economic ties have been broken, and especially now that a sizable number of such enterprises have found themselves outside Russia, this problem is screaming out to be solved. We should add to all of this the "interruptions," to put it mildly, in the supply of technical and boatswain's equipment, spare parts and accessories, and POL. As for what all of this leads to, let me explain using our submarine as an example. When we go out on patrol, we do so without the volume of spare parts, tools and accessories specified by the norms. The appropriate services explain to us that the sets of spare parts and tools are unavailable at the storage depots because they are not being replenished, even though orders for deliveries are submitted regularly. Things are also very poor in regard to the supply of special tools. We were just recently able to more or less replenish what we needed, though it took a great deal of effort. Even so, we had to borrow from neighboring ships, which means we left them completely "naked." And special tools aren't the worst of it--it's now been 4 months that we haven't received any cleaning cloths or industrial-grade alcohol. Scarce grades of fuel and lubricants are issued only for combat patrols. We found the freon we need for the fire extinguishing system with difficulty. I can go on with this list for a long time yet, but let me talk just a little bit about food. They won't of course allow us to go to sea hungry. However, certain products are regularly substituted today on the basis of a hard-to-understand system of calorie content. In addition, in the past we used to receive a lot of preprocessed food. It has now practically disappeared. Not only does the quality of food preparation in the specific conditions of a submarine suffer in this case, but also the galley equipment, which is not adapted to processing such food products, is overworked, and people have to be pulled off their watches for this work as well. One problem raises another. The new assortment of food products comes in packaging that does not meet the norms of storage and use aboard a submarine. The abundance of glass compels us to break up all of these jars before dumping them overboard, and I need not explain how inconvenient and bad this is under the conditions of a submarine. And one final thing. As we talk, the ship is being prepared to go to sea, but there are only 20 percent of the authorized number of officers aboard, and around 25 seamen and petty officers are absent. Rather than doing work aboard ship and preparing their materiel, they are dealing with problems in various shore-based services. When a ship is at its base, the personnel are generally taken away from their planned lessons and combat training measures on a continual basis. Sometimes 70 percent of the crew is taken away from its duties in this way. This is associated mostly with the present system under which the submariners have to see to crew life support on their own. But various all-hands jobs, many off-ship details, and other measures are frequent as well. All of this doubtlessly has to have a negative effect on the quality of the professional training of all categories of the crew. Besides others, there is this criterion that graphically characterizes the decline in the level of professionalism: While literally just 2 years ago there were almost three dozen masters of military affairs aboard ship, and our crew was the formation's leader in this, now there are only three or four persons. Presence of a large number of top-class specialists even allowed us to carry out some renovation and auxiliary work aboard the submarine by our own efforts. Now this is no longer possible. In addition after we return from sea, another four of the best-trained specialists will probably be leaving the crew. And what's going to happen when the last master of military affairs leaves? Unfortunately, we can't see even the semblance of an effort to rectify the situation. Could it be that something is being done, but the results haven't made themselves known at our level yet? We will be leaving for sea this week, and we will doubtlessly apply all of our strength in order to complete the missions of alert duty. I need not say anything about their importance and complexity. I feel that we will be capable of fulfilling our patrol successfully. But do I feel some anxiety? Certainly. I don't know a single person, and all the more so a commander, who has ever set off for a cruise of any length who wasn't troubled deep within his soul: Will everything fall into place, and will he be able to successfully overcome all difficulties and surprises that seamen, and especially submariners, encounter at sea? Worries about family left behind on shore also intensify such anxiety today. Even with our support, things aren't easy for them, and how are they going to deal with the everyday problems in our absence? Still, it is our hope that when we return, we will be met by changes for the better, slight though they may be. COPYRIGHT: "Morskoy sbornik", 1994.
