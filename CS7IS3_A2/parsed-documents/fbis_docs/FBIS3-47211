The eight-member Foreign Ministry mission is looking into possible areas for an expanded Japanese contribution to the international efforts under way in the former Yugoslavia. Shunji Yanai, director general of the ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau, said there is much Japan ought to do in the way of humanitarian assistance, such as helping with refugee camps. He suggested that Japan could also help with reconstruction after the conflict is over. The team, which left Japan last Friday, visited an inland UN protected area that is one of four such demilitarized sites set up in Croatia. They also crossed a cease-fire line between Croatian and ethnic Serbian forces and visited the country's border with Bosnia-Hercegovina at the Sava river. At each site, the Japanese were briefed by local officers of the UN protection force. On Tuesday, the mission will visit the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo and meet officials of the government there. They will also visit the Serbian capital of Belgrade and the Macedonian capital of Skopje before returning to Japan on January 17.
