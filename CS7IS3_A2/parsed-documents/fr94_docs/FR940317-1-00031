FR940317-1-00031 FR940317-1-00011 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 1 [MM Docket No. 94&hyph;19; FCC 94&hyph;46] Implementation of Section 9 of the Communications Act; Assessment and Collection of Regulatory Fees for the 1994 Fiscal Year AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Commission begins implementation of section 9 of the Communications Act of 1934 to assess and collect regulatory fees. The Commission's objective is to assure that the fee collection process does not have an adverse impact on its regulatory activities; that fees are collected and deposited in the most cost effective manner possible; and that fees impose little or no additional paperwork burden on the public. Further, the Commission proposes to amend certain of its rules governing the collection of fees for applications and other filings under Section 8 of the Communications Act. We note that the implementation of regulatory fees will further the National Performance Review goals of reinventing Government by requiring beneficiaries of Commission services to pay for such services. DATES: Comment date: April 7, 1994. Reply comment date: April 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Room 222, 1919 M St., NW., Washington, DC 20554.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a summary of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in MD Docket No. 94&hyph;19, adopted March 4, 1994 and released March 11, 1994. The full text of this document is available for inspection and copying Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in the FCC Reference Center (room 239), 1919 M St., NW., Washington, DC 20554. Copies of this document may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Services, Inc. (ITS, Inc.), 2100 M Street, NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857&hyph;3800. 1. Section 9 of the Communications Act, was added by section 6003(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. 1 Section 9(a) authorizes the Commission to assess and collect annual regulatory fees to recover costs incurred in carrying out its enforcement activities, policy and rulemaking activities, user information services, and international activities. Section 9(f)(1) provides that ``[t]he Commission shall prescribe appropriate rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of this section.'' The purpose of this Notice is to set forth proposed rules as provided for in section 9(f)(1). In this Notice, we also propose several conforming and clarifying amendments to our rules concerning application filing fees, which are assessed and collected pursuant to section 8 of the Communications Act (``Section 8 fees''). See 47 U.S.C. 158. 1 Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;66, Title VI, Section 6002(a), 107 Stat. 397 (approved August 10, 1993). The new Section 9 of the Communications Act is codified at 47 U.S.C. 159. Establishment, Adjustment and Amendment of Regulatory Fees 2. Section 9(b)(1)(C) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 159(b)(1)(C), requires the Commission to collect the fees established by the Schedule of Regulatory Fees in section 9(g), ``until adjusted or amended by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3)'' of section 9(b). The statutory schedule in section 9(g) lists various regulatory fee categories under the Commission's Private Radio Bureau, Mass Media Bureau, and Common Carrier Bureau, and it specifies an annual fee amount for each category. See 47 U.S.C. 159(g); see also Appendix below. 3. The statute requires the Commission, in certain circumstances, to make adjustments or amendments to the Schedule of Regulatory Fees. First, since regulatory fees must result in collections of amounts that can reasonably be expected to equal amounts appropriated by Congress, for any fiscal year after fiscal year 1994, 2 paragraph (2) of section 9(b) requires the Commission to revise the Schedule of Regulatory Fees by proportionate increases or decreases to reflect changes in the amount appropriated for that fiscal year for the performance of the Commission's enforcement, policy and rulemaking, information services, and international activities. Such increases or decreases shall also reflect unexpected increases or decreases in the number of licensees or units subject to regulatory fees. 3 Second, amendments to the schedule may also be made to reflect other changes and factors. Paragraph (3) of section 9(b) provides that, ``[i]n addition to the adjustments required by paragraph (2), the Commission shall, by regulation, amend the Schedule of Regulatory Fees if the Commission determines that the schedule requires amendment to comply with the requirements of paragraph (1)(A) [of section 9(b)].'' 2 47 U.S.C. 159(b)(1)(B). The government's 1994 fiscal year (``FY 1994'') commenced on October 1, 1993, and ends September 30, 1994. 3 47 U.S.C. 159(b)(2)(A). 4. For fiscal year 1994, we propose to adopt the fee amounts established by the Schedule of Regulatory Fees as approved by Congress. Adjustments to the statutory schedule required under paragraph (b)(2) may not take place until after the 1994 fiscal year, and thus we do not have authority during the current fiscal year to revise the schedule for purposes of matching the amounts actually appropriated for the current fiscal year. With regard to amendments under paragraph (3) of subsection (b), we similarly believe that the statutory scheme does not envision that the Commission would exercise its authority to amend the fee amounts in the schedule until at least after FY 1994. Interested parties are invited to comment on a proposal to adopt the fee amounts set forth in the statutory Schedule of Regulatory Fees.
