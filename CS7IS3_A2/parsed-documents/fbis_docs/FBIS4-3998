Clinton made the remarks before meeting a group of congressmen who visited South Africa a couple of weeks ago. "To have this multi-racial election is really a wonderful thing," Clinton said. "The United States is committed to this process and its success, and we'll be there as a partner when the elections are over." On Monday [25 April], Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said Washington would double its economic aid to South Africa once the first multi-race government takes over. In a speech sponsored by the Howard University Committee on South Africa, Brown said Washington will pledge about 160 million dollars to the nation after this week's historic elections. The U.S. will also encourage its companies to invest in South Africa, Brown said. At present, the U.S. Agency for International Development provides 80 million dollars in educational and humanitarian aid to non-governmental organizations in South Africa. Officials said the new assistance will cover such traditional aid programs as housing, health and other social needs.
