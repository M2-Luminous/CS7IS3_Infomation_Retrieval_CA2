He said he was not surprised by the leap in the dollar's exchange rate because a state cannot support negative balances of payments and trade indefinitely, and this is bound to have an effect on its national currency. Professor Berov gave us this interview on Friday evening [1 April]. The next day, following Zhelev's self-serving performance on the Panorama television program, we telephoned the prime minister again. He said he does not intend to resign, and confirmed that he would be at work on Thursday [7 April]. He did not comment on the president's assessment of the government. [Dimitrova] Professor Berov, this interview is being recorded. Do you have any objection? [Berov] Naturally not. Go ahead with your questions. [Dimitrova] How do you feel, Professor? [Berov] Normal. I intend to return to work soon. [Dimitrova] How soon is that? [Berov] I cannot say because it depends on the doctors. I assume I will be at my desk on Thursday. [Dimitrova] Your wife says you are walking 700 meters a day. Is that true? [Berov] Yes, sometimes even further, but I have not yet reached Cherni Vrukh [peak of Mount Vitosha on outskirts of Sofia]. [Dimitrova] Did the leap in the dollar's exchange rate surprise you? [Berov] What should I say? It was not a great surprise for me because we had negative balances of trade and payments, especially during the second half of last year. In the first quarter of 1994, we again had a negative balance, which as yet has not been taken into account, but there are some secondary figures that indicate, I would say, that the sickness is continuing. This is a sickness of the deficits in the balances of payments and trade, and one of the causes is the embargo. Can a state maintain negative balances of payments and trade indefinitely without this affecting its national currency? [Dimitrova] How do you react to the president's statement that this government is sick and to the possible soundings on forming a new government? [Berov] How can I react? You know that initially the government in Bulgaria is appointed by parliament. In any case, anyone is entitled to express any viewpoint, and this is naturally a matter of his own personal opinion. The president has a right to a personal opinion. [Dimitrova] Do you intend to make structural changes in the cabinet? [Berov] Yes. [Dimitrova] It is said that you will close down certain committees and replace them by ministries. Who will head the Ministry of Privatization? [Berov] Yes, there will be such a ministry. Rumen Gechev will be the minister. I do not know if you have heard his name, but he is well known among economic circles. You know that the Constitution does not provide for any committees. So far, the committees have continued to exist by force of inertia. However, it is high time to dissolve them and allocate their functions to different ministries or elevate some of them to the level of ministries. [Dimitrova] Which ministers will you let go, Prof. Berov? [Berov] Oh, it is too early to say. First, I have no conclusive data showing that anyone is not doing his job properly. [Dimitrova] I would like to ask you this -- of course, you need not answer: Are you not sorry that you named as your deputy one of the deputy prime ministers and not the other, who is a more up-to-date politician -- I am referring to Valentin Karabashev. Might he not have coped much better with the situation facing the country? [Berov] Valentin Karabashev had some long trips abroad planned, and he is continuing these at the moment. I cannot appoint as my substitute a person who would be absent at least half the time. [Dimitrova] Was this formal reason the only motive for your decision? [Berov] It is an important, substantial reason. The person who stands in for me must be in the country. He cannot exercise his right to rule -- it is not a right but a duty -- from a distance of thousands of kilometers. You cannot play the game like this. [Dimitrova] The 168 CHASA weekly forecasted that a possible caretaker government would develop into a "velvet dictatorship" cabinet. What is your view on the ambitions and statements of Dimitur Ludzhev, who has been using fascist phraseology in recent months? [Berov] This is evidently a matter of personal ambitions. Regarding the fascist phraseology, the answer is clear. I believe that dictatorship is impossible in Bulgaria, I will tell you that straight. Even the most ambitious individual will not be able to pull it off. Next, I assume you are familiar with our Constitution and realize that it is not necessarily the caretaker government that has to hold the elections. Look how Mitsotakis fell from power in neighboring Greece. Yet he was the very one who organized the elections in which he was defeated. [Dimitrova] We have before our very eyes the histories of your neighbors Greece and Turkey. They passed through a form of military dictatorship that introduced law and order in these countries and stimulated their economies. [Berov] Do you mean to say there is no law and order in our country now? If we have to introduce a military dictatorship to restore elementary order and legality, where are we going? I believe that we have to be optimists. [Dimitrova] One last question: Can you go over to the window so we can take a photograph? [Berov] I think you will have an opportunity for this on Thursday when I return to work at the session of the Council of Ministers. I do not think it is proper for someone to show themselves at the window. [Dimitrova] Then I will not insist. Thank you for the interview. [Berov] Have a nice evening.
