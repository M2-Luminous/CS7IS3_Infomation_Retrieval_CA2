The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Mr. Kim Tae-chung's View on the North Korean Nuclear Issue." Referring to his remarks, the editorial says "it is not important how many nuclear bombs North Korea possesses but whether it actually has nuclear weapons." The editorial then says that it is "hard to understand" the APPF's excuse that Kim made the remarks in order to stress the futility of North Korea's possession of a few nuclear weapons because the number of nuclear warheads is not the focus of the nuclear issue. Noting the ongoing international efforts to deter North Korea's nuclear development, the editorial holds that his remarks are "tantamount to throwing a wet blanket over such efforts," and calls on Kim to "clarify his view on the North Korean nuclear issue before or after he returns home from the United States." The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "We Should Not Allow North Korea To Have a Nuclear Bomb, Not Even One Nuclear Bomb." Noting that his remarks regarding North Korea's nuclear issue has "caused ripples at home and abroad," the editorial maintains "regardless of the true intent behind his remarks, there is a high possibility that the remarks will confuse the government's North Korean policy." Stressing the importance of deterring North Korea's nuclear development for the nation's interests, the editorial says, "In view of this, it is hard to read the true intent of Kim's remark that `the ROK and U.S. Governments have complicated the matter by not yielding a single point to North Korea.'" The editorial concludes that "While we are well aware of where Chairman Kim's true heart and aspiration for the improvement of the North-South relations lie, as one of the most respected personalities in ROK politics, he should refrain from making ambiguous remarks and should work towards a unified national view." The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Does He Mean That the North's Nuclear Bomb Is Tolerable?" Referring to Kim Tae-chung's "shocking" remarks on the North's nuclear development the editorial says: "It is deplorable that he made such irresponsible remarks at a time when the entire nation is working hard to stop North Korea's nuclear development." The editorial says Kim's remarks at the Washington's National Press Club proposing the invitation of Kim Il-song to the United States and the appointment of Former President Jimmy Carter as a special envoy to Pyongyang should have been "more discreet" The editorial concludes that "he should restrain himself from making remarks creating uneasiness and confusion among the people who call for the transparency of North's nuclear issue and want to improve the relations between the North and South."
