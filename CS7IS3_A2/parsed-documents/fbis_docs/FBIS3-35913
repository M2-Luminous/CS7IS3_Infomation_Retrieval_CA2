The Russian diplomat, who arrived in the republican capital after visiting Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, brought a draft agreement on cease-fire in the zone of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. In an interview with journalists after completing the talks Vladimir Kazimirov stressed that during his trip to the region the issues raised at the recent meetings in Moscow of the Russian foreign minister with the heads of the foreign political departments of Azerbaijan and Armenia were discussed. In his view, the positions of the sides involved in confrontation remain inflexible. He expressed the hope that, as an initial measure, an accord on a general cease-fire will be reached tonight. According to Gasan Gasanov, Azerbaijan would benefit from signing an agreement on truce, either short or long-term. The republic, he stressed, adheres to a position of political peaceful settlement to the conflict. If Armenia undertakes to withdraw its troops from Azerbaijan, the latter, in turn, is ready to "immediately start talks and sign an agreement," the minister said. At the same time, touching upon Armenia's position, the head of the republican foreign political department noted that it has not changed significantly and remains inflexible. "Armenia is still trying to talk to Azerbaijan from a position of strength," Gasan Gasanov stressed.
