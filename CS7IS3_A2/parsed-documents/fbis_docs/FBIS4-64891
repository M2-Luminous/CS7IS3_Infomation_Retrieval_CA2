FBIS4-64891 "drweu090_e_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-090 Daily Report 9 May 1994 UNITED KINGDOM Foreign Office: `No Problems' With Yemen Evacuation Foreign Office: `No Problems' With Yemen Evacuation LD0905171694 London PRESS ASSOCIATION in English 1645 GMT 9 May 94 LD0905171694 London PRESS ASSOCIATION English BFN [By Jackie Burdon] [Text] More than 200 people, including 180 Britons, were flown out of war-ravaged Yemen on a British Airways jet today. The DC10 took off from the capital Sanaa with 225 evacuees on board at about 2 pm BST [British Summer Time]. "It all went very smoothly with no problems," a Foreign Office [FO] spokesman said. The aircraft is due to refuel at Larnaca, Cyprus, and arrive at Gatwick airport late tonight. More than the expected 150 Britons turned up at the Sheraton Hotel, Sanaa, for the flight, and the remaining seats were taken by other nationalities. As civil war raged in Yemen, Britons who have already returned said they had witnessed heavy fighting. One Briton who had already got out told BBC News: "I went out on to the balcony and saw flashes of light and explosions coming up from the airport and it was at that point that I thought, `This is it.'" Another said: "We were in a compound not 100 yards from the airport and there were bullets flying all over the place." Forty Britons who have already left were administration workers from the Canadian Occidental Petroleum company. They arrived at Stansted airport on Sunday [8 May]. The airport in Sanaa has been effectively closed, but attacks seem to quieten during daylight hours, and banks, businesses, schools and restaraunts in the city are open. The FO has urged Britons in Aden to leave with other foreign nationals aboard the French ship Jules Verne, which was due to set sail this morning for Djibouti. About 200 British nationals are thought to be left in the country after today's airlift and sailing.
