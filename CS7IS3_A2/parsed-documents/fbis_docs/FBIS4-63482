FBIS4-63482 "drsov099_f_94021" FBIS-SOV-94-099 Daily Report 20 May 1994 National Affairs Defense Ministry Statement on Crimean Situation Defense Ministry Statement on Crimean Situation LD2005195194 Kiev UT-1 Television Network in Ukrainian 1800 GMT 20 May 94 LD2005195194 Kiev UT-1 Television Network Ukrainian BFN [Text] A statement by the press center of Ukraine's Defense Ministry: Certain political forces are continuing to exacerbate the already tense situation around the Crimea. Confirmation of this is the attempt by a group of unidentified armed people to seize a command post of a unit of Ukraine's air defense troops in the town of Sevastopol. However, the precisely organized guarding of the facility and the resolute actions by servicemen of Ukraine's Armed Forces were an obstacle in the criminals' path. The telephone call by Mr. (Mykhaylov), an aide to the president of the Republic of Crimea, to Lieutenant General Mykhaylo Lopatin, commander of Ukraine's air defense troops, also evokes certain reflections. The former employee of the Personnel Department [Osobovyy Viddil] of the USSR KGB was suddenly interested in what the Ukrainian air defense forces would do in the event of the unsanctioned appearance of aircraft from foreign states over the Crimea. The press service of Ukraine's Defense Ministry confirms the reply by the commander of the air defense forces that in cases of violations of Ukraine's air space the air defense troops will act in accordance with the regulations on combat duty, employing the necessary forces and means. In this context, the latest resolution by Crimea's Supreme Council on Crimeans undergoing military service only on the territory of the peninsula also puts one on one's guard. This document not only runs counter to Ukraine's current legislation and the demands of the state's defense capabilities, but also creates additional tension in society and among the troops. The press service of Ukraine's Defense Ministry states that military formations of Ukraine's Armed Forces deployed in the Crimea are subordinate to the Defense Ministry of Ukraine and will carry out orders of the supreme commander in chief of the Armed Forces and the defense minister of Ukraine in the interests of ensuring our state's territorial integrity, its defense capabilities, and the inviolability of its borders. Any provocative actions directed against Ukraine and its Armed Forces will continue to be resolutely repulsed.
