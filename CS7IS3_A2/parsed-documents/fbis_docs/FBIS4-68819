Notman: "What Does the River Carry?"] [Text] For many Novosibirsk residents the latest holiday ended with an alarming report on Russian television that our city is threatened by contamination and that some sort of yellow foam with a high concentration of arsenic and other hazardous substances is approaching the Ob Sea by water. As it turned out, this report was correct to a certain extent, but at the same time somewhat exaggerated. It is true that an observer at the monitoring center in Shabalino (which is between Kamen-on-Ob and Barnaul) noticed yellow foam on the water surface and collected a sample. Analysis showed a markedly reduced content of oxygen in the water. With respect to some hazardous substances, on the other hand, the maximum allowable concentration [MAC] was considerably exceeded. In keeping with procedures, the observer notified control services of this. This is the way the information reached Moscow, where it was somewhat dramatized. After the first analysis, samples were taken daily. They were sent to relevant services in both Barnaul and Novosibirsk. This is when the strangest signals began to arrive. One service (SES) discovered an increased content of arsenic in the yellow foam. First at the maximum allowable level, then exceeding this maximum 1.5-fold, and then on 25 April--14-fold. With respect to petroleum products content, the MAC exceeded the norm 16-19-fold. At the same time, other services did not detect anything in the samples. Nothing alarming, that is. What happened is anybody's guess: different samples; someone trying to paint over the problem; or imperfect measuring equipment. In any case, the Altay Kray SES [Environmental Service Station]--and very often water contamination comes to our oblast precisely from there, from Altay--refuted its initial data. The Altay Committee for Environmental Protection came to the conclusion that mineral fertilizer had been washed into the water. And spring melting of snow brought more muck into the river. Currently samples are taken daily. This will continue until the end of May. So far nothing alarming has been detected in the water reservoir. So we can stop worrying. Unfortunately, not for long. We are being helped by the spring thaw. There is a lot of water, which reduces the concentration of hazardous substances. In other words, once again we are being helped by accident rather than by people. There is potential trouble, however. Purification facilities in Barnaul have been idled today for several days for repairs. During these days it is permitted to dump 5,000 cubic meters of sewage a day into the river without treatment. After 25 May this untreated water will definitely approach Novosibirsk. What will be the concentrations then and what else will the mass media be reporting?
