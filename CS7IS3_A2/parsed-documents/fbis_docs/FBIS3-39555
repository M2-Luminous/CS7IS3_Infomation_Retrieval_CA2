The formation of joint detective teams on the basis of agreements between the member states "followed logically" from his proposal, the minister said. It would quickly become clear that Europol should not be limited to supporting the fight against drug dealing and money laundering, the minister said. "After all, organized crime does not limit itself to these activities," he said. "The organizations are always looking for more fields for their activities." A rapid study of how Europol's duties should be expanded was therefore to be recommended, Hirsch Ballin said. The agreements between the 12 member states only allow Europol to exchange information. The minister said that Europol's powers would also have to be expanded, so that the organization was given executive powers. "I realize that this last step is still far away, but it is the direction we must follow," Hirsch Ballin said.
