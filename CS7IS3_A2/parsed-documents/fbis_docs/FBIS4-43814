If a French military intervention really takes place in Rwanda in the next few days, France will return to its African "backyard" with a stir. Such an intervention, no matter how humanitarian French politicians may present it, is regarded as taking sides in Rwanda -- taking the wrong side. Admittedly, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, the driving force behind an intervention, does not completely share the blind loyalty to [deceased Rwandan President Juvenal] Habyarimana with large parts of the French establishment, and he calls the events in Rwanda "genocide," expressly meaning the activities of the government troops by this. "Those who have committed, promoted, or covered up massacres" shall be excluded from the necessary national reconciliation process in Rwanda. Nevertheless, Juppe cannot ignore certain facts: The French have supported Juvenal Habyarimana's regime -- whose murder triggered the new round of civil war -- for decades. It was the French who established, equipped, and trained the Rwandan Army after civil war broke out in 1990. Certain Frenchmen seem to have stayed in the country after UN troops were stationed there in the autumn of 1993, training the militarily organized opponents of a peace between the government and the guerrilla forces in militias and thus paving the way for a new war. No matter what Juppe says, if armed Frenchmen go back to Rwanda, the mass murderers in the militias loyal to the government will cheer them, and the guerrillas, who are also fighting a war, but who do not deliberately kill civilians, will fight against them. What is the purpose of such an intervention? The latest statements from Paris say that the French are to stay until the UN blue helmets have arrived. But why then does France not simply help the UN go to Rwanda quickly? The fact that various African states want to join the French mission adds to the confusion. Will we soon have "French" Senegalese and UN Senegalese drive around Rwanda trying to fulfill the same "humanitarian" mission? Either France really wants to fulfill a humanitarian mission -- in the current situation this must primarily mean taking victims away from the militias in Kigali, which would double the UN mission -- or France wants to achieve something else. But this would immediately give rise to accusations, and maybe the fact, of siding with murderers. The central problem is: For France, Africa is a big parade ground. Where can France play superpower if not in Africa, where certain Parisian circles can do a lot of damage with little effort? On the other hand: How severe can the damage be without doing irreparable harm to the superpower's prestige? Rwanda is an excellent stage for gaining new importance through cheap effects. Comparisons of the planned French action with the landing of the U.S. Marines on the Somali coast in December 1992 are quite interesting. Back then, the Marines did not achieve any results, but all of a sudden the United States had a glorious new Africa policy -- if only for a short time. Perhaps the French intervention in Rwanda will lead to the French shadow diplomacy, which has been a major promoter of the war, having to step down in favor of a commitment that is more suitable. Juppe's attempt, which is more cautious than President Mitterrand's talk of "a matter of hours," and has been agreed upon with the UN, shows first signs of a bad conscience for the murderous consequences of the French policy conducted so far. A France that no longer wants to be an accomplice and therefore intervenes against itself? This would be the only slightly favorable interpretation of events that must be found simply catastrophic otherwise.
