In an interview with news agencies NATO spokesmen did not rule out the possibility of new bombing raids -- in the event of the Serbs failing to stop their shelling of the besieged Muslim enclave. For their part, the Bosnian Serb leaders have also taken a hard-line stance. Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the self-proclaimed Serb Republic parliament, threatened retaliatory "political and military measures," hinting that the Serbs would continue their offensive against Gorazde. Russian diplomacy finds itself in an unpleasant position. Events are taking a most undesirable turn for Moscow. For as long as stress was laid on peace talks, Russia successfully played the role of intermediary in the Bosnian settlement, winning one diplomatic victory after another. But as soon as hostilities commenced between the Serbs and NATO, the world has seen for itself that the Kremlin's ability to influence the development of the situation is very limited. The Russian protests have had no impact. "Our reaction was entirely appropriate for the circumstances," U.S. President Bill Clinton said in a phone call to Boris Yeltsin. New Zealand's Colin Keating, who is chairing the UN Security Council this month, rejected a Russian proposal to urgently convene the Council. NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, responding to criticism from [Russian Federation Foreign Minister] Andrey Kozyrev, said that the preliminary consultations with Moscow on which the Russian minister had insisted would have taken too much time and would not have allowed the main task -- of protecting the UN personnel threatened by the Serb guns -- to have been resolved. Our Paris correspondent Yuriy Kovalenko reports that Woerner warned the Serbs against any retaliatory strikes, noting that NATO has so far used just two aircraft to bomb the Serb positions, but that more major operations could be carried out if necessary. If this happens, relations between Russia and the West will be put to a new test. But, if things reach serious crisis point, President Yeltsin attaches too great an importance to ties with the United States and West Europe to put them at risk over the inflexibility of the Bosnian Serbs. All the more so as the Serbs' actions over the past few days have caused poorly concealed irritation in Moscow. Despite all the Kremlin's efforts to persuade the Serbs to compromise and to make them at least end the shelling of Gorazde, they preferred to go on playing with fire. The NATO strikes were therefore inevitable, and Russian mediation was useless. This was something that was stated with some bitterness in a TV interview by Yeltsin's special representative Vitaliy Churkin, pinning on the Serbs a considerable amount of the responsibility for the deterioration in the situation. Russian diplomats were also very disappointed at the behavior of Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the "Serb Republic." Meeting with Churkin, he assured him that he had ordered an end to the bombardment of the Muslim enclave. Despite this, the shelling continues, which gives NATO an excuse for a new strike -- entirely in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 836, which declared Gorazde a "safe haven." This resolution, passed 4 June 1993, was adopted unanimously by the Security Council members (including Russia and China). This removes most of the arguments from the Russian diplomats who are contesting NATO's action. Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Foreign Ministry's Information and Press Department, told IZVESTIYA that, for Russia, protecting the "blue helmets" is no idle question, since there are Russian peacekeeping forces in Bosnia too. But, as he put it, Moscow will not put up with the role of a junior partner who is informed only when people want to hear a "yes." Russia insists on the complete cessation of hostilities in the Gorazde area, including air strikes. Kozyrev has set out this position in a phone call with the U.S. secretary of state.
