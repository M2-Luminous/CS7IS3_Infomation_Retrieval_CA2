But this does not mean that it must have an oil transshipment complex near Odessa At its meeting, the tender commission considered competitive bids for the construction of an oil terminal (known as the oil transshipment complex, or NPK) in the vicinity of Odessa. A majority of the commission members voted in favor of the bids submitted by the IVM company. The complex will be able to receive 40 million metric tons of oil per year. The construction of the first stage of this complex, with a planned capacity of 12 million metric tons, is to begin soon. But should we be in such a rush to begin building? We will begin by examining the numbers that I consider to be most significant. These are official statistics. During the unloading process, the average amount of oil spilled into the sea is 70 grams per metric ton. This might seem like an insignificant amount. But what happens when you multiply these 70 grams by 40,000,000 metric tons? You get 2,800 metric tons! After absorbing this amount, "the world's bluest" [sea] will turn black, disgusting, and dead. Specialists may say that I am wrong. According to the calculations of Professor O.H. Myronov (Sevastopol's Institute of the Biology of Southern Seas), the Black Sea is supposedly capable of cleaning up 2,600 metric tons on its own. This may be, but we are left with another 200 metric tons, which is enough to pollute the entire Odessa bay and Odessa's beaches (one cubic meter of oil, spreading as film, covers ten square kilometers). This will start a chain reaction: it will disturb the balance of the "water area -- atmosphere" system, producing unexpected changes in climate and the mass destruction of phytoplankton (in other words, the "lungs" of the sea). There is more. Mollusks [rachky-chervyachky?] will die, fish will die of hunger and lack of oxygen. And no new fish will breed, because their eggs will have been destroyed even earlier. We will not be the only ones affected. The Black Sea will be completely devoid of fish and all living organisms, because the Odessa valley [balka] accounts for 70 percent of the total bioproductivity of the Black Sea. It acts as a kind of birthing home for 60 percent of all the fish in the Black Sea. And what about human health? Those who have managed to catch such fish and eat it now lie hospitalized in cancer wards. The toxic components of oil can accumulate in huge quantities in fish. Nor can we ignore the possibility of technical mishaps. Consider an accident along the 25-mile-long pipeline, an accident involving the equipment used to receive the oil. Finally, an accident involving an oil tanker. et us get back to statistics, which indicate that the number of such accidents is growing with each year. In 1986 there was only one accident that produced a large oil spill; in 1987 there were five, in 1988 -- 21, and in 1989--39!. The sea in the vicinity of Odessa resembles Derybasivska Street in Odessa itself. But the most that a collision between two pedestrians on Derybasivska Street can result in is an exchange of juicy invective, whereas a collision at sea in which a tanker hits something will spell tragedy for thousands, perhaps millions, of people. Supporters of the terminal respond to concerns about the threat of pollution to the sea by saying: we will call in the oil clean-up vessels and they will remove everything. But the director of the State Inspectorate for the Protection of the Black Sea, S.K. Dolynskyy, is much more pessimistic on the subject: it is possible to remove only 10 percent of the oil that has been spilled. Moreover, should one of our tankers "splatter" oil near some foreign shores, we will have to pay huge fines and compensation for serious losses. Not surprisingly, Turkey announced its unwillingness to allow our tankers to pass through its straits. The risk of collision in these narrow sea corridors rises manifold. It appears, therefore, that in our attempt to free ourselves of dependence on Moscow, we will end up just as dependent on Turkey. Just like in the old days, when our hapless hetmans sought the sultan's support against the tsar or the tsar's against the sultan. It will be a sad day if, after spending huge sums of money on this project, we will be unable to use it because of our southern neighbor. Now that I have broached the subject of politics, let me cast some light on the situation with respect to the terminal from the political standpoint. The point of the project is primarily political: to make Ukraine independent of Russia. This means that either our politicians and diplomats are unable to live in harmony with our neighbors, or that this eighbor is an out-and-out villain. At this point, we should mention another argument that is made in support of the terminal. Russia's oil production is supposedly dropping and there will nothing left for us to buy. Perhaps that is so. But so far Russia is pumping oil to us. And even if we have to pay for it in hard currency, I, as a politician, do not much care to whom we pay this money--Iran or Russia. As an ecologist, however, I am in favor of dealing with Russia, because this will allow us to protect our benevolent sea from oil. And so, let us return to ecology. If we must ship in oil by sea, what can we do to reduce the danger? In the first place, the tankers should be unloaded in a closed port. The oil port that has long been operating in dessa already has the capacity to take in 4 million metric tons. Following reconstruction that will take two weeks, it will be able to receive 8 million, and after another six weeks, 12 million. Exactly the same amount that the first stage of the future terminal is designed to receive. In other words, we can receive the same amount of oil but spend a lot less money if we opt for reconstruction. In addition, this will be safer, because in the event that "something happens," up to 90 percent of the spilled oil can be removed in the closed area of the port, and the rest will pollute only the port. The personnel of the Odessa port submitted its proposals to all the institutions concerned, but for some reason no one was interested. Could it be because they would have to travel to Odessa to negotiate this matter rather than to England? Another way to prevent accidents is to reduce the tonnage of oil tankers. Instead of the planned tankers with a capacity of 100,000-150,000 metric tons, we need tankers that will hold one-third as much. Such vessels can be built at our own shipyards--in Kerch, Kherson, and Mykolayiv. But for some reason, Ukraine is placing orders for its tankers in the Federal Republic of Germany instead. Our countrymen are left jobless. The Ukrainian government is planning to feed German shipbuilders. Why? It is up to the Security Service to determine the reason. At the same time, it should assess this whole project from the standpoint of security. The terminal can prove a tasty morsel for terrorists--homegrown and foreign alike. Put the sea portion of the terminal out of service and the whole country is left without "black blood." The shore facilities are even more inviting--they stand next to the Odessa port plant [pryportovyy zavod]. In addition, the burning oil will produce clouds of ammonia, which will transform Odessa into a cemetery within hours. Our military has considerable experience in the operation of terminals. If the need is really so great, it makes more sense to use the existing terminals of the Black Sea Fleet. Conversion in action! But perhaps we need not involve either the Security Service or the Defense Ministry? We have, after all, a Ministry of Environmental Protection! They are the ones who should be sounding the alarm. Unfortunately, however, this ministry is silent. And when it does speak up, it does so at little more than a whisper. In talking with me, Minister Yuriy Kostenko agreed that 40 million metric tons through a single facility is too much. "This is contrary to the National Security Program, which I helped to draft," he added. Yet the ministry gave its approval for the construction of the first stage of the terminal. In doing so, it did list many reservations. But why agree to the project? It is not up to me to relate in detail the position of this ministry. I expect that UKRAYINSKA HAZETA will give the minister of environmental protection and other organizations concerned in this matter an opportunity to do so in future issues. But one dangerous problem remains--to devise the safest way of shipping in the oil. Perhaps it would be better to bring in some of the oil through the oil port and some through the Black Sea Fleet's terminal. And the rest? But then, is there anyone who can show concretely that today Ukraine needs exactly 40 million metric tons of oil? And does this figure include the eight million metric tons that our businessmen shipped abroad last year? Another fact is also interesting. Some people are now citing a figure of 100,000-150,000 million metric tons rather than 40 million. According to the data of this same socioecological alliance, in addition to the existing oil refinery in Odessa, plans are now being drawn up for a second refinery, closer to the terminal. The plans for the terminal itself include an outport. This facility is designed for exporting not for importing. Here is what it boils down to: the oil is shipped to us, we refine it, give 50 percent to the owner of the oil and keep the rest for ourselves. Plus all the smoke, dust, etc. In other words, we are paying with the lives of our people to solve the "gasoline" problem. Just like any banana republic. We will sell the health of our citizens, but in exchange we will be able to feed them so that they do not strike and do not demand early elections to the Supreme Council. For Ukraine, oil means its existence and independence. But finding this oil must be left to people who are wise and who are patriots of the land on which their children and the children of their children will live after them.
