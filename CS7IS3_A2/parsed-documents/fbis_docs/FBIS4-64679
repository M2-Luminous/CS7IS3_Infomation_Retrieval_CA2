For yesterday, the European Parliament (EP) gave its approval to the accession treaties that had previously been concluded with Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria. The voting was preceded by an unprecedented lobbying campaign, with all parties mobilizing their members in an effort to achieve the required majority. Great effort was invested in the lobbying campaign, and EP members (MEPs) were put under pressure from various quarters by means of letters bearing the signatures of figures ranging from Jean-Luc Dehaene, German Chancellor Kohl, and the outgoing Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers to [Luxembourg] Prime Minister Jacques Santer. In each case the message was unequivocal: The EU cannot leave the four applicant countries at a loose end and must "send a signal" by means of a positive vote that the newcomers are welcome. There is no objection to this attitude. After all, the EU is an "open" association of states that any democratic country subscribing to its goals can join. Nobody wants to prevent enlargement of the club. However, enlargement of this kind does become a problem if other conditions are not fulfilled first. That is precisely where the shoe pinches, and at that level the EP vote can hardly have been welcomed by those who have serious intentions regarding a politically unified Europe. There are a great many good arguments in favor of enlargement that have to be taken into account. The candidate member states can all pride themselves on their highly democratic institutions and on the fact that these institutions function exceptionally well. Moreover, the countries in question share the same culture as the 12 existing EU member states. The latter argument can also be used for including the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. And yet, by deciding as it did, the EP was not true to itself and did not do Europe a good turn. For the Europe that is about to be launched is quite a different Europe than the one for which committed Europeans are striving, namely a unified Europe, showing solidarity, and a Europe with smoothly functioning institutions. Under pressure from pure political considerations, the negotiations on accession were hurried through without at the same time keeping an eye on the need to adjust the rules of play with a view to securing the internal EU functioning. That is precisely where the EP went wrong. In the past, Parliament has come out with numerous resolutions and issued urgent calls to begin by deepening the Union and only then proceeding to enlarge it. But when it came to turning words into deeds, the EP cried off. Grim statements, such as voting "with a very heavy heart" in favor of enlargement, or "in order to serve higher interests," or "in order to show solidarity with the candidate member states" all have a false ring about them. Not only do they contradict previous, frequently idealistic outpourings, but in many instances they also conceal pure opportunism on the part of MEPs who are seeking to save their political hide. So, shortly before the European elections (scheduled for 12 June), Parliament has missed a unique opportunity. Its credibility may well have been dealt a fatal blow. The EP has lost its honor.
