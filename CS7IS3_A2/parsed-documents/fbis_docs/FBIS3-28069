A previous Labour government committed New Zealand to buying two Australian-built frigates at around 600 million New Zealand dollars (334 million US) apiece. There is also an option on a third vessel to replace the four aging frigates which make up the navy's front line. Smith earlier said the Royal Navy had sold six Type 21 Amazon frigates to Pakistan at a cost of only one million pounds sterling (668,000 US dollars) each. "This shows what a dud deal we are getting in paying over 600 million dollars each for the Anzac frigates," he said. But Defence Minister Warren Cooper said Smith's comments showed "all the brilliance of hindsight. When the decision was taken in the late 1980s to go ahead with the Australia-New Zealand frigates project, there were no suitable ships being offered, including those now sold to Pakistan. "There is little to be gained by claims of Rolls Royce solutions when second-hand ships were simply not on the market back then," Cooper said. He noted the Australian deal was signed by the administration of Prime Minister David Lange which had also cut military ties with the United States through its ban on nuclear armed or powered warships. "We've got a ship in the New Zealand Navy that was given to us by the Americans. If we had a better relationship with the Americans they would replace that ship for nothing. We know that. We've cut off our options," Cooper told Radio New Zealand. He said if second-hand ships were considered it was necessary to know what was on them. "While I've been Minister of Defence I've had at least six people come to me as agents for what we could call grid military equipment. They've been acting out of Russia, particularly because the Russians seem to have all that equipment. "They've wanted to sell us helicopters and aircraft carriers, and I had to be pretty careful that I wasn't in the situation where I had to ask the taxpayer to pay for big capital works programmes when we could find things that were available off the shelf, maybe a few years old, so we could put them in the defence forces. I made absolutely certain there weren't bargains out there that we could use that we were denying ourselves," Cooper said.
