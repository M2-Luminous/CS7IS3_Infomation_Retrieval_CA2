(a) ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' is any finely comminuted product resulting from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle and other tissue of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses that may or may not contain skin with attached fat and meeting the other provisions of this section. Examples of such product are ``Mechanically Separated Chicken'' and ``Mechanically Separated Turkey.'' (b) ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' shall not have a bone solids content of more than 1 percent. At least 98 percent of the bone particles present in ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' shall have a maximum size no greater than 1.5 mm (millimeter) in their greatest dimension and there shall be no bone particles larger than 2.0 mm in their greatest dimension. (c) ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' shall not have a calcium content exceeding 0.235 percent when made from mature chickens or from turkeys as defined in §381.170(a)(l) (vi) and (vii) and (a)(2), respectively, or 0.175 percent when made from other poultry, based on the weight of product that has not been heat treated, as a measure of a bone solids content of not more than 1 percent.

(f) The management of the establishment that produces ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' shall maintain records to support the validity of bone solids content and bone particle size of ``Mechanically Separated (Kind).'' Such records shall be made available to the inspector or any other duly authorized representative of the Secretary upon request.
