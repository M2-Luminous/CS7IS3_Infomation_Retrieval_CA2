FBIS4-56494 "drlat087_b_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-087 Daily Report 4 May 1994 Barbados Haiti Political Groups Denounce `New U.S. Initiative' Political Groups Denounce `New U.S. Initiative' FL0405221994 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole in French 1045 GMT 4 May 94 FL0405221994 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole French BFN [Text] The major political parties have not yet reacted to the possibility of a U.S. military intervention in Haiti or to the announcement of a total embargo, as advocated by the United States. The big parties, such as Movement for the Establishment of Democracy in Haiti, National Agricultural and Industrial Party, National Front for Change and Democracy, Assembly of Progressive National Democrats, and Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary Party of Haiti refrained from reacting, at least publicly, to those two hot points in the news. The first reactions, however, have arrived. Some small political formations strongly criticized the new U.S. initiative to increase the sanctions and brandish the threat of a military intervention. Among the major political parties, we have the reaction of Professor Hubert de Ronceray , MDN [Mobilization For National Development], who received those statements as a new demonstration of contempt, aggression, and injustice toward the Haitian people. No to American intervention! No to any new occupation of Haiti! The people's anti-Aristide organizations quickly reacted in condemning the statements of the United States president. Let us listen successively to the statements by Hubert de Ronceray from MDN; Jude L. Jean-Jacques of AJEPOPOA, Haitian People's Power Youth Organization; and Frank Pierre of Capois-la-Mort: [Begin recording] [De Ronceray, in Creole] MDN finds it strange that a great country, a strong power like the United States of America does not see any other kind of democracy to offer us, sees no other kind of democracy to offer a small, poor country like Haiti but hunger, injustice, and death. It is a shame, a waste, for such a huge power to lower itself to the point of agreeing to kill more Haitians and to send its own children to die for a chicken-minded priest who performs democracy with necklacing, iron cuts iron, and decapitation and the burning of homes. MDN reminds everyone that nothing will change with the road we have taken with Article 149. It means the formation of an ad hoc government, the holding of elections for other CASEC's [Communal Section Administrative Councils], other mayors, other deputies, other senators, another president. [Jean-Jacques, in Creole] In the face of threats of intervention being sent by some American legislators and the State Department spokesman; in view of the arrogance of some diplomats or spokesmen in the country asking for military intervention in Haiti, we are asking the president of the Senate office, Bernard Sansaricq, and the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Robert Monde, to assume their responsibilities so that a state authority can be established and the country's Constitution respected; to manage the criminal, insane UN/OAS embargo and defend the country's security. Up with political stability! Up with democracy! Down with anarchy! Down with U.S. intervention! [Pierre] We say no, no, no; this will not do. Those people should not confuse 1915 with 1994. In 1915, the United States landed in Haiti and killed our children, brothers and sisters, aunts, grandfathers and grandmothers; then in 1994, from the generation of the great Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Charlemagne Perralte, and the great independence hero Capois-la-Mort, we say no, it will not happen. We have the blood of those ancestors in our veins. We in Capois-la-Mort ask the Haitian Army to neither give in nor to second guess what they heard. They must stand firm so the parliament can become strong because the Haitian Army is responsible for representing the country and watching over lives and property in Haiti. [end recording]
