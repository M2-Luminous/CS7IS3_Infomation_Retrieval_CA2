Japan Broadcasting Corp. quoted a leader of his ruling coalition as saying that Hosokawa would resign to take responsibility for controversy over his personal finances, a coalition party leader said [sentence as received]. An extraordinary cabinet meeting is planned to be held at 0515 GMT, Takemura told reporters. Komeito party chief Yuichi Ichikawa said on television, "the prime minister told us he would resign from office." Hosokawa had been under opposition pressure to step down over a 100 million yen (952,000 U.S. dollars) loan he took in 1982 from a trucking firm, later to figure in the money-and-mobsters scandal which last year toppled the Liberal Democratic Party from power. The opposition has staged a month-long boycott of budget business in parliament, demanding Hosokawa allow a former aide to testify to the assembly on the matter. But Hosokawa refused. Ichikawa said that Hosokawa had tried all he could to clear up controversy over the loan issue, but he had just learned of unspecified further illegalities over the cash. Hosokawa came to power last August after his eight-party coalition defeated the long-ruling LDP in general elections. JIJI news agency reported that Hosokawa expressed his desire to resign in a meeting with leaders of his coalition government at the prime ministers official residence this afternoon.
