"The departure of the Social Democratic Party from the coalition is a matter of course," said Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party. "I have repeatedly pointed out that Shinseito-led management of political affairs is high-handed. Shinseito revealed its true character after the election of its party head (Tsutomu Hata)," Kono said. Asked if the LDP will pursue any links with the SDP, Kono replied it is too early to talk about that.
