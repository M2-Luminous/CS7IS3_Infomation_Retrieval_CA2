FR940919-0-00038 FR940919-0-00011 A tract of land located in a portion of the west one-half of Section 28 and the east one-half of Section 29, Township 43 North, Range 9 west, of the New Mexico Principal Meridian, County of San Miguel, State of Colorado, described as follows: Beginning at the southwest corner of the said Section 28; Thence N 89 ○36 ’00 ’ ’ W. 292.70 Feet; Thence S 04 ○05 ’12 ’ ’ W. 538.63 Feet; Thence N 03 ○29 ’42 ’ ’ W. 780.19 Feet; Thence N 22 ○15 ’00 ’ ’ E. 3,344.16 Feet; Thence S 51 ○51 ’49 ’ ’ E. 570.44 Feet; Thence S 03 ○15 ’36 ’ ’ E. 1,106.22 Feet; Thence S 45 ○24 ’42 ’ ’ E. 546.96 Feet; Thence S 28 ○41 ’12 ’ ’ W. 549.62 Feet; Thence S 29 ○40 ’09 ’ ’ E. 169.68 Feet; Thence S 44 ○30 ’03 ’ ’ W. 649.51 Feet; Thence S 85 ○54 ’00 ’ ’ E. 660.00 Feet; Thence S 04 ○06 ’00 ’ ’ W. 660.00 Feet; Thence N 89 ○56 ’00 ’ ’ E. 1,318.68 Feet; to the true point of beginning containing 11,249 acres as described above. Then, at Remine Creek, the nonattainment boundary follows the service area boundary for 9.65 miles to the eastern edge of the area, continuing to follow the 9,200 foot contour line. The boundary then intersects Bear Creek. Here the nonattainment boundary diverges from the service area boundary (9,200 foot contour line). The nonattainment boundary continues in a west, southwest direction for 0.92 miles from the intersection of the 9,200 foot contour line and Bear Creek to the top of ski lift number 9 in the Telluride Ski Area at an elevation of about 11,900 feet. The boundary then shifts and runs in a north-westerly direction for 0.83 miles from the top of lift 9 to the top of lift 7, which is located at an elevation of 10,490 feet. From the top of lift 7, the nonattainment boundary continues in a north-westerly direction for 0.5 miles to the intersection of lift 3 with the 10,000 foot control line. The nonattainment boundary follows the 10,000 foot contour line in a south, south-west direction for 3.2 miles, until it intersects Skunk Creek. Here the boundary diverges from the 10,000 foot contour line and follows Skunk Creek in a northerly direction for 2.25 miles. At the intersection of Skunk Creek and Colorado State Highway 145, the nonattainment boundary leaves the creek and follows Highway 145 in a northerly direction until it meets the service area boundary as it existed prior to changes adopted in 1991. EPA is replacing the boundary description currently in 40 CFR 81.306 with this revised description to more clearly define the nonattainment area. Note that this description is merely a more detailed explanation of the boundary and not a change in the boundary itself. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for a revision to any SIP. Each request for a revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. III. Final Action This document announces EPA's final action on the rulemaking proposed at 59 FR 32397 on June 23, 1994. As noted elsewhere in this action, EPA received no comments on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified this action from Table 2 to Table 3 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600, et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. Approvals and conditional approvals of SIP submittals under sections 110 and 301, and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A., 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 18, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review must be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)). The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted these actions from review under Executive Order 12866.
