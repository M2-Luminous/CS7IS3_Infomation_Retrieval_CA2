Kim and Clinton were talking about concerted measures on Pyongyang's nuclear issue in a telephone conversation, according to the presidential office. Clinton phoned Kim this morning and explained the background of the U.S. decision to agree to a third round of high-level talks with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Clinton disclosed that the DPRK has agreed not to refuel its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon or reprocess spent fuel and has guaranteed continuous monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The U.S. President said that he welcomes the inter-Korean agreement to hold a summit and he is encouraged to see things are developing rapidly to lay the groundwork for the summit. Kim, in the meantime, said that he has praised the DPRK's acceptance of Seoul's offer for a preliminary contact next week for the inter-Korean summit. He also noted that his government is pushing for the inter-Korean summit with the "absolute support" of the people. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter went to Pyongyang last week and brought back a message to Seoul that President Kim Il-song wants to hold a summit with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam. Seoul immediately accepted and proposed a pre-summit working-level contact at the truce village of Panmunjom on the morning of June 28. Yesterday, the DPRK notified South Korea of its acceptance of Seoul's proposal.
