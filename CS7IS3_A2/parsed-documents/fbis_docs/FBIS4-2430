The official, who requested anonymity, said the Japanese Government has been reluctant to develop official ties with Taiwan for fear of offending Communist China, with which Tokyo has diplomatic relations. "Since relations between the ROC and Japanese Governments have been cool, I don't think our ties will worsen simply because of Hosokawa's resignation," the official in charge of Japan affairs said. Although many countries, including the United States, Germany, Britain and France, have sent ministerial-level officials to visit Taiwan, Japan has declined to follow suit. "I think the Japanese Government will continue to ban exchanges of visits of high-level officials between the two countries, no matter who will assume the premiership," the official said. Hosokawa on Friday announced his decision to resign to take responsibility for failing to clear up questions about controversial financial dealings and for provoking a four-week opposition boycott in parliament.
