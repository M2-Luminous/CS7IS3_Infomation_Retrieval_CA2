According to this source, diGenova is to verify reports claiming that the Czechoslovak secret service provided the election staff of former President George Bush with information discrediting his then election rival, Bill Clinton. The U.S. investigator is mostly interested in the illegal search for information in President Bill Clinton's travel documents. Clinton came for a visit as a student in the 1970's. The former Czechoslovak authorities allegedly provided Bush's election team with, among other things, the report that Bill Clinton's sojourn in Prague has not been registered with the police. This information has then been correlated to the never-confirmed link between Clinton and the Soviet secret service KGB. Marek Skolil, director of the Press Department of the Foreign Ministry has so far refused to comment on the visit of the U.S. investigator.
