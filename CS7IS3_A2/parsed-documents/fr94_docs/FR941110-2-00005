Introduction On October 8, 1991, a federal court approved settlement between the State and Federal governments and Exxon under which Exxon will pay $1 billion in criminal restitution and civil damages to the governments. The State and Federal Trustees will receive $900 million in civil damages from Exxon over the 10 years. The funds are to be used to restore the natural resources and the services they provide, injured by the Exxon Valdez oil spill. This includes the restoration of any natural resources injured, lost or destroyed and the services provided by that resource or which replaces or substitutes for the injured, lost or destroyed resource and affected services. Restoration includes all phases of injury assessment, restoration, replacement, and enhancement of natural resources, and acquisition of equivalent resources and services. Under the applicable court decrees, all decisions about restoration and use of the civil settlement funds are made by six natural resources Trustees, three Federal and three State. The three Federal Trustees are: The Administrator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, and the Secretaries of the Departments of Agriculture and of the Interior. The three State Trustees are: The Commissioners of Fish and Game, and Environmental Conservation, and the Alaska Attorney General. A Trustee Council, located in Alaska, composed of the three State Trustees and designees of the three Federal Trustees, has been assigned responsibility for decisions relating to the assessment of injuries, use of the civil settlement funds, and all restoration activities including the preparation of a Restoration Plan. On April 10, 1992 (57 FR 12473&hyph;12475) on behalf of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, the Forest Service published a Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the Restoration Plan. This was later revised on January 14, 1994 (59 FR 2352&hyph;2353). The Trustee Council released a Draft Restoration Plan in November 1993, which was the proposed action for the analysis conducted in the EIS. The Draft EIS was released for public comment on June 17, 1994 (59 FR 31191) followed by a 45-day comment period ending on August 1, 1994. This was followed by the release of the Final EIS on September 30, 1994 (59 FR 49925). B. The Decision The proposed action (Draft Restoration Plan) consisted of policy statements, a discussion of categories of restoration actions and broad objectives for injured resources and services. The policies for identifying and conducting restoration actions have been revised and reorganized into policy groups in response to public comments received on the Draft EIS. People commented that some of the policies needed clarification. This was done in the Final EIS. Based on the analysis contained in the EIS and the recommendation of the Trustee Council, it is the decision of the Federal Trustees to adopt Alternative 5 and its policies as identified in the Final EIS. This includes the establishment of a restoration reserve. Copies of the ROD may be requested from the Oil Spill Public Information Office, 645 G. Street, Anchorage, Alaska 99501. Phone number 907 278&hyph;8008 or within Alaska 800 478&hyph;7745, outside Alaska 800 283&hyph;7745. Dated: November 3, 1994. Deborah L. Williams, Special Assistant to the Secretary for Alaska, Department of the Interior. Phil Janik, Regional Forester, Alaska Region, Forest Service, Department of Agriculture.
