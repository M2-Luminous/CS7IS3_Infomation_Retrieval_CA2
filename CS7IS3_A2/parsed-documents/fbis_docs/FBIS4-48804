He was formerly a journalist but left Togo in September 1992. He is said to be a close ally of Gilchrist Olympio, the radical Togolese opposition leader in exile. On 25 May, the Togolese Government accused him of having masterminded the 13 May holdup on an armored Central Bank of West African States van. The assailants fled, unable to lay their hands on the 10 billion CFA francs the van was carrying. A police officer was killed during the holdup, and, according to Togolese authorities, Mr. Foli was wounded. A source at the Cotonou hospital told AFP Mr. Foli was admitted on the night of 13 May following "a road accident" but died a week later. The source did not state the nature of Mr. Foli's wounds. According to reports from other hospital sources, Mr. Foli had previously gone to a private clinic to be treated for "gunshot wounds" and registered under a fake name, but due to the seriousness of his condition, he was transferred to the hospital. Some Togolese people claiming to be Mr. Foli's relatives this morning transferred the body from the Cotonou hospital to a private morgue while awaiting burial. They said their "relative" was a victim of an "attack" in Lome on 13 May but managed to flee to Benin.
