Open lies are carried with references to Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation Pavel Grachev and this, mildly speaking, gives rise to surprise. It only remains to wonder whether this is yet another political trick on the part of the Russian military ministry or its habit to rely upon dubious information sources. Moreover, General Grachev makes statements whose content indicates that the Black Sea Fleet is commanded by the Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation. Besides, the fleet receives orders and directives from the Russian military department. Recently, Pavel Grachev ordered to decisively "counter all provocative actions with regard to the Black Sea Fleet facilities...." The Press Service of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense is authorized to state that the interference by the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation into the affairs of the united Black Sea Fleet, which, in accordance with the Yalta accord, is directly subordinated to the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, impedes a civilized resolution of the problem of dividing the fleet and creates a dangerous tension in the Crimea.
