Although the National Defense Secretariat has kept the public informed about the violence unleashed by the rebels against both people and property, it wishes to offer the following figures and information in an attempt to provide the people with a more complete picture -- a picture to which they are entitled. 1. The migratory flow toward major cities and towns in the region originates in the villages and hamlets under rebel control or influence. 2. Testimony by the people who have sought shelter and protection at the refugee camps indicates that they fled their villages after being stripped of their land, animals, crops, and property, and because of constant harassment for refusing to join the armed groups. 3. As of this time, 19,188 displaced inhabitants are at various shelters or with relatives and friends in the areas under Army protection listed below: In Escarcega, Campeche, there are 207 people; at individual homes in Chanal there are 50; in (Ochuc), 100; in La Trinitaria, 1,042; in San Cristobal de Las Casas, 250; at shelters in Ocosingo, 544 and 8,206 more are with friends or relatives; in Altamirano there are 403; and in Las Margaritas, 8,283.
