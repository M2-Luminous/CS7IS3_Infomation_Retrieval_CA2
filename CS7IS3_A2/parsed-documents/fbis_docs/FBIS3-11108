Last year's trade deficit reached 3.6 billion pesos. But the members of the economic team do not seem to be worried. As a counterbalance, it was officially announced that the February inflation rate was zero, while wholesale prices dropped 0.2 percent. Economic Programming Secretary Juan Llach said that with these results Argentina has reached the cost of living percentage of the developed countries. Reaching a trade balance in the short term is, however, very far away. LA NACION was able to learn from a reliable source at the Economy Ministry that December 1993 imports reached 1.55 billion pesos and exports 1.05 billion pesos. For some analysts, the figures for the first 11 months of last year published by INDEC [National Institute of Statistics and Census] should cause alarm. In 1992 the negative balance reached 2.8 billion pesos, and in only one year the trade balance has registered a significant deficit. During 1993 the deficit grew more than was expected by Economy Ministry officials, who find an explanation in an increase of capital goods imports. They said: "The country is re-equipping itself." But the truth is that the increase in capital goods imports was minimal compared to the high increase in the balance of payments. In 1992 the increase in the balance was 37.5 percent, while in 1993 imports grew 40.9 percent. A difference in the deficit of 700 million pesos in 12 months is not small, and everything seems to indicate that this trend will continue. In 1993 exports grew at a rate of 7 percent, while imports went over that figure, reaching an 11 percent increase. The arguments used by the aides of Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo have created concern among some analysts, who do not doubt their assertion that the same negative trend will continue in the next few months. Trade with the United States would be one of the main reasons that the Argentine trade balance is in the red every month. Of the total deficit, about 2.2 billion pesos is reportedly with that country. Argentine imports from NAFTA were 18.3 percent higher than in 1992. Of the 3.7062 billion pesos in imports, 92 percent came from the United States. The other face of the coin was improvement in trade with Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. In this case the negative balance was reduced by three-quarters as compared to the trade deficit of 1992. The deficit was 500 million pesos in 1992, while in 1993 the deficit was only 146 million pesos. In the first 11 months of 1993 imports increased by 31.9 percent in capital goods, 5.2 percent in vehicles, 7.7 percent in consumer goods, and 7.1 percent in intermediate products. Another reason why the trade balance continues to be negative is the lack of exports by car manufacturers. It has been learned that the auto industry has a debt of approximately $300 million, without counting the 21,000 cars and spare parts included in Protocol 21 (agreement with Brazil). The destinations of Argentine exports were: $2.5218 billion to Brazil, $1.187 billion to the Netherlands, and $1.1294 billion to the United States. The total sales represent 40 percent of the sales abroad. The main Argentine imports came from: the United States, with $3.411 billion; Brazil, with $3.219 billion; Germany, with $921.7 million; and Italy, with $879.5 million. INDEC also confirmed that during the first 11 months of 1993, 27.3 percent of exports were products of the industrial sector, 37.6 percent from the agricultural sector, and 26 percent were primary products. This shows a drop in the exports of agricultural products and an increase from 22.7 to 27.3 percent of industrial products. This week Industry Secretary Carlos Magarinos will announce a package of measures to help regional economies. New instruments are expected to be implemented to improve exports. There are indications the economic team is working to try to cover the hole produced by the overevaluation of the local currency. We will have to wait.
