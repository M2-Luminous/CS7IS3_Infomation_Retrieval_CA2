Answering questions from IZVESTIYA's correspondent, Ambassador Sergey Zotov, leader of the Russian delegation, recalled that in 1993 we withdrew our troops from Lithuania without a corresponding treaty being drawn up. Our Latvian and Estonian partners in talks were tempted to follow that option. But they forget that at the time Vilnius farsightedly accepted Moscow's terms, which provided for guarantees for the rights of the Russian-speaking population to be observed. For a long time the Russian diplomats' efforts consisted in convincing the Latvian side of the hopelessness of such an approach and making efforts to lead the talks out of the impasse in which they found themselves. Moscow and Riga wasted several months on this. According to Sergey Zotov, however, significant progress became apparent in the talks in January. Today a start has been made on the legal-treaty formulation of not only the Russian troop withdrawal but also the agreements concerning social protection for servicemen and military pensioners in Latvia, the legal status of a Russian strategic installation -- the radar station in the city of Skrunda -- and the conditions of its operation. With regard to the radar station's period of existence, the Russian diplomat pointed out that the Skrunda station will function for four more years. In addition, S. Zotov reported, an additional 18 months are allocated for dismantling it. Naturally, these periods have to be confirmed by the governments of Latvia and Russia, but Moscow considers this a reasonable compromise. "Thus," the Russian ambassador concluded, "we will be left with small technical questions, and after resolving them in the very near future we plan to open up the way to completing all the work on a package of agreements, so as to submit it to the two countries' governments for signing." Sergey Zotov expressed the assumption that the Russian Government will receive the agreements elaborated in the talks for approval by the end of February.
