"I will serve in that capacity until 18 April, the scheduled date of a Council of Ministers meeting that is of fundamental importance to Spain. It is at that meeting that the overall European plan for infrastructures will be approved for the ports, airports, navigable waterways, and so on...to be financed out of European funds." The former senator, former deputy, and founder of the Baleares Liberal Party...now heads the PP [People's Party] list for the European elections and takes stock of the nearly nine years he has served as a European minister. His conclusion: "I have gone to bat for Spain a great deal in Europe." [Duque] Are you going to leave the post of European commissioner (European minister) of Transportation and Energy in order to head the PP list for the European Parliament? [Matutes] Yes. The Council of Ministers meeting scheduled for 18 April will be my last. It will be decisive for Europe and Spain because it will pass the overall European plan for infrastructures: the ports, airports, navigable waterways, and highways, putting Spain's projects in a position to be financed by European funds. Although there is no incompatibility whatsoever between my office as a commissioner and heading the PP list for the European Parliament, I prefer to remove myself in order to wage my campaign with complete freedom. [Duque] You have been a European commissioner for nearly nine years, but what have you done for Spain in Europe? [Matutes] I have always tried to pave the way for a soft, painless arrival of Spanish businesses in the Community enabling them to compete on good terms and ensuring that the framework provided will facilitate that task. The understanding and trust of the Spanish Government that I have enjoyed at all times have been exemplary. I think that I have done my work conscientiously and that it has been recognized, not only by the Spanish Government, but by businessmen as well.... However, the great battle of the Spanish economy will be won or lost depending on whether or not it has good domestic policies. What will make us able to compete on the big market is the framework of Spanish fiscal policy, whether or not we promote savings and investment, meaning whether we create jobs and competitiveness or penalize such investments, whether or not we train good professionals and specialists.... [Duque] And what is left for you to do as a European commissioner if most of Spain's policy remains to be carried out? [Matutes] There is a common area that increasingly affects all of our lives, the policy on infrastructures, for example. All of the projects now under way will be 80 to 90 percent cofinanced out of European funds. In addition, agricultural policy is dictated by Europe, as is the common transportation policy, the environmental policy. VAT [value-added tax] rates are also decided in Europe.... Just imagine how important that is! [Duque] What have you gained as a European commissioner? [Matutes] These nine years have been years of very hard work, years when I have put in 14 or 15 hours a day on the average, here in and abroad, on plans almost constantly. However, at the same time, the work has been a thrilling challenge for me and a very gratifying task insofar as I have been able to carry out important missions for my country and Europe. During my first term as a commissioner, I was entrusted with the task of handling Credit and Investments, the Development of Financial Engineering, Policy for the PYMES. I managed to get a favorable policy for small and medium-size enterprises. At the same time, I launched the ECU [European currency unit] on markets throughout the world, in New York and Tokyo in particular.... During my second term, as the commissioner responsible for Mediterranean Policy and North-South and Latin American Relations, I achieved closer bonds with Latin America--which was very low on the list of priorities--and strengthened ties with neighboring countries, which are of prime importance for Spain. Now, as commissioner of Transportation and Energy, I have carried out the overall European infrastructure and transport plans so essential to Spain. I am also completing the directive for gas and electricity that will make it possible to integrate those markets into a single European market, that of the Twelve. [Duque] What does this mean in practical terms? [Matutes] A drop in the price of gas and electricity. [Duque] You will make it possible for the price of gas and electricity to go down? [Matutes] Yes. We are going to do so by introducing competition into markets that are now national and governed by monopolies and oligopolies. We are going to introduce free competition on a Community scale. [Duque] And do you think the average citizen will understand this? [Matutes] We often experience the problem that what is done in Europe is done by governments and not sufficiently explained to the citizens, but everyone realizes the importance of introducing competition between companies operating in these sectors. It will result in a drop in prices. [Duque] That is fine, but what will a European minister tell farmers who feel they have been deceived, hurt, and mistreated by Europe? [Matutes] They do feel mistreated and rightly so. For many years, farmers were very well treated by the Community even though they endured the protectionism of the EEC. Then, at the precise time that Spain joined the EC, due to international pressures aimed at a liberalization of farm markets and budget austerity, the farmers had to endure the consequences of opening the Community to outside markets and have less aid.... They are having a hard time of it, but so are all European farmers. And if we had to make a scale, I would say that all those who enjoyed the most protection, the farmers in the north and on the continent, are having the hardest time of all. I mean those who grow grain and oil-yielding plants, along with many livestock breeders. In contrast, those growing fruit and produce will not be so badly hurt. [Duque] That is true, but how will you explain it to them? Is it not a fact that Europe has a debt to most Spanish farmers? [Matutes] Europe does indeed have a debt to those Spanish farmers who have not benefited from the policy of "common splendor"; that is a fact. We have to tell them that in the Community, we will have to make an effort to support their income. Without the farmers, Europe would not be this model of political and social stability. [Duque] What will your election program aimed at beating the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] be based on? [Matutes] On a common platform passed by the European People's Party meeting in Brussels on 8 and 9 December and attended by Kohl, Lubber, and Aznar...the main European leaders. It is a program of the European center right with a Spanish "appendix" that seeks a better and more effective defense of Spain's vital interests in Europe. It is based on improving infrastructures, with solid economic aid...in a more active, more dynamic Europe, with greater participation by businesses and society...in a less bureaucratic, less interventionist Europe, a Europe that is less expensive and that has fewer taxes. These are the center-right programs of the governments in the Community's most advanced countries, all except Greece and Spain. [Duque] Is the PP staking its future on these elections? It is said that if you beat the PSOE, you could force them to move up the general elections. [Matutes] The PP now represents hope for millions of Spaniards. A victory would be a confirmation of that hope and trust which the PP awakens in society. Now then, this does not mean that a victory by us in those European elections will imply that we are asking that the general elections be moved up. However, it will mean a confirmation of a serious, responsible, competent alternative that can take over the reins of this country and lead it down the path of recovery. [Duque] And if you lose, will it be the end of Aznar, as the Socialists are saying? [Matutes] That is not part of our plans. Of course it will not be the end of Aznar. He is not the one running, but the pre-election polls show us winning.... [Duque] Fine. Aznar is not running, but the PP is, even if it is headed by you.... [Matutes] If we should lose, we would suffer the consequences of the errors we have made. [Duque] Certain regional parties like the PAR [Aragon Regionalist Party], which could support the PP in Europe, have united behind a common candidate.... Will that take votes away from the PP? [Matutes] I do not see why a coalition of regional forces with frequently conflicting interests would better defend the interests of that region than a group of European deputies from the same region who are on PP lists. I do not see the improvement. Regional interests will be better defended by people from the PP. For example, it was I who was behind the approval of the Somport tunnel linking the Autonomous Community of Aragon with France through the Pyrenees, as a project of Community interest. [Duque] Fine, but tell me what you have done for the Autonomous Communities of Spain in Europe, one by one.... [Matutes] Fine! I have already told you about Aragon. In Baleares, which does not have access to FEDER [European Regional Development Fund (of the EEC)] funds because its per capita is above the Community average, we succeeded in getting 5B funds for farmers in the entire region. We also passed improvements for the Ibiza, Mallorca, and Menorca airports.... In addition, 60 to 70 percent of the funds used for port improvements will come from the Community.... [Duque] And what have you done for the Canary Islands? [Matutes] For the Canary Islands, we passed the common market organization for bananas, protection for tomatoes from winter imports, and aid for infrastructures. [Duque] And for the Basque Country? [Matutes] For the Basque Country, I obtained structural funds to finance conversions and fought very hard in the Commission when the plan to reorganize the Spanish iron-and-steel industry tried to take the little Sestao steel plant away from us, leaving us without a single kilo of Basque steel.... [Duque] What about Asturias? [Matutes] I have just passed the coal assistance code that will enable coal mining to continue to receive enough aid to make it to the year 2004, which is when the CECA [Economic Coal and Steel Community] Treaty will have to be revised.... I have not neglected a single Community and I could make a list. For nearly nine years now, there have been many projects for which I have fought and worked hard for the regions of Spain.... [Duque] What about Castille-Leon? [Matutes] We managed to get FEDER funds for infrastructure projects such as highways and helped protect cynegetic species. [Duque] What about Fraga's Galicia? [Matutes] It has benefited from all Community funds for improving infrastructures.... I have worked to open up talks with third countries so that Galician fishermen could conserve and build up fishing grounds. We are now fighting to see that cattlemen are not hurt by milk quotas throughout the northern corner.... [Duque] And Andalusia, which will also hold autonomous elections on 12 June? [Matutes] I have supported all infrastructures built. The famous highways, the Despenaperros Pass, were built with European aid.... [Duque]] And what did you do for Madrid? [Matutes] Well, since income is high there, it does not have access to FEDER funds, but we did obtain it for the surrounding belt of industrial towns.... [Duque] And Castille-La Mancha? [Matutes] The same is true. Highways and infrastructure projects were financed. The AVE, which benefits that region and Andalusia as well, was built with Community financing.... [Duque] What about Valencia? [Matutes] Like the Canary Islands, it continues to receive FEDER funds despite its high income. Those funds were renewed and certain fruit and produce schedules were extended to winter periods.... [Duque] And Murcia? [Matutes] The same is true. It receives structural funds, funds for highways. [Duque] And Catalonia? [Matutes] We gave it aid from FEDER funds and it will soon have the AVE connecting it with the center of Spain and the rest of Europe.... [Duque] What about Extremadura? [Matutes] There are the FEDER funds to improve the infrastructure and the reforestation plan.... [Duque] La Rioja? [Matutes] It also gets FEDER funds, help for wine.... [Duque] And Navarre? [Matutes] The connection with France and the Community via a direct highway, without going through Velate.... [Duque] And what about Cantabria? What have you done for that autonomous community that has become poorer with the EC, like many other communities? [Matutes] Cantabria has the same problem as Galicia and Asturias, with the surtax on milk production. That is because of the poor information which the government provided at the time about real milk production and we are now paying the consequences. However, we hope to rectify the situation, improve its highways....
