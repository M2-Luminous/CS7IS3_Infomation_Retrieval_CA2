Replying to questions at a news conference in Tokyo, he said Kazakhstan does not have a refugees' problem yet. However, Nazarbayev said, "collapse of empires never goes quietly," and people are concerned since they can see bloodshed in Tajikistan and the Caucasus. Politicians, he said, should have foreseen this when they were signing the Belovezhskaya Pushcha agreement and when "against our will, the ruble zone was being destroyed." An economic crisis can be observed throughout the former USSR at present, the quality of life worsens, and on the eve of the elections on 12 December many politicians had nothing better to do than "to use the Russian theme since there was nothing else they could talk about." However, concern for common people and politicizing are different matters, the president stressed. The Russian-speaking population in Kazakhstan enjoys all the rights and even have opportunities not available in other countries on the territory of the former USSR. "Russians, Germans, and Ukrainians are our citizens, citizens of Kazakhstan, and I know it will be worse for them if they leave," Nazarbayev said.
