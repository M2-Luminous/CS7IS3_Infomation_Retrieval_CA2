We have repeatedly heard through authoritative media the report that, as the means to guarantee the nuclear transparency of North Korea faced the uppermost practical limit, the United States has decided to seek a countermeasure, with which it may ignore the possibility that North Korea currently possesses nuclear weapons. Some of the U.S. conservatives even suggested that the ROK and other countries be allowed small-scale nuclear armaments as a countermove against the possible possession of nuclear weapons by North Korea. Last year, U.S. President Bill Clinton warned that "I will not allow North Korea to develop nuclear weapons." U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, however, lately said that "What we can do now is to deter North Korea from producing any more nuclear weapons." The phrase "any more" in Secretary Perry's remark is noteworthy. It is natural for us to be concerned about the possibility of very serious changes in the situation since our aim is the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. If the situation is actually changing seriously, we must not be puzzled now with the phrase that "there is no clear evidence to prove that North Korea possesses nuclear weapons." A more difficult task has been added to our policy which is solely based on the assumption of North Korea's nuclear transparency. Even if North Korea had one or two nuclear weapons, this could not be a threat to the United States. The United States would only have an additional burden in the international nuclear management. However, we are in a different situation. We are the direct object of North Korea's nuclear threat. It is clear that our military position would be weakened. In addition, if North Korea uses nuclear weapons as a means of force, not as a trump card, we would unavoidably be driven into a defensive position in South-North relations and in other international arenas. It would be too late if we tried to seek a countermeasure when the United States comes to have interest only in "any more" production of nuclear weapons by North Korea after admitting it possesses nuclear weapons. We still hope for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but we cannot adhere to it even in case the hope is stifled by North Korea. We should return to the "no confirm, no deny" policy toward the nuclear problem or further strengthen the international cooperation system. In any case, we should assume a peace-guaranteeing policy. With regard to the North Korean nuclear issue, the government seems to make considerable efforts only to relieve the people's anxiety. The government makes a wrong assumption, however, if it believes that the people are reassured by the government authorities' remarks that "there is no clear evidence that proves the North's nuclear weapons development" and that "there has been no sign of the North's military provocation." The level of the people's security consciousness is far beyond the government's expectation. When the government takes a security policy that the people think is reliable, it will overcome trials caused by the North Korean nuclear issue, encouraged by the people's confidence, without making public relations efforts.
