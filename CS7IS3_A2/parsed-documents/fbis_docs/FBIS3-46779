The year of 1994 will mark 20 years since Kim Chong-il was nominated as the successor in the plenary session of the Workers' Party Central Committee in February 1974. This also attracts the people's attention. In view of the importance attached to the so-called "cyclic year" -- such as the 10th and the 20th year -- in North Korea, it is likely that visible steps for settlement of succession to power will be taken this year. This speculation is also supported by the step-by-step measures taken each year since 1991 for Kim Chong-il's succession to power, including his successive nomination as the supreme commander of the military, marshal, and chairman of the National Defense Committee. If step-by-step measures are not taken this year regarding succession to power, it could mean that an abnormal front [isang chonson] might have been created within the North Korean power structure. People observe that at least one of the titles retained by Kim Il-song at present, including general secretary of the party, chairman of the party's Central Military Commission, and the president of the state, will be transferred to Kim Chong-il this year, and complete succession to power, including transfer of the remaining titles, will be finalized in late 1995 or thereafter. This observation is supported by the fact that North Korea has designated 1995 as "the year for reunification," that North Korea would require an overall evaluation of its decision to designate the upcoming two and three years as an adjustment period, and that Kim Il-song demonstrated his health by giving on-the-spot guidances more than 10 times last year. Therefore, it appears that this year the title of either president of the state or chairman of the party's Central Military Commission will be transferred to Kim Chong-il, while succession to the position of general secretary of the party will be somewhat delayed in view of the characteristic nature of the socialist state. The possibility of early succession to the presidency was predicted in 1992 through the revised Constitution, which abolished the regulation stipulating that the president hold the additional post of chairman of the National Defense Commission and which prescribed that the president's responsibility may be reviewed at the Supreme People's Assembly. As a result of this, the president's power was drastically reduced. This may be construed to be a step- by-step measure for Kim Chong-il to advance toward the position of president from chairmanship of the National Defense Committee. There has also been speculation regarding succession to the post of chairman of the party's Central Military Commission. The party's rules stipulate, however, that the general secretary hold the additional post of chairman of the Central Military Commission. Therefore, in order to realize the succession, the step to separate the two positions must be taken by first revising the party's rules. Last year, senior officials, including O Chin-u, Choe Kwang, Yi Chong-ok, Pak Song-chol, Kim Yong-chu, and Kim Pyong-sik, either retained their incumbent positions or were newly appointed. It is anticipated, however, that a fierce whirlpool of generational shifts will sweep North Korea at the end of this year. The generational shift will be carried out in such a manner to support Kim Chong-il's succession to power. It is highly likely that Kim Tal-hyon and Kim Yong-sun, who were demoted, will be reinstated; and Kim Ki-nam, Kim Kuk-tae, Chang Song-tae, and the like, who are close associates of Kim Chong-il, will appear at the forefront during the shift. If the nuclear problem is not satisfactorily solved and the economic crisis persists, succession to power and the generational shift will face serious trials. Nuclear Issue and Diplomacy The North Korean nuclear issue is the core for maintaining the system and for defining economic problems. Through the drastic measure of withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], North Korea is attempting to ensure maintenance of its political system and to secure economic assistance. It seems that the North Korean nuclear problem, which was the main cause of deadlock in North-South relations last year, will be settled this year in some form. There is great possibility that North Korea, which is now standing on the crossroads of its decision to advance toward nuclear weapons development or to ensure its nuclear transparency, will undertake a policy of ensuring its nuclear transparency. As the NPT will be revised in 1995, the policy for international denuclearization will likely be strengthened, and North Korea's nuclear development will only cause its own isolation by going against the trend of the time after the end of the cold war. North Korea's choice to ensure nuclear transparency will be made in expectation of maintaining its system. This choice may give rise to discord within North Korea's power structure. Even if North Korea makes this choice, the North Korean nuclear issue will enter into other aspects if the quantity of extracted plutonium proves to be more than expected as the result of International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspections. In this case, concealment of plutonium will be the point of dispute and North Korea and the international community will again wrangle with each other. In the event North Korea accepts complete nuclear inspection of the seven nuclear facilities it reported to the IAEA, North Korea-U.S. relations will begin to improve above all and negotiations between North Korea and Japan for establishment of diplomatic relations will be resumed. The first step in improving U.S.-North Korean relations will be the lifting of the U.S. embargo against North Korea; even the mutual exchange of liaison missions will be realized between North Korea and the United States. The negotiations for establishing diplomatic relations with Japan, held over eight times in the past, will be resumed and will make noticeable progress. This is because the pro-North Korean Japanese Social Democratic Party has the majority of seats in the Hosokawa coalition cabinet and because North Korea is in need of reparations from Japan to overcome its economic difficulties. In the meantime, North Korea will likely strive to improve relations with China and Russia, its traditional allies, and to emphasize economic diplomacy with oil producing countries including Iran and Libya. At the same time, North Korea will continue pushing for nonaligned diplomacy with third world countries, including those in Southeast Asia and Latin America. Economy and Society It appears that this year North Korea will unlock the gate of its economy externally, while internally it will attempt to further strengthen the control of people in order to maintain its political system, thus implementing two contradictory policies. In view of its outdated production facilities and backward technology, the North Korean economic index will not likely show noticeable growth this year. Improvement in U.S.-North Korean relations following solution to the nuclear problem, however, will bring about a stable supply of foodstuffs and oil, as well as a reduction in defense expenses, thus serving as a new factor for invigorating its economy. It is expected that this year North Korea will, for the first time, induce foreign capital to Najin-Sonbong free trade zone as part of its external opening up. North Korea will also likely induce foreign investments for developing sight-seeing resources in the Mt. Paektu and Mt. Kumgang areas. It is presumed, however, that North Korea will decide on the opening of Nampo industrial zone and the like after analyzing the result of development of Najin-Sonbong district. It is clear that North Korea will accelerate external trade following declaration of the trade-first policy and will diversify its markets by extending to Europe, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. Needless to say, North Korea will direct its efforts on restoring normal economic relations with China, Russia, and Iran with a view to securing a stable supply of foodstuffs and oil. However, such a limited opening up will work as an occasion to strengthen the control of people in a bid to maintain the system, because North Korea has learned a lesson from Eastern Europe that opening up should not be allowed to be a factor for collapse of the system. Therefore, North Korea will allow only the people whose so-called identities and status are reliable, to move in the Najin-Sonbong district, which will be opened as a free trade zone; and ideological indoctrination among the residents will be intensified more than ever before. North Korea's emphasis on national tradition by unearthing the Tangun Tomb and dealing with the issue of national cultural inheritance as the first agenda item at the Supreme People's Assembly held in December 1993 can be regarded as a signal of strengthening the ideological control of the people. Such indications were also noted during the Korean intellectuals' rally held in late 1992 at which the laws on opening were revised, and during the rally of forerunners with beautiful communist traits held last December at which the trade-first policy was declared. In spite of such intensified internal control in North Korea, this year will be the first year of substantive changes in North Korean residents' consciousness. This is because frequent exchanges with the West after declaring the trade-first policy and the limited economic opening up will inevitably result in changes in residents' consciousness. The success of the control of North Korean residents in the midst of the policy of limited opening up will be a key to choosing opening up or self-reliance.
