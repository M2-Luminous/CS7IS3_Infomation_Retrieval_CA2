He said this at a news conference at Bratislava airport, immediately after the return of the Slovak delegation. The prifme minister considers Thailand to be an important trade and economic partner, too. According to Meciar, Slovakia has achieved a certain opening with regard to relations with Turkey, and Pakistani officials are also showing an interest in visiting Slovakia. At the news conference, the prime minister refused to comment on the resignations of Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik. He said that so far he has not heard President's Kovac's stand and that he has not yet gathered enough information about the matter. He also failed to comment on the alleged statements by Jan Slota, the newly elected chairman of the Slovak National Party [SNS], who is said to have expressed admiration of Russian ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. The prime minister stressed that the SNS continues to be the coalition partner of the HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia]. A trend toward implementing elements of an authoritarian regime is what is emerging when the internal political situation in Slovakia is assessed abroad. This was said by Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik at a news conference in Bratislava. He said that, if this proves to be true, Slovakia's position abroad, with regard to its integration into Europe, would suffer. Jozef Moravcik expressed the view that Slovakia's foreign policy orientation will be preserved because Slovakia has already taken important international legal steps in that direction, such as signing the association agreement with the European Union and the umbrella agreement on participating in the Partnership for Peace program.
