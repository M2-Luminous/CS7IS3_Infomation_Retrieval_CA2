Bosnian Serb Army sources estimate that the Moslem leadership is endeavouring, wherever possible, to provoke the Serb Army's reaction to its attacks, in order to heighten tensions and press on with the media demonisation of the Serbs. The Moslems are trying, with the help of the foreign propaganda machine, to blame their actions against U.N. peacekeepers and NATO on the Serbs and provoke an anti-Serb reaction from the international public which should eventually lead to further air strikes against the Bosnian Serb Republic. This is why a British NATO plane was downed over the eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde on Saturday and this is why the plane carrying U.N. Commander for Former Yugoslavia General Bertrand de Lapresle came under fire from Moslem positions in Sarajevo, Serb Army sources say. They explain that Moslem attacks and provocations intensify on most fronts when NATO planes are buzzing overhead, with small-arms, mortars and anti-aircraft guns in full play. The Bosnian Serb Army is refraining as much as possible from reacting, but makes it clear that whoever should attack the Bosnian Serb Republic would be treated as an enemy. Serb Army circles expect the imminent crushing of the Moslem offensive to be followed by a regrouping of the Moslem forces and fresh attacks on some other fronts. The circles indicate it is high time the Moslem side accepted the offer of the Bosnian Serb military and political leadership for establishing a lasting and total cessation of hostilities throughout the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina and turning to the peace process and a quest for political solutions.
