Presenting the idea, Dr. Mahmad Jadallah, one of the most prominent DFLP activists, said that in view of the feared human rights violations against Palestinians not only by Israel but also by the Palestinian national government that will be established in the territories, "someone must try to stop irregularities and violations of human rights by Palestinians, even if this is only done by words." The seminar, held yesterday at the al-Watani Hotel in East Jerusalem, dealt with issues on the current agenda of Palestinian society involving its fears with regard to the future. Among other things, the participants discussed relations between the individual and the Palestinian government that will be established in the territories, the status and role of human rights watch organizations in relation to that government, the status of Palestinian women, and the proposed constitution for the Palestinian government. In the discussions, sharp criticism was leveled at the PLO leadership for signing the Oslo agreement; for its lack of awareness of the need to teach democratic values in schools and other institutions; and for other negative phenomena in the territories, such as the murder of innocent people.
