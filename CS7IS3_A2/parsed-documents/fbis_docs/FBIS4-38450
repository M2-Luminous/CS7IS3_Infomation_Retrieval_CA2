Taking part in the session of the commission are representatives from a mission of a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the Russian Federation, Georgia and Abkhazia. The commission is expected to look into a procedure of registering refugees and all those who wish to return, and problems of conducting an information campaign. "There are strong differences between the sides about the number of people wishing to return," said Deputy Chairman of the Abkhazian Council of Ministers, Leonid Lakerbaya. "Abkhazia is against using any approximate figures," he said. "In accordance with an agreement signed in Moscow the right to return to Abkhazia is given to all those who did not take part in military operations. We shall abide by this rule," Lakerbaya added. Abkhazian representatives insist on the fact that the process of refugee return should not be stepped up. For the time being, they are prepared to discuss the return of refugees to the Galsk region only. Lakerbaya believes that at the first stage, no more than 200 applications, asking for permission to return, shall be accepted, while the Georgian side insists on the fact that the process of refugee return be stepped up as much as possible. Another demand made by the Abkhazian side is that those who wish to return must confirm that they will not fight against the lawful authorities and pledge to comply with Abkhazian laws. A group of experts in charge of the information campaign met before the commission began its work. Deputy Chairman of the Abkhazian Minister of the Press and Information Beslan Gurdzhua told ITAR-TASS that it is necessary to inform people about current developments and create a favourable psychological climate. "People are being frightened by statements on mass return of refugees," Gurdzhua said. "No social and economic conditions for this have been created in the republic yet, " he added.
