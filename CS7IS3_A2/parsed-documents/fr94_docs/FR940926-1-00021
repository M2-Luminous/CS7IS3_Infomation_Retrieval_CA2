FR940926-1-00021 FR940926-1-00009 In addition for the wild ginseng, the following information and data can be provided in narrative form: 1. Approximate number of ginseng collectors (diggers) in the State and whether the number appears to be increasing, stable, or decreasing. 2. A description (or copy) of the State's regulations for the annual harvest of wild ginseng, including (a) designated harvest season_preferably to begin after seeds are mature; and (b) harvest requirements, such as (i) minimum size or age of plants allowed to be collected_at least 3-leaf (3-prong) is recommended, and (ii) whether seeds from collected plants are to be planted and only at the harvest sites, etc. 3. Number of pounds (dry weight) of ginseng roots certified by the State for export. 4. Information on trends in roots per pound (dry weight) for the State or, if possible, natural regions of the State, indicating whether the number of roots per pound appears to be increasing, stable, or decreasing. 5. A brief description of any research projects related to ginseng's status that the State has initiated or that are ongoing in the State. 6. The State's opinion, based on the information and data provided on the topics above and any other information and data that the State may provide, as to whether the removal of the ginseng from the wild in the State might have been adverse for the State's entire population of the species. For cultivated ginseng, the following information and data can be provided in map, tabular, or narrative form. Ginseng is considered cultivated when it is artificially propagated and maintained under controlled conditions, for example in intensively or intermittently prepared or managed gardens or patches under artificial or natural shade. 1. Counties in which ginseng is commercially cultivated. 2. The number of pounds (dry weight) of cultivated ginseng roots certified by the State for export. Management Authority Criteria In addition to the Scientific Authority finding that ginseng exports will not be detrimental to the survival of the species, the Management Authority must be satisfied (1) that the ginseng was not obtained in contravention of laws for its protection, and (2) as to whether it was of wild or cultivated origin. Criteria used by the Management Authority in determining a State program's qualifications for export are that the State has adopted and is implementing the following regulatory measures (see 50 FR 39691, September 30, 1985): 1. A State ginseng law and regulations mandating State licensing or registration of persons purchasing or selling ginseng collected or grown in that State. 2. State requirements that these licensed or registered ginseng dealers maintain true and complete records of their commerce in the annually harvested ginseng and provide copies of such records to the State in a signed and dated statement at least every 90 days (within 15 days of end of each quarter of calendar year) and a year-end accounting of the total commerce for the year. 3. Dealer records required to show date of transaction, whether roots and plants were wild or cultivated, if roots were dried or fresh (green) at time of transaction, weight of roots, weight or number of plants, State of origin of roots or plants, and identification numbers of the State certificates used to ship ginseng from the State of origin. The name and address of the seller or buyer of record of the ginseng shall be maintained by the dealer on his/her own copy of commerce record forms supplied by the State(s) of licensing and shall be made available to the State ginseng-program manager(s) upon request. 4. Inspection and certification by State personnel of all wild ginseng harvested in the State to authenticate that ginseng was legally obtained from wild sources within the State. Cultivated ginseng harvested in the State may be certified by licensed or registered dealers approved by the State to make such an accounting of this ginseng. Experience has shown the value of an inspection and certification program by State official(s) who can document both the weight of the ginseng roots (weight or number of plants) involved and that they were legally taken from the wild or cultivated in that State. Dealer certification for cultivated ginseng is being considered because the declared origin of the root is indicative of whether it is wild or cultivated and the marked difference in appearance and price between wild and cultivated ginseng makes it reasonably unlikely that wild ginseng would be certified by a State-approved dealer as cultivated. Cultivated ginseng may be recorded by such a dealer and exported with appropriate CITES export documents without further certification by State officials. 5. Ginseng unsold by March 31 of the year after harvest must be weighed by the State, and the dealer, digger, or root owner given a State weight receipt. Future State export certification of this stock for export is to be issued against the State weight receipt. 6. Certificate of origin forms for wild ginseng must remain in State control until issued at certification. The certificate of origin forms for all ginseng must contain the following information: (a) State of origin; (b) Serial number of certificate; (c) Dealer's State registration number; (d) Dealer's shipment number for that harvest season; (e) Year of harvest of ginseng being certified; (f) Designation as wild or cultivated roots or plants; (g) Designation as dried or fresh (green) roots, or live plants; (h) Weight of roots or plants (or number of plants) separately expressed both numerically and in writing;
