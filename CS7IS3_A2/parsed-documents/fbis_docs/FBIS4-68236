The authors of those features assert that the higher educational institution is in complete decline, and its graduates have no prospects with regard to the service. They ask whether it would not be better to train lieutenants for the fleets of Russia, and not only for the Ukrainian Navy. What is the sense of the cutbacks that are taking place? A discussion by the senior officer of the press center of the Ukrainian Navy, Captain-Lieutenant Albiy Shudrya, with SVMI [Sevastopol Naval Institute] Chief Rear-Admiral Viktor Makarov began with that question. [Makarov] The Armed Forces of Ukraine are being cut back as a whole; their size has been defined by the Supreme Soviet. The quantitative composition of the Navy is defined accordingly, and orders are placed from the state on that basis. We also train specialists for Derzhkomatom [State Committee for Nuclear Power] and Derzkomkordon [State Border Commission]. As for the training of officers for the Russian Navy, Russia itself has refused this, taking out all cadets who did not take the Ukrainian oath. No one demanded any payment for the training of those cadets. We were prepared to complete their training without charge, in accordance with the Dahomys and Yalta agreements. Proceeding from some political views or ambitions, all of those people who did not want to study here were called back from Sevastopol in April of 1993. We are prepared to work according to that plan, however. Belarus will possibly order some specialists--they do not have very many military schools--and Kazakhstan could also resolve the issue of training cadres here. If such a proposal were to appear, we would of course study it... The institute is not collapsing and is not being dissolved, but is rather being reformed. The group of those who want to study is being cut back, as is occurring at all of the higher educational institutions of Ukraine--both civilian and military. The state will be training as many specialists as it requires. The laboratory base, simulators, a number of departments and support personnel are all being preserved at the institute. Some naval services are being accommodated in the freed-up spaces, close to 50 percent of the premises today. As for the accommodation of subunits of the National Guard, that is disinformation. [Shudrya] Why were more cadets than are needed accepted last year? [Makarov] We were proceeding from the Yalta and Moscow agreements between Ukraine and Russia. The discussion concerns the division of the Black Sea Fleet [ChF] in a ratio of 50 percent to 50 percent. The order for the training of specialists was placed with a regard for that. We know today, however, that the resolution of the issue of the Black Sea Fleet at Massandra has been disrupted, and this group became unnecessary. The graduates of 1992-93 were thus greater than the requirements for officers. Some of the graduates, true, were sent to replenish the Ukrainian Navy. The ChF command, however, did not display any interest in assigning the young officers to vacant positions. Many of the graduates were discharged into the reserves. [Shudrya] The cutbacks in cadets will lead to cutbacks in instructors. What will happen to the officers and scientific staff members? [Makarov] We will not be dismissing the instructors, and do not intend to let anyone go. The naval scientific-research center is still far from fully staffed. There are many vacancies at command levels of the institute, and commanders of subunits, companies and departments are needed. There are also quite a few positions in the Ukrainian Navy that would suit our officers as well. I had a conversation with the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, and I can report that such an opportunity will be granted in a case where there is a desire to continue service. There are also quite a few higher positions in the department of the Navy or at the newly created Armed Forces Institute of Ukraine. [Shudrya] Newspaper features assert that the recruitment of cadets will now take place in Kiev. Has there really been such a decision? [Makarov] There is such a version. People should come to the institute from other regions, not just from Sevastopol. Such an imbalance still exists. I feel that this is not entirely fair to the other inhabitants of Ukraine. The more so as many of the oblasts have assumed sponsorship of the Ukrainian Navy. Rivne Oblast, for example, is sponsoring the SVMI. The sponsors have assumed the obligation of sending their own representatives to take the examinations on a competitive basis. [Shudrya] The institute has a good physical plant. Will it be preserved? [Makarov] The physical plant that is needed by the Ukrainian Navy will be preserved, and no questions whatsoever can arise here. We do not intend to eliminate and dismantle it, but are rather proposing to use it, as before, for the training of cadets. As for a new physical plant, it still needs to be resolved where it will be. [Shudrya] Tell me, if you would be so kind, will young men from Sevastopol be trained at the SVMI? [Makarov] I have no doubt of it. The opportunities for access to the institute are the same for everyone. Knowledge, a desire to become a sailor, physical fitness and endurance, however, have to be mandatory. These criteria have always been taken into account. Today, in connection with the fact that the recruiting will be cut back, they move to the forefront. Our task is to select the best, wherever they may come from. Many unfortunately enter the institute only in order to study for a year or two in order to avoid the draft, and then leave. There are people from Sevastopol among those as well. I do not want us to err in selecting those for whom naval service is the path of the romantic.
