FR940406-0-00142 FR940406-0-00011 26. A new §86.098&hyph;25 is added to subpart A to read as follows: §86.098&hyph;25 Maintenance. Section 86.098&hyph;25 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from §86.094&hyph;25. Where a paragraph in §86.094&hyph;25 is identical and applicable to §86.098&hyph;25, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;25.'' (a)(1) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;25. (a)(2) Maintenance performed on vehicles, engines, subsystems, or components used to determine exhaust, evaporative or refueling emission deterioration factors is classified as either emission- related or non-emission-related and each of these can be classified as either scheduled or unscheduled. Further, some emission-related maintenance is also classified as critical emission-related maintenance. (b) Introductory text through (b)(3)(vi)(D) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;25. (b)(3)(vi)(E) Evaporative and/or refueling emission canister(s). (F) Turbochargers. (G) Carburetors. (H) Superchargers. (I) EGR System including all related filters and control valves. (J) Mechanical fillpipe seals. (b)(3)(vii) through (b)(6)(i)(E) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;25. (b)(6)(i)(F) Evaporative and refueling emission control system components (excluding canister air filter). (b)(6)(i)(G) through (h) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;25. 27. A new §86.098&hyph;26 is added to subpart A to read as follows: §86.098&hyph;26 Mileage and service accumulation; emission measurements. Section 86.098&hyph;26 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from §86.094&hyph;26, §86.095&hyph;26 or §86.096&hyph;26. Where a paragraph in §86.094&hyph;26, §86.095&hyph;26 or §86.096&hyph;26 is identical and applicable to §86.098&hyph;26, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;26.'' or ``[Reserved]. For guidance see §86.095&hyph;26.'' or ``[Reserved]. For guidance see §86.096&hyph;26.''. (a)(1) and (2) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;26. (a)(3) Emission data vehicles. Unless otherwise provided for in §86.098&hyph;23(a), emission-data vehicles shall be operated and tested as described in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii)(C) of this section and §86.094&hyph;26 (a)(3)(ii)(A), (B) and (D). (i) Otto-cycle. (A) The manufacturer shall determine, for each engine family, the mileage at which the engine-system combination is stabilized for emission-data testing. The manufacturer shall maintain, and provide to the Administrator if requested, a record of the rationale used in making this determination. The manufacturer may elect to accumulate 4,000 miles on each test vehicle within an engine family without making a determination. The manufacturer must accumulate a minimum of 2,000 miles (3,219 kilometers) on each test vehicle within an engine family. All test vehicle mileage must be accurately determined, recorded, and reported to the Administrator. Any vehicle used to represent emission-data vehicle selections under §86.098&hyph;24(b)(1) shall be equipped with an engine and emission control system that has accumulated the mileage the manufacturer chose to accumulate on the test vehicle. Fuel economy data generated from certification vehicles selected in accordance with §86.098&hyph;24(b)(1) with engine-system combinations that have accumulated more than 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) shall be factored in accordance with 40 CFR 600.006&hyph;87(c). Complete exhaust, evaporative and refueling (if required) emission tests shall be conducted for each emission-data vehicle selection under §86.098&hyph;24(b)(1). The Administrator may determine under §86.094&hyph;24(f) that no testing is required. (B) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;26. (C) Exhaust, evaporative and refueling emissions tests for emission-data vehicle(s) selected for testing under §86.096&hyph;24(b)(1) (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) or §86.098&hyph;24(b)(1)(vii)(B) shall be conducted at the mileage (2,000 mile minimum) at which the engine-system combination is stabilized for emission testing under low-altitude conditions. (a)(3)(i)(B) through (a)(3)(ii)(B) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;26. (a)(3)(ii)(C) Exhaust, evaporative and refueling emissions tests (as required) for emission-data vehicle(s) selected for testing under §86.096&hyph;24(b)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv), or §86.098&hyph;24 (b)(1)(vii)(B) shall be conducted at the mileage (2,000 mile minimum) at which the engine-system combination is stabilized for emission testing under low-altitude conditions. (a)(3)(ii)(D) through (b)(4)(i)(C) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;26. (b)(4)(i)(D) through (b)(4)(ii)(D) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.095&hyph;26. (b)(4)(iii) [Reserved]. (b)(4)(iv) through (c)(3) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;26. (c)(4) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.096&hyph;26. (d) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;26.
