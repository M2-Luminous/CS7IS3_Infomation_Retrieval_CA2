FR941220-0-00095 FR941220-0-00014 As clarification, it is the Department's position that the LCA-filing employer has no prerogative_other than in circumstances described above_but to pay the required wage beginning no later than the day the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant is in the United States under the control and employ of that LCA-filing employer, and continuing throughout the nonimmigrant's period of employment. Any H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant employed under an LCA in a full-time capacity (the part-time block not having been checked on Item 7(b) of the LCA) shall be guaranteed full-time pay (ordinarily 40 hours' pay) each week, or the weekly equivalent if paid a monthly or annual salary. If the employer's LCA shows ``part-time employment,'' the employer will be required to pay the nonproductive employee for at least the number of hours to be worked per week indicated on the I&hyph;129 petition filed by the employer with the INS. If the employer indicates on the LCA that an employee is to work only part-time and subsequent investigation discloses that in fact the employee was working full-time in a majority of the weeks during the period covered by the investigation, the employer will be held responsible for full-time pay including during nonproductive periods for which the worker received either no pay or less than the required wage. i. Time bar on investigation of complaints and on imposition of remedies (See § XXXX .805(d)(5).) Through enforcement experience, the Department has become aware that the Interim Final Rule's provision regarding timeliness of complaints, § XXXX .805(c)(5) (now § XXXX .805(d)(5)), does not give sufficient guidance concerning the implementation of the statutory directive that ``[n]o investigation or hearing shall be conducted on a complaint concerning *␣*␣* a failure [to meet a condition specified in an LCA] or misrepresentation [of material facts in such an application] unless the complaint was filed not later than 12 months after the date of the failure or misrepresentation, respectively.'' 8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(2)(A). The Interim Final Rule states that ``[t]he complaint must be filed no later than 12 months after the date of the alleged violation(s).'' In enforcement proceedings some employers have argued that this time bar falls on all alleged violations 12 months from the date of the filing of the LCA, which embodies all the employer's obligations and against which any failure or misrepresentation would be determined. It is the Department's continuing position that the statutory language, taken in its plain meaning, ties the 12-month time bar to the date of the employer's wrongful action ( e.g., failure to pay the required wage) and not to the date of the LCA. If Congress had intended the LCA date to be controlling, the statute easily could have been written to so specify. Thus, the Interim Final Rule speaks of ``the date of the alleged violation(s).'' In order to resolve any possible confusion, the regulation is being clarified. The Final Rule specifies that ``[t]he complaint must be filed not later than 12 months after the latest date on which the alleged violation(s) were committed, which would be the date on which the employer allegedly failed to perform an action or fulfill a condition specified in the LCA, or allegedly took an action or failed to take an action which, through such action or inaction, demonstrates a misrepresentation of a material fact in the LCA regarding such action or inaction.'' The Department does not consider this statutory provision to be applicable to the scope of available remedies (particularly, the back wage remedy); Congress dealth with remedies in a separate provision (8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(2)(C)) which neither contains nor references the 12-month time bar. Thus, neither the Interim Final Rule nor the Final Rule contains a 12-month limitation regarding the scope of remedies, and the rule has been clarified to expressly so provide. j. Debarment timing (notice to Attorney General) (See § XXXX .855(a).) The statute requires that the Secretary notify the Attorney General of an employer's violation(s). Pursuant to § XXXX .855(a) of the Interim Final Rule, the Administrator is required to notify the Attorney General (AG) and ETA of the final determination of a violation by an employer upon the earliest of the following events: (1) Where the Administrator determines that there is a basis for a finding of violation by an employer, and no timely request for hearing is made pursuant to § XXXX .820 of this part; or (2) Where, after a hearing, the administrative law judge issues a decision and order finding a violation by an employer; or (3) Where the administrative law judge finds that there was no violation by an employer, and the Secretary, upon review, issues a decision pursuant to § XXXX .845 of this part, holding that a violation was committed by an employer. This regulatory construct creates a situation where the Administrator notifies the AG of a violation upon a finding of a violation by an ALJ, even though such finding subsequently may be appealed to the Secretary and eventually overturned. An employer thus could be debarred after a finding of violation by an ALJ, serve part or all of the debarment period, and subsequently be found by the Secretary not to have committed a violation. To correct this anomaly, § XXXX .855(a) has been amended to require notification to the AG after a finding of a violation by an ALJ only under the following circumstances: (a) where there is no appeal from the ALJ's finding to the Secretary; (b) where, upon such appeal, the Secretary declines to review the ALJ's finding; and (c) where, upon review, the Secretary affirms the ALJ's finding. k. Prevailing wage computation (See § XXXX .731(a)(2)(iii).) As clarification, the first sentence in § XXXX .731(a)(2)(iii) is amended to conform to the wording at 20 CFR 656.40(a)(2)(i). As stated in the Preamble to the Interim Final Rule published on October 22, 1991, the regulation ``incorporates the language of 20 CFR 656.40, as required by the Conference Report (see 56 FR 54723).'' The change in this Final Rule is not substantive in nature, but provides more detailed guidance in the correct procedure to compute a valid average or arithmetic mean.
