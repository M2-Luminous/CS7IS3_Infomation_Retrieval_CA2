Japanese negotiators like to work overnight. Probably, they always camp out to be trained for all-night negotiations." With Japan-U.S. summit talks just ahead, U.S. negotiators are strengthening their criticism of Japanese bureaucrats over Japan-U.S. comprehensive trade talks, where progress is hardly being made. However, Joan Spero, U.S. under secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs, sarcastically criticized Japan's slow negotiation style at a news conference held at the Japan Press Club on 12 January. Spero "analyzed" Japan's negotiation attitude, saying, "When they play judo, Japanese always assume the defensive position. She said: It seems that they think there are steps they have to go through in negotiations, too." At the initial stage, they flatly refuse our demands, saying "there is absolutely no discrimination against foreign companies and the markets are open to all." But, they would say "let's talk a little" if the United States makes counterarguments by citing data and examples. Thus, the second stage of discussions starts. She added that Japanese "hardly show their hand." In this way, she made a cutting remark at negotiation technique of Japanese bureaucrats. She said that unlike "Americans, who immediately reveal their intention because they are good-natured people," Japanese negotiators start to bring all-night discussions to a settlement at midnight on the very last day of negotiation period. As she said this, reporters at the news conference burst into laughter. But, Spero explained the current situation, saying: "(The trade talks) are still at the first stage and we are arguing whether the Japanese markets are open or closed to foreign companies." She concluded the news conference by saying that "we are trying to get enough sleep now to be ready for the final all-night sessions" so that we will not be beaten by the tough Japanese bureaucrats.
