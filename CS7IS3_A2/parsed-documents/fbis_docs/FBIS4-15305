On the eve of the second tour of the parliamentary elections, 48 percent of the constituents are ready to vote for them. Such are the results of the public poll in Ukraine conducted by the Democratic Initiatives Centre and the Institute of Sociology of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. A fifth of the polled believe that Ukraine can get out of the crisis only in a close political and economic union with Russia. Nearly every fourth Ukrainian thinks it necessary for the republic to join the rouble zone. Twelve percent of the voters pin hopes on the bloc of the parties headed by ex-Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma and ex-Vice Speaker of the Parliament Vladimir Grinev who advocate the restoration of severed contacts with Russia. Seventeen percent of the people do not believe anybody. The parties and organisations of Ukrainian nationalists are supported by only two percent of the voters.
