Speaking to the Mozambican and international media, Gen. Domingos Fondo made it very clear that he could not care less about Dhlakama's accusations. He added that Afonso Dhlakama must go to court, present his case, and prove his accusations or he will have to pay. [Begin Fondo recording] As you know, our country has an institution that deals with accusations such as those. He should draw up a criminal complaint and deliver it directly to the correct institution so it can summon Gen. Fondo to answer those charges. He should bring the matter before the court rather than make those comments in public. A person who accuses another person of having committed a crime does not do so in the street but, rather, brings the case before the competent institution. I do not feel offended at this stage [words indistinct] must go directly to court and if there is no concrete evidence to back what he is saying, he will pay. When a person makes an accusation [words indistinct] has to pay. If you accuse someone of stealing, you go to court and say: he has stolen from me. In turn, the court will say: well, you must pay now. [end recording] Asked about international media reports on his alleged involvement in arms trafficking, Gen. Domingos Fondo said he had nothing to say. He was also asked to comment on whether he has business interests in South Africa: [Begin recording] [Fondo] I do not know whether you have come here as businessmen. If you are here to treat me as a businessman, then I must take off my uniform and then you must talk to me as you would to a businessman. [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct]. [Fondo] If you are here to treat me as a businessman, then let us talk directly about what my company does. If I am here accused of (?smuggling) arms, then that is another matter altogether. You are here to talk to me as a member of parliament and a member of the Mozambique Liberation Front Party. [Reporter] [Words indistinct]. [Fondo] [Words indistinct] (?weapons), if someone gets in touch with me, he does so in my capacity as general, to offer weapons at that particular time [words indistinct] (?and then it is over).
