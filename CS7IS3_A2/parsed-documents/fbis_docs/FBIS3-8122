Klaus stressed that until this morning it was not clear which planes had been involved. "We know well that in this strange war many strange things are done by individuals which are not entirely synchronized and coordinated with the others," he said. In Bosnia there were now various "subcommanders who have the power to send out four planes somewhere," Klaus said. "Therefore I think I am right in saying that not even the NATO commander was clear -- he said so this morning -- as to where the planes left from and why they were going somewhere," Klaus said, adding that "something happened, and it is unnecessary to speculate about what it will lead to."
