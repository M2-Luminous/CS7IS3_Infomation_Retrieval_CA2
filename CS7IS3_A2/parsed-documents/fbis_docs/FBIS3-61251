To a considerable extent, these needs can be met and provided for by means of creating and developing satellite-link systems. The practical experience gained by other states in this sector attests to the fact that what works in creating national satellite-link systems is either based on the share-type participation of state and commercial structures, or leasing satellite-link channels from other countries. There are sufficient grounds for considering that Ukraine's scientific, technical, and industrial potential--as well as its geopolitical position--will enable us to solve this problem in a comprehensive manner. In accordance with the directive issued by the president of Ukraine, dated 3 October 1992 and entitled "On a National System of Communications Links," as well as Decree No. 92 issued by the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, dated 4 February 1993 and entitled "On Measures Regarding the Creation of a Unified, National System of Communications Links," the Ukrainian National Space Agency (NKAU) has developed a Program for Creating a Ukrainian Satellite-Link System. Primary attention in this program was accorded to the following four services, which we will briefly discuss below in order to inform the readers of URYADOVYY KURYER. A satellite-link system for general use This has the task of providing and ensuring an international liknk, as well as additional (reserve) communications channels within our country at times of overloading and accidents on the radio-relay lines and cable links. At present international telephone links have been provided to the United States, Canada, and Southeast Asia by the satellite-link station in the city of Zolochev (there are approximately 500 telephone cables here); this is done via satellites of the international consortium known as Eutelsat. To Western Europe communications links have been provided via Eutelsat's European satellite by a station set up at the Kiev International Telephone Exchange (120 channels). Further development of this service will be carried out by way of modernizing the Zolochev Station (its potential throughput capacity is close to 1000 telephone channels), and the station at the KMTS [Kiev International Telephone Exchange] (with close to 500 channels). Provisions have also been made to build satellite stations in oblast centers. 2. A system of satellite television viewing As of today, the territory of Ukraine has no broadcasting stations within a network for distributing TV programs via satellite, although individual consumers or users can receive more than 20 TV channels from foreign satellites. Our program provides for expanding two or three channels to Ukraine and to Europe, as well as for broadcasting TV items to the United States, Siberia, and the Far East. For this purpose we will be able to utilize the resources of the station at Zolochev, as well as the teleport whose construction is planned to begin quite close to Kiev. This teleport has been designed in such a way that--after the Lybid spacecraft has been put into operation--most TV will be relayed to the teleport from leased foreign satellites. A system of satellite links with mobile objects With the aid of this system it is planned to organize dispatcher-type links for guiding or direct technological processes for transport. At the present time links with mobile objects (and in Ukraine these are still only ships) are carried out via spacecraft of Intelsat and Gorizont, as well as the central station (TsMSZ-1) located in the city of Odessa. Our program provides for expanding the technical capabilities of TsMSZ-1 in order to offer the new types of services which are now being introduced all over the world. Beginning in 1995, we will be launching the Arkos and Mayak satellites in order to replace Russia's Gorizont satellites. The NKAU has been conducting negotiations with the Informkosmos Joint-Stock Company--the developer of the Marafon mobile satellite link. The purpose of Ukraine's participation in this project was conditioned by several factors. These include advantageous rates for us for the link services and the participation in this project by Ukraine's leading enterprises, in particular, by the Muson Concern, located in the city of Sevastopol. It is the only plant on the territory of the former Soviet Union which has produced mobile satellite-link stations for civilian uses. We must also take into account the fact that satellite links constitute one of the most profitable types of business, and hence Ukraine's participation in these promising international projects is desirable, all the more so in that investments can be made in the form of products of our own enterprises, rather than by hard currency. 4. A system of satellite links for news, information, and business This service will consist of individual networks of links which will provide exchanges of information in the interests of the president, organs of state administration, banking structures, various departments, etc. Certain networks of the business and information links are being created within the framework of the program for converting defense-type enterprises. Thus, for example, the Kiev Radio Plant is producing small-scale stations for the Sokil satellite link (the dimenions of the antenna are 46 X 46 cm), on the basis of which the communications network of the Ukrinterzv'yazok Firm are being organized. The large-scale network of a banking communications link for Ukraine's Prominvestbank is being created by the Geosat firm, based on the SSZ [satellite-link station] which is being turned out in Izhevsk. Negotiations are being carried out with Western partners concerning joint production of SZ stations for individual use at Ukrainian enterprises. These stations can operate within the international networks of the satellite links on spacecraft of Intelsat and Eutelsat. The developers of the program which we are discussing here envision two stages for implementing it. The first stage is offering the services on the basis of leasing already-existing satellite links, developing a ground-level infrastructure in all four of the above-mentioned services, as well as the development, manufacture, and launch of our own satellite links, along with participation in the international project for the Marafon mobile link system. The second stage is as follows: After the launch of the Lybid spacecraft, most of the traffic will be transferred to it. Leasing channels on foreign satellites is to be maintained--for the most part--by means of links with America and the Asian-Pacific region. What is envisioned is the possibility and the capacity of leasing to other states and to foreign organizations a portion of the resources of this spacecraft, offering to make available the services of this satellite link to adjacent regions, carrying out launches with the aid of Zenit rocket-carriers, and selling systems as a whole, including those of rocket-carriers and spacecraft. Developing the Ukrainian satellite-link system in the first stage--prior to 1997--in the event that all the services envisioned by our program are adopted--would require 300 billion krb. [karbovantsy] (at the prices prevailing in July 1993) and 100 million dollars. Most of the hard-currency outlays (97 million dollars) would be earmarked for leasing channels on foreign spacecraft. From the time when the Lybid spacecraft is put into operation these outlays--while retaining and even increasing the volume of services rendered by the satellite links--would be reduced by approximately two-thirds and would amount to about 5 or 6 million dollars per annum. The expenditures in the national currency for maintaining the Lybid satellite-link system would not increase because the basic funds for creating it would have been spent during the first stage. And so (not even taking profits into account) the creation of a satellite-link system using our own spacecraft would enable us to save some 10-12 million dollars a year and to offer users in Ukraine all the necessary services of a satellite link. If we were to abandon the creation of our own spacecraft and hire foreigners on a contract basis to produce it and launch it into orbit, then the outlays for creating the satellite segment alone--one which would be analogous to Lybid--would amount to approximately 160-200 million dollars, instead of 30-50 billion krb. Such a great difference is to be explained--in addition to everything else--by the high degree of readiness of the Zenit rocket-carrier and by the capability for manufacturing our own platforms for satellite links. In other words, Ukraine already has an abundant supply of those very systems components which are so expensive on the world market. The difference in the value of a satellite link "made on contract" and one of our own systems amounts to a factor of 8-10. And this also provides us with an opportunity to acquire big profits both from selling the services of our links and from selling the satellite links themselves--as well as their launches--on the world market. We are still at the beginning of the road to creating a satellite-link system in Ukraine. But this road must be traveled so that Ukraine may become a truly independent state.
