And yet, in this electoral campaign, you have attacked each other day in, day out... [Fini] My judgment has not changed. Bossi is the Attila of Italian politics. When we sit down around a table, the League will have to scale down its pretensions. And Bossi will not only be the one who will count less, but he will end up like the one who in general goes and buys the cigarettes. [LA REPUBBLICA] And who will be prime minister? [Fini] The electorate will point that out, and the president will appoint him. This is not a decision for party secretaries. One thing is certain: The prime minister can never be someone like Bossi. For the simple reason that a member of the League, an exponent of a party which is not national, cannot be prime minister. Strauss was the leader of Bavaria but he never dreamed of putting himself forward for the chancellorship. [LA REPUBBLICA] And Berlusconi? [Fini] As far as I am concerned, Berlusconi can be prime minister without problems. [LA REPUBBLICA] Is a government with League and MSI [Italian Social Movement] ministers possible? [Fini] Yes, on condition that the League is clear on two points: a clear decision in favor of national unity and genuine solidarity between the north and the south. [LA REPUBBLICA] They too are asking you to state your position on federalism. Is that all right for you? [Fini] What they call federalism can in our view be called decentralization. If this is what it is, we can discuss. If, on the other hand, they wish to despoil the state of all its skills, if they are looking for three republics, the answer is no. [LA REPUBBLICA] The PPI [Italian Popular Party] maintains that the Pact for Italy is the only lineup that seems ready to govern. How do you respond to this? [Fini] I too saw [PPI Venice Regional Secretary] Rosy Bindi on television. She said they already had their program in the drawer. I do not find it difficult to believe her: It is the same one they have had for the past 40 years. [LA REPUBBLICA] Who says that a Berlusconi-Fini-Bossi majority will not be quarrelsome like the old five-party system? [Fini] All coalition governments are exposed to the danger of internal conflicts. The Left too had its difficulties, it seems to me. But what is the alternative? The single party?
