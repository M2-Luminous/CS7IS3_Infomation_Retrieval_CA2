L. Kravchuk in Search of `Historical Enemy'"] [Text] Lvov -- As might have been expected, the failure of the Ukrainian-Russian talks on the parameters of the division of the Black Sea Fleet is being actively discussed in Ukraine. Rejecting accusations of revising the Moscow agreements previously reached by the presidents of the two states, Ukrainians are pinning the entire responsibility for the conflict on the Russian side. Naturally, the fuss that has been raised does not help the majority of Ukrainian citizens, who are already following all the divisions ensuing from the Belovezhskaya Forest agreement with great pain, to remain calm. The only people who have benefitted from the tension have perhaps been the right-wing, radically inclined nationalist forces. With support from the Kiev authorities, they have tried to unleash an appropriate propaganda campaign. They are presenting the essence of the problem as the eviction of sovereign Ukraine from its own territory in Crimea through the "occupation" of the latter by the Russian Federation Navy. The Ukrainian leadership is being blamed for serious mistakes in respect of the Black Sea Fleet and Crimea, which have "made it possible to turn the peninsula into the bridgehead of Russia's permanent threat of aggression against the Ukrainian state." The Ukrainians are also very pained about the results of the meeting between Pavel Grachev and admirals and officers of the Black Sea Fleet staff and the promotion in rank of the commander of Cheleken who, according to the Ukrainian side, took stolen radiological equipment worth millions of dollars out of Odessa. Moscow's attempts to include Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov in the negotiating process are also being received in a mixed way, to say the least. This attempt may help intensify separatist moods in Crimea and reinforce Meshkov's own position. The national democrats are demanding the adoption of resolute and tough measures by official Kiev. They insist on restricting the topics for discussion during the Ukrainian-Russian talks to no more than the division of the Black Sea Fleet, with the gradual withdrawal of all Russian military structures from Ukrainian territory, which, in their opinion, is the main object of the claims of the neighboring state. By trying to impose on Russia a territory outside Ukraine by way of a permanent main base for the Black Sea Fleet, for example Novorossiysk, people here are trying to create problems for Moscow with the so-called "floating stock." The Ukrainian authorities do not agree with the assertion made by P. Grachev during a press conference that the Ukrainian Navy has seized 126 Black Sea Fleet ships, and apart from that, a 20-percent share seemed too small for the infrastructure of the fleet. Strange as it may seem, the explosive situation has proved advantageous to Leonid Kravchuk in terms of settling his own domestic problems. And if it does not prove possible to put a stop to the early elections, which do not bode well for the president, then the chance remains of least somehow keeping afloat, using the image of savior of the nation and the state in the face of intervention by the "historical enemy," which is on the point of beginning tomorrow. That, perhaps, is precisely where one of the roots of the conflict lies. That is why, despite the statement made by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense Press Service on its readiness to resume the negotiating process at any time, to be honest, there is not much certainty that this will happen.
