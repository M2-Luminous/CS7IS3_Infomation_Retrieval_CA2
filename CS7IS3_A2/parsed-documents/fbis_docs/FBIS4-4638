FBIS4-4638 "dreas064_d_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-064 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 South Korea Foreign Minister Returns From U.S., Japan Foreign Minister Returns From U.S., Japan SK0404133294 Seoul YONHAP in English 1147 GMT 4 Apr 94 SK0404133294 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said here on Monday afternoon that he expects China will influence North Korea to fulfill its obligations spelled out in the UN Security Council president's recent statement over the nuclear question. The minister noted that the council president's statement was unanimously adopted and China played a positive role in the process. While meeting with the press on arrival at Kimpo Airport from his tour of the United States and Japan, Han said South Korea, United States and Japan are carrying on efforts to persuade North Korea through China. "If North Korea fails to fulfill the obligations within a specific period of time, the UN Security Council will take up the issue again, at which stage it would apparently take strong steps," he said. The foreign minister also said that North Korea's acceptance of additional inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is one of prerequisites, not the sole condition, for third-round U.S.-North Korea high-level talks. He thus held fast to the position that the U.S.-North Korea agreement made on last Feb. 25 remains valid. Regarding the issue of the Team Spirit exercise, Minister Han declined to say whether the joint exercise would be resumed by saying South Korea is discussing the question with United States.
