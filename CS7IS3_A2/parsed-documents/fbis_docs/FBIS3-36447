The Constitution Will Be Abolished Later On"] [Text] After the government has been reformed, the parliamentary majority has found itself in a difficult position: T he ambiguous assessments of the new Cabinet of Ministers have played havoc with the Communists' plans. The economic part of the program by the Russian Federation Communist Party and its allies was based on "anti-shock" declarations. Whereas the agrarians' tasks are obvious -- get as much money as possible -- the communists, fighting against President Yeltsin and "his constitution," have lost their main trump in this struggle -- propaganda against Russia's Choice. Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov believes, however, that Russia's Choice members are still entrenched in the presidential and government apparatus. By way of illustration of their continued activity he cited the signing of a friendship treaty with Georgia and the abolition of benefits for workers in the country's northern regions. Mr. Zyuganov is ready to be patient with the "sensible" part of the Cabinet of Ministers if he sees "a sound program for revising the reform course." The Russian Federation Communist Party is ready to approve in general "the initiative by Academicians Abalkin and Petrakov." The communists hope that their program will be a focus "around which all forces in the government and parliament, except Russia's Choice, will rally." To accomplish their main objective -- "the removal of the ruling regime" -- the communists are still considering three options. The first is achieving victory in local elections. According to Mr. Zyuganov, regional administrations will try to write regulations on elections to suit themselves and the president will end up controlling the provinces. Here, the communist leader believes, the Duma must step in by adopting a local election law. The second option -- disavowal of the constitution -- according to Zyuganov, is too early to discuss. "One must not stir up a storm all at once," he said. The constitution, in his opinion, will be "rejected by life itself." The third option relates precisely to how such life should be organized. The "extreme measure" -- a Russian-wide strike -- the communists claim, "will wipe out the regime but also finally kill the economy."
