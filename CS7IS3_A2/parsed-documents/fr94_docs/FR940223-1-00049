FR940223-1-00049 FR940223-1-00008 Regulatory Evaluation It has been determined pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that these rules will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the terms of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 501 et seq. It has also been determined that these rules do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment pursuant to Executive Order 12612. These rules do not contain any information collection requirements as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3502(4), and consequently the review provisions of 44 U.S.C. 3507 and the implementing regulations in 5 CFR part 1320 do not apply. List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 3001 Administrative practice and procedure, Postal Service. For the reasons set out in the preamble, 39 CFR part 3001 is proposed to be amended as follows: PART 3001_RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE 1. The authority citation for 39 CFR part 3001 continues to read as follows: Authority: 39 U.S.C. 404(b), 3603, 3622&hyph;3624, 3661, 84 Stat. 759&hyph;762, 764, 90 Stat. 1303; (5 U.S.C. 553), 80 Stat. 383. Subpart A_Rules of General Applicability 2. Section 3001.10 would be amended by revising paragraph (a) and by adding paragraph (d) to read as follows: ยง3001.10 Form and number of copies of documents. (a) Production. If not printed, documents filed with the Commission shall be produced on paper of letter size, 8 to 81/2 inches wide by 101/2 to 11 inches long, with left- and right-hand margins not less than 1 inch and other margins not less than 0.75 inches, except tables, charts or special documents attached thereto may be larger if required, provided that they are folded to the size of the document to which they are attached. The impression shall be on only one side of the paper unless there are more than ten pages. The text shall be not less than one and one-half spaced except that footnotes and quotations may be single spaced. Any typeface not smaller than 12 pt may be used. If the document is bound, it shall be bound on the left side. Copies of documents for filing and service may be reproduced by any duplicating process that produces clear and legible copies. * * * * * (d) Electronic filings . (1) All testimony, exhibits, workpapers, library references, briefs and reply briefs which have been prepared on a computer or word processor shall be filed as diskettes (or otherwise electronically transmitted to the Commission) within five business days of the initial filing of the hard copy. (2) Diskettes filed pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section may be provided in any widely-used format. The preferred formats are IBM&hyph;PC compatible diskettes in Word Perfect, Microsoft Word, ASCII text, Lotus (DOS 3.0 or later version), or DIF format. If these formats are not used to produce the initial hard copy, diskettes will be accepted in any format actually used. Documents which have been generated on a mainframe or minicomputer, for example, shall be converted to diskettes, if possible. In such cases as these, where a file translation program must be used to produce a PC-compatible diskette, reasonable conversion programs will satisfy the requirements of this section. If a party has generated hard copy of documents subject to this section on a computer other than a personal computer and lacks the capability of producing a PC-compatible diskette, the party must arrange for other means of conveying the information electronically. Recommended alternatives to the filing of diskettes are transmission by modem or providing the information on magnetic tape.
