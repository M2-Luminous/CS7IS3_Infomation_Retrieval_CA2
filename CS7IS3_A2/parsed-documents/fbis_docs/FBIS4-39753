He made this statement at a government meeting in Moscow Thursday. Soskovets harshly criticized the leaders of some federal ministries and agencies, including the Machine-Building Committee and the Atomic Energy Ministry, for poor discipline and feeble control over the situation in specific branches. Commenting on the performance of a number of federal executive bodies, he said "We are doing our job very badly." Soskovets said the government meeting had summed up the results of its performance in the first half of the year. "There are no outstanding success in the sphere of industrial production, an unbiased assessment is needed," he said, adding "the movement of reforms will depend on how we use the executive power we are entrusted with." Soskovets said Russia had lost its positions on the world arms market. Soviet arms exports totalled 30 percent of the world market compared to the USA's 35 percent. Now the situation has thoroughly changed, he said. Russia's exports amount for a mere five percent, while the U.S.A. controls 65 percent of the world arms market. "We have suffered great losses in this area, it is necessary to restore our positions gradually, step by step," Soskovets said.
