Primary concerns deal with the rational use of a fixed currency exchange rate. In an inflationary situation a fixed rate of currency exchange rapidly loses meaning, especially when inflation is prolonged. The results are an increase in imports and a decrease in exports, the need to support the currency abroad, and transformation of Ukraine into a supplier of capital for other countries, especially Russia. In fact, Russia regards a fixed rate of exchange in Ukraine as a source of income in their economic plans for 1994. The IMF calculated that in 1993 Ukraine lost 1.3 billion U.S. dollars because of state of affairs. The negative balance of payment is destroying Ukrainian potential as an exporter and further exacerbates Ukrainian foreign debt, which in 1993 reached 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. This spells total economic ruin. The obvious solution is to institute a market-controlled floating exchange rate for the karbovanets vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar and the ruble. Many experts agree on this course of action, including the IMF and V. Yushchenko, head of the Ukrainian National Bank (UNB). With certain economic adjustments, this approach makes sense theoretically and conceptually. The best alternative for Ukraine at present is a controlled exchange rate, i.e., a free-floating rate during a transitional period until Ukraine develops a stable monetary system to support all financial transactions. An absolute prerequisite for a floating exchange rate is the creation of a stabilizing fund to control the supply and demand for currency and alleviate the loss of millions of dollars at the UNB used to cover billions in foreign debts. How did Russia manage to introduce a floating rate of exchange without a stabilizing fund? For one thing, Russia has a positive balance of trade thanks to its exports of fuel, raw products and armanents, all of which raises the value of the ruble with respect to the coupon-karbovanets. For another, unlike Ukraine, Russia can also intervene in the monetary market, while the contrived high ruble-to-karbovanets ratio assures a positive balance of trade with Ukraine by charging a lot for goods exported to Ukraine and paying little for goods imported from Ukraine. This is neocolonialism in the finest sense of the word and makes it possible for Russia to agree to a disproportionately low ruble-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate. The UNB advocates a 100 percent mandatory regulation of currency in relation to market conditions, based on the theoretical arguments that this will ensure a more realistic and accurate exchange rate. While theoretically true, such a course may screen subsidies at the UNB unless mandatory--but liberal--taxation is introduced to stimulate exports and increase flow of capital into the country. The current national deficit is due precisely to the lack of such taxes. Money for the national monetary fund would come from taxes on exports, the selling of exported goods at the prevalent global prices, and recovery of export subsidies. The Ukrainian foreign debt is an artificial creation of the accord signed between Ukraine and Russia in Moscow in October 1992. In it, Ukraine assumed responsibility for the debts of its industry, while Russia did incur an analogous obligation for its industry. Furthermore, Ukraine agreed to sell its goods at below market value and to charge virtually nothing for the transit of Russian goods and those of other CIS countries across Ukrainian territory. Finally, Ukraine agreed to ineffective import-export, tariff, and monetary policies which make our products uncompetitive on the CIS market. Consequently, without drastic reforms in our foreign trade policies it will be impossible to eliminate Ukraine's foreign debt.
