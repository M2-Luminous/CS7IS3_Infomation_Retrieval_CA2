Among the possible variants for utilizing the highly-enriched uranium removed from nuclear warheads, the proposal by the American "General Atomics" company was the most acceptable. The contract provided for creating in Ukraine a joint enterprise to process highly-enriched uranium and transform it into nuclear fuel for atomic electric power plants [AES's]. The following are the advantages of this variant: m--no expenditure associated with the transportation of highly enriched uranium; m--with the help of contemporary ecologically safe technologies, highly enriched uranium may be effectively transformed into fuel; m--conditions are created for Ukraine to earn hard currency rapidly; m--Ukraine's long-term technological cooperation with the world's advanced companies in the sphere of nuclear power engineering. An enterprise, more specifically a small production unit, may be built within one or two years. The cost of the construction is $30 million. After the fulfillment of the program for processing the highly-enriched uranium, the production may be reprofiled for the needs of Ukraine's nuclear-fuel cycle. 2. The transfer of nuclear warheads to Russia is stipulated by interstate documents "The Main Principles of the Utilization of Nuclear Charges of the Strategic Nuclear Forces Deployed in Ukraine" and "The Agreement Between the Ukrainian Government and the Government of the Russian Federation on the Utilization of Nuclear Warheads," which were signed on 3 September 1993 in Massandra [in the Crimea] during the meetings of presidents L.M. Kravchuk and B.N. Yeltsin. In accordance with the clauses of the aforementioned agreements, Ukraine committed itself to transferring to Russia all types of nuclear warheads of intercontinental nuclear missiles and air-launched cruise missiles for them to be dismantled and utilized. No other possible variants of dismantling nuclear warheads were considered. 3. On the world market, the price of nuclear fuel, which is supplied in accordance with long-term contracts, amounts to between $1,000 and $1,400 per kilogram. One-time agreements on fuel supply are somewhat cheaper -- between $600 and $700 per kilogram. Ukraine receives all its fuel for atomic plants from Russian enterprises at prices close to world prices. However, practice shows that the majority of world countries with nuclear power engineering have their own enterprises that manufacture fuel cartridges because it is economically rational. Ukraine has large deposits of uranium ore and some functioning enterprises of the nuclear-fuel cycle -- the enrichment of crude uranium, production of zirconium for heat-generating elements, absorbing materials, and so on. That is why it would be much more profitable for Ukraine to manufacture our own fuel cartridges than to purchase them from Russia. The cost of constructing such an enterprise is about $500 million; it could be built within two or three years; in the conditions prevailing in Ukraine, the period of recoupment would be three years. 4. If we proceed from the assumption that capacities for the production of nuclear fuel are created in Ukraine, something upon which Ukrainian nuclear specialists and scientists insist, then it is most expedient to use nuclear materials from the warheads for the needs of our own power engineering. If nuclear warheads are transferred to Russia, it is much more profitable for Ukraine to receive compensation for the nuclear materials, and not compensation in the form of nuclear fuel. For example, in accordance with some estimates, the cost of highly- enriched uranium is 100 times that of the price of low-grade uranium contained in the fuel cartridge, and weapons-grade plutonium costs between five and 10 times that of the highly-enriched uranium. That is why Ukraine is entitled to compensation of $10 billion for the nuclear materials from tactical weapons alone. The cost of all those fuel cartridges, which Russia promises to supply in exchange for Ukraine's nuclear weapons will only constitute between $1 billion and $2 billion. 5. The problem here lies not so much in the inability of scientific collectives as in the absence of desire on the part of our leadership to do something. 6. In accordance with Ukraine's Supreme Council decree "On Additional Measures for Ensuring Ukraine's Nonnuclear Status," which was adopted in April 1992, the government had to take urgent measures to establish effective technological control over the nonuse of the nuclear weapons located on the territory of Ukraine. It was planned to have this work fulfilled by one of the Kharkiv Institutes which developed practically all systems of control over the former USSR's strategic offensive weapons. The Supreme Council's decisions have not been fulfilled to this day and, for that reason, it is, probably, appropriate to speak about seven to 10 years, in order not to do anything at all. Partnership for Peace is the attempt, on the part of the United States, without entering into a conflict with Russia, to fill in that vacuum of security that resulted from the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact and the USSR. However, in conditions of political instability and expansion of the revanchist moods in Russia, the West's indecisiveness in creating effective security systems in Europe may lead to yet another redivision of the spheres of influence and to a restoration of Russian hegemony within the CIS or Eastern Europe.
