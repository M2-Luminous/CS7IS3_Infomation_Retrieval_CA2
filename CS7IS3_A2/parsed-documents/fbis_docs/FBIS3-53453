'Asfur affirmed that "this team has not left Taba since the halt in the negotiations on Wednesday [12 January]." 'Asfur denied that "there are secret talks between the Palestinians and Israelis," affirming that "the talks have been halted, and that they will resume tomorrow, Monday, as agreed." 'Asfur hoped that progress will be made in the negotiations that will be resumed in Taba tomorrow, affirming that "the Palestinian side rejects Israeli pressures, which are aimed at extricating concessions." 'Asfur added: "We have submitted a compromise to the Israeli side on the issue of the border crossings with Jordan and Egypt, one that falls in line with the spirit of the Declaration of Principles, and heeds Israeli external security, as well." 'Asfur went on to say: "We are awaiting the Israelis' response in the next round of the Taba negotiations." He affirmed the Palestinian side's "commitment to the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles." The Palestinian official affirmed that "coordination between the Palestinians and Israelis on the border crossings must involve the entire border crossings; that is, from the entrance to the crossing up to the territories that will fall under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority." With regard to the size of the Jericho area, 'Asfur said that "the Palestinian side is insisting that it include populated areas as well as historical and religious sites." All these, he noted, must be under the jurisdiction of the future Palestinian authority. As for the issue of settlements, this is a complicated issue, he said. "However, we hope that we will make progress towards a resolution of this issue," he added. The negotiations which started on Monday were halted on Wednesday evening so that the head of the Israeli delegation to the negotiations could take part in the funeral of Nehemya Tamari, commander of the Central Command, who was killed when his helicopter crashed north of occupied Jerusalem on the night of 11-12 January. Dr. Nabil Sha'th has said that 35 percent of the civilian issues discussed have been finalized. The two delegations are yet to address the issues of water problems, planning, and preparations on the ground, not to mention the construction of housing units.
