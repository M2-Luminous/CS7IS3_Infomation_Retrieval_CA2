FR940325-0-00011 FR940325-0-00003 The Commission has found that multi-site States, when not fully participating in an exercise at a specific site will usually partially participate at a significant level of activity every 2 years at that specific site in order to support the participation of the appropriate local governments. The Commission has found that this level of exercise participation provides adequate emergency response training for State and local governments. Additionally, a provision still exists in the regulation which permits State or local government participation in any licensee's drills or exercises. A State or local government may consider its response capability to be less than optimal because of an unusually large personnel turnover or because there have been limited responses to real emergencies in the community. The regulation still requires the licensees to provide for State or local government participation if they indicate such a desire. This final revision does not have any adverse impact on public health and safety because State emergency response personnel continuously respond to actual emergencies and experience has shown that states through a combination of full and partial participation exercises maintain an adequate level of response capability. A formal requirement for a State to return to a specific site every 7 years to participate in an exercise has proven to be unnecessary. This rulemaking deletes that unnecessary, unwarranted and burdensome requirement. Nonetheless, nothing prevents a State from returning to a specific site to participate in an exercise whenever it deems warranted. Lastly, this revision deletes past due dates (see section F(2) (a)) because they are now meaningless. FEMA concurs with the amendments in this rulemaking. Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in subpart A of 10 CFR part 51, that this rule is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment; and therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required. This regulation updates and clarifies the emergency planning regulations relating to exercises. It does not involve any modification to any plant or revise the need for or the standards for emergency plans, and there is no adverse effect on the quality of the environment. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact on which this determination is based are available for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20036. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement This final rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget approval number 3150&hyph;0011. Regulatory Analysis The Commission has prepared a regulatory analysis on this regulation. The analysis examines the costs and benefits of the alternatives considered by the Commission. The analysis is available for inspection in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20036. Single copies of the analysis may be obtained from Michael Jamgochian, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Telephone: (301) 492&hyph;3918. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification The regulation does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The final rule updates and clarifies ambiguities in the emergency planning regulations relating to exercises. Nuclear power plant licensees do not fall within the definition of small business in Section 3 of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632, the Small Business Size Standards of the Small Business Administration in 13 CFR part 121, or the Commission's Size Standards published at 56 FR 56671 (November 6, 1991). Therefore, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission hereby certifies that this final rule, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and that, therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis need not be prepared.
