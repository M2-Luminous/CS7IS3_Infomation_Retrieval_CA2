Following these wild geese are tens of thousands of migrant workers, who are swarming into Xinjiang like tides. Statistics provided by the Urumqi railway station's passenger transportation department indicate that the railway station transported 200,000 migrant workers in the autumn and winter of last year, and more than 100,000 migrant workers have come to Urumqi from 20 February of this year to the present. These migrant workers are only staying in Xinjiang temporarily, but more have settled down in the region. According to a report by XINJIANG JUNKEN BAO [Army Reclamation Newspaper], there is a production team on a vegetable farm in the southern part of the Taklimakan desert that consists of 430 members, all of whom are migrant workers. Zheng Bangjun came to Xinjiang from Sichuan's Qiuling County. As soon as he found a plot of land for development in the Tarim basin in 1987, he immediately helped move six of his eight brothers and sisters to this place. Incomplete statistics show that there are more than 300,000 migrant workers in Xinjiang now. Migrant workers keep coming to Xinjiang despite its remoteness in location. The emergence of migrant workers' thronging into Xinjiang has been due to China's reform and opening up and to the breakthroughs in rural economic structural reform. Contracting land to each household and linking remunerations to output have boosted the initiative of the 800 million peasants, thus emancipating the productive forces and making it possible for many peasants to leave their farmlands for cities. The reform of China's grain policy, which was introduced in 1993, enabled the peasants to stay in cities. In the past, commodity grain was not available without urban domicile. This domicile registration system tightly restricted the peasants to the rural areas. The overall lifting of control over grain prices had a great impact on the domicile registration system and made it possible for surplus rural laborers to move to cities. Therefore, in a sense, the emergence of a large number of migrant workers at present is a sign of social progress.
