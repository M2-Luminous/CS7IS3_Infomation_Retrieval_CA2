The sources said that the cost of this number could reach $560 million, while the Jericho area and the Gaza Strip need 10,000 for the transitional phase, costing $212 million. The source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Israel, which always uses security concerns as an excuse, is rejecting these figures and believes they are exaggerated, demanding that they be reduced to 5,000 or 6,000 policemen only. The source, who asked to remain anonymous, added that the Israeli proposal has been rejected, and that this rejection has been conveyed to the Palestinian delegation to the Taba committee negotiations aimed at determining the number of the Palestinian police forces and the type of weapons they are going to use. The source pointed out that the Israeli side is also refusing to agree to the Palestinian police forces being armed with heavy, or even medium, weapons. The source confirmed that numerous states -- among them Britain, Sweden, Spain, Greece, the Netherlands, Russia, and the United States -- have submitted proposals to train and arm the Palestinian police. But they still remain promises and statements in the air, while the United States has recently trained a special security team for Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat. The source emphasized that Israel is flooding the occupied territories with light and medium weapons and equipment in preparation for implementing certain schemes designed to sabotage the peace process, foment sedition, and spread panic among Palestinian citizens, and also to show the extent of the Palestinian security forces' competence in controlling the Palestinian scene. The source added that arms have spread rapidly and there are now about 12,000 pieces. He pointed out that Israel has full lists of those who have arms.
