[Shanudah] Do not forget that the Vatican represents a state, not just a church. The Vatican pope is a head of state and head of a church, and he has ambassadors in foreign countries. This, therefore, is not a reconciliation between Christians and Jews. The Vatican pope represents only the Catholics. All the others -- Orthodox, Protestant, and Anglican churches -- are not associated with this policy and have nothing to do with it. As for us, our dispute with the Jews is known. [passage omitted] [Al-Sa'id] What about reports that Coptic tourists have begun visiting Jerusalem? This contradicts your declared position that there will be no pilgrimage to Jerusalem before peace prevails and Israel pulls out of the occupied Arab territories. [Shanudah] We still adhere to our declared position. We will not go to Jerusalem unless we all go together. Reports about Coptic pilgrims in Jerusalem are untrue and merely propaganda. We still ban travel to Jerusalem. [passage omitted] [Al-Sa'id] Do you fear the growing extremism and violence by some individuals in the country? [Shanudah] We fear no one but God. And we even want to move from fearing God to loving Him. When we love God, we will not be linked to Him with feelings of fear. We want all people to be religious, but not extremists or fanatics. [Al-Sa'id] In light of the current call for a national dialogue, is there a real possibility for an Islamic-Christian dialogue? [Shanudah] The Islamic-Christian dialogue should keep away from creeds and focus on cooperation between Muslims and Christians in all fields without discussing differences of faith and creed. This will help people keep their love for each other. [Al-Sa'id] What is the truth in saying that the Coptic Church is emotionally inclined toward the West, especially the United State, perhaps because they have the same religion? [Shanudah] Common religion does not mean common policy. There are many Islamic countries, each with its own policy, and the same applies to Christian states. [passage omitted] Another point: You may speak of a common religion, but there is more than one sect. While the Copts are orthodox, the majority of Westerners are either Protestants or Catholics. So, there is a sectarian difference that may cause a conflict between the two sides, especially since we know that foreign missionaries have come to Egypt and tried to convert the Copts by various means and ways. I wonder what emotional inclination you mean in your question, and toward which Western countries? [Al-Sa'id] The United States. This may be because it is the most powerful. [Shanudah] It is known that the United States supports the Jews, and our policy toward the Jews is known. Support for the Jews is something no one accepts at all. This support in itself indicates that differences in religion do not affect policymaking. The Americans and the Jews have different religions, but they are politically in agreement.
