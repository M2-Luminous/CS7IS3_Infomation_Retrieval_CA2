Uribe Velez spoke with our economics section about these past 18 months in politics, during which time he has had to put up with lobbying, criticism, threats, and even impertinent questions from a reporter in Armenia, who asked him what pension fund he owned. [Sarmiento] What is the most important thing about the social security reform? [Uribe] It contains mechanisms for expanding coverage to improve health care; over the long run these mechanisms will mean steady growth for social security service in terms of broader coverage and a major improvement in quality. It also contains a capitalization mechanism that will boost national savings appreciably, and this should have very favorable macroeconomic ramifications in the medium term. [Sarmiento] The feeling in the country is that the law boosted contributions but reduced pensions, which is not at all good for Colombian workers.... [Uribe] Setting up state-run institutions was in vogue in Colombia in the 1960's, as it was all over the world. The creators of these institutions did not realize how inefficient an all-powerful State would become. In recent years we have seen a totally opposite vogue: the neoliberal vogue of dismantling the entire State. The reform's major virtue is that it balances State participation very well with the participation of private citizens and social entities. The State is involved as a regulator, as a monitor, and also as a provider of social services; private citizens and social entities deliver services. We are devising a major synthesis here. We are placing the system at a happy medium between the two extremes of total nationalization, as in the 1960's, and the complete transfer of these public services to market forces, as some champions of neoliberalism advocate. We are placing ourselves at a social center of great importance. Unlike countries such as Chile and Peru, among others, in Colombia contributions are not going to be paid exclusively by the workers; on the contrary, employers are going to pay the larger share. And why are contributions being increased? As far as pensions are concerned, we are moving up to 1996 the increase to 13.5 percent that we would have to have in place by around 2010. The very likely consequence is that if we have a 13.5 percent rate as of 1996, we will not have to order further increases to pay pensions during the next generation. The advantage of an increase now is not only that it will avoid future increases but also that it will enable us to gradually resolve the government's problem of its huge debt to future retirees. The average length of service of workers is 12 years, and moreover there are no reserves. As the State begins to collect these higher contributions, like any private sector employer, they will guarantee enough reserves to meet these obligations. We are not boosting contributions for health care. We are simply leveling them out at the top to extend coverage to the worker's family. The eligibility age is being raised very little. Whereas other countries have put it at 65, which was the administration's initial proposal, Congress raised it to just 62 for men and 57 for women, and only as of 2014. In other words, the age has been raised conservatively and far into the future. [Sarmiento] Why do you regard this reform as the most important of the past half century? [Uribe] Because this country delivers social security services to a very small percentage of the population, barely 21 percent, whereas coverage in the industrialized countries is close to 100 percent and the average is between 40 and 50 percent in Latin America. Colombia, at 21 percent, is barely at Haiti's level. This reform provides all of the mechanisms for us to start expanding coverage. [Sarmiento] Isn't it utopian to think that by the year 2000 all Colombians will have health care? [Uribe] The goal is a very ambitious one, and in this connection I am less optimistic than the health minister, but we have to make an effort to come as close to it as we can. The first step is to fulfill the legal obligation that in a year's time the ISS [Social Security Institute] has to offer family coverage to all its affiliates. This will be an essential element for credibility in enforcing the new law. Second, the public funding for health care in coming years is going to rise from 2 to 4 percent of the GDP. Third, one quarter of the revenues of the departments and municipalities must go to health care. And fourth, some of the revenues of the territorial entities that will come from Cusiana and Cupiagua will expand the health-care budgets as of 1997. [Sarmiento] The comment that laws do not bring votes but that social security could cost votes is making the rounds in Congress. Aren't you afraid that it may jeopardize your aspiration to be governor of Antioquia? [Uribe] The governorship is an aspiration, but now is not the time to bring it up. Let's see what happens in 1994. I think that Colombia, like so many other Latin American countries, has been banishing populism. I think that populist harangues bring applause but do not speak to Colombians' deep-seated rationality. I believe much more strongly in the good sense of people, who prefer serious reforms to simple populist harangues. Reforming is very hard and initially causes headaches, but in the end it is one of the few things that make politics gratifying. [Sarmiento] Do you consider this a perfect reform? [Uribe] This law will no doubt have to be reformed in the future. It is not perfect, but it establishes very important institutions that are destined to last for a very long time in Colombia. We cannot aspire to perfection because social security is very complicated. There is a social security crisis the world over; all countries are seeking a model. We have developed a very Colombian model, based on our own experience and our own idiosyncrasies, but unlike in Chile, Peru, and Bolivia, this reform was not adopted either by a dictatorial government, or a strong Executive without Congress, or an Executive without a deliberative public. We have adopted it here with a pluralistic Congress, four months before elections, with a vigilant public, and in a democracy with an opposition. [Sarmiento] What worries you about the law? [Uribe] I am worried that in the area of health care the 12 percent rate may not be enough. But to the extent that the system works well, in a year or two political and social conditions conducive to an increase will have been created. I am also worried that the hike will be hard on small and mid-sized business, but this problem will be felt just in the first few years. They will then begin to reap the benefits of better health services and a substantial growth in savings. [Sarmiento] The administration says that in adopting the reform it was thinking more about our poorest citizens. How will it affect these segments of society? [Uribe] The reform provides a very important instrument for the members of the informal economy and poor peasants: the possibility that the family allowance funds and the cooperative sector can organize themselves as health promotion enterprises. As family-allowance funding is rechanneled to bring health care to these groups in our large cities and on small peasant farms, we are going to make headway in extending services to people who have long been ignored. [Sarmiento] How would you convince the country that the law is not a bad one, when some think that the next administration's first task will be to reform it? [Uribe] I believe strongly in the practical effects of the reform. We have altered 50-year old social security legislation that had brought us to very low levels of coverage. It is only fair to call for a reasonable period of lead time before evaluating the practical results. [Sarmiento] The academic sector feels that in seven years or so the pension contributions will have to be increased again because the reform was an equation that Congress broke because hiking the contributions was not enough. [Uribe] Congress was conservative in tightening the requirements, to the extent that a pluralistic Congress could do so. Many people there said that raising contributions meant that requirements did not have to be tightened or certain benefits cut. The projections of the actuaries tell us that this equation improves into the future and that the ISS and the system in general may make it to the year 2020 with a large cushion of reserves. [Sarmiento] In the final accounting, who does this law cover? [Uribe] The main dividing line in the reform is, by and large, age, with exceptions. A minimal part will apply to males over 40 and females over 35. Everyone will have to make larger contributions, however. [Sarmiento] In one sentence how would you describe the social security reform? [Uribe] As a reform with major challenges. [Sarmiento] We are about to have a change in administration. Is there any guarantee that the next one will implement the reform? [Uribe] I do not think that President Gaviria's reformist spirit, which was a fundamental factor in this reform, is going to go for naught. I am certain that whoever the next president of Colombia is, he will take up the task of implementing it. It will be excellent for the next administration to find the legislative part clearly defined and all set to be implemented. [Sarmiento] Doesn't this law privatize pensions and health care? [Uribe] The major virtue of this law is that it follows neither the nationalization wave of the 1960's nor the privatizing wave of neoliberalism. It aims for a sensible happy medium. It tells the State: you monitor and regulate. And it tells private individuals and the social sector: you cooperate with the government in delivering these services and in steadily expanding social security. [Sarmiento] Since this law is not perfect, what are its shortcomings? [Uribe] So far I would point out two minor problems. In the early years contributions are going to be very heavy for small and midsized businesses. And the health-care contribution is inadequate for now. [Sarmiento] Was there a great deal of pressure to get this reform out? [Uribe] Not pressure, but everybody had ideas about the reform. Political parties, employer and labor unions. All economic, social, and political sectors voiced opinions. And I would say that the purpose of the reform was not to apportion discontent equitably, as Saint Thomas put it, but rather to develop common ground that is good for the country. [Sarmiento] Have there been threats against your life? [Uribe] I have not been threatened. Politics entails risks, and you have to face up to them with patriotism. When you enter politics, you have to choose between trying to preserve the entire established order, the political modus vivendi, and helping to transform it. I believe that as long as I am in politics, I have to help transform it and work patriotically, with thoroughgoing devotion for Colombia and to be very prudent during the difficult times in political life.
