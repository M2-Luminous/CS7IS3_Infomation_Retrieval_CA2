In this edition, we begin publishing a bimonthly supplement on this topic. David Montoya, of the Special Report team, was able to interview the chief of the DINANDRO [National Counternarcotics Division], General Walter Taboada Milla. The National Police's DINANDRO has been operating since 1 January 1992, the date of the merger of the two divisions of the PIP [Peruvian Investigative Police] and Civil Guard that had been responsible for that task. The merger into a single division made it possible to reinforce the police work on what is known as interdiction. Now, there is more national information on the problem, available more rapidly. The DINANDRO's mission combines intelligence and interdiction activities, and simultaneous coordination with the Armed Forces throughout the country. [Montoya] Starting with the topic of the "Vaticano" case, is it true that some artists had to be arrested to create a smokescreen in the country? Did they really have to be arrested based on "orders from above," without evidence? [Taboada] It was called an order from above, referring to their superiors in the chain of command. So, there was no agency apart from the police that ordered the detention of those persons. [Montoya] But there was no apparent evidence for detaining them, was there? [Taboada] Then why didn't they complain; why didn't they file a suit for habeas corpus? We detained them to investigate the specific case involving the financial aspect, because there was a series of contradictions. (Later, one of those detained sued the interior minister.) [Montoya] And in the case of Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, did you succeed in proving the drug trafficking charges? [Taboada] Within 12 days, we collected sufficient evidence to sentence him for a great many years. By his own admission, he was a drug trafficker from 1979 until 1991. [Montoya] But "Vaticano" apparently is going to be sentenced to life imprisonment for his connection with subversion, rather than for drug trafficking. [Taboada] That is a complementary charge. [Montoya] Many people wonder how the Campanilla Army Base could have failed to discover "Vaticano's" illicit activities, and how he managed to create his empire almost before their eyes. What is your opinion of this? [Taboada] We have been totally dedicated to seeking evidence against this individual, and we couldn't go any further in two weeks. The trial judge has paved the way for continuing the investigation and for going as far as necessary. But "Vaticano" didn't start out in Campanilla; he began much sooner, selling by the kilo at first. Later, by 1989 in Uchiza, he was already owner of the "firm," which he called "Loco Limonier." Then he moved to Campanilla. He's a clever man, despite the fact that he has only primary schooling. There, with the entire population's support and the local authorities' approval, he managed to renovate the marginal highway, spending $300,000, and even installing electrical utilities. As this drug trafficker has mentioned, there were no Army personnel there at that time; they arrived later. [Montoya] How much was "Vaticano" moving as regular shipments? [Taboada] "Vaticano" claimed that it was more profitable for him to lease the landing strip than to engage in collecting and shipping drugs. He was leasing his landing strip for $15,000 per flight, and it is his claim that there were about 20 to 25 flights per month. [Montoya] Drug dealing is a financial activity that can corrupt people. Have there been any cases of this kind in the directorate that you head? [Taboada] As human beings, we sometimes make mistakes, and it is due to such a mistake that I am there (in the DINANDRO). You may recall the case of the son of the drug trafficker, "Mosco Loca," who was released. Those responsible were a colonel, a commander, and a captain. For that reason, there was a series of transfers of officials who had been working together for over two years. During my administration no cases have appeared, and I have been there for six months. [Montoya] We are witnessing a drop in the price of PBC, and there is much talk about the international drug traffic's potential opportunity with poppies. How has the DINANDRO been monitoring this product, the base for heroin? [Taboada] There has been considerable talk of poppies. A television channel showed poppies in the San Martin zone bordering Moyobamba and Rodriguez de Mendoza Provinces. We reached the site that had been identified as a growing zone and, according to the video that we have, it is a poppy variety that is useless for extracting gum or latex (components for heroin). To give an idea, the capsule, or bud, must be pear-shaped, and the one that they showed was small, resembling a peanut with a shell, on which incisions could not be made to extract the gum. We have checked other areas, in northern Moyobamba, north of Rioja, where the same type exists; and we reached Jaen, with the same results. [Montoya] What is the drug traffic's future? [Taboada] We are progressing well. We have been outfitting a coordinating office to monitor the components of basic paste. The Ministry of Industry, the DINANDRO, the Public Prosecutor's Office, and the Sunat [National Tax Administration Superintendency] have been integrated into this office. We are also connected to terminals that have sufficient range for monitoring producers, importers, exporters, warehouses, carriers, sellers, and resellers. In other words, the monitoring reaches 80 percent and, when this outfitting is completed, we'll achieve 100 percent. [Montoya] Is the drug traffic currently a priority for the National Police of Peru? [Taboada] In fact, since last year, since September if I'm not mistaken, we have begun attaching greater importance to the interdiction of the drug traffic. You must have heard through the news media that the DINCOTE's [National Counterterrorism Directorate] personnel are going to be reduced. What will be reinforced is the DINANDRO's activity, in order to achieve greater success. [Montoya] Minister Briones has stated that, in 1994, he expects the DINANDRO to become an office with success similar to that of the DINCOTE. Do you all feel identified with this kind of expectation on the part of your superior chiefs? [Taboada] It is not merely an expectation or desire that is involved, but also logistical support. They are backing us so as to convert us, this year, into the police unit that will accrue outstanding success. [Montoya] Does this apply to your personnel's income and bonuses, as well? [Taboada] A system is being introduced whereby we give bonuses to the personnel, but according to the number of seizures, and not daily or monthly. PBC Prices Falling: Drug Traffic Reorganizing in Peru? In the case of Peru, the price of washed PBC, the principal illegal export product, has virtually plummeted thus far in the 1990's. At first glance, this would appear to affect the influence of cash flow from this activity on the Peruvian economy. Nevertheless, at the same time, the drop in basic paste prices could be one of the leading economic factors in the expansion of coca crops on nearly all of the Peruvian jungle border. However, it is also an incentive for growing other crops, such as poppies, which are still incipient in Peru. One possibility is that a period of reorganizing this illegal activity is beginning, wherein coca derivatives will continue to be the main product, but with an outcome not yet possible to predict. It is likely that this downward price trend will continue. However, it is also important that an impetus be given to the alternative development projects, as a centerpiece of the antidrug plans.
