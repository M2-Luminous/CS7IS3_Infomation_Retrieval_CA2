[Begin recording] [Santos] The Public Security Forces were alerted to an unidentified object, near the Camosa area, I understand. Specifically, it was located on the route to Toncotin Airport. The bomb squad went to the site and determined it was an empty box. [end recording] Commenting on the catcalls heard at the Tegucigalpa National Stadium during the inauguration the moment the Honduran Armed Forces General Staff members entered, Santos said: [Begin recording] [Santos] We regard this in a positive light. This definitely shows you rifles have not served only to crush the people. The people at any given time are totally at liberty to express themselves without the fear of being crushed. We believe this is a situation.... [pauses] We look at it under a positive light. These situations definitely merit analysis. This did not happen four years ago, and it happened now. We hope that in the next four years corrective measures are taken. That way the situation will be totally different four years from now. [Unidentified reporter] Colonel, why do you think the people in the stadium jeered you? [Santos] The fact is these things happen to express disapproval of certain actions that are not conducted by institutions but are often isolated incidents by individuals who commit actions that fall outside the law. [end recording] Santos maintained the catcalls were not directly aimed at Luis Alonso Discua, the Armed Forces chief. [Begin Santos recording] This is not a situation against the Armed Forces chief. It shows disapproval of some actions that we have acknowledged at the opportune time and have sought to correct. At any given moment, the important thing is to analyze them with the goal of amending them so these things do not happen. [end recording]
