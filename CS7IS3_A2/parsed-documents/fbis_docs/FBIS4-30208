There are 450 fishing boats of all types on Phu Quy Island and local fishermen earn their income chiefly from deep-sea fishing and diving. In the beginning, fishermen did not want to go and fish in the Truong Sa Archipelago area for fear of poor catches and long trips and a lack of large boats. In early 1993, a fisherman from Phu Quy Island stayed in Truong Sa for one and a half months and earned 150 million dong from shark fishing. Since then, the movement to fish in Truong Sa has developed quickly. A total of 94 fishing boats operated in Truong Sa in 1993 and fishermen caught 5.6 tonnes of shark fins, 250 tonnes of shark flesh, and 180 tonnes of snapper flesh. Since early this year, as many as 150 fishing boats with 1,200 crewmen aboard have conducted fishing activities in Truong Sa. Each trip brought about two tonnes of snapper and goby and an average profit of between three and five million dong. On some occasions, fishermen earned as much as nine million dong in profit per trip. To encourage fishermen to operate in Truong Sa, Binh Thuan Province has adopted a policy under which fishermen who invest in the building of large boats having a 45 horsepower-capacity or more for deep-sea fishing activities, especially in the Truong Sa Archipelago area, will be exempted from taxes for one year. Fishermen will also receive the wholehearted assistance of the defenders on the island.
