Orlova; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] Today in Moscow, representatives of centrist parties discussed the possibility of holding presidential elections in Russia this year. Taking part in today's open sitting of the Centrist bloc, apart from the hosts, were representatives of 14 parties and associations whose political inclinations and ideologies were in complete contrast, even at first glance. For instance, the Sakharov Union of Democratic Forces -- the initiator and creator of the Centrist bloc; the Muzyka publishing house; and arriving slightly late, but accompanied by a whole detachment, leader of the Pamyat National Patriotic Front Dmitriy Vasilyev. Very impressive, don't you think? It was Mr. Vasilyev who began the discussion on the only issue on today's agenda: The possibility of holding early presidential elections on 12 June this year. Well, the sitting started very sluggishly, and after numerous appeals by Chairman Vladimir Voronin [head of Sakharov Union of Democratic Forces] to begin discussing this vital political question, which received no response, the distraught chairman had to repeat his opening speech once again to rouse the sleepy participants. Today's meeting is expected to result in the signing of a joint document on the need for early presidential elections. Many participants already believe that such a decision will be adopted.
