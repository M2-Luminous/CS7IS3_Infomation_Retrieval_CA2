The resolution was taken this afternoon, and the case is therefore dismissed. Judge Pfeiffer had instituted proceedings following charges made by Judge Milton Juica in passing judgment on the murder of the Communist leaders. Gen. Stange and other members of the top echelon of Carabineros were among those accused of nonfulfillment of military duties. The Military Court appointed Judge Pfeiffer to conduct the inquest. Gen. Stange took a leave of absence and was given other tasks during the proceedings. Following the ruling by the Military Court, which confirmed the decision not to prosecute Gen. Stange, Judge Pfeiffer dismissed the case and acquitted all the high-ranking Carabineros officers against whom Judge Juica had brought charges.
