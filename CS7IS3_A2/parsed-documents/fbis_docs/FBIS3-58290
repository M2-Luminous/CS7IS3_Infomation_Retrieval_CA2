"We have different ideas of how such a candidacy should be dealt with appropriately," Hintze told FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG. The CDU did not agree with CSU Chairman Theo Waigel's approach, said Hintze. The CDU would only make a statement when the CDU leadership bodies had held their meeting and made a decision on 14 and 15 January. Waigel acted differently; he first made public statements, and subsequently asked the bodies, said Hintze. At the closed CSU meeting in the Kreuth sap, Waigel said on 6 January that, following a telephone conversation with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the CDU chairman, it was "clear who will be the candidate of the CDU and CSU." WELT AM SONNTAG learned from the Chancellor's Office on 8 January that Helmut Kohl, too, does not agree with Waigel's premature presentation of Herzog. On 8 January, Michael Glos, CSU land group chairman in the Bundestag, sharply rejected Hintze's criticism. His party's approach had been "very appropriate," said Glos at a news conference in Munich. The CSU had always favored Herzog -- who is still president of the Federal Constitutional Court -- for the office of federal president (to be elected on 23 May). He said the CSU had only supported the former CDU/CSU candidate, Steffen Heitmann (CDU), in order not to "put off" the sister party CDU, added Glos. Now that Heitmann "finally" was not available any more, the CSU should have the right to say "audibly and publicly whom it considers a qualified candidate," said Glos. Glos also recommended to the CDU to "make very sure" that the candidate suggested by it has the backing of its own ranks. The CSU did not want to see a CDU candidate called into question by the party's own ranks. Owing to sharp criticism even from CDU politicians, Saxony Justice Minister Heitmann had withdrawn his candidacy as a successor to Richard von Weizsaecker on 25 November 1993. While Chancellor Helmut Kohl stressed his intention to FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE to continue talking about a common candidate with his coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party [FDP], FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer stressed that his party would also stick to its candidate, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher, when Roman Herzog is nominated (the candidate of the Social Democratic Party of Germany is North Rhine-Westphalian Minister President Johannes Rau). According to a Wickert poll, 77.9 percent of the Germans consider Roman Herzog qualified as federal president.
