So far, Shantou boasts a total of 265 Taiwan-invested enterprises with 300 million U.S. dollars in capital. Taiwan is the second largest among all non-state investors in the city, next only to Hong Kong. Greater confidence among investors from Taiwan has enabled them to shift investment from the formerly labor-intensive shoemaking, leather and food industries to technology-intensive fields like electronics, petrochemicals, machinery and industrial crafts. For example, equipment for receiving TV programs via satellite, individual computers and color video electronic keyboards produced by a solely Taiwan-funded technological company in Shantou are welcome in markets in Europe and the U.S. Instead of first executing original trial action, many Taiwan investors have regarded their investment undertakings in Shantou as part of long-term development strategies as embodied by the expansion of fields involved in and the growth of funds to individual projects. More than 10 projects backed by Taiwan investors have cost more than 10 million yuan each. The city has also made remarkable progress in introducing Taiwan investment to its key infrastructural projects. Four Taiwan-based financial groups have decided to contract for the construction of a bridge across the local bay at a cost of 1.5 billion yuan. The foundation of a 16-story "Taiwan mansion" funded by several Taiwan investors was also laid recently in Shantou.
