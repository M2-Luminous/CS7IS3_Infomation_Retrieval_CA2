After their elimination from the budget and from the social services, they could disappear. Severance pay? It could all go into the pension funds. The unemployment compensation fund? Its days are numbered. Everything is now on the table, including even the integrated labor contracts and the contracts that cover an entire category of workers. You are no longer electrocuted when you touch the live wires of the labor unions' gains. RAI [Italian Radio and Television Broadcasting Corporation] President Claudio Dematte did not get a shock when he let it be known that the company plans to delay implementation of the extremely expensive integrated labor contract, and not even when he announced the delay of payment of the 13th month's wages. And the government did not get a shock when it decreed that a government employee will be penalized for his first day of absence. Today, it is no longer impossible to bring up the issue of severance pay or lifetime job security in the public sector without causing an uproar. The contractual totems are crumbling. The certitudes that were won are evaporating, just as many cathedrals of labor no longer appear to be inviolable. What is happening? Is it the logical result of the economic crisis? Or is it the result of an unstoppable trend toward deregulation? Both of these hypotheses appear to be valid. "In fact," says the economist Mario Deaglio, "the one is actually linked to the other" and adds that if this reaction had not occurred, the damage would be substantially greater within a few months. "It is an epochal change," he says. There is no social perception of the phenomenon, however. Although the initial countercurrent experiments have been visible and concrete, no heated debates or widespread confrontations are taking place. Jobs are the Maginot Line, while an ill-concealed abstentionism prevails on the other fronts. The fear of seeming to be excessively free-market oriented is apparently predominant, and the most cherished secret hope is that this difficult moment--which entails doubts and dilemmas--will pass. For the moment, therefore, the problem is not being dealt with nor even discussed, and yet it exists. Farewell to Severance Pay The proposal with respect to severance pay could help to involve employees in the salvage and revival of their companies. It was discussed during the negotiations concening Olivetti's surplus workers. Should severance pay be converted into shares of stock? Why not? These are only the initial references to the problem, which is no longer taboo. "Basically, the practice of setting aside this pay--referred to in the jargon as TFR [remuneration paid upon termination of the employer-employee relationship]--is already being used as a means of financing companies," notes Bruno Manghi, for many years the very active head of the CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions], who is today an advocate of a free market economy. The proposal to channel these sums into the pension funds has received the support of the labor unions and the business community and could soon become reality. "It will depend on the extent of the tax reductions," Manghi predicts. This prospect could also displease those who have always counted on receiving their severance pay. Actually, no one has called into question the rights that have been won. To be sure, the sterilization of these set-aside sums--which have not been completely indexed--has now been accepted following so much controversy, and it is motivating many employees to request advance payment of these sums so that they can buy a home or merely safeguard their capital, hopefully after supplementing it with capital gains. This is the objective of hundreds of employees and managers of the Italian Credit Bank, who have acquired the stock of the bank--which is being privatized--at a 10 percent discount, paying for it with an advance on their severance pay. A different approach is taken by those managers [preceding word in English] who are profiting from the crisis of corporate groups--and the transfer of the ownership of companies--by using their credit to take over their respective companies in MBO (management buyout) [preceding two words in English] transactions. No More Pay for a Thirteenth Month A general experiment was carried out in connection with the payment of wages for a 14th month and the other supplementary monthly payments. In many labor contracts--for example, that of the journalists--these supplementary payments have been frozen and diminished by inflation. Now the pay for the 13th month is coming under fire. There is nothing concrete in this connection, merely some warning signals (RAI is refusing to make the payment)--which in other times would have been the prelude to the bankruptcy of the companies--and some warnings by economists. "Today," the economist Mario Deaglio explains, "production can migrate quickly to countries that are more competitive, and there are many countries that do not pay wages for a 13th month." The problem is obviously not so much the tradition of a one month's Christmas bonus--which is, moreover, already reduced by tax adjustments and by year-end household expenses--as it is the complicated Italian wage structure. And the 13th month wage payments will probably also be included in the reform. Overalls Are Not Mobile "Even in Japan they are coming to realize that a company--or a job--is not a lifetime thing," Stefano Micossi, director of research at Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry], points out. "We should accustom ourselves to changing companies and cities," he warns. Millions of immigrant workers are competing--with modest pretensions--for the marginal and less desirable jobs in the developed countries. And although white collars and blue overalls do not migrate, the production does. "There is also mobility with respect to hours and contractual conditions," Micossi emphasizes. "Today," he explains, "there is only one type of contract. You work from 0900 to 1700 hours. And if there is an attempt to introduce variants--such as part-time [preceding word in English] or temporary employment--in order to adapt to a company's operating conditions, there are regulations and controls that tend to discourage initiatives and to restore the typical situation." In the view of Confindustria, the next challenge will be posed by the concept of contract labor, as envisioned in a new legislative measure. The goal: contract freedom. Custom-Made Pact The next step would be individual bargaining, which is opposed by the labor unions but is now--in practice--increasingly widespread in the higher professional categories, in the specializations, and in the services. Individual hiring is the rule, and individual superminimum wages are a productivity incentive. "A greater differentiation in wages is imperative," explains Sergio Ricossa, one of the principal exponents of Italian economic liberalism, who is convinced that individual bargaining would fuel the recovery of Italy, Inc. "We must provide incentives for productivity rather than penalize it, as is occurring under the system of graduated taxes," Ricossa believes. "Two tax brackets would be enough." A Single Fund It is the old battle against wage leveling, which is more accentuated when a company is in crisis and the unemployment compensation fund is involved. The benefit paid is the same (slightly more than 1 million lire) for blue-collar workers, white collar workers, and managerial levels. "It is an unfair penalty imposed on those who are accustomed to a larger income," Manghi acknowledges, "and for this very reason the creation of an initial graduated scale of benefits is now under discussion." Another previously untouchable taboo has therefore come under close scrutiny. Moreover, the unemployment compensation fund is no longer by definition extendable ad infinitum, without limits. Some companies that have been closed for years have employees who are still receiving the benefit. Now, however, after two years the benefits expire and mobility status begins. Another two years, and the guarantees expire. This system motivates people to accept jobs that were originally rejected. "Mobility status works in areas that have an industrial tradition," Manghi discloses. In Turin, one out of three jobseekers has found other employment. "The unemployment compensation fund is not a product of welfarism," Deaglio insists, in commenting on the exhaustion of the fund's liquid assets. If one must choose, he adds, "it is better to abolish the fictitious jobs and preserve the fund." The reference was obviously to public employment. If job security is endangered in the private sector, the days of welfarism in the public sector would appear to be numbered.
