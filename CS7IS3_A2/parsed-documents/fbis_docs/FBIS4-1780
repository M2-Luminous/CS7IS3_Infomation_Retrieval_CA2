The circular pointed out: At present, the whole party and the whole country are striving to carry out the guiding spirit of the 14th National CPC Congress and the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC CC. China's economic restructuring has developed to a new stage where overall progress and major breakthroughs are integrated. In China, the establishment of a socialist market economy and further emancipation and development of the productive force mean a great creative undertaking, an arduous and complex project involving all of society, and a brand new subject which should be handled properly in establishing socialism with Chinese characteristics. Facing the new situation and tasks, we are confronted with many unfamiliar and incomprehensive things which require our earnest and arduous efforts to study them. How well cadres of all levels and particularly leading cadres study the subject has great bearing on persisting in carrying out the party's basic line to the fullest extent, on initially establishing a socialist market economy by the end of this century, and on smoothly carrying out the second strategic goal of national economy and social development. For this purpose, the CPC CC has decided to urge the broad masses of cadres to conscientiously study the theory and basic knowledge concerning a socialist market economy during the course of organizing comrades of the whole party to study and master Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Concerning the major content and basic requirement of the study, the circular points out: 1. The establishment and development of a socialist market economy constitutes an important part of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This theory is an ideological weapon which we must master in carrying out our economic restructuring. In studying the theory of a socialist market economy, we must, first of all, comprehensively and systematically study relevant expositions in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's works to understand the guiding spirit and essence of his ideas. The report of the 14th National CPC Congress and the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC CC, which are formed with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as a guide, must be used as required reading materials for studying the theory and basic knowledge of a socialist market economy. It is necessary to understand in a broad and deep-going way from these materials the guiding ideology, target requirements, basic principles, major links, and work arrangements for conducting this reform. It is imperative to study various principles, policies, and reform plans adopted by the CPC CC, as well as relevant laws and regulations in an effort to carry out a socialist market economic system. Meanwhile, it is necessary to pay attention to the study of basic knowledge of a socialist market economy. The book entitled "What a Socialist Market Economy Is," jointly compiled by the Development Studies Center under the State Council and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, can be used as a popular textbook. Cadres at all levels, no matter whether they are engaged in economic work or otherwise, should have a full understanding of the importance of the study and enhance their self-awareness and sense of urgency. 2. It is necessary to adhere to the principle of linking theory with practice and manage to apply what one has learned. Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and based on China's basic socialist system and economic development, we should emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, and conscientiously study and boldly borrow all useful experiences of other countries of the world that conform with the rule of modern socialized production during the course of developing their market economy. Efforts should be made to integrate the study of the theory and basic knowledge of a socialist market economy as well as the party's principles and policies with the summing up of practical experiences of each locality, department, and unit in carrying out reform and economic construction and with the efforts to study and resolve understanding problems and working problems in the current reform drive. 3. Efforts should be made, through study and education, to ensure that cadres at all levels will achieve practical results in the following three aspects: First, it is necessary to further unify the ideology to carry out the guiding spirit of the 14th National CPC Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC CC. We must correctly understand the intrinsic characteristics of a socialist market economy and have full understanding of the necessity, urgency, and arduousness of setting up this new economic system so as to strengthen the self-awareness and resolution of carrying out the party's line, principles, and policies, and to push forward and support the reform with one heart and one mind. Second, it is necessary to master the theory and basic knowledge of establishing a socialist market economy as well as relevant principles and policies, strive to understand and handle issues involving new theories and ideas, be bold in exploration and practice, promptly sum up new experiences, continuously enhance working standards, and gain initiative in pushing forward reform and economic development. Third, it is necessary to have an all-round understanding of the inner relationship between developing a socialist market and rigidly following the principle of the party spirit in running business, consciously uphold the party's ideal and faith, and persist in a correct sense of value, integrity, and self- discipline so as to resist the corrosion of passive and corrupt phenomena and withstand the new test faced in the new period. Concerning the methods and measures of the study, the circular points out: 1. Teaching plans for all regular training classes of party schools, institutes, and centers at all levels should be properly readjusted to arrange necessary time for teaching special courses such as the theory and basic knowledge of a socialist market economy, as well as relevant plans, principles, and policies for the reform. In addition, rigorous checks and evaluations of such efforts should be carried out. 2. Party schools, institutes, and centers at all levels should sponsor, in a planned way, backbone cadres' training classes and special topic study classes for the study of the theory and basic knowledge of a socialist market economy. 3. It is necessary to organize on-the-job studies for the majority of cadres. Necessary time for the studies must be ensured in accordance with various situations. The study methods should proceed from reality and be flexible and varied in form. In general, the method of releasing cadres from work to enable them to study in classes can be integrated with that of individual studies. Other methods include a combination of reading, supplementary lectures, and discussion. 4. The central study groups of the party committees at all levels should treat the study of the theory and basic knowledge of a socialist market economy as one of the important elements and strive to study them better and genuinely play exemplary roles. 5. It is necessary to launch a publicity campaign to educate the people about the knowledge of a socialist market economy by putting mass media to full use. The central television station as well as provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal television and radio stations should arrange proper times for broadcasting special supplementary lectures. All localities and units should organize cadres to watch or listen to these programs. In accordance with needs, some video or audio tapes may be produced as a supplementary aid to cadres' studies. Newspapers, publications, and propaganda and public opinion departments must closely coordinate this educational campaign and launch their work purposely to give publicity to good study experiences. Concerning the organizational and leading work, the circular emphatically points out: 1. Party committees at all levels should conscientiously strengthen their leadership by paying great attention to the study and education of the theory and basic knowledge of a socialist market economy among all cadres. Major efforts should be made to ensure a success in the study and education of leading cadres of party committees and governments, cadres of economic administration, and cadres in charge of the management of the state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises on or above county level. Localities should formulate practical plans and, in accordance with the characteristics and the needs of practical work of those cadres who are in various trades, professions, departments, and levels, put forward various specific requirements and adopt various methods for the study and education. In addition, they should pay great attention to carrying out these plans. In order to achieve effective results, it is necessary to have good preparation for and regular inspections of the work. Efforts should be made to avoid formalism. Cadres' study should be considered as an important content of their evaluation. Under the unified leadership of the party committees, party organization departments as well as publicity departments of the party committee at all levels should be responsible for carrying out the work of organizing and implementing study and education. 2. The State Economic and Trade Commission is responsible for the unified arrangement of the study and education of enterprises' leading cadres and administrative personnel. The Work Committee for Organs under the CPC CC and the Work Committee for Central Government Organs shall arrange for the study and education of cadres working for the CPC CC and the state organs. 3. Each level is responsible for its own work, with a higher level supervising lower levels. The Organization Department and the Propaganda Department of the CPC CC will conduct a selective inspection by the end of this year on the study of the central studying groups of all provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal party committees as well as on that of the central study groups of the party committees (party organs) of the CPC CC and the state organs.
