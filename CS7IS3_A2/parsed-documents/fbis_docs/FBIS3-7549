Their discussion, entitled "Okinawa in the Asia-Pacific Era," lasted 90 minutes. Due to Tsukushi's popularity as a newscaster, there were many young people in the audience. The theater was filled to near capacity with an audience of 1,200 on hand. The discussion, moderated by Tsukushi, covered a wide range of topics, including those entitled "The Power of Okinawan Culture, Which Retained Its Identity Under U.S. Military Rule," "Internationalization Based on a Distinct Culture," and "Japanization and Okinawa's Identity." Tsukushi said: "In prefectures which seek social and economic vitalization, the people have fears and concerns about local depopulation due to a decreasing population. The average income in Okinawa is the lowest of any in the nation, but its population has continued to increase since the end of World War II. This, in effect, is Okinawa's answer to such concerns. Okinawan society shall serve as a model for the society that Japan is seeking to become." Regarding the policy of peace which the prefectural government advocates, Governor Ota said: "To keep Okinawa's war experiences from becoming a thing of the past is a difficult but important task. We hope to accomplish this task and to continue to move forward." [Tsukushi] Although internationalization is widely advocated, there are, on the other hand, many cases in which exchange students coming to Japan from other Asian countries develop anti-Japanese attitudes. However, for Okinawa, where there are 1,400 exchange students, it is said that a majority of them return home with a good impression of the prefecture. [Ota] I feel that this is because Okinawa and those countries have similar climates, living conditions, and cultures, in addition to similarities in terms of their historical backgrounds. Many Asian countries have experienced periods of rule by powerful Western nations, during which the peoples did not even have control over their destinies or living conditions. Although Okinawa did not come under colonial rule, I feel that Okinawa and Asian countries are connected by common cultural roots as oppressed peoples. [Tsukushi] As for the current frictions between Japan and the United States, if Japan stressed its distinct uniqueness, the United States would try to undermine it by claiming that Japan is a "heterogeneous" country. Japan advocates the concept of internationalization, but the Japanese tend to group together among themselves, as can be seen in their conventional use of the term "gaijin" [foreigner]. On the other hand, I have the impression that Okinawans are more open psychologically. [Ota] Asia is a multiethnic region with different religions and languages, but there are many things about Japan concerning a tendency to exclude alien cultures. During the days when it was a kingdom, Okinawa got along well for a long time with other countries, frequently coming in contact with "alien" cultures and accepting them. [Tsukushi] There is a mistaken notion that being able to speak English fluently is equivalent to becoming internationalized. Even now, some people in mainland Japan have the gross misunderstanding that the Okinawan people speak English. There seem to be few Okinawans who have really mastered English. Here there seems to be a more open culture in which speaking English does not necessarily mean that one has become internationalized. [Ota] There are many U.S. military personnel stationed on Okinawa, but exchanges cannot be conducted easily because they are confined inside chain-link fences. Moreover, the Americans ruled the Okinawans after the end of World War II. Therefore, even though Americans and Okinawans live in the same land, exchanges between the peoples have been impossible because of their relationship as rulers and the ruled. Exchanges truly can be carried out only on the basis of a relationship between equal partners. [Tsukushi] When discussing the English language, there is the argument that English-language imperialism invades other cultures. Great Britain, which indirectly controlled India, trained a handful of local rulers who could speak English exactly like Englishmen. Although the United States came into Okinawa bringing all its military, political, economic, and cultural power, Okinawa did not turn out to be like India. When we think of the reasons for this, I believe that it was the power of Okinawan culture that helped it withstand the circumstances. [Ota] The museum built in Shuri by the U.S. military symbolizes a U.S. policy which was aimed at alienating Okinawa from Japan. The United States asserted that "because the Okinawans developed such a fine culture in the days of the Ryukyuan Kingdom, they do not have to rely on the Japanese." At the time, there was a deep-rooted reaction among the Okinawans against such a U.S. policy, even though they were burdened with the problem of not being able to become economically self-sufficient. [Tsukushi] The United States poured funds, called the high commissioner's funds -- which can be likened to funds set up by Mito Komon [popular name for Tokugawa Ieyasu's grandson and the second daimyo (1661-90) of the Mito domain, Tokugawa Mitsukuni, who invited Japanese and Chinese scholars to compile the History of Great Japan] -- into local districts to send over 1,000 Ryukyuan exchange students to the United States. However, they did not necessarily all end up having pro-American sentiments. [Ota] The United States did intend to foster pro-American local nationals via the exchange student system. However, the pursuit of knowledge is immeasurably deep. The more a student devotes himself to it, the more he learns what human beings are all about. Eventually, he realizes how outrageous military rule is. [Tsukushi] By getting an education in the United States, a student realizes the abnormal situation on Okinawa. This is so ironic. By the way, I feel that nowadays, young Okinawans are properly reexamining their identity, which is deep-rooted in their culture. With 20 years having passed since the reversion of Okinawa to Japan, they have gained confidence about what they are. I feel that this is a very healthy and wonderful thing. Asia Music Pageant in Okinawa '94 [Tsukushi] I believe that the general theme of this musical event is related to people's identities. This is a chance for people to get in contact with other people--something like a contest--to try to confirm one's own identity in the process of mutual association. Otherwise, one shall end up indulging in self-complacency. I feel that it is important to educate people about what happened to Okinawa and what occurred there, historically speaking. There should be more opportunity for cultural exchanges and to hold discussions about peace. Frankly speaking, I feel annoyed when I visit the war memorial site at Mabuni-no-Oka. There, memorial engravings list war victims separately, according to their home prefectures. Mr. Ota, it seems that the prefectural government plans to construct a monument listing all victims who died during the Battle of Okinawa, regardless of where they hail from. [Ota] I have visited India, Thailand, Burma, and recently Singapore. What I noticed in all these countries is that the young people there are proud about building their countries. They have great passion. It was overwhelming. However, this seems to be quite lacking among young people in Okinawa. As for peace, it is important for young Okinawans to learn properly about the circumstances under which their parents, brothers and sisters, and grandparents were forced into inhumane conditions. Whether you win or lose, war results in more and more people being hurt. We would like to build the "Peace Monument" to convey the message that war is meaningless. [Tsukushi] I take it that the names of war victims from mainland Japan, Okinawa, Taiwan, and Korea are all to be engraved on this monument. Am I correct about that? [Ota] Yes, and I think there will be over 200,000 names engraved on it. [Tsukushi] I have also heard that some interesting incidents have come to light. These should also contribute to preventing Okinawa's war experiences from becoming a thing of the past. [Ota] So far, war survivors have reported to the prefectural government's War Victims Relief Division the sacrifices they made in supporting the nation's military cause. If we look at the actual situation during the Battle of Okinawa, there were some people who were critical of the nation's war policy. Some of them were executed because they refused to turn over their important food supplies to the military. Therefore, with this project, the prefectural government has been trying to carry out investigations to include all victims from babies to the elderly. [Tsukushi] In some cases, whole families were killed, and then there is no one left to report such cases. [Ota] Many died together with their relatives and with entire family clans. [Tsukushi] In another way, Okinawa carries with it the image of an island of military bases. [Ota] The concept of peace is at the very foundation of Okinawan culture. From the days of the Ryukyuan king, Sho Shin, the Okinawan people were forbidden to carry weapons. After the Satsuma [of present-day Kagoshima Prefecture on Kyushu] invaded the Ryukyus in 1609, the ban on carrying weapons was enforced even more strictly. As a result, the Okinawans learned the martial art of karate to protect themselves. All these things have permeated the Okinawan way of life. Okinawans have maintained peace by establishing relations of mutual reliance with neighboring countries. [Tsukushi] For the Okinawan people, the ground warfare--the so-called "typhoon of steel" [in World War II]--certainly took a very heavy toll. Incidentally, however, possibly greater damage has been done to Okinawa's natural environment since Okinawa's reversion to Japan in 1972 than during that period of ground warfare. [Ota] The U.S. military has taken over Okinawans' precious farmland to use for military bases. Even very fertile parcels have all been taken away. Among other towns, Kadena has 83 percent of its total area taken up by military bases, with over 10,000 local residents being forced to live on the remaining 13 percent [percentages as published]. They have no other choice. The prefectural government, for its part, seeks to get rid of military bases to protect the natural environment. This is a very difficult issue, but we hope to try not to destroy the environment.
