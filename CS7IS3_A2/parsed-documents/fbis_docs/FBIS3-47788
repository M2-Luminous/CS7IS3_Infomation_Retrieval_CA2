Mitsuhide Yamaguchi said at a press conference in Osaka that the Ex-Im Bank will basically maintain its stance on financial aid to Russia despite the resignation of First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar on Sunday from President Boris Yeltsin's government. Yamaguchi made the comment after growing speculation that Russian economic reforms may be delayed because of Gaydar's resignation. He said, however, that the bank needs to take a careful look at the development of Russia's economic policy. Some analysts said Gaydar's resignation may have an adverse effect on relations between Russia and international financial bodies like the International Monetary Fund.
