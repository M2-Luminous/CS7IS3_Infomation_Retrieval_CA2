Those Willing May Join In"] [Text] The press conference by Yuriy Koptev, general director of the Russian Space Agency; his Kazakhstani colleague Tokhtar Aubakirov; and the republic's Deputy Prime Minister Galym Abilsiitov was rather reminiscent of a public showdown, at times turning into a squabble over the future fate of the Baykonur space launching site. Yet for all the disagreements, "none of us opposes this space launch site," Galym Abilsiitov said. "Everyone wants to preserve it and moreover, develop it further and use it in our interests." These interests are in the area of joint defense and in implementing a huge civil space program on which Russia is now working. Russian Space Agency Director Yuriy Koptev also believes that Baykonur occupies quite a definite place: it is irreplaceable. "Any talk about leaving this site in the future," Koptev noted, "is fraught with very big losses for Russia. I cannot say that they cannot be made up, but these losses may affect extremely badly all our current plans and all the services within the CIS framework that can be rendered with the assistance of space facilities." According to the Kazakhstani side, however, at present neither Russia nor Kazakhstan have sufficient funds to ensure the viability of the immense technical, production, and social complex. In the past everything was decided from Moscow fairly quickly, using the power of the entire huge country. Now the divided countries, which are incapable of fully ensuring the operation of the space launching site, have decided to share all costs. "In spite of the fact that Kazakhstan does not have its own space program or direct state interest in the launching site as an object of scientific and technical or production activity," the Kazakhstani deputy prime minister specified, "we are interested in Baykonur's existence and development if only because it is our property. And we have agreed to share the costs of maintaining the space launching center." Kazakhstan's share in the overall spending constituted 6 percent, and Russia's 94 percent. This does not involve space programs but merely the maintenance and operation of the complex. Today the complex is being worked past repair, rapidly falling into decay. Almaty has expressed its discontent also over the CIS Joint Strategic Forces Command's transfer of the site to the jurisdiction of the Russian Defense Ministry as of the middle of last year, without coordinating with the other CIS participants. There is now a 40 percent shortage of commissioned officer specialists and a 57 percent shortage of noncommissioned staff. Importantly, manpower is the responsibility of Kazakhstan, which is already experiencing huge difficulties in raising its own army. The best possible option for organizing the operation of the launching site, in the Kazakhstani leadership's opinion, would be to create on its basis an international space company with the participation of primarily Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and possibly other countries. This, as is believed here, could attract considerable foreign resources to the project and also help demilitarize the complex. "So far, however, this idea has not received support from Russia," Kazakhstan's deputy prime minister stated. "But we are also looking for other approaches and do not rule out that for the sake of salvaging the site it may be put up for public sale...." True, Abelsiitov added that this option will undoubtedly be coordinated with Russia, but he did not preclude such a scenario. The Russian position was presented by Yuriy Koptev. According to him, space activity in the world today is maintained for the most part with state support. In talking about a space company, therefore, it is necessary to establish from the outset who will be supporting it financially. "To hope that within the next five to six years the space launching site will find such a form, allowing it to become self- sufficient, is unjustified optimism," Koptev said. If no state funds are invested in the business (and at present it is possible to talk only about Russian money), what can survive is a particular launch pad or a particular line of activity in Baykonur, but nothing more. In addition, so far no foreigners are forthcoming who would be willing to launch rockets from the Kazakhstani site. Furthermore, Koptev believes, at present it will be practically impossible to attract quickly the 14,000 civilian specialists needed to replace the military space officers. Everyone agrees, however, that it is necessary to try to change the situation and gradually demilitarize the site. Yet the approaches to addressing this problem are fundamentally different. Kazakhstan believes that the questions about the viability of the launching site and of Leninsk city are inseparable, and that Russia must assume responsibility for the whole complex. Moscow for its part supposes that it is impossible to replace the military specialists with civilians in the near future, while operation may be ensured in the form of an international space company but within the framework of state financing, with some services being provided on a commercial basis. It is planned to introduce a transitional period of several years to carry through such changes but with a special condition, namely to make sure that the complex remains part of defense programs.
