Wu said a growth rate of nine percent for the national economy in 1994 set in the government work report delivered by premier Li Peng is both "positive and appropriate." A four percentage points markdown from last year's 13 percent growth is "very necessary" because it will help balance total supply and demand and ease the pressure on "bottleneck" sectors of the economy, said Wu, who is here attending the annual session of the National People's Congress. It will also create a relaxed environment for promoting economic restructuring. "I think that, from a long-term point of view, it is conducive to the achievement of a sustained, rapid and sound development of the national economy," he noted. "Shanghai will, as always, implement macroeconomic control measures taken by the central authorities," he added. Wu Bangguo also expressed Shanghai's support for the establishment of a national tax assignment system. Shanghai will try to contribute more to state coffers every year on the basis of economic growth, he said. Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju expressed appreciation of the central government's repeated statement that its policies on the city's Pudong New Area and on Shanghai paying back its own foreign debt will remain unchanged. This shows that, while pushing ahead with reforms, the central authorities have taken into account local interests and needs for further economic expansion. The mayor pledged to improve Shanghai's economic performance by following guidelines for achieving a sustained, rapid and sound economic development. "Meanwhile, we will continue to speed up readjustment of Shanghai's industrial structure," he said. At the end of 1993, the service sector accounted for 38 percent of Shanghai's gross domestic product and the ratio is expected to grow by two percent this year, he said. Huang Ju predicted that the ratio will rise further to 45 percent by the end of this century. Shanghai's imports and exports shot up 20 percent in the first two months of 1994 over the same previous period, a record growth in the past 10-plus years, he said.
