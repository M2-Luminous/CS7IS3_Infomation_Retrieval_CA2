In an interview for the "Itogi" television program he stressed: "One should either do one's job or admit that you are unable to do it." Nonetheless, neither Yegor Gaydar nor the Russia's Choice bloc, which he heads, intend to join the opposition, believing it "possible to support constructive dialogue with the government." Explaining his decision to leave the cabinet, Yegor Gaydar said: "This will stimulate the government to focus more on adopting responsible decisions and will force it to tackle the need to curb inflation, because now this is the responsibility of the government and Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, and not of Gaydar." The view of Grigoriy Yavlinskiy was heard on the same television program. He said that Gaydar's departure from the government was political rather than economic. "In September Yegor Timurovich was invited in as a decorative figure to adorn the government for a period of very difficult change. Now that the main political gestures have been made, the decor can be changed."
