"In this matter, discretion is a more effective approach than publicity," the prime minister told a press conference at the end of a two-day stay in Beijing. Balladur repeatedly declined to provide any details of a 20-minute closed-door meeting on human rights with his Chinese counterpart Li Peng and their respective foreign ministers, stressing that he had "said in private all that I had to say." "I said it in private because I thought it was more useful," he added. His remarks followed the detention Friday of leading dissident Xu Wenli and the arrest one week ago of China's most celebrated pro-democracy activist Wei Jingsheng. Xu's detention was particularly embarrassing to the French government, given the dissident's known interest in France, especially its revolutionary history. Balladur, on the first official visit here by a French premier in 16 years, refused to say if he had discussed Wei's detention or handed a list of dissidents to the Chinese authorities. He also confirmed that he had handed a letter to Chinese President Jiang Zemin from his French counterpart Francois Mitterrand, inviting him to visit France. However, in an apparent departure from usual protocol, no invitation was extended to Li Peng.
