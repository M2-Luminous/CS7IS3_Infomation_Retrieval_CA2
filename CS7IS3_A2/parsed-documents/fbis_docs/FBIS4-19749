The Cordoba Group is the fourth battalion of the Spanish Army to participate in the UN peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. This information stems from the Captaincy General of the southeast coast military region. Armored personnel carriers, military engineering vehicles, four-wheel drive trucks, excavating machines, tows, cranes, and radio equipment make up the shipment. This equipment is sent to reinforce what has been used until now by the three preceding groups in the former Yugoslavia. The missions for which the new equipment will be used include removing rubble and repairing housing destroyed by shelling.
