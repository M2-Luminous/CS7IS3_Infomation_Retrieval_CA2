Citing a telling historical parallel, the parliamentarian said that to recognize the Tartu Treaty as the foundation of today's interstate relations between Russia and Estonia would be like Hetman Semenov, who also signed a territorial agreement in Manchuria, concluding a treaty with China on the establishment of today's Russian state borders. Time itself and the existing historical realities have sidestepped and sidelined the unfortunate Tartu Treaty. The statement is as unambiguous as it is significant, for it shows that at last a stance is developing on the part of Russian parliamentary circles toward the acute "Estonian question" or, more accurately, toward the "Pechorskiy Rayon card," which the Estonian side invariably plays in order to stymie the so far fruitless Russian-Estonian talks on interstate relations. The talks have been going on without any progress for a long time now because Estonia's appetite for Pechorskiy Rayon acts as a stumbling block. And this is evidenced not just in words but in deeds, for the "right" to Pechorskiy soil has already been enshrined in nothing less than the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia. [passage omitted] It is surprising but true that all the Baltic state's maneuvers and intrigues were until recently met with drowsy indifference or, at best, a wait-and-see approach, thereby encouraging those bent on acquiring others' land to engage in more and more subversive acts. And here it is not just territorial appetites, not just rowdy scenes involving Estonian nationalist organizations periodically staged on the Russian border. The poisonous seeds of enmity toward Russians nurtured in Estonia's political inner sanctum can only cause you to wonder. [passage omitted] Only the local authorities, in concert with the oblast administration, are now tackling the problem of the border territories and endeavoring to issue statements and reassure people that "not an inch of Russian soil will be ceded." (Incidentally, inhabitants of Pechorskiy Rayon also heard such assurances from Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and Chernomyrdin -- and what came of that?) Albeit worn out by the uncertainty, the inhabitants of the border region do nevertheless regard these statements with mistrust -- Pskov, after all, is not Moscow, where big-time politics is played, and they do not believe that the Russian authorities are capable of protecting them. Thank God that the Pechorskiy Rayon question is finally being taken up in earnest by Russian parliamentarians, and high-ranking ones at that: Namely V. Lukin, chairman of the State Duma International Affiars Committee, and V. Podoprigora, chairman of the Federation Council's identically named committee. During their one-day trip to Pechorskiy Rayon they studied the work of the border control points and the problems of providing a border infrastructure, and met with customs officials, border guards, and representatives of the rayon public. A conference to sum up the results in which Oblast Governor V. Tumanov took part was held at the rayon administration. "The aim of our trip was to study all the conflicts surrounding the "Pechorskiy Rayon question'" V. Podoprigora said in summation, "and to convey the full acuteness of the prevailing situation to parliament, the government, and the president. In our view, it is essential that special parliamentary hearings be held on this question to elaborate at last a clear Russian stance and to spur the supreme authorities to take practical measures to disavow the 'Pechorskiy card' once and for all." It is time, high time this were done!
