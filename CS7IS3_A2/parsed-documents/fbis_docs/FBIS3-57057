Erik Samel will sum up his visit. [Samel] [passage omitted] According to the French minister, the main subject in his discussions with Estonian politicians were issues to do with European security, including the so-called Balladur plan or the European security pact, whose opening conference will take place in April, in Paris. The pact aims to provide an opportunity for all European countries to have their security ensured. The French minister emphasized that for France, Estonian security is also French security. According to [Foreign Minister] Juri Luik, who also attended the news conference, Lamassoure's visit took place at a very good time for Estonia since Estonia is now taking great strides toward Europe. [Begin Luik recording] We talked about several issues of mutual interest. First, of course, about security issues. The Estonian position is that the closer Estonia is to the European Union, the more Estonian security is safeguarded. Of particular importance here is Lamassoure's position -- which the Estonian side also encouraged -- that a free-trade agreement with Europe is a good thing but it must contain a strong political dimension. A political dimension, which, in fact, would equate us with the Visegrad foursome, would equate us with Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia. This is the position that the French minister emphasized and that is also what we emphasized. We also emphasized the need to develop new European security structures. First and foremost, the West European Union. The West European Union is a promising organization alongside NATO. There was also talk about an associated member status, which is being developed at the West European Union. Given the status of an associated member Estonia would be willing to take part in the work of the West European Union. We discussed the Balladur plan and the French minister emphasized (?and said that he is in full support of) the Balladur plan developing into a mechanism for resolving bones of contention between Estonia and Russia because the strength of the Balladur mechanism is that the European Union member states will act as guarantors to agreements reached. They will also help to broker such agreements. I would not, for example, rule out the possibility that the Estonian-Russian border issue may find a solution through precisely this mechanism, in the spirit of cooperation it provides.
