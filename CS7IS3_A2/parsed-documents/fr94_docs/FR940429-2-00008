FR940429-2-00008 FR940429-2-00007 Ridge Area Timber Sales, Including Ridge and M&M Timber Sales, Okanogan National Forest, Okanogan County, WA AGENCY: Forest Service, USDA. ACTION: Cancellation of an environmental impact statement. SUMMARY: On June 6, 1991, a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Ridge Area Timber Sales, which included the Ridge and Milk Timber Sales, was published in the Federal Register (56 FR 26048). The notice of intent was revised on July 9, 1992 in the Federal Register (57 FR 30463), and the title of the document was revised to ``Ridge and M&M Timber Sales.'' The majority of the analysis area for these timber sales falls in areas identified as Late-Successional Reserves in the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement on Management of Habitat for Late-Successional and Old-Growth Forest Related Species Within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl. Additionally, the M&M Timber Sale falls within a Key Watershed. Because of the restrictions on timber harvest activities in Late-Successional Reserves, and on road construction in unroaded portions of inventoried roadless areas in Key Watersheds, I have decided to terminate the environmental analysis process. No draft or final environmental impact statement will be issued for the Ridge Area Timber Sales. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Direct questions regarding this cancellation to Arlo VanderWoude, Timber Management Assistant, Twisp Ranger District, P.O. Box 188, Twisp, Washington 98856 or telephone (509) 997&hyph;2131. Dated: April 20, 1994. Billie Hansen, Acting Forest Supervisor.
