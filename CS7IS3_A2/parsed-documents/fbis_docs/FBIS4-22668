Golya; place and date not given: "Stepan Topal: 'I Believe in the Wisdom of New Politicians....'"] [Text] To the surprise of many people, the residents of rayons densely settled by the Gagauz population displayed the greatest activity during a parliamentary elections held in the republic and the sociological poll "Council With the People." As late as two weeks before the election, the local administration spoke about the intention of a majority of the population not to participate in these actions. However, the politicians of Chisinau and Komrat summoned up the courage to rise above past wrongs and to take steps toward each other. As a result, about 100,000 citizens of Moldova of Gagauz nationality who desire peace and stability on this rich land were given an opportunity to take advantage of the right to vote. Their hearts are alive with the new hope that the confrontation will come to an end, and that the Gagauz knot which has been tightly tied over the last three years will be untied reasonably. This is how our dialogue with Stepan Topal, then president of the unrecognized Gagauz Republic, began. [Topal] The elections proceeded successfully, and political life has calmed down somewhat. A session of our parliament held on 11 March ratified the results of the sociological poll during which an absolute majority of the Gagauz came out in favor of Moldova's independence. Simultaneously, we held a referendum during which local residents came out in favor of the existence of the Gagauz Republic within a united Moldova. We now live in anticipation--anticipating that the leadership of Moldova in the person of President Snegur and the political forces that have come to power will keep their election promises and solve the Gagauz problem. We are satisfied with the results of the elections; after all, precisely those parties that the Gagauz population supported have come to power. Both the Agrarian-Democratic Party and the Socialist Party have given positive assurances to the effect that they will resolve the Gagauz issue at the very first session. [Golya] Did this promise prompt the Gagauz administration to reconsider its original decision? [Topal] Not just this. Perhaps the Congress "Our Home--the Republic of Moldova" which was held in early February was the turning point. For the first time in the last three years President Snegur and other leaders from Chisinau officially stated at the congress that the Republic of Moldova is building its own statehood, not striving to unite with Romania, will ensure equal rights for all its citizens, and will not allow them to be infringed upon. This coincides fully with our position; for three years we have been fighting for Moldova's sovereignty and independence. It appears that our intentions coincide at present. Being aware of the situation, we accommodated them, opened polling stations, and facilitated active participation of the people in the elections, although we were apprehensive about being cheated yet again by Moldovan politicians. The ball is in Chisinau's court. We would like to hope that our worst apprehensions will not come true. [Golya] What is the explanation for the fact that most voters in areas densely settled by the Gagauz population voted in favor of the Electoral Bloc of the Socialist Party and the Unity Movement? [Topal] Perhaps it is due to their having worked with the voters more. To be sure, quite a few Gagauz voted in favor of the Agrarian-Democratic Party. Judging by their programs, these very political forces are capable of justifying our expectations. A bigger vote for the Socialists might also have been due to the fact that most of the candidates from the Agrarian-Democratic Party of Moldova were also members of the old parliament. They were not able to resolve the Gagauz issue, and for this reason the voters had less confidence in them. [Golya] Stepan Mikhaylovich, at the outset, when fundamental differences existed between Komrat and Chisinau, you cooperated with the Dniester area and provided feasible support to each other. How are your mutual relations developing at present? [Topal] Normally. We have signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation and we fully comply with it. The Dniester area has helped us with the necessary energy resources and other materials. We believe that the problems of the Dniester area and Gagauzia should be solved in parallel. Failure to solve the Gagauz problem will affect the Dniester area, and the other way around. It is necessary to resolve the status of the Dniester area and Gagauzia as soon as possible and to determine the state structure of Moldova. [Golya] How do you see it? [Topal] We should proceed from reality. We believe that, by all signs, a federated or confederated structure is the most realistic under current conditions. I do not understand why some politicians and statesmen of Moldova are in mortal fear of this. After all, there have been dozens of examples throughout the world of countries with federated structures retaining their integrity. Such is our opinion. It virtually does not contradict the draft law on Gagauz Eri autonomous oblast within the framework of which President Snegur proposes to solve the problem. However, this should be a draft developed with the participation of our representatives rather than the one that was written in one night in the office of Mr. Arseni. Many questions were raised concerning this document in Strasbourg during an expert evaluation. We are now forwarding our clarifications to the Council of Europe and hope that the new parliament will discuss a draft law which is drawn up with our remarks taken into account. [Golya] Perhaps some problems of the Gagauz may and should be solved within the framework of the Law on Ethnic Minorities, too.... [Topal] Possibly. We are prepared to participate in its development in order to ensure guaranteed rights for all residents of Moldova. However, it should be kept in mind that the Gagauz do not consider themselves an ethnic minority. I would like to ask those who maintain this: Where do the Gagauz form an "ethnic majority?" We will not reach an accord if we once again begin by discriminating against an entire people, the Gagauz people. In the old parliament we heard enough statements to the effect that the Gagauz are strangers, that they are not a people. [Golya] Some Gagauz were elected to parliament only on the ticket of the Agrarian-Democratic Party because from the beginning of the election campaign you actually ignored the latter. Are those too few, perhaps? [Topal] The Gagauz should receive a quota of their own in the new parliament, just as in the structures of executive power. We hope that the new parliament will show understanding for this problem and will give our representatives an opportunity to work within the state structures. Otherwise it would be difficult to say that our problem has been completely solved. The point is that the Gagauz who came to the parliament on the tickets of various parties represent themselves rather than the Gagauz people. They live in Chisinau, and their hearts do not exactly bleed for their fellow Gagauz. This is not a rebuke to them; such is reality. [Golya] How do you structure your foreign policy? [Topal] We consider ourselves to be an autonomous entity within the Republic of Moldova, and proceed from this. Naturally, if the Gagauz problem is solved we will have no claim to pursuing our own foreign policy. We believe that these issues, as well as defense, state security, and some other crucial problems should be the prerogative of Chisinau rather than the local organs of power. At the same time, a close relationship has developed between us and Turkey because it is a kindred country. We have specific plans concerning economic cooperation. For example, it is planned to build a tile plant in Komrat in which the Turkish side is prepared to invest 30-35 percent. There are also plans to provide telephone communications in Komrat and the entire Budzhak region with the help of the Turkish company TRT. In addition, the late President of Turkey Turgut Ozal promised to allocate $35 million for the development of the Gagauz region. It was planned to use the funds, for example, to complete the construction of the "South" canal so as to finally provide water for the entire region which has been officially acknowledged to be a zone of marginal farming. In a word, there are many plans. The Consulate of Turkey in Chisinau is giving us all kinds of assistance. For example, owing to the consulate, about 200 of our students are already studying in Turkey. Otherwise, implementation of the plan depends entirely on how the parliament solves our problem. If there is peace and tranquility, there will be investment and support from developed countries. [Golya] As far as is known, for now you advocate the ratification of all agreements within the framework of the CIS and the Economic Union. [Topal] Naturally, we believe that there is no other way out. The abandonment of traditional economic relations in the absence of real integration with the West has brought about the economic catastrophe all of us are facing. [Golya] What solution to the language problem do you see? Are you personally fluent in the Moldovan language? [Topal] Personally, like most elderly Gagauz, I know the Moldovan language, although I am not perfectly fluent in it. I see a solution to this problem in creating normal conditions for language instruction rather than in forcible Moldovization or, worse yet, Romanization. Attempts at forcibly making us learn the language caused a negative response. The Gagauz began to pull their children out of Moldovan day care centers and stopped learning the language. This would not have happened had an opportunity been given to study the language voluntarily and normal conditions provided. The Gagauz are not against the Moldovan language; they are against discrimination along language lines. The new parliament has a duty to postpone certification, if not cancel it; this would substantially reduce confrontation in our society. [Golya] We are now in the third year since the day you were elected president. During this time you have seen few pleasant moments and have heard many threats. Do you regret putting this heavy burden on your shoulders? [Topal] I am not a politician; all my life I have worked on road construction. However, since the people elected me, I must pull my weight until the end. You cannot cheat your destiny.
