Khavanov, Yu.S. Sedov, NIKIMT Scientific Production Association; UDC 621.791:620.9:62-519] [Abstract] The specific features of nuclear power industry installations and the resulting requirements imposed on the welding practices, structures, and operating rules, particularly the harmful impact of the installation environment on the operating personnel and equipment, prompted the development of remote controlled welding facilities and processes which are more stable and informative. For illustration, the SA-296 automatic welding machine for gas-shielded consumable and nonconsumable electrode welding of annular butt joints is considered and its components are outlined. A family of welding machines developed on the basis of these components is described. The design of the automatic welding arc length control device (ARND) which is crucial for use in the nuclear industry is discussed. An analysis of the welding process and equipment requirements for routine maintenance and repair operations in nuclear power plants and the development and operating experience accumulated in this field make it possible to recommend that emphasis be placed on raising the automation level by using welding adaptation systems.
