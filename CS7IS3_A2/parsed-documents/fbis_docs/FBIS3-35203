[passage omitted] First I feel obliged to thank the honorable Iranian nation with all my being--an aware nation, a nation with a sense of timing, a nation which recognizes its enemy, a nation which is grateful for God's great bounties--for their demonstration of power on 11 February before the eyes of friends and foes the world over. We, who know about the world issues, and are aware of them, somewhat more than the general public, understood the strength of the blow that was delivered to the propaganda which the enemies of the Islamic republic of Iran had started a few months ago. When they start the adverse propaganda they start it together since the other side is but one front. Those Zionist and arrogant news agencies--those famous agencies from whom all news reports and analyses are taken by all the world broadcasting aerials--and several radio stations which spend millions every year perchance to be able to get their voice across to a few people in Iran. The translators and presenters write, they employ people, they spend on technical things, spend on publicity, spend on writing, make policies, and spend much money to get that voice across to Iran, so that maybe a few individuals here and there listen to it and be influenced by it. Beginning several months ago they began whispers--of course that is not new either, but once in a while they begin an onslaught--to the effect that the people no longer have anything to do with the revolution and Islam in Iran. The people are fed up with Islam. Look how badly the Islamic Republic of Iran's authorities have acted that the people have even put aside Islam. Domestically, too, some were repeating those sentences. They still will do so, let me tell you! Unfortunately in our very universities--I say this to the Hizbollahi students so that they know--there are such motives here and there. Of course the majority of the lecturers are good; are faithful; support the development and advancement of this nation; support the Islamic revolution and the holy system of the Islamic republic. But you can't say that there are no sly ones either. In those same universities there are some people--of course they are very few, very few--who try to give this issue a philosophical form, saying that since the Islamic Republic came to power Islam weakened. There cannot be a more blatant lie and trick. Islam's acme was reached all over the world with the creation of the Islamic Republic of Iran. They want to portray the situation in an exactly opposite way. They want to say that the Islamic Republic, the formation of an Islamic state, and the delivery of the crushing blow of Islam and the Koran to the mouth of the enemy are all causing Islam harm. If this had been so, then the prophet and the lord of the faithful ['Ali, the first Shiite imam] would not have formed a government, and the leaders of the Islamic community at the advent of Islam would have just sat in their homes. What need was there then for forming a government? If an Islamic government was harmful for the delivery of Islam's message, then why did the prophet go to all that trouble and engage himself in so many wars in which so many people lost their lives? You can now see for yourselves how ignorant they are about Islam. Sometimes words such as these are disseminated by a certain radio station belonging to one of the world's disgraced and ugly groups. This can be blamed on that group's ignorance, or the fact that it is not part of this community. But some people in this very Islamic homeland utter such meaningless words. Anyway, the nation did what it had to do at a highly appropriate time. It came out on 11 February and amazed them. They were left speechless. What could they say, after all? The huge streets of Tehran, Azadi Square, and all towns and cities were filled with a massive crowd. This was the case even in those towns which the enemy wants to portray as having disputes with the Islamic system. The serious and resolute faces of the people of these towns were clearly visible. The enemies and the others witnessed how cohesively the Iranian nation was conducting its movement. I tell you here that, in the world of today, there is not even one other single government -- whether among the major powers such as America or the smaller powers -- which has the capability to mobilize its nation in such a magnificent way to participate in a national and ideological event. This is something which only the Islamic Republic of Iran is able to accomplish. Another point is that there is an onslaught against Muslims in the world, brothers and sisters, and Muslims should realize that they are being attacked from all sides. Even if a country is left alone in a corner of the world, it should not think that it is so; there is an onslaught against Islam and Muslims. Of course, the clear example of this is the great tragedy of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is really strange, it is unprecedented. Those Serbs and Croats, backed by the British, certain European Governments, and America, have outdone the usurping Zionists of Israel in creating tragedies and cruelty. [passage omitted] Today all the events are seen in American and European magazines and press and television, and the hardhearted West and the arrogant and unjust governments are sitting around -- having first equipped the oppressor, doing everything for him, and giving him plenty of scope -- waiting for the strong to cut off the head of the weak, from ear to ear. Every once in a while they say a few things, hold a conference, and so forth; it is all empty talk. Of course, Islamic governments are not all that faultless. Some have behaved well. The Iranian Nation and Government have behaved better than all. Some others have behaved well and some badly. Otherwise, if Islamic governments had said to those who support the Serbs that they would sever ties and stop trading with them for a month, things would not be as they are. They were negligent. In any case, it is a big event. Of course, God willing, you will see -- the whole world will see -- in the future that this event will be beneficial to Islam in Europe and harmful to arrogant European powers. The nature of this event is such that in future years [pauses] God willing, this will pave the way for the revival of Islam and the situation of Islam in Europe. That is one example of the onslaught. Another example is Palestine, occupied Palestine. Today Israelis, before the eyes of the world, have usurped Palestine and have imprisoned, tortured, convicted, forced into exile, and dropped bombs on Palestinians and the world remains silent. Moreover, the world condemns the oppressed people, saying: Why you do such things? When I say the world, I mean the world of arrogance -- that is, America in the first place, which is the most wicked and malicious of them all, followed by those who follow America. What is happening in Lebanon is a struggle against the usurper Zionist enemy that has usurped both Palestine and parts of Lebanon. Instead of asking the usurper why it has usurped, the world criticizes the people who are defending their homes, asking them: Why are you defending them? See what a filthy new world order is dominating the world. Is that the new world order they were speaking about? A bullying thug enters the house of a group of orphan children, occupies their home, takes away their facilities, foodstuffs, their comfortable rooms, their bedrooms, occupies the whole space of their house, and imprisons the occupants of the house in a cellar, for example, and sets restrictions on them. As soon as an opportunity arises for those children to cry out and ask why, he gets angry, saying: You always speak of struggle, why do you not think of peace? Why you are so ill-humored? You see, that is the situation of the world today. They carry out acts of aggression and mass murder against Muslims, and the mass murderers are encouraged, as has happened in Kashmir and Tajikistan. They collaborate to destroy Islam. But when Muslims open their mouths once, they say: For God's sake, you always speak of struggle. You are always ill-humored. That is the way things are. They have begun a dangerous and violent confrontation against Islam. Of course this confrontation that, despite going on strongly for around 10 to 12 years and being properly planned, has, God be praised, created more problems for arrogance and has made life more difficult for it. Each day world arrogance becomes more disappointed and the governments that support it become more hesitant. That is the way things are. Muslims of the world should know this, and you, the Muslim nation of Iran, should also know that Islamic Iran is where Islam can speak forcefully. Appreciate such power, glory, and independence. Appreciate the capability of this nation and this government to express their feelings about any power. Others do not have such a capability. God be praised, we have increased our capability in that respect day by day. We have become stronger each day, thanks to almighty God. the enemy, with all its power, has become frustrated in its confrontation with Islam. Our nation should appreciate this, our government should appreciate this, officials should appreciate this. Do not distance yourselves from Islam. We should not forget the enemy. We had the test of 11 February, in which our nation performed well. We also have the Jerusalem Day test, toward the end of the month of Ramadan, to come. A couple of times each year, God be praised, we have such general demonstrations and shows of the Islamic Iran's strength. One is performed better than the other. You should not forget Jerusalem Day, and, of course, the path of being steadfast in this arena is to maintain a close link with God, so that God almighty does not deny us his bounty and mercy.
