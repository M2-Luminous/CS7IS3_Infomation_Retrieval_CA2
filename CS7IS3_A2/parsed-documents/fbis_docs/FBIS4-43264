European cooperation that country after country wants to join is cooperation that Sweden cannot remain outside, Bildt writes in a press statement. Bildt interprets the Austrians' massive yes to membership in the Union as a wish for influence. Austria does not want to stand outside the peace and security order that is now emerging. Opposition leader Ingvar Carlsson also expressed happiness with the result of the referendum yesterday: "It is enormously positive bearing in mind that Austria like Sweden is a neutral country." According to the opinion polls, there were many people who did not make up their minds until the last minute. "This indicates that it is very difficult to measure election results using opinion polls. In the past I have said that I do not believe that we in Sweden can predict election results using opinion polls. I am even more convinced now," Ingvar Carlsson told TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA. Odd Engstrom (Social Democratic Party), the spokesman for the Yes to Europe organization, said that Austria's referendum result will be an example for Sweden. Eva-Britt Svensson (Social Democratic Party), one of the two chairmen of the No to the EU organization, believes that an important reason for the Austrian result is the fact that the no side in Austria did not have any similar organization. "There has been no organization that the broad opposition to the EU in Austria has been able to identify with," she said. ``That is why this broad opposition has not shown itself in the result. ``Instead that right-wing populist, Haider, has frightened people off. ``Here in Sweden we conduct the debate differently, using objective arguments.'' Svensson does not believe that the Austrian result will influence public opinion in Sweden. Marianne Samuelsson, spokesman for the Green Ecology Party, which is campaigning against EU membership, was not particularly surprised by the yes victory: "It is true that it is probably a bigger majority than we were expecting," she told DAGENS NYHETER. "And this will of course have an influence on the Swedish people."
