It demands of them, among other things, effective policies for learning about their clients, identifying parties involved in transfers of large sums, exercising strict control over foreign currency transactions, and identifying "suspect" operations. It reminded the heads of private banks that these funds are being laundered precisely to "conceal criminal or illegal activities," such as drug trafficking and tax evasion. It claimed that this laundering is done to hide the real origin of the money, so that it may be used freely. Furthermore, "it operates as a support service, allowing criminals to enjoy the profits from their businesses." [passage omitted] The CNB indicated that, in countries such as Mexico, "narcolaundering" may be practiced involuntarily by banks, because they offer a large variety of services and instruments, such as cashiers' and travelers' checks, and electronic transfers. These can be used to conceal funds accrued illegally. In view of this situation, the CNB remarked, multiple banking institutions need to know how the money laundering systems operate, and how they can detect suspicious operations. This is necessary both to protect themselves and to continue cooperating with the efforts being expended by the pertinent authorities for prevention. According to this public agency, the bank personnel can cooperate to a great extent with the government's efforts to avert this illicit practice. Of course, they will be obliged to meet the established reporting requirements "in a timely manner," and to adopt the guidelines stipulated in the pertinent legislation. The CNB noted that, on the management level, bankers must cooperate in controlling and possibly solving the problem. Hence, it "suggested" that they devise programs to meet the following requirements: To establish an internal monitoring system that will help to prevent money laundering. To ensure suitable training for bank personnel. The CNB explained that what is entailed is having a good bank management that will "maintain suitable levels of discretion" in its operations. This includes appropriate identification of persons doing business with credit departments, as well as demanding "professional, ethical" conduct on the part of bank employees and officials. It observed that all this certainly entails strict cooperation with the judicial authorities, "within the bounds established by the applicable laws." This institution indicated that, in order to become fully acquainted with clients, there must be a proper identification of depositors and other users of bank services. At the same time, measures must be devised for promptly detecting unusual or suspicious operations. In fact, financial brokerage institutions will have to spot laundering activities and prevent them from being carried out through transfers. If they cannot do so for reasons associated with computerized systems, the National Banking Commission recommends that the following be included in all payment orders: a) name, domicile, and number of the person seeking the payment order; b) the same information, but on the beneficiary's account; c) identification of the first bank that accepts such a payment order. Private banking agencies will be required to prepare reports on transactions in foreign currency made by, or in the name of particular clients, "especially when they involve large sums," in the form of individual or combined transactions. The official institution pointed out that, nevertheless, an operation involving a large sum in cash does not necessarily imply that illicit activities or foreign exchange contraband are being committed. The banks must take into account the amount, frequency, and nature of the transaction, "as well as the bank's previous experience with the persons involved, whether they be employees or clients." In this connection, the CNB explained that there are activities that could be suspected of laundering motives, such as those carried out with "large sums" in cash, "deceptive" transactions, the deposit or withdrawal of large amounts of funds through electronic transfers; and, of course, teller transactions involving considerable sums. The National Banking Commission recommended that financial institutions concern themselves with workers employed in banks whose life style "is not in keeping with their salary," those who "refuse to take vacations," and, of course, those linked with sizable shortages of bank funds. The members of credit institutions of any kind should reinforce their connections with other banks, paying special heed to "significant" changes in the normal pattern of transmitting foreign currency among agencies. The CNB stated that, when there are increases in the amounts of cash handled, without a commensurate rise in the number of operations, the banks will have to be particularly alert. Finally, the National Banking Commission instructed bankers to be very watchful of deposits made in the Central Bank "in amounts that differ from those maintained in the other banks," or deposits made by those employed in other institutions of similar size. And they must definitely suspect receipts showing increases in the use of bills of small denominations, with no indication of a decline in those of large denominations.
