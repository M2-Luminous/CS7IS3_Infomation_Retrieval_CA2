The president pointed out that when a final version of this law is reached, it will be presented to the public for discussion. It will be discussed in all institutions, because it is an issue that concerns the broad mass of citizens. Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif made this statement after President Mubarak's meeting with the media men on the 11th anniversary of such meetings. This meeting lasted for over 3 hours. [passage omitted] Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif said that after the meeting, President Mubarak answered questions posed by prominent writers, thinkers, and media men. AL-WAFD Chief Editor Jamal Badawi asked a question about Sudan. [passage omitted] President Mubarak answered the question by affirming that it is only natural for relations between the Egyptian and Sudanese people to be good and that the two peoples have known throughout history that they are linked till eternity. [passage omitted] The president noted the various successive stands of the Sudanese regime in international forums. It has attempted to encourage certain attitudes not commensurate with the standard of relations between the two countries, such as when the Sudanese delegation recently objected to Egypt's membership in the East Africa Trade Organization at a time when Egypt had refrained from playing any role in supporting the decision to place Sudan on the list of states harboring terrorism. The information minister clarified that President Mubarak pointed out the false reports published in some Arab newspapers that cited Sudanese newspapers. These reports claimed that Egypt has dispatched forces amounting to 10,000 soldiers to the Hala'ib area. The president questioned Egypt's incentives in sending troops there and who it would be fighting. He said that Egypt will not fight the Sudanese people; it has no motive to do so. We care a great deal about the Sudanese people, he added. The president added that provocative attempts will not affect us. We need to be patient and feel comfortable that Egypt's security is in safe hands. [passage omitted] The information minister said that during this meeting, writer Dr. 'Abd-al-'Azim Ramadan discussed the interviews with repentant terrorists recently broadcast on television. He affirmed that this is a good move on the part of the television, but said that there are fears regarding guarantees of the actual repentance of these terrorists and whether they will return to terrorism. President Mubarak said: I can set your minds at ease regarding the issue of repentant terrorists. We need to be very cautious in creating conditions for repentance while keeping alert and following up. We ask our returning sons to follow the right path and join the nation. [passage omitted] The information minister said President Mubarak highlighted the strong links between foreign and internal action. He stressed that had it not been for Egypt's international relations, no external support for Egypt's economic reform would have come. International support for our causes would not have come, be it support for the economy, politics, technology or trade cooperation, or the opening of markets to Egyptian products. The president also noted that there are external issues that demand our attention, whether in Arab and Islamic circles or on the worldwide level. He used the example of Sudan and the events in Yemen, as well as the Somali crisis. He explained that these issues are linked to events inside Egypt and to the homeland's security. The president also gave the example of Egypt's African role, which prompts us to intervene to resolve African differences and use its influence in creating an atmosphere of peace among the African states. Al-Sharif said that President Mubarak referred to the importance of international relations, which have played a role in establishing peace. Mubarak pointed out that peace means stability of the region and that this stability affects domestic policy and cannot be separated from it. He said that the issue is not merely stability and the establishment of any peace, but peace must be based on the right, justice, and legitimate rights. President Mubarak explained the developments of the Palestinian- Israeli contacts which preceded the signing of the Declaration of Principles, the contacts between Egypt and Israel over the issue, and the subsequent negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis in Oslo. He touched on the obstacles that faced the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations throughout the talks and Egypt's role in reconciling their views. He noted the efforts that were necessary up until the latest agreement was signed. He also referred to the details and differences over the size of Jericho and Gaza that arose before the signing of the agreement. He noted that the differences continued until early in the morning of the signing and that differences also arose during the signing. He explained that a solution to the crisis was reached through an agreement to continue the negotiations over the size of Gaza and Jericho, which was signed by the cosponsors of the peace process and Egypt. [passage omitted] Responding to a question by writer Zakariya Nil on party plurality and the lengths to which it might go, in light of Algeria's experience, President Mubarak said that this is one of the issues on the national dialogue agenda, noting that certain people may propose forming new parties. He said: My view is that we do not want to divide the people into parties, as this would divert us from our main goal of serving the people and improving their standard of living. We do not want to engage in partisan disputes that may divert us from our devotion to these major goals and interests. He said: I want to stress that there are parties that play a political and democratic role, but other parties have confined their role to publishing a newspaper that spreads rumors and casts doubt on the national performance. He said that the regime in Egypt is stable and will not be affected by certain personal actions. He said: I hope that through national dialogue we will be able to reach acceptable and logical decisions. He added: Certain people may interpret this as going over the head of the national dialogue, but I have a right to express my views. In response to a question on the drafting committee and the time needed to prepare for the national dialogue, President Mubarak said that the dialogue will result in recommendations not decisions. He said: When we determine that the recommendations serve the interests of society, we will turn them into decisions. The decisions should be consistent with the people's interests in the present and future. He noted that the recommendations will be forwarded to the parties concerned--legislative, administrative, or executive bodies such the cabinet--for decisions. He noted that he envisions that the drafting committee will complete its work in June and that the dialogue will have a time limit so that it will achieve its goals and not become mere talk and one-upmanship. Answering a question on protecting the Nile's waters from pollution in the wake of the dumping of large numbers of human bodies in the Rwanda lakes, one of the sources of the Nile River, President Mubarak affirmed that the Health Ministry is dealing with this issue and that the water is regularly and strictly analyzed to ensure it is safe to use. Responding to a question on the Yemeni problem, President Mubarak stressed that unity must not be imposed by force but by polling the people and sounding out their feelings. He said that the use of force to impose unity is wrong. He called for halting the war, disengaging the combatants, and trying to bring the views of the two parties closer together. He pointed out that this is the best solution for the situation. He said that no one can impose unity by force; we have our own experience in this regard. He noted that if military force had been used to impose Syrian-Egyptian unity, it would have had negative repercussions and torn asunder the relations between the Egyptian and Syrian peoples. He said that leader Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir was wise when he made his decision to stop the use of military force. [passage omitted]
