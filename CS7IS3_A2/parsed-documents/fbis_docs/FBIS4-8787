A child was wounded by shrapnel and, at the same time, an artillery attack was launched on the first defense lines in Turbe, a Muslim-held town west of Travnik. At dusk the inhabitants of Travnik witnessed how NATO aircraft chased after a Serb plane that had suddenly appeared in our country's airspace, flying at a low altitude. According to eye-witness accounts, it is most likely that this was a MiG-21 plane which acrobatically fled toward Banja Luka in panic after the NATO planes appeared. Due to low clouds we are not able to inform you about the epilogue of this close air encounter, but we can say that the (?NATO) air force was active above central Bosnia for almost one hour, which is an unusually long period and is a sign that something indeed took place in the sky.
