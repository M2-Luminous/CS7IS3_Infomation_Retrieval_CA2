This was done by signing an agreement between the representatives of our republican authorities and UNPROFOR, that is to say, UN officials. Although members of the Nordic Battalion took over control of Tuzla airport yesterday, UNPROFOR will be officially accountable for the safety of the airport, which has been under its control for several hours, as of today. To recap, approximately 300 soldiers of the Nordic Battalion took up positions to secure the airport in the course of yesterday. Six Leopard tanks are positioned in the vicinity of the runway, which have the authority to protect this airport by force if need be, that is to say, to respond to possible fire from the Serbian aggressor's positions with fire. It is worth mentioning once again that the runway has been ready to receive aircraft for over 18 months. We have learned unofficially that as of today all other preparations to make Tuzla airport operational have been accelerated. Official forecasts say that this should happen on 18 March; however, sources close to UNPROFOR anticipate that it might happen before this date.
