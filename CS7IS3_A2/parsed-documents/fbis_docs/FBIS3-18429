Mario De Scalzi reports: [De Scalzi] The Italian Republican Party [PRI] is expelling part of its history, and the expeller is party secretary Giorgio La Malfa, who still remains secretary despite his problems over alleged illegal funding to his party. La Malfa is proposing the expulsion of the venerable Bruno Visentini, the former president of the party, Giorgio Bogi, the present deputy secretary of the party, and Libero Gualtieri. Visentini, Bogi, and Gualtieri are, according to the party secretary, nothing less than heretics. Their sin was to choose to ally themselves with the progressives of the Democratic Alliance, rather than the center led by Mino Martinazzoli [secretary of the Italian Popular Party]. This comes about despite the fact that La Malfa warned that this would happen at the last party conference. The polemic-laden winds that are blowing through Italian politics and which have divided Socialists, Christian Democrats, Communists, and many others, have not spared the small party. However, it is unimaginable to think of a PRI without either the aristocratic aloofness of Visentini or the English pomp of Giorgio Bogi.
