Addressing a meeting here on Puglia, Land of Peace Facing the East, Fabbri recalled the withdrawal today of Italian soldiers from Mogadishu and the meager results obtained in Somalia, in part because a plethora of contingents were sent in that had never before worked together, he said. For him, the only organization capable of carrying out a pacification effort and of implementing United Nations' decisions was NATO, whose role, he insisted, had certainly not ended with the end of the Warsaw Pact. Within the general framework, Italian action must be developed with regard to the following three scenarios to the east: Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Mediterranean area, and the Middle East. The minister lauded "the extraordinary commitment" of Italian Armed Forces in peacekeeping missions abroad and specifically mentioned the success of the missions in Mozambique and in Albania. He also recalled the ten Italian soldiers who died in the Horn of Africa.
