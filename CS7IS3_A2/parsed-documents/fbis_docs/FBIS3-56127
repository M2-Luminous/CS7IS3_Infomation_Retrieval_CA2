The republic's difficult economic and financial position has forced parliamentarians to cut military expenditure to a minimum. The Republic of Belarus Ministry of Defense has been allocated a little over 650 billion rubles [R] from the state "purse," which constitutes roughly 4 percent of the budget's expenditure section. The lion's share of these funds will go to pay monetary allowances to servicemen, to pay for communal services, and to provide the Army with food and clothing. A total of R18 billion -- around 3.5 [figure as published] percent of the military budget -- is earmarked for the purchase of hardware and arms, and the spare parts for them.
