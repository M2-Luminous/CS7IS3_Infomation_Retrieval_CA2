At the same time, Gvero added, it is well known how many UNPROFOR troops have lost their lives or have been wounded in Muslim and Croat-controlled areas. "Facts point to the inevitable conlusion that the Blue Berets are completely safe only on the territory of the republic of Srpska," Gvero stressed. According to him, "the Serbian side has so far displayed full cooperation in its dealings with members of international organizations and UNPROFOR." Gvero underlined that UNPROFOR's movements are always determined by previous agreement between the two sides and that, because of this, "there is absolutely no reason why the Serb side should be singled out as the party obstructing or preventing UNPROFOR's movements." The deputy commander of the VRS main headquarters pointed out that top-level officers recently met General Francis Briquemont, UNPROFOR's commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that "it was noted with mutual satisfaction that a high degree of rapport has been established between the Serbian side and UNPROFOR." "We expect soon to have a similar meeting with General Jean Cot, UNPROFOR's commander for former Yugoslavia, which will certainly be mutually beneficial," General Gvero assessed.
