FBIS4-45577 "jptdd028__l94077" JPRS-TDD-94-028-L JPRS Narcotics 25 May 1994 EAST ASIA THAILAND Anticorruption Commission Chief Comments on Money Laundering Anticorruption Commission Chief Comments on Money Laundering Bill 94WD0433B Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 25 May 94 pp 1,3 94WD0433B Bangkok BANGKOK POST English CSO [Text] The Counter Corruption Commission is drafting a bill to deal with the laundering of "dirty money" acquired from narcotics trafficking or other illegal activities, CCC secretary-general Prasit Damrongchai said yesterday. Mr Prasit said the bill would be completed in two weeks and forwarded to the Cabinet for consideration. He said the bill would empower the Bank of Thailand to examine the movements of money belonging to individuals suspected of involvement in the businesses or who are "unusually" rich. The directors-general of the Police and Customs departments and the secretaries-general of the CCC and Office of Narcotics Control Board will be empowered to examine suspected "dirty money," he said. All other officials will be barred form checking into the source of "dirty moeny" to protect the rights and freedoms of individuals. Mr Prasit said it was impossible to fix the amount of money determined as unusually large and suspected of being acquired illegally other than to base it on the occupation of the individuals under suspicion. For instance, a civil servant earning 30,000 baht a month yet with 500,000 baht in the bank would cause suspicion as to how the money was acquired. Like-wise, a businessman who operates a business worth about 1,000 million baht and has a revolving fund which doubles the amount of the operating fund would also warrant an examination to determine the source of the money. He said the anti-money laundering law would greatly benefit the CCC's operations. If there is a complaint of corruption by an official or of an official said to be unusually rich, the CCC could ask for information about the official's financial standing and the source of his money. Gift cheques could be frozen if the official cannot explain how they were obtained. The law, he said, will also apply to MPs. "If MPs suspected of involvement in narcotics trafficking cannot prove how they amassed their wealth, their assets can be subject to forfeiture," he said. Mr Prasit said it was necessary to explain the benefits of the law to parliamentarians to avoid opposition in Parliament. He said the law would not infringe on the rights and freedoms of individuals. "The United States, which has a constitution which provides the greatest protection for the rights and freedoms of individuals, also has an anti-money laundering law." People who violate the law should not receive protection and law-abiding citizens should not be afraid of the law, he said. The CCC chief said he had sought the opinions of about 20 bankers on the law and was told they all support it. But they doubt it will ever be passed into law. The bankers also expressed concern that the law would be an additional burden on banks and financial institutions and might affect the financial system as well as the economy. Mr Prasit insisted the anti-money laundering law would help protect honest businessmen against the use of dirty money in lawful businesses. "If someone dumps 500 million baht of drug money into a business, honest competitors will be seriously affected," he said. The Office of the Narcotics Control Board, Bank of Thailand, Finance Ministry and Chulalongkorn University's Law Faculty are drafting similar bills. Their bills will be combined and incorporated as one, said Mr Prasit. ONCB secretary-general Chawalit Yotmani said Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan, who oversees ONCB affairs, had appointed a panel comprising officials from the Finance and Justice ministries, Bank of Thailand, Stock Exchange of Thailand, Chulalongkorn University, Police Department, ONCB and Supreme Attorney-General to draw up the anti-money laundering law. Pol Gen Chawalit said Thailand already had a law allowing authorities to confiscate the assets of people convicted of financing drug businesses. The law was introduced in 1992 and 11 offenders have since had their assets seized, he said. Pol Gen Chawalit said the ONCB would pursue the investigation into allegations by the United States that former Chat Thai MP Thanong Siripree-chapong was involved in smuggling marijuana to the US.
