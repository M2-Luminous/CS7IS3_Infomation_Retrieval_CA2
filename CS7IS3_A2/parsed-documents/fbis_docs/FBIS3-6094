The prime minister has instructed concerned officials in government and the ruling coalition parties of his intention to study ways to promote the reform. The prime minister is aiming to win the people's understanding of his intention to push for the administrative and fiscal reform by announcing his plans to "make the government lean" after judging that debates on tax increases are inevitable in the course of sweeping reform of the current tax system for Japan to prepare itself for a society of senior citizens. While the idea is surfacing within the ruling coalition parties of merging three agencies -- the National Land Agency, the Hokkaido Development Agency, and the Okinawa Development Agency -- the prime minister plans to review the need to maintain various corporations and business corporations. The prime minister's plans, however, will encounter twists and turns because the government ministries and agencies are expected to react against them. The prime minister believes that his failure to mention how he will work to reform and streamline the administration was one of the reasons for the national welfare tax coming under attack. The prime minister thinks it is indispensable for the government to show a posture to make itself lean and not to meet all fiscal requirements through tax increases. Among the ruling coalition parties, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which wants to avoid raising the consumption tax, is responding positively to the prime minister's plans. Along with the prime minister's intention, the Administrative and Fiscal Subcommittee in the "Tax System Reform Consultative Council on Social Welfare" (headed by Koken Nosaka, chairman of the SDPJ Diet Administration Committee), is now working on a full-fledged review, and a plan is surfacing for merging the Hokkaido Development Agency and the Okinawa Development Agency into bureaus in the National Land Agency. The plan has been incorporated three times in all in reports compiled by the Second Provisional Administrative Survey Council in 1981 and the Second Provisional Administrative Reform Promotion Deliberation Council in 1987 on the need to promote the comprehensive and integrated development of national land, but it has never been put into effect. In this connection, moves are afoot to reexamine the way the Hokkaido-Tohoku Development Finance Corporation, the Okinawa Development Finance Corporation, and the Amami Gunto Promotion Development Credit Fund are managed. The Third Administrative Reform Council, which tried to promote reform of special corporations in the closing days of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], scrapped plans to compile a final report in the face of backlash from government ministries and agencies shortly after the Hosokawa government was inaugurated. Taking this background into account, the prime minister is showing his eagerness to grapple with the policy task that was left unaccomplished during the LDP era. The prime minister is poised to study broad ways to merge, abolish, or privatize corporations, business corporations, and financial corporations, and funds whose management is intransparent, whose work is duplicated, and whose significance of existence is lost in view of the objective of their establishment. Government ministries and agencies in Kasumigaseki [name of Tokyo town where government ministries and agencies are located] very strongly resist any reform that affects directly the fate of their organizations and a loss of their vested interests. In response to the plan for the merger of the three agencies, the Hokkaido Development Agency and the Okinawa Development Agency are voicing their strong opposition to concerned officials in the ruling coalition parties. Some point out that "it is doubtful how much in financial resources the government will be able to save by reorganizing government ministries and agencies, and reforming special corporations." The prime minister, Kasumigaseki, and the ruling coalition parties are expected to engage in a fierce tug of war in the future.
