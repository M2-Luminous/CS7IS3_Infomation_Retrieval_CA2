Apart from that, a terse statement from the Ecology Generation wondered about, among other things, "the government's indulgence of the arms industry's pressure groups." Setting aside these discordant notes, public opinion did not react to the 613.118 billion current francs [Fr], which represent Fr658 billion in constant francs based on an annual inflation rate of 2 percent, provided for in the military programming law covering the 1995-2000 period. That is half of France's total annual budget. Should one conclude from this that the French are losing interest in the issue and that, above certain amounts (the Fr20 billion for the recapitalization of Air France seemed to strike home a lot more), we are wandering out in the realm of the abstract? Or does it mean, as some optimistic elected representatives allege, that as a result of the Bosnian and Somalian interventions, the French understand completely the importance of having an optimal national defense and intervention capacity? The elected representatives hardly reacted either. Next Tuesday [24 May] evening, and probably Wednesday too, they are supposed to debate the text. This presentation is to be preceded by a speech by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. The vote itself, as is the case with important texts, will not take place until a week later. However, the outcome is already known. It will be positive. The military planning law could even be marked by the seal of consensus. The RPR [Rally for the Republic] -- except for a few grumblers like Jacques Baumel -- and the UDF [French Democratic Union] will obviously vote in favor. The Communists will vote against, as is traditional. The Socialists will vote "yes" under pressure from President Francois Mitterrand, who will let it be understood that he is the main instigator behind the text which he supposedly managed to get "accepted" by the government. The 1995-2000 military planning law should therefore be widely adopted, but not necessarily applied, because it has no legitimacy in terms of substance. At Bercy [Finance Ministry], they always have trouble getting used to the idea that the government and the elected representatives are going to commit themselves to spending over a period of six years. Budget experts are "completely prepared to take with one hand what was given with the other," one deputy commented. It was with some reluctance that the Finance Ministry agreed to an annual increase of .5 percent in defense spending -- and even, beginning in 1998, of 1.5 percent if the economic recovery and the cost reductions for arms programs materialize -- while the law on controlling spending calls for each ministry to receive .5 percent less per year. However, Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy indeed realized that, since Balladur's arrival at the Matignon [office of the prime minister], the prime minister has favored [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard with each volley between the Finance and the Defense ministries. This is a political choice since Defense was favored in the prime minister's first speech on general policy. It is also a politician's choice: His defense minister is also the honorary president of the Republican Party, which is the UDF's strike force, and a source of hoped-for support in the 1995 presidential elections, even if it means promising "Leo" the prime ministership and painting a glowing picture of support for the presidential elections in 2002. The 1993 interim budget, the 1994 budget, the financing of external operations: The Finance Ministry had to defer to the Defense Ministry, but is not losing anything by waiting. In the past, the moral validity alone of a programming law did never withstand annual budget cuts. According to Francois Leotard, the difference would only be 4.9 percent, but this calculation is based on the initial finance law. According to a calculation currently being made in Parliament, after the budget audit, the gap would reach 20 to 25 percent. The elected representatives regret seeing their vote in favor of a programming law scorned by these little cuts based on the principle of the "Huron curve." That is the name for the financial mechanism whose program authorization curve starts at a very high level, but which is systematically being eroded at the lower levels representing payment credits, or the money that is actually allocated. Despite everything, in the year 2000, France will have the most modern fighter aircraft in the world, the Rafale; a missile-launching nuclear submarine which can rival those made by Russia and the United States; a nuclear propulsion aircraft carrier in a class that only Washington has; an armored division of Leclerc combat tanks, the newest in Europe; and helicopters, satellites, missiles. Everything will be new and high-tech. Is this a stroke of genius or a stroke of madness? It is, first of all, a sort of "concatenation" logic. The kind that, in the eighties, first under the Right and then under the Left, made France simultaneously launch a renewal of all its major armament programs. Total cost: Fr700 billion! Not to mention the fact that at the same time we had to continue equipping our troops with the existing equipment, which is not included in the total. By the early nineties, it was too late to stop these major programs. The industrial and social risk had become too great. Squaring the circle meant keeping the programs while making savings. The 1995-2000 programming law tried this tack by encouraging the manufacture of equipment, by counting on cost reductions of 2 percent, and by postponing or staggering future programs, since there could be no question of rewriting the "concatenation" logic. Why 2-percent cost reductions? Quite simply because there were those among Francois Leotard's staff who thought they could "fit things in" over the six-year period with an annual growth of 2.5 percent. However, such a growth rate is inconceivable at a time when the Matignon is asking all its ministers to economize. The .5-percent increase was only won after applying a lot of pressure that irritated more than just one person at the Matignon. Two percent was still needed to make the operation succeed, hence the objective of productivity gains. The worst thing is that all this is just not enough. So far, bearing in mind the Fr700 billion that has to be found, the various governments have always "passed the bucket." Preceding programming laws definitely provided for a slight progression, but they did not show the necessary and substantial increases in spending to finance the actual project cost in the subsequent years (up 5 percent, up 10 percent, up 12 percent). This is a time bomb left behind; and one which the planning law for 1995-2000 has not completely defused. In six years, France will therefore have top quality arms. There are plenty of geopolitical reasons for this: The celebrated "peace dividends," mentioned by Laurent Fabius following the fall of the Berlin Wall, have given way to a great many fears. Is France at risk of one day being hit by a nuclear missile from Ukraine? From Belarus? A SCUD from Algeria? A chemical bomb from the Balkans? Not to mention the threat of terrorism, nuclear proliferation, etc. The white paper, which was drawn up just before the programming law, reviews all possible crises. France must therefore combine maintaining its deterrent force with developing its capacity to project its forces via helicopters, future troop transport aircraft, landing craft, and even Cruise missiles. It is a sort of compromise between Desert Storm and the Cold War, an attempt to, at a price, maintain the armaments industry with its 230,000 employees throughout France and its technological skills, which are often the best in Europe. However, the main reason for these Fr613 billion over six years may lie elsewhere. France has a seat on the Security Council and is fighting to get its voice heard everywhere in the worldwide diplomatic chorus, starting in Bosnia, where it has more soldiers than other nations, to Cambodia. "It is not the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] that allows France to keep this place," an RPR senator said with regard to these strategic questions, "it is the weight of its Army, its capacity, independent of the United States, to intervene militarily. Without its Armed Forces, France would be relegated to the rank of second-class nation." So Paris has every reason in the world to put more than Fr600 billion into this programming law: political consensus, disinterest -- but not hostility -- from public opinion, a geostrategic key, the industrial and social imperative, and technological necessity. This will remain true until the next annual budget debate. Even in the government, they will then realize that one Leclerc tank costs Fr30 million, one fully equipped Rafale fighter plane Fr588 million, and a nuclear aircraft carrier Fr17 billion. How many schools, kilometers of freeway, or how much AIDS research could all that buy? Questions of choice and priority, or even of demagogy will inevitably arise throughout the six years covered by the programming law.
