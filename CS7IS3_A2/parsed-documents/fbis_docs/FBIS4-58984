[Begin Sifi recording] In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. Thank you Mr. President. Mr. President, chairman of the Consultative Council, ladies and gentlemen ministers, ladies and gentlemen. May God's peace, compassion, and blessings be upon you. I am honored and pleased to join you today at the inauguration of the National Economic and Social Council [al-majlis al-watani al-iqtisadi wa al-ijtima'i] On this occasion I present to you, on behalf of the head of state and the government, my warm congratulations for everyone's choice and the trust put in you. I also express to the organizations and institutions which appointed you my satisfaction with the constructive spirit and broad view they expressed during the consultations which brought them together with the government on setting up this Council, which has a special importance. The installation of the National Economic and Social Council, which will be followed by the National Transitional Council, is a symbol of the break with past practice, which we hope to instill, and is proof of our eagerness to engage in open consultation with all the participants in national life. Ladies and gentlemen, the state, while opting for opening up to its economic and social partners in order to create this council, affirms its desire to ensure the actual participation of all sections of society in order to take charge over the future of our country. I am convinced that this opening up of our state to society, the choice of competence, and giving the necessary opportunities to our youth, will be a starting point toward the better management of our country's affairs. Thanks to your ideas and the suggestions which you submit to the government, we will continually consolidate and deepen the citizens' contribution to preparing the social and economic decisions which concern them and define their future. I hereby affirm the government's eagerness for the development of this consultation so as to take charge of coordinating the economic reforms which will be witnessed by the country, and for the revival of national development, which will benefit large sections of our people. This was the concept stressed by the head of state recerntly before the Council of ministers, and which is related to the need to give necessary attention to promoting national solidarity and social justice. At the same time, great attention will be given to those sectors financing the economy, such as the hydrocarbons sector or those which comply with economic growth, and society's needs such as agriculture, housing, and small and medium industries. Our national development will remain characterized by social justice and the state's contribution in parallel with the reforms, which aim at improving efficiency and freeing creative initiatives. Better than that, this development will be further consolidated through extended consultation with all representatives of society, and in this lies the final split with the spirit of monopoly, whatever its nature. In this respect, the composition of your council provides a better framework to identify the real points of strength and weaknesses of our country, and to collectively identify the best ways and means which enable Algeria to fully utilize its actual resources. Ladies and gentlemen, at a time when our country embarks on profound reforms and the international arena, when we experience fast and profound changes -- from which the economic, technological, and scientific domains cannot escape, your council represents a considerable achievement to promote the interests of our country and people. Indeed, in parallel with the revival of the national economy, Algeria has to open up economically toward the outside world in order to occupy its real status within the international exchange. On the other hand, it is imperative for our country, especially when youth constitutes the majority of its population, and especially now, to be concerned with the future perception of its development in order to ensure a respected future for the rising generations through the promotion of efforts and the exploitation of creative energies that are the sources for good and prosperity. Such ideas, which have now acquired a wide and permanent framework through your council, underline to our people, regardless of the passing difficulties, that the hope of restoring its perpetual prosperity in a stable country, one respected by other nations, is a legitimate hope. It is because Algeria of the eternal November revolution still has plenty of the necessary energies to face up to all challenges. All of this underscores the significance and vastness of the hopes pinned on this council, which will be concerned with fundamental national issues. The nation is awaiting rich ideas from you, ideas that will emanate from the diversity of your specializations and qualifications, and the state is awaiting from you reformist proposals. I would like to stress, on behalf of the head of state, in my own name, and on behalf of the government, that we highly appreciate your brave commitment to serve the nation at this very time; the time when Algeria has to depend on its loyal children, who will never leave or abandon it. Before this heavy burden and great responsibility is laid on your shoulders, I cannot but wish you every success and righteousness, and stress to you my absolute support. I have the honor to officially announce the installation of the Social and Economic National Council. May God help us all to accomplish everything that brings good, pride, and prosperity to Algeria. Peace be upon you and God's compassion and blessings. [end recording]
