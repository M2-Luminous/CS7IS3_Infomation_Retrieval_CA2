"All kinds of reform that are taking place internationally will ultimately affect North Korea," Gorbachev told the speaker of the National Assembly, Yi Man-sop. "When we reflect on the experience of German unification, we cannot doubt that Korea will eventually be unified one day," said Gorbachev during a courtesy call on Yi. Gorbachev, accompanied by his wife, arrived in Seoul last Friday to attend the second world peace conference, which is sponsored by the Washington-based World Peace Federation, an affiliate of the Rev. Mun Son-myong's Unification Church. "Germany is experiencing difficulties because it has achieved unification in a hurry," Gorbachev said. "Korea should proceed with its unification projects, taking its time so that there would not be such adverse side-effects." Earlier Sunday evening, Former President No Tae-u hosted a dinner for Gorbachev. No and Gorbachev agreed that although they have both retired from active politics, they will work to promote friendly ties between South Korea and Russia. Gorbachev is scheduled to attend the world peace conference until Tuesday and meet with South Korean Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang before leaving Seoul Thursday.
