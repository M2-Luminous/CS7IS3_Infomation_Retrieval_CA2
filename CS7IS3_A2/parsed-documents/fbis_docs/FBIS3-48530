Passing this message on to the Thai Boon Rong (TBR) company was what ordinary Cambodians did last Thursday in their third protest against prices at the TBR-built market in central Phnom Penh. "The good investors will drive out the bad," read placards last week, using a near identical line from Rangsi's speech made during Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's Cambodia visit. Support for the dispute has widened since the last demonstration on December 20. Some of last week's protesters said they were students from several Phnom Penh colleges. Apart from supporting the traders' claims that rents at the soon to-be-completed TBR market are too high, demonstrators said they were showing their support for Rangsi in his heated war of words with TBR chairman Theng Bun Ma. "We come here because we want to find justice for Sam Rangsi," student leader Pich Moniroat told journalists in front of 1,000 people gathered opposite Phnom Penh's National Assembly building. At a January 11 press conference, Rangsi said King Sihanouk had sent a message fully supporting the market traders, wrote the latest edition of Cambodia's fortnightly English-language PHNOM PENH POST newspaper. A few days later, the TBR chairman published a letter in another local newspaper describing Rangsi as "the minister of destroying national economy and finance" accusing him of using "inciting" language, and inviting him to "inspect our company". Rangsi's written response spoke of "the economic colonialist yoke of the Thai Boon Rong company which has the backing of the mafia operating in nearby countries". In his letter, Rangsi promised to send "officials to inspect your company in the future". A student from Phnom Penh's economics institute said he had come to support Rangsi against TBR. "The youth support king, National Assembly, and Sam Rangsi" read a nearby placard. "I come here with the youth and business people to ask the Government to kick the Thai Boon Rong company out of Cambodia," said Pich Moniroat, who told journalists he was head of the Patriotic Youth Association from Phnom Penh University. "Why didn't Thai Boon Rong settle with excellency Sam Rangsi in a quiet way (instead) of putting in the newspaper?" asked Pich rhetorically. Unofficial Cambodian sources say the REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA newspaper which ran Theng Bun Ma's criticism of Rangsi is at least partly owned by the TBR group. In his written reply to the company chairman, Rangsi refers to the "clarification which you had your newspaper publish". The demonstration seems to have caught the imagination of an increasing number of Cambodians. Details remain sketchy about TBR itself. Chairman Theng Bun Ma is a Sino-Cambodian from Kompong Cham province, a TBR representative told Inside Indochina. "According to what I receive, he is originally a Cambodian who fled durihg the war to become a Thai citizen," Cambodia's Information Ministry spokesman Sieng Lapresse said in a telephone interview last week. "The company is a Thai company." In the TBR chairman's newspaper message to Rangsi, the letter accused the finance minister of daring to "denounce the previous government". Senior officials in the now-defunct State of Cambodia (SOC) regime are widely blamed by Cambodians for corrupt selling of state assets which led to Phnom Penh's December 1991 anti-corruption riots. The TBR chairman appears to be trying to exaggerate differences between the former SOC rulers and the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] party to which Rangsi belongs and which won the elections in May, observers say. After the second market demonstration in December, First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh's Cabinet director Li Thuch said a "positive start" had been made on solving the dispute and no more protests would occur. Government officials and protestors last week contradicted him. "At this time, this thing is not moving anywhere," said Lapresse. Inside Indochina at the end of last week was unable to contact TBR company representatives or Rangsi for comment on the latest developments. Apart from the market at the centre of this dispute, TBR is developing several hotels in Phnom Penh. Early last-month, the company donated a 12-seater plane to the Government, according to an AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE report published on December 7. A few weeks ago, THE CAMBODIA TIMES newspaper ran a full-page 50th birthday greeting to First Prime Minister Ranariddh "With Best Wishes" from Theng Bun Ma and all personnel at TBR. Last week's protesters had a different message for the TBR chairman: "We want the Royal Government to settle this dispute with Thai Boon Rong company in front of the people," said student leader Pich, 30. "We will demonstrate again if there is no solution."
