He said that this zone would include territory from the Western Georgian city of Zugdidi to Gali -- a regional center in Southern Abkhazia. He said that the peace keeping forces (2,500 to 3,000 men -- INTERFAX) will enter the "security zone,", which will be set up after the withdrawal of Georgian and Abkhaz formations from the Inguri river, by the end of May. At the beginning of June refugees will start to return to the Gali region. He said that 88 UN observers based in Abkhazia would also control the situation in the security zone and that an increase in their numbers was currently being discussed. "No Georgian or Abkhaz troops will be in the security zone," he emphasized. Ioseliani also reported that mobile patrol groups made up of up to 400 peace keeping soldiers would be formed in the Kodor canyon, from which Georgian and Abkhaz troops must withdraw. He stressed that all these are initial moves and that talks would continue and a plan worked out for returning all the refugees to Abkhazia. He said that at the end of this week military representatives of Georgia, Abkhazia and the CIS would meet. The meeting will establish the exact position of the peace-keeping forces.
