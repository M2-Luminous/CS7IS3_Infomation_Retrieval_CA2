The two new units will strengthen the naval operation in the western region of the archipelago and will consolidate the so-called "integrated fleet system" of the Indonesian Navy. The Western Fleet commander-in-chief also swore in the commanders of the new units -- Colonel Sumarjo appointed as the amphibious ships squad commander and Colonel Fakhmi Jamaris as exercise fleet commander. The Western Regional Fleet was established in 1985, while the Eastern Regional Fleet has been in existence since the country's independence. According to Kushariadi, two more squads will be set up -- the escort ships squad and the minesweepers squad -- following the arrival of 39 warships purchased by the Indonesian Navy from Germany. Of the 39 warships, nine minesweepers, five corvettes, and three amphibious LSTs (landing ship tanks), have already arrived here.
