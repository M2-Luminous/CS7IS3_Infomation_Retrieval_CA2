Your statements have often been misinterpreted, you have often been quoted out of context by foreign news agencies -- there is a great deal of interest among Sarajevans in the answers you will give to the questions I will try to ask prior to your announced visit to Sarajevo. Let us start from the beginning, in other words from the time the Republic of Croatia recognized the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina; let me recall that Croatia was the first to do so. The date was 7 April 1992, two years ago. The ambassador was appointed that same year, some five or six months later. This will be your first visit to Sarajevo -- two years after recognition. In the meantime President Izetbegovic has visited Croatia quite often. Why is your visit taking place now, relatively late in the day? [Tudjman] I would like to ask you why you are asking such a question. The reason Mr. Izetbegovic visited Zagreb so often was because Croatia has been, so to speak, the Bosnian government's mainstay, Bosnia's mainstay in its struggle for independence. Generally speaking, Croatia has always extended its hospitality -- whenever Mr. Izetbegovic had to travel to the West, whenever he had to go somewhere for talks, it was Croatia that made it possible [changes thought], for Bosnia-Herzegovina to organize itself for defense against the aggressor. In such circumstances, the circumstances Bosnia-Herzegovina was in, Mr. Izetbegovic neither invited me to Bosnia-Herzegovina nor could I have come under such circumstances. The exact date of even this prearranged visit cannot be fixed yet, given the circumstances. So, those are the reasons why I am visiting Bosnia-Herzegovina now. I gladly accepted Mr. Izetbegovic's invitation after the signing of the Washington accords, but the answer to your question lies in the situation. [Journalist] When he invited you to visit, President Izetbegovic stressed that the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina have a good many issues in common, or rather questions which should be considered together. In your view, what are these issues? [Tudjman] Well, above all the question of the revitalization of the Washington agreement, the agreement on a federation between the Croatian and Bosniak Muslim nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and also the question of the creation of a confederation between a federal Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. These are vital questions which are of vital importance both to the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and to Croatia. [Journalist] So this will be the focus of your talks when you come to Sarajevo in the next few days? [Tudjman] Certainly. [Journalist] The Croatian ruling party and you personally -- at least it is understood this way in Sarajevo, and not only in Sarajevo -- interpret the Washington agreement as the continuation of your policy. However, I must remind you, again from Sarajevo's point of view, that in Bosnia-Herzegovina you often stress that President Izetbegovic personally proposed to you at one of the Geneva meetings something similar and virtually the same as what has now been signed in Washington. I have to ask you directly, why at that time in Geneva did you not accept these proposals which in Sarajevo they are saying are the same, while you have now signed them in Washington? [Tudjman] Because they are not the same proposals. The Washington agreement reflects the continuity of Croatian policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina: allow me to remind you and the public in Bosnia-Herzegovina of some facts. Croatian policy and I personally were in favour of realizing the Cutilheiro proposal -- not only Cutilheiro's proposal, but we also took part in working out a proposal on a cantonal system for Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to resolve the war crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina in this way. Croatian policy and I personally were also in favor of finding a solution to the war crisis, the political crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, on the basis of the Vance-Owen proposal on the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina into provinces. When all this came to nothing -- and when, in opposition to the separation of the so-called Srpska republic in Bosnia, the idea emerged that the Muslims might be organized as a separate republic and as a separate state in the framework of the program that emerged in the European conference on the former Yugoslavia in Bosnia and also in the framework of the reality which was unfurling in Bosnia- Herzegovina, in other words in the framework of these ideas of the creation of a union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the Muslim leadership developed the idea that it would be better for the Muslims to realize their own republic, their own separate state. So to this end, by way of resistance to Serb aggression, and in this search for a solution to the crisis of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna was also created. It was in this context that Mr. Izetbegovic proposed that they go for a union between the Srpska republic and a unified Muslim-Croat republic. And this is quite different from the current agreement on a Bosniak Muslim-Croat federation. In contrast to this, I was the one who proposed that there be a confederation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia and also the closest cooperation between the republics -- the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and the Muslim republic. So this proposal was also put forward at the Berlin meeting. Europe, Germany, and the world convinced themselves of the benefits of this proposal and believed that Croatian policy was in favor of solutions which would be acceptable both to the Bosniak Muslim people and to the Croatian people, and which would have provided prospects for the resolution of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. So this is something quite different from the proposal which you mentioned. However, the vital thing is that we did reach agreement in Washington on the creation of a Bosniak Muslim-Croatian federation and a confederation with Croatia. [Journalist] Mr. President, if you could tell us more -- it seems we can never stop dwelling on this problem -- what are currently the most burning issues in relations between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Tudjman] First of all we should solve certain material questions. As you know, Croatia has accommodated several hundred thousand refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina of which more than half are Muslims, not only Croats. Croatia has had to allocate vast sums for the accommodation of those refugees, the education of the children, for extending medical care to the wounded from Bosnia-Herzegovina. So, we have to solve these material questions. However, I should say that -- important as they may be -- these questions are nevertheless marginal compared to the task of creating conditions for the birth of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and finding the best ways for setting up confederal relations between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia in terms of the economy, cultural links, and overall communal relations in the search for a new international order in the region of former Yugoslavia and this part of southeast Europe. [Journalist] Mr. President, you mentioned the federation, which has been agreed on at least in principle and in writing. When could we expect something similar in the case of the confederation between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Tudjman] The moment the federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina becomes established and an overall solution to the crisis in Bosnia- Herzegovina is found. [Journalist] Mr. President, I must apologize for my bluntness but please answer this -- namely, it often happens that statements made by your associates and you yourself are construed in Sarajevo as meddling in the internal affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This particularly applies to your insistence on your concern for your compatriots in the neighboring country. From the Sarajevan and Bosnia-Herzegovina point of view, this sometimes seems like interference in internal affairs. I would like to ask you whether, after Washington, we in Bosnia-Herzegovina can expect this to become confined within acceptable boundaries? [Tudjman] Is what I said about Croatia making it possible for Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Sarajevo government to organize their defense with Croatia's help also meddling in internal affairs? Is the fact that we accepted several hundred thousand refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina meddling? Were we interfering when we were compelled to extend aid to the Croat population to defend itself against Serb aggression? At that time, when the Muslims were not yet prepared and when they did not believe the Yugo-communist army and Serbia and Montenegro would attack Bosnia, our Croats in Bosnia- Herzegovina were prepared precisely because they knew what was going on and because Croatia helped them defend themselves. And something else -- Croatian territory was threatened from the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina which in the beginning was not prepared to defend itself from Serbian and Montenegrin and Yugo-communist aggression. I am not only referring to the immediate vicinity of Dubrovnik but to all of southern Croatia, although this especially applies to the regions east of the Neretva, around Dubrovnik. So, we had to interfere in order to defend the Croatian Republic as well as to extend aid to the Croat people who were threatened with genocide, as they truly were later on, just like the Muslim people. Therefore, this was no meddling but a result of the crisis of the former Yugoslavia, the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia. What was at issue here was whether or not the whole of Bosnia- Herzegovina would be devoured by Greater Serbia. In this context we held talks with Mr. Izetbegovic and other Muslim leaders. You probably know that in the course of this series of talks we signed an agreement on 12 July 1992 in which it was said that the joint efforts against Serb aggression call for cooperation, including military cooperation in border areas. Since we are discussing this issue and since you formulated your question the way you did, I must recall that we in Croatia even suggested a direct military alliance at the time. However, the Sarajevo government did not agree to a general military alliance but only to cooperation in border areas. So, this is what it was all about, not meddling. Croatia was extending aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina, not only to the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina for their defense against Serb aggression; this was also aid to the Muslims to stand on their feet, to organize in their opposition to Serb aggression, and all this was aimed at creating conditions for the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Journalist] Please let me say that it was precisely the creation of, as we in Bosnia-Herzegovina say, the so-called Herceg-Bosna that was perceived by the government in Sarajevo and the presidency as an intention to partition Bosnia. What is your comment? [Tudjman] Your question is again based on the wrong premises. A little while ago I explained to you that we favored both a cantonal and a provincial organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina. But when this fell through, in the light of what was going on on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the war, when these proposals were not accepted by all three sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina, then it is understandable that we -- contrary to this ambition of the Serbs to isolate themselves as a separate republic and contrary, as I said, to the intention, the Muslim leadership's considerable intention to create their own republic, their own independent Muslim state -- that the Croats had to start creating their own republic, Herceg-Bosna. The Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna was created in the resistance to Serbian aggression. Had it not been for this resistance the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina would have probably, as I said, fallen into the hands of Greater Serbia. Hence, this was not a result of Croatia's choice in favor of Herceg-Bosna's secession. I will tell you one truth, two truths. We signed an agreement with Mr. Izetbegovic on 14 September 1993 in Geneva and with the Muslim leadership, a public agreement on cooperation between the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and the Muslim republic within the framework of a union. We also signed a secret agreement -- which does not have to be secret any longer now, given how the situation has evolved -- an agreement on a confederation of these republics with Croatia. On 16 September, however, two days later, the Muslim leadership signed an agreement with the Serbs which, in fact, envisaged the break-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina, its carve-up, as this agreement stated that in the event of the union being carved up, the rights of the present Bosnia-Herzegovina, the rights of its membership in the United Nations, would be vested in a Muslim republic. Consequently, one cannot, there is no justification, there are no historical and political reasons for ascribing this intention to the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia's policies, that Croatia has favored a break-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina since the beginning [as heard]. It was not in Croatia's interest to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina. I will even tell you one other thing. Highly responsible people from the Muslim leadership have told me: You can annex Herceg-Bosna to Croatia, but on condition that central Bosnia remains within the framework of the Muslim republic. I refused to accept this. I took into consideration the Croatian people outside the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna -- the area which had then been under direct control [as heard] -- and I believed, for strategic reasons, that more deeply-rooted joint interests existed than those regarding the annexation of western Herzegovina, which had been proposed. All your questions indicate that there is a lack of understanding and one-sidedness in the way the Bosnian Muslim public was being informed about Croatia's policy from the very beginning of the crisis until today. This Croatian policy has led to what we have achieved [as heard]. Had it not been for the Croat republic of Hereg-Bosna, which also took others into consideration -- the leadership of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna included not only people from Herzegovina, but also those from central Bosnia and Bosnian Posavina -- we would not have saved these areas, the survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina would not have been possible, and there would not have been an agreement on the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation and on the confederation with Croatia. These are the foundations we should bear in mind, and it is this policy that we should build upon, and not upon one-sided and false interpretations of the Croatian policy. [Journalist] What are real prospects for the full implementation of the Washington agreement? [Tudjman] I think the prospects are good because the Washington agreement succeeded in coordinating Bosniak Muslim and Croat interests in Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as the interests of Bosniak Muslims and Croats with those of the Croatian state. Furthermore, these interests have been adjusted to the interests of the western world which did not want to allow the realization of Greater Serbian plans to incorporate Bosnia-Herzegovina into a Greater Serbia, nor did it allow -- and these tendencies existed -- extremist-fundamentalist Mujahedin-oriented plans to create an Islamic state in Bosnia and in Europe. In this agreement on the Bosniak Muslim-Croat federation and on the confederation with Croatia, Croat and Muslim interests coincided with the interests of the Western world to create the preconditions for a democratic system and for linking Bosnia-Herzegovina with Western civilization -- contrary to aspirations to create a Greater Serbia and contrary to certain extremist notions that a fundamentalist Islamic state could be created. These are the guarantees for the implementation of this agreement. [Journalist] Mr. President, after Geneva, when you and President Izetbegovic signed one of the Geneva agreements, your Minister Silajdzic and Minister Granic were set a task to implement the agreement. After the Washington agreement, are there any concrete tasks of this kind? Are there any concrete plans to implement it? [Tudjman] For Christ's sake, the agreement is being implemented daily: the POWs have been released, talks are under way on the organization of federal power in Bosnia-Herzegovina, plans exist on how to establish the confederation -- it is clear that this is a matter involving serious politicians dealing with serious politics and not the ones dealing with policy-mongering, who are calling into question this agreement beforehand, not taking into consideration the strategic elements. The problem of solving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina does not only belong to Croats and Muslims, or to Croats, Muslims, and Serbs, but also to the eastern and the western world. [Journalist] Looking at it from the present perspective, after all these evils we lived through together, what if anything would you change in your policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Tudjman] I answered this question when answering all your previous questions. I would not change anything. I would only wish to see that ideas about the necessity of the Bosniak Muslim-Croat alliance prevail in the Bosniak Muslim policy and that those are eliminated who went as far as claiming that it was wrong for the Muslims to enter a federation with the Croats. I would also like to see the revival of the traditions of Bosniak Muslim leaders -- political and cultural -- who advocated the idea that the Muslims had historic ties with the Croatian people through their origins and their language. Should I perhaps remind you of Safet Bey Basagic [Bosnian Muslim poet], I may not be able to quote precisely -- who had even predicted what I have just spoken of, that this is not just a Croat-Muslim issue, but also the issue of east and west. He said in one of his verses, I think: The sounds of my Croatian language can unite the east and the west, can be the food of both songs and the mind; if I am not mistaken. I would like these people to come to the fore, the people who would nurture that which both Safet Bey Basagic and many other eminent Muslim political and cultural leaders have been nurturing. I knew many of them, I was especially fond of Mak Dizdar [Bosnian Muslim poet]. The same goes for Croats, for people like Franciscan [Bosnian Croat priest and poet] Grga Martic who wrote poems and spoke about unity in the interest of both Bosniak Muslims and Croats. I will try to remeber what Grga Martic said: There is no hope for a home lacking brotherly love, and there is no hope for a Bosnia without Croatia. Therefore this idea has survived despite everything that happened between the Croats and the Muslims in history. Because of this division between east and west and because of the geopolitical links, there is a need for a federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and for a concept of a confederation. For this to be achieved, it is necessary for both Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina to get used to the idea that this is a historic necessity and that today's world needs it, so that they could coordinate their actions in this direction and know how to overcome all minor details which are different and which we discussed in part in this interview. [Journalist] Mr. Tudjman, I would like to thank you and ask you one last question: At one of your regular monthly news conferences, you said that you would be happy to go to Sarajevo. Do you still think you would be going there happily? [Tudjman] I am still happy to go, but I will be going with the feeling that in this way I would be implementing the policy which I have been conducting right from the beginning. This policy has also been advocated by far-sighted people -- both Croats and Muslims, as I said. I personally have known Croatian politicians who have played an important role not only in the political life of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- I am thinking of Dr. (Barisa Smojan) or Dr. (Juraj Sute) -- but in Croatian politics generally. I have also known Muslim politicians and cultural workers. My visit to Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina will therefore be the continuation of the tendencies that unless there is a resolution of our future as envisaged by the Washington agreement, there would be no peaceful life together in this part of southeast Europe, and without this no new international order would be possible, not only on the territory of the former Yugoslavia but there would also be no peace in this part of Europe. So it is with this sense of the historical necessity of implementing this agreement, and life together as envisaged in the Washington agreement, that I am going to Sarajevo, in the hope that my visit will contribute to the implementation of these ideas and subsequently to the overcoming, as soon as possible, of not only the political but also the war crisis we are faced with at present and which the whole world is concerned with, and the whole world is requesting that we do this. [Journalist] Mr. President, thank you for the conversation and bon voyage to Sarajevo. [Tudjman] Thank you.
