I would just like to say, on the margin, that I was not invited to any "talks" in Litomysl. Incidentally, this would have been inappropriate at an exclusive meeting of presidents. I was invited to a concert (and one cannot talk there) and to a dinner (and, despite the many interpreters, one can only talk to one's immediate neighbor). Given the sudden emergence of a whole series of problems just before my visit to South America (the talks on the jurisdiction of the regions were held in my office late on the Friday [15 April] evening at the time of the Litomysl dinner), I gave intentional priority to an apology and chose to deal with the matters that, at the given moment, especially after the morning meeting of the Coalition Four, I considered to be the most pressing. It seems pointless to me to continue speculating about this. However, the very idea of Central Europeanness, which was declined in all its cases in the media after the meeting, is something else. I would like to publicly acknowledge my Central Europeanness. Indeed, I feel that neighboring countries are closer to us than the countries that are not our immediate neighbors, that we are linked to them by thousands of visible and invisible and conscious and unconscious ties, and -- at the same time -- I am convinced that the policy of the current Czech Government corresponds precisely to this. Emphasis on these neighborly relations is enshrined in its policy statement of July 1992 and most of our foreign visits are made to these countries. Everyone who wants to know knows that, five days before Litomysl, I held day-long talks (and I emphasize talks and not a concert!) with Prime Minister Pawlak of Poland, that my previous foreign policy meeting was with German Social Democratic Party Chairman Scharping (the hot favorite for the post of German chancellor), and that the two most recent "prime ministerial" letters I wrote were to our neighbors -- to Bavarian Prime Minister Stoiber (about the oil pipeline from Ingolstadt) and to Saxon Prime Minister Biedenkopf (about Czech involvement in the only engineering enterprise in Erfurt). I cannot accept, therefore, criticism of my lack of Central Europeanness. I even think -- more strongly than some other Czech politicians -- that there is something in Central Europeanness, that there is really something specific about this region, that it has a common historical experience, a common cultural heritage, and -- last but not least -- some common contemporary problems, and that it would perhaps be possible to retrieve something positive from all of this. The somewhat strange idea of the Pentagonal (for example, Italy with its Sicily and Sardinia is hardly part of Central Europe) did not play this role and, similarly, I am not sure whether the institution called the Central European Initiative has a real chance of playing any historic role. Despite this, I would be willing to try something. When I was preparing to go to Budapest last July to attend a meeting involving the prime ministers of the 10 Central European Initiative countries, true to my beliefs, I said that it does not make sense to rattle off a couple of courteous phrases prepared in advance and then calmly return home again. Therefore, I prepared phrases by which I asked: Do we want to take our Central Europeanness seriously or not? Do we want to derive something from it on an institutional level? Do we want to assert our "Central European" attitudes -- if they exist -- on other forums? If the answer is yes, I am willing to go into this, if the answer is no, then let us stick to the cordial dinners and concerts. Our foreign minister talked me out of saying this by arguing that it could be interpreted as a step oriented against integration with the European Community. I respected this view and I delivered something like a "polite nothing." Everyone was satisfied. Even in the lobbies, where I tried out my Central European ideas with a little exaggeration and irony in my voice, it was clear that no one was interested in such a thing. Let it be so. Then only good neighborly cooperation, which the Czech Republic is striving for on all forums, the attempt to obviate possible disagreements and conflicts, the maximum possible openness of the borders, and freeing and facilitating as much as possible the flow of people, ideas, cultural values, goods, money, and capital remain. I have the feeling that, in this sense, the Czech Republic has a good conscience. We are negotiating calmly with Slovakia, without dramatic threats, about recognizing the undisputable Slovak debt that evolved with the break up of the Federation. We are not the ones complicating the Customs Union, we are not the ones slowing down the completion of the process for establishing a free trade zone with Poland and Hungary, we are not protesting against this or that project in Austria, we are not sending alarming signals about the Sudeten Germans, and so on and on. Nevertheless, we have to talk to each other as much as possible. In this sense, the meeting in Litomysl certainly played a positive role.
