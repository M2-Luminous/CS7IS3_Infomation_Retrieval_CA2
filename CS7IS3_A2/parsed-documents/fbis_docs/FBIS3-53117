He called on the youth to confront those people who advocate terrorism, whose hearts have been destroyed by hatred, and who are working to spread corruption and crime in Egypt in the name of religion, which is innocent of such crimes. He said such people have harmed Islam. Nevertheless, the doors of the state are still open for all those who have been misguided to return to their senses once again and join the Egyptian youth who are fighting for the future. This was stated at the large student conference held at Qina University yesterday on the occasion of the opening of the university's cultural season. The conference was attended by Yahya al-Bahansawi, the governor of Qina, and some governorate figures. The minister added that the Governorate of Qina has destroyed its image due to a small alien minority which does not belong to it. Historically, Qina has always been known as a country of science, writers, and intellectuals. Major General al-Bahansawi, the governor of Qina, announced that the state, despite its difficult economic circumstances and the sufferings it is going through due to the many development projects it is undertaking, has, nevertheless, provided a great deal of support and potential for Upper Egypt to decrease the suffering of its youth and help them lead their lives in a human fashion. Qina is second among the governorates as regards the allocation of employment projects for youths. The governor added that 2,392 popular mosques in Qina have been included under the ministry. These mosques have also been provided with imams who are qualified Islamically, intellectually, and spiritually. In addition, 2.5 million Egyptian pounds have been allocated to maintain, repair, and renovate the rest of the mosques in the governorate. Also, 2.25 million pounds were allocated to establish the mosques of al- Hujayrat and al-Humaydat -- the two towns of terrorism -- and to refurbish and renovate the famous archaeological mosque in the governorate, the mosque of 'Abd-al-Rahim al-Qina'i. The minister of awqaf also approved the allocation of 750,000 pounds to build a mosque at Qina University. The founding stone of this mosque was laid yesterday and it will be called the mosque of Martyr Major General 'Abd-al-Hamid Ghubarah, the assistant Qina security chief who was martyred by terrorists.
