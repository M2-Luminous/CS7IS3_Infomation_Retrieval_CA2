President Carlos Roberto Reina stated the following: [Begin Reina recording] The entire ministers cabinet met with the members of the Central Executive Council. The meeting took place in an extremely frank and open manner. It is no surprise to anyone that every new administration must confront situations that may tarnish the normal manner in which governments are conformed. There are commitments by party leaders which must be met. Someone who participated in the meeting said that it is a very difficult task for a politician who has promised certain things during the campaign to visit the ministers and high government officials because they always find some problems to solve at that exact moment. That is something normal because on the one hand the ministers and officials are organizing and tremendous expectations are created during the election campaign. In addition, there is little time to solve every expectation in detail, and most of all in such a short period of time. I have already announced that next Monday I will address the nation where I will talk about two fundamental issues: first the current state of the nation as well as how we received it, and secondly, a detailed government program for the next four years. The purpose of this meeting was to create fluid communications so that the high government officials who do not have sufficient time due to valid reasons, may proceed to honor campaign promises through responsible persons appointed in each of the ministries to undertake such a task. There are political commitments that were made during the campaign and we plan to honor them. In addition, we have also scheduled a meeting with the Liberal Party bloc to prevent any misunderstandings. I was extremely satisfied when Mr. Jaime Rosenthal Oliva, a very important Liberal Party leader, expressed his genuine acknowledgement of our efforts. [end recording] With respect to the numerous demands by Liberal party activists who want a position within the government, President Carlos Roberto Reina stated as follows. [Begin recording] [Reina] We covered the issue, but it is not easy to find openings to the nearly 1 million votes we obtained during the elections. That is impossible. But what we do seek to do is implement some mechanism whereby a head of a department or even a deputy will have access to the ministers of the autonomous institutions to find selection mechanism that are just and fair. [Reporter] [Question indistinct] [Reina] I would say a sort of modus operandi as they say in international vernacular. [end recording] One month after taking office, President Reina pointed out that he had already made some important decisions, but that he has stepped aside and delegated responsibilities to some of his ministers. [Begin Reina recording] Previously, a president was someone who would sit at his desk simply signing agreements affecting the lowest janitor and the highest government official. I have passed on some responsibilities to the appropriate ministers, and reserved some duties for myself. A president who simply sits and signs documents is a president who cannot work and does not make the political decisions he must constantly make. I have already made some political decisions. For example, I have delimited the border with the Republic of El Salvador. That is a national objective which we plan to carry out and explain shortly. Tomorrow I have a meeting planned at the Foreign Ministry to discuss the issue, and we cannot procrastinate any longer on this issue which is so crucial to Honduras. [end recording] With respect to this issue, President Reina indicated that during the first 15 days of March he plans to visit the territories recovered from El Salvador especially (Nawaterique) and Dolores. The objective of the visit is to speak to residents of the region as well as to confirm the effectiveness of the border demarcation.
