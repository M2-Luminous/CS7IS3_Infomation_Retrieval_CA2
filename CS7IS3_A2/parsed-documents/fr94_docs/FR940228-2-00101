FR940228-2-00101 FR940228-2-00060 OLS Acquisition Corp., et al. (70&hyph;8311) OLS Acquisition Corporation (``Acquisition Corp.'') and OLS Energy-Berkeley (``Berkeley''), One Upper Pond Road, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, both indirect nonutility subsidiaries of Energy Initiatives, Inc. (``EII''), an indirect subsidiary of General Public Utilities Corporation, a registered holding company, have filed an application-declaration pursuant to sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(a), and 12(b) of the Act and Rule 45 thereunder. By order dated August 1, 1989 (HCAR No. 24931), the Commission authorized OLS Power Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership and an indirect subsidiary of EII, to, among other things, acquire indirectly through Acquisition Corp. all of the outstanding common stock of OLS-Energy-Chino, a California corporation (``Chino''), OLS Energy-Camarillo, a California corporation (``Camarillo''), and Berkeley. Berkeley, Chino and Camarillo are each lessees, pursuant to leases (``Leases'') with General Electric Capital Corporation or a wholly owned subsidiary (collectively, ``GECC'') of operating cogeneration facilities (``Facilities'') located in California, which are all qualifying facilities under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. The Leases expire, in the cases of Chino and Camarillo, on December 31, 2007, and in the case of Berkeley, on August 7, 2007, but may be renewed, subject to certain conditions, for up to 10 years at the lessee's option. Rent payable during such renewal term would be the then fair market rent for the respective Facility, or, for an initial three year renewal term, an amount which has been agreed upon if the renewal option which provides for payment of rent in such agreed upon amount is elected by the lessee. At the time of the acquisition, Berkeley, Chino and Camarillo each were parties to revolving credit agreements (``Credit Agreement(s)'') with FECC that provided for the short-term working capital requirements of their respective Facilities. Berkeley, Chino and Camarillo have issued secured promissory notes to GECC evidencing these borrowings. After the acquisition, each company was unable to generate sufficient revenue from sales of steam and electricity to pay its operating expenses and rent under its Lease on a current basis. In order to remedy the problem, the OLS Companies ultimately reached agreement with GECC and their host institutions to restructure their Leases and the energy services agreements under which they sell electricity and steam to their host institutions (``Energy Services Agreements''). On August 30, 1991, Chino and Camarillo entered into agreements with GECC and their respective host institutions which, among other things, reduced the rent payable to GECC under their respective Leases, increased the amount each could borrow and reduced the rate of interest payable under their respective Credit Agreements and reduced certain rebates payable to their host institutions under their respective Energy Service Agreements. The amendments to Chino's and Camarillo's Credit Agreements were authorized by orders of the Commission dated February 9, 1990 and December 26, 1990 (HCAR Nos. 25038 and 25230). Pursuant to authorization granted in five previous orders of the Commission issued from 1990 through 1992, Berkeley has previously amended its Credit Agreement to, among other things, increase the aggregate amount of the borrowings which may be outstanding at any time from $1 million to $1.25 million, extend the time period for borrowings to December 31, 1994, and reduce the rate of interest from 5% over the prime rate, as defined, to 3% over the prime rate. Pursuant to negotiations with GECC and the University of California at Berkeley (``University''), where the Berkeley Facility is located, Berkeley now proposes to restructure (``Restructure'') the Lease with GECC as well as the Energy Services Agreement with the University and related agreements. Berkeley also proposes to further amend the Credit Agreement. The Restructure contemplates, among other things, that (i) rent payable to GECC under Berkeley's Lease will be reduced, effective December 31, 1993, by approximately $780,000 per year and will be payable quarterly in amounts which track expected revenue, rather than semi-annually in equal payments, and (ii) rebates payable to the University under the Energy Services Agreement will be reduced or deferred to increase the cash retained by Berkeley to pay operating expenses. As part of the Restructure, Berkeley proposes to borrow, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, up to an aggregate amount outstanding of $1 million under a loan facility (``Overhaul Loan Facility'') as part of the Berkeley Credit Agreement with GECC. The Overhaul Loan Facility would be used to fund the cost of major repairs, nonroutine maintenance activities and overhauls of its Facility; provided that the initial advance under the Overhaul Loan Facility may be used to pay amounts due fuel suppliers and the operator of the Facility, costs incurred to consummate the Restructure, prepayments of working capital advances and rent under Lease.
