In 1993, some 94 vessels of fishermen in Phu Quy Island were engaged in deep-sea fisheries, netting nearly 436 tonnes of fishes. In the first months of this year, more than 150 vessels with 1,200 men fished in Truong Sa. On an average in each fishing trip, they caught two tonnes of fish, earning 3-5 million dong, and even more than 9 million dong on one or two occasions. To create favourable conditions for fisheries in Truong Sa, the government has applied tax exemption for exploitation and export of sea products in the territorial waters of the archipelago. The authorities of Binh Thuan Province have also promulgated a policy on tax exemption for building deep-sea trawlers.
