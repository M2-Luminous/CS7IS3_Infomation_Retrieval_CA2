Sources at the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that if such a trend goes on in South Korea, Russia may totally reconsider its basic stand toward the question. Russia earlier gave the word that it would cooperate with South Korea in resettling in South Korea those North Korean loggers who remain stranded in Russia after escaping from North Korea-run logging yards in Siberia. The sources said the recent series of South Korean press reports on North Korean loggers were not factual and, besides, the Russian Government has been placed in a highly awkward position at home and abroad due to such reports. "We have invited the South Korean Government's attention to this aspect several times in the past," they said. The sources said Russia told Seoul that if South Korea, through its press, continues to raise clamor about the loggers issue, Russia may make an aboutface in its basic stand over the loggers' resettlement in South Korea. An atmosphere, they said, is being fostered among Russia's security organizations for a change in Russia's policy over the loggers. "Because of such an air, inter-office talks on procedural matters related to the loggers' resettlement in South Korea are having a hard going," they added. Russian experts in Korean affairs, too, said the Russian Government is highly dissatisfied with the way the South Korean Government handles the loggers' issue. They did not rule out the danger that after President Kim Yong- sam's visit to Russia, South Korea-Russia relations may be dragged into a delicate current. "It is possible that an extremely small number of North Korean loggers could be sent to South Korea in a symbolic gesture before President Kim's visit to Moscow," they said. "But, if an overheated atmosphere is created in South Korea by giving, for instance, a hero's welcome to the loggers to the detriment of Russia's position, there would possibly be no further flight of loggers to South Korea." Meanwhile, those North Korean loggers stranded in Russia have cut off their contacts with the South Korean Embassy in Moscow following Seoul's announcement of a policy to accept them. It is believed that some of the loggers might have been arrested by North Korean secret agents.
