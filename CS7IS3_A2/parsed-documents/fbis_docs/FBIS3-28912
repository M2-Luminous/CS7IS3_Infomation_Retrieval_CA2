Hosokawa spoke to reporters at a press conference after a previously unscheduled breakfast meeting with Clinton, called at Clinton's request, in the family quarters of the executive mansion. He said that the two sides could not resolve their differences regarding interpretation of a previous agreement to use "objective criteria" to measure the progress of imports in Japan. Japan rejects the idea of using "numerical targets" to that end, which it says amounts to managed trade. But Hosokawa said he was hopeful that the U.S. would not, in the aftermath of the collapse of the talks, resort to "unilateral punitive measures in violation of GATT," a reference to the multilateral General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. U.S. officials have warned of retaliation against Japan before the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial countries convenes its annual summit meeting in Naples in early July. Hosokawa said his "frank" breakfast talks with Clinton took place in a "relaxed atmosphere" and that they did not dwell on awkward subjects. He said the talks reaffirmed the "adult" nature of the bilateral relationship. Clinton and Hosokawa had three hours of formal summit talks Friday at the White House, in which the two leaders had what one senior U.S. administration official later described as "rather intense" exchanges over economic issues. They announced afterwards Friday at a joint news conference the two countries' failure to reach an accord on the new framework. U.S. administration officials subsequently said Washington would not reopen the framework negotiations unless Tokyo changes its position. The Clinton administration concluded an agreement with Hosokawa's predecessor, Kiichi Miyazawa, last July that called for setting up a new "framework" of trade relations between the two countries to help slash Japan's trade surplus and open its markets. Under the terms of the agreement, the two countries were supposed to work out a formula by the summit meeting Friday on how to increase foreign access in specific market sectors -- autos and auto parts, insurance, and government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment. Hosokawa is due to return home on Sunday.
