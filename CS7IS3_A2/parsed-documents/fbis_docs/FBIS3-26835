Institutions, armed forces units, and military academies throughout the Army provided the seminar with several hundred theses. Authors of 85 good theses attended the seminar. The following is a summary of the seminar. 1. The Historic Position and Great Significance of the Theory of Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics During discussions, the participants unanimously pointed out that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics upholds the combination of the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism with China's actual conditions and the characteristics of the era. This is a creative theory that has taken shape gradually and has developed into the great practice of China's reform, opening up, and modernization. This theory has inherited and developed Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and is a banner guiding China's modernization toward success. On the inherent relations between the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and Mao Zedong Thought, some comrades pointed out: There were two historic leaps in the party's ideology and theory. The first was in the democratic revolutionary period, which saw the emergence of a revolutionary road with Chinese characteristics, unveiled the logic of the Chinese revolution, gave rise to Mao Zedong Thought, and guided the Chinese revolution to victory. The second took place after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, during which the road to building socialism with Chinese characteristics was found, the logic of Chinese modernization was unveiled, and the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics took shape -- a theory that will lead China's modernization to success. The common points and inherent relations of the two leaps were "combined" and the theoretical essence of the two roads was emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, though the content, natures, and missions of the two leaps greatly differed from each other. In his remaining years, Comrade Mao Zedong tried to unveil the logic of Chinese modernization and made initial achievements in this respect, but because this historical mission was difficult and complicated, and because Comrade Mao Zedong committed a mistake of subjectivism -- a mistake of an ideological nature -- we can say that this historical mission basically remained incomplete. The second-generation leading collective of the party Central Committee with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the core conscientiously studied and summed up the experiences and lessons since the founding of the PRC, and in their new practice established the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This theory carried forward and corrected Comrade Mao Zedong's explorations, while a more important point was putting forward and developing new ideas. The participants pointed out: We should study and master the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and use this theory to guide our thinking and work, and this should permeate the entire process of socialist modernization. This is a matter of priority importance which involves the country's prosperity and prolonged stability. In new historical conditions, only by arming cadres and soldiers throughout the armed forces with this theory can we ensure absolute party leadership over the Army, ensure that the Army will adhere firmly to the party's basic line for 100 years, ensure that the nature of the people's Army will not change, and ensure the smooth carrying out of all construction and reform projects in the Army. 2. The Basic Content and Scientific Structure of the Theory of Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics The participants said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a scientific system with rich and profound content, strict logic, and a complete structure. This system originated in Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, but bears the strong nature of creation, practice, and the era. It does not simply copy or fragmentarily supplement Marxism or its principles, but is a major development of Marxism and its principles. Both in form and content, it is a scientific system of modern Chinese Marxism with special characteristics. We say that this theory is a scientific system because, like other scientific theories, it has the basic scope, basic viewpoints, basic theory, completeness, its own systematizm, and profoundness. Completeness means that the theory comprehensively explains a number of basic questions, such as what socialism is and how to build socialism in an economically and culturally backward country like China. Systematizm means that there are strict logical relations between these basic questions. Profoundness refers to its theoretical summation of a number of fundamental questions concerning socialism; it is a theoretical manifestation of modern Chinese socialist development law. The participants were very much interested in discussing the scientific system of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. They had this consensus view: The theory that socialism is in the initial period is the basis of this theoretical system. The productive forces criterion and the three favorable's are the main theme of this system. The socialist market economy is something newly developed by this system. Emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts are the essence of this system. "One central task, two basic points" are the core and specific manifestation of this system. The participants also unanimously pointed out: The 14th CPC National Congress report has summed up Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in nine points, and has comprehensively and systematically expounded the basic ideas and basic views of this theory. This is very important for us in thoroughly understanding this theory and its scientific system. The theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is an organic scientific system comprising a series of viewpoints and principles. Only by completely and accurately studying and understanding it can we truly master its essence. 3. Seriously Studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Thought on Army Building in the New Period and Building the Army Into a Modernized, Regularized, and Revolutionary Army Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the general architect of China's reform, opening up, and modernization. He is also the general architect of Army building in the new period. Through discussions, the participants further understood that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on Army building in the new period has inherited the fundamental point of Mao Zedong's military thinking. On the other hand, this thought also has put forward a number of new viewpoints. One of its basic points is that the Chinese Army must focus on modernization; comprehensively carry out revolutionization, modernization, and regularization; build the Army into a fine army with Chinese characteristics; improve China's national defense capacity; and provide a powerful guarantee of safety for China's reform, opening up, and economic construction. Many participating comrades pointed out: We should study and implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on Army building in light of the actual conditions of our armed forces units, maintain a "firm grip" on the central task of modernization, and speed up our Army building and reform. Efforts should be made to improve the quality of our Army. Education and training should be put in a strategic position. Strict training should be given to the armed forces according to actual combat, so as to improve their combat effectiveness. Comrades present at the seminar also profoundly discussed how to strengthen and improve the Army's ideological work under the conditions of the socialist market economy. Following the development of China's reform and opening up and the establishment of the socialist market economy structure, interest relations are being adjusted, causing a profound change in the concept of value, in standards of conduct, and in life-styles. Thus we are required to inherit and develop the Army's fine tradition of ideological and political work, to cope with the development of the era, and to strengthen and improve the Army's ideological and political work. It is necessary to correctly appraise the positive influence of the socialist market economy on officers' and soldiers' minds, to pay attention to this main aspect, and to turn disadvantages into advantages. It is necessary to propagate the "five kinds of spirit" initiated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the "64-character enterprising spirit" summed by General Secretary Jiang Zemin, so as to encourage officers and soldiers to cultivate a correct concept of life, a correct concept of value, and the spirit of selfless dedication, and to resolutely resist money worship, pleasure seeking, and extreme individualism. It is necessary to meet the Army's demand for modernization, as well as the officers' and soldiers' demands for knowledge; to make ideological and political work permeate education and training; to improve the Army's scientific and cultural quality; and to strengthen its coherent force and combat effectiveness. We should be good at resolving ideological and actual problems; really care for cadres' and soldiers' study, training, work, and lives; and carry out profound, meticulous, and down-to-earth ideological and political work. In short, ideological and political work is the fine tradition and unique strong point of our Army. As long as we use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his thought on Army building to arm the minds of cadres and soldiers throughout the armed forces, work in a down-to-earth manner, make bold explorations, and are good at summing up experience, we will be able to blaze a new trail in the Army's ideological and political work, and in its modernization drive.
