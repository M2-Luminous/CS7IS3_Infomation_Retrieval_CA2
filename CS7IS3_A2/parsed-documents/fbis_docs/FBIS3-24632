Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-O2FEB94-CHINA-UK-HONG KONG Beijing Renews Threats of Economic Reprisals Intensifying its ongoing effort to force the British Government to change its stance on Hong Kong, Beijing returned to specifically threatening economic reprisals against British companies unless London withdraws its support for Hong Kong Governor Christopher Patten's political reform program which was submitted to the Hong Kong legislature (Legco) in December 1993. This hard-line stance was most authoritatively expressed by Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation (MOFTEC), who warned at a press conference on 28 January that the British Government's "uncooperative attitude" on Hong Kong "is likely to affect (yingxiang) Sino-British trade ties?? (Xinhua, 28 January). In addition to Wu, other Chinese officials have also recently gone on record as warning London of the negative economic consequences of supporting Patten. According to Beijing's English-language paper China Daily, Tong Jiemin, deputy director general of MOFTEC's European affairs department, said that "bilateral economic and trade relations can hardly escape damage from an uncooperative and unfriendly Britain" (16-22 January). Similarly, Lu Ping--the State Council's director-general of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office--was reported by the PRC-owned Hong Kong daily Ta Kung Pao of 18 January as telling a group of Hong Kong businessmen that Britain, because of its stance on Hong Kong, "is now falling far behind" France and Germany in gaining access to China's "huge potential market." Beijing's most recent explicit warnings to London on economic reprisals contrast with the previous circumspect ion evident in Premier Li Peng's remarks in mid-December just prior to the submission of Patten's partial reform bill to Legco. At that time, Li had implied that Beijing was contemplating retaliatory measures--possibly including economic reprisals--if Patten submitted his reform bill, stating that "frankly speaking, it is hard to say that the unfriendly, uncooperative attitude of the British" will not "affect" bilateral relations in "other fields" (Beijing radio, 11 December 1993). Chinese leaders were last observed to specifically threaten British firms with economic reprisals in late March 1993 when Li warned that Beijing planned to retaliate against British firms unless London withdrew its support for Patten's proposals. PRC media subsequently portrayed Chinese officials as backing away from such hard-line threats of punitive economic measures against British investors. (AUTHOR: SIMON.
