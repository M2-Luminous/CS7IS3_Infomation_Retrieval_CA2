The two documents published below were adopted: the resolution of the scientific and practical seminar, ``Current State and Prospects for the Development of Computing Equipment in Ukraine,'' and ``Main Points of State Scientific and Technical Policy in the Area of the Development of Computing Equipment in Ukraine.'' Resolution of the scientific and practical seminar ``Current State and Prospects for the Development of Computing Equipment in Ukraine'' Having discussed the problems associated with the current state and development of computing equipment in Ukraine, the scientific and practical seminar considers it expedient: 1. To create in Ukraine a national profit-making industry for computing equipment and micro-electronics as the basis for implementation of the top priority state directive ``Promising Information Technologies, Complex Automat ion Devices, and Communication Systems'' (Resolution No. 2705-XII of the Supreme Council of Ukraine dated 16 October 1992). 2. To support Resolution No. 61 of the Presidium of the ASU dated 3 March 1993 and the resolution of the Interdepartmental Conference of 19 March 1993 on problems of informatization in Ukraine regarding the development of the ``Concept of Informatization of Ukrainian Society'' and the creation to this end of the Interdepartmental Council on Informatization. 3. For the State Committee on Science and Technologies, the ASU, the Ministry of the Economy and the Ministry of the Machine Industry to develop the ``Concept of the Development of Computing Equipment in Ukraine'' and to submit it for the approva l of the Cabinet of Ministers.

The Ministry of the Machine Industry: - analyze the state of scientific and technical, as well as industrial and technical potential of various computing equipment subdivisions, including the provision of components; - analyze existing comprehensive branchwide computing equipment, telecommunications, automation, and micro-electronic projects, including the provision of an elemental base, and components, including imported components; - develop proposals for advanced development of domestic micro-electronics and electric radio components as a basis for the development of all electronic ma chine building, including resolution of the problem of providing and putting into production two submicron technology modules (in Ivanovo-Frankovsk and Borispol); - develop proposals to create joint ventures and strengthen ties with near and distant foreign countries. 5. For the State Standards organization, the Ministry of the Machine Industry and the ASU to develop proposals to create a single state system of standards, unification, and certification of computing equipment (both foreign and domestic) in accordance with world practice. 6. To send representatives of Ukraine to international organizations that are undertaking standardization of computing equipment and information science, as well as to other international organizations. 7. For the Ministry of Education, with the ASU, to analyze the training of personnel and to develop proposals to improve the training system for the creation and use of computing equipment (including microelectronics) as well as to create an infrastructure of instruction on the basics of information science and computer technology for numerous levels of the society. 8. For the heads of the Scientific Research and Design Institute, the Ministry of the Economy, the Institute of Cybernetics of the ASU, the Ukrainian Scientific Research Institute for Scientific and Technical Information, the Print Scientific Production Association, and others to conduct an annual analysis of the state and trends for the development of computing equipment and informatization in Ukraine as compared with leading foreign countries and to formulate conclusions and recommendations and submit them to interested ministries, departments, and organizations. 9. For the State Committee on Science and Technologies of Ukraine and the ASU (the Institute of Software Systems of the ASU) to examine the possibility of founding and organizing a regular periodical publication on the software industry in Ukraine. 10. In order to economically spend state budget resources and create state centers for highly scientific advanced technologies, to ask the Ministry of the Machine Industry and the Ministry of Defense to submit to the Cabinet of Ministers proposals on the allotment of targeted funding to buy licenses and technologies: - the production of printed circuit boards ; - assembly line production of printed circuit boards; - design and manufacture of software tools; - production of cathode-ray tubes; - production of hard disk drives; - laser printers. 11. In order to produce computing equipment at the current technical level (instead of buying computers ready to use) and to save monetary resources, to ask the Ministry of the Machine Industry and the Ministry of Finance to submit to the Cabinet of Ministers proposals for the allocation of targeted funding for purchase in 1993 of: - microprocessor assemblies; - high-capacity memory microcircuits; - high-cap acity hard disk drives; - components of computers and workstations; - licenses for software. 12. In order to economically spend state budget resources, to ask the Ministry of the Machine Industry to resolve the problems of producing RU7 and RU9 high- capacity memory microcircuits in Ukraine (at the Kvazar or Rodon plants), which would enable Ukrainian computer manufacturing enterprises to provide their own elemental base at a European level. 13. It is considered expedient to conduct regular scientific and practical seminars on computing equipment. To ask the Elektronmash computer production ass ociation to expand (in an established order) the materials of the scientific and practical seminar. ``Main Points of State Scientific and Technical Policy in the Area of the Development of Computing Equipment in Ukraine.'' This document was developed in the process of composing the ``Concepts of the Development of Computing Equipment in Ukraine'' (version 2-92) which was included in the draft ``Concepts of the Rapid Development of the Machine Building Industry of Ukraine ( decree No. 32 of the State Committee on Science and Technologies dated 17 Jun 92) as part of the section titled ``Instrument Building.'' '' The general governmental significance of the computing equipment subdivision was affirmed by resolution No. 2705-XII of the Supreme Council of Ukraine dated 16 Oct 92, which defined ``promising information technologies, comprehensive automation devices, and communication systems'' as a top priority area of science and technology in Ukraine. The hardware and software base for this area is computing equipment and micro-electronics. The purpose of this document is to develop the foundations of state technical policy on the creation in Ukraine of a profit-making subdivision of computer equipment production. The materials of this document should be a component of the ``Concepts of Informatization of Ukrainian Society.'' This document was examined and approved by the interbranch scientific and practical seminar ``Current State and Prospects for the Development of Computing Equipment in Ukraine'' (Kiev, 17-18 May 1993, State Committee on Science and Technologies, ASU, Ministry of the Machine Industry, Ministry of the Economy, and Ministry of Defense). A brief analysis of the state of development and production of computing equipment in Ukraine 1. When Ukraine was part of the former USSR it entered into a collaboration with a number of republics (Russia, Ukraine, Belorus, Lithuania, and others) including organizations and enterprises comprising the union computing equipment industry. The production of computing equipment was mainly divided among three ministries: The Ministry of Radio Industry, the Ministry of Instruments, and the Ministry of Industrial Communication. There was a territorial specialization in which Ukrainian organizations and enterprises concentrated on small computers (the SM computer), control computers, and peripherals and subcomplexes for the SM and YeS computer (the Elektronmash KPO [expansion not given], Impuls scientific production association, Khartron scientific production association, the Scientific Research Institute of Microdevices, the Kvazar joint venture, the Print Scientific Research Institute, the Magnit joint venture, the Infrakon Central Scientific Research Institute, etc). In the last 3-4 years Ukraine has also developed a line of low-performance personal computers (consumer and educational computers, etc.). The ASU (Cybernetic Center, IPRI, IPME , etc.) have been engaged in basic and applied research while participating in union projects to develop large specialized computers and professional personal computers (the YeS 1800 series) for general industrial and special use. The teams at these organizations are now the scientific-technical and industrial technological potential of Ukraine in computer equipment. However, due to former departmental separation, they have not formed an integrated s tructure organized for the production of consumer computer equipment. 2. The existing projects for the development and production of computing equipment in Ukraine make it possible to partially meet the needs of the domestic market and the CIS market for the following types of computing equipment: - controlling and measuring (real time) computing systems (PS series); - consumer and game computers; - laptops; - multiprocessor computers and special processors; - basic units of personal computers (of the Poisk-2 series); - terminals for digital communication networks; - telecommunications equipment (LAN equipment, computer communication via telephone and television channels, specialized input-output in banking systems,systems based on bar codes, etc.); - fiber optic communication line equipment; - PROM controllers, numerical programmable control units; - video terminals and collective use imaging devices; - devices for the input of graphic information (digitizers, scanners); - devices to output graphic information (plotters) - tools for interactive communication with a computer (mouse, joystick, etc.); - various types of printers; - hard disk drives; - floppy disk drives and floppy disks; - Kartridzh type magnetic tape drives and magnetic tapes; - service and auxiliary equipment. The cost of this equipment is a factor of 2-12 less than analogous foreign models (for acceptable technical specifications). In terms of the elemental base of micro-electronics, electronic radio components, and special materials, the percentage of computing equipment supplied domestic ally is on average 10- 12%. By comparison, the figure for Western Europe is 30-40%. After a long drop in computing equipment production (1990 to the first half of 1992), an almost complete cessation of work to develop new products, and suspension of experimental production and mass production enterprises, a definite rejuvenation has been noted. A number of targeted comprehensive programs have been developed and are in operation, including: - ``The Target Comprehensive Program To Develop Computing Equipment in Ukraine in 1992-1995'' (State Defense Industry of Machines, Elektronmash KPO, March 1992 ); - ``Competitive Computing Equipment To Solve the Problems of the Informatization of Ukraine (State Committee of Science and Technologies and the ASU, 1991-1993)''; - ``Target Program To Develop High-Performance Computing Equipment in Ukraine in 1993-1997'' (Ministry of the Machine Industry, 1993); - ``Ukrainian Program To Create and Start Mass Production of Network Hardware and Software Based on the MAP/TOP Protocol for Comprehensive Automation of Machine Building'' (State Defense Industry of Machines, Integral UNPTs [expansion not given], 1991); - Elektronika-93 (Ministry of the Machine Industry, Scientific Research Institute of Microdevices, 1993). Many claims have been made about these programs, but they are in any case providing some direction. More than fifty organizations of the ASU, Ministry of the Machine Industry, and other departments are participating in them. Moreover, more than a dozen computing equipment projects have been implemented as part of comprehensive programs in allied fields: instrument building, and in the sector of defense computing equipment. However, these minute changes in the computing equipment subdivision have not yet nullified the profoundly impaired macroprocesses that are hindering the development of the subdivision, which is evidenced by the following analysis of its grave condition. 3. Analysis of the current state of research and development of computing equipment and the elemental base in Ukraine finds it in grave condition. Especially depressing indicators are: - the absence of a single state technical policy (program for development, standards, mechanisms for state regulation and attracting private firms and foreign investments). Such programs exist in many developed market economy countries in a range of national and international programs: PAFE (France), ALVEY (Great Britain), ESPIRIT (the European Community), and in Russia (National Programs on Electronics and Informatization); %the assortment of computing equipment produced in Ukraine is insufficient to support information technologies, not only in strategic areas (defense, energy, finance, transport, communications), but also in general use; %the low level of competitiveness on the world market and even in the markets of developing countries; the lack of a system of standards and certification of domestic and imported products; %a low level of self-sufficiency of the elemental base; %the low level o f self-sufficiency of basic system and application software; %the insufficient level of precision electronic and electro-mechanical technologies; %the absence of experience and technologies for mass production of precision electro-mechanical devices , not only for computing equipment, but also for similar products (for example, there is no clock factory in Ukraine); %the weak development of software tools (CAD) to design VLSI, computing equipment, and software; %a massive drain of computing specialists to distant foreign counties and to other fields in Ukraine. This process is taking on an increasingly irreversible and catastrophic nature for the development of computing equipment. Factors defining the need to develop a domestic computing equipment subdivision Under these conditions a subdivision can arise, and trends for the reorientation of enterprises in the subdivision to another product have already begun, for example to consumer goods far from electronic machine building. The idea that Ukraine does not need its own computing equipment is being heard not only in the halls of well-known western firms present in Ukraine (IBM, DEC, SIEMENS, BASF, and others), but also at seminars in solid institutes and even state institutions involved in the management of science. Let us present some basic arguments for the need to strengthen and develop electronic machine building (computing equipment, communication, instrument building, etc.) in Ukraine. 1) Because the enterprises of basic areas of industry are lagging behind technologically, they are not competitive, and this makes it impossible in the near future to develop the exportation of products to hard currency zones, in order for Ukraine to buy all the Western equipment it needs. Ukraine does not have export supplies of valuable raw ma terials to provide for the annual purchase of 50,000 computers (75-100 million dollars). This is the only reason Ukraine is forced to independently provide for the main areas of human activity in the production of electronic machinery, including computers. 2) Ukraine, like the other republics of the former USSR, developed in a closed social, economic, and scientific production space for a long time. Outdated information technologies, methods and forms of representing and processing information were created, and a standards base (GOST, OST, etc.) was created which was stricter in some ways (for example, on the conditions of testing and use) than international standards. Thus, at present there is and will continue to before some time objective conditions limiting the widespread use of imported standard computing equipment in our real conditions. In many areas this is simply impossible (military equipment, automated control systems for technological processes in metallurgy, chemical processing, atomic energy, etc.). 3) In a number of areas of application (government, defense, the economy, finance, etc.) high requirements are placed on confidentiality and the protection of information, which is impossible to guarantee with imported computing equipment; 4) Enhancement of the defense capacity and its maintenance on a sufficient level in Ukraine (as an independent state outside the bloc) requires a high level of self-sufficiency of highly scientific defense equipment, primarily electronic equipment (including computers). These factors are sufficient to conclude that development in Ukraine of the electronic machine building field, including the building of computers, is a prime necessity. However, there are other factors which justify the technical, economic and social advantages of development of this sector of industry in Ukraine, including: - foreign experience shows that electronic machine building is the most profitable (and at the same time ecologically pure) field for states with limited natural resources, as is the case of Ukraine. In industrially developed countries, the last few decades have witnessed active restructuring of the economy due to a sharp increase in the rate of growth of industry in scientific areas. For example, in the US, since 1977 the average annual rate of increase of industrial production was 2.9%, and in scientific areas, 14%; - the development of the computing field for use in the difficult conditions of defense and a number of other industries creates the necessary infrastructure (scientific, technical, industrial, etc.) for the computer equipment industry and its elemental base, which makes it possible to create and develop a competitive consumer and industrial computing equipment industry with minimal material and labor costs; - the creation of a domestic computing equipment industry with a gradual increase in the level of competitiveness in the final analysis will substantially reduce hard currency expenditures in the state economy; - the domestic development of computing equipment stimulates the development of science and the overall intellectual potential of the country. Goals and the main points of state policy in the development of computing equipment 1. The main trend in state policy on the development, production, and use of computing equipment is creating a balance between meeting state interests in all areas of Ukrainian society and real resources, considering the need to preserve the scientific and industrial potential which exists in this field. The following are proposed as the main strategic line of development of computing equipment in Ukraine (1993-1996 and to the year 2000):--to create a profitable domestic computer equipment industry concentrated on the production of computing equipment, and systems based on this computing equipment, that are needed to provide for the primary goals of informatization of Ukraine;--to develop domestic computing software in the form of the State Open System of Computing Equipment (GOSVT-Ukraine, hereafter GOSVT-U) with a consideration of the following principles: - orientation of the assortment of hardware and software in GOSVT-U to complete compatibility with international standards; - the use of modular construction; - achievement of self-sufficiency in the elemental base of up to 40-50%; - maximum possible combination of the development and production of computing equipment for civilian and military use; 2. GOSVT-U should be the basic complex for state means of informatization, primarily in defense and security, government control, health, education, and welfare, taxation, the ecology, and other noncommercial areas of activity. Work to create and introduce GOSVT-U should mainly be financed by the government. Economic and legal mechanisms must be created to stimulate: - the expansion of the assortment of GOSVT-U modules to reduce the import of computing equipment into state information systems; - finding designs which reduce the assortment and/or amount of imported components; - producing GOSVT-U products which are competitive in the domestic and foreign markets. 3. Detailed analysis and the selection of primary trends for the development of computing equipment will be done by determining the assortment of equipment for GOSVT-U. However, the main guidelines for state policy in this area should be: - the creation of computing equipment and information technologies linked with the defense and security of the nation; - providing automation equipment to the country's most important technical facilities (energy, metallurgy, agriculture, ecology, etc.); - production of profitable competitive products; - the creation of computing equipment in high demand (preferably with a high degree of domestic labor in the production of these products); - the presence of experience and real stockpiles of computing equipment; - primary provision of state control, fundamental scientific research and work related to urgent social needs of society. 4. World experience has shown that a full computing equipment self-sufficiency level (80-90%) can only be reached by developed and wealthy nations such as the U S, Japan, and Western Europe (as a whole). However, the technical and economic advantage of international division of specializations holds them to a level of self-sufficiency of no greater than 70%. Less wealthy nations (Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy) are at a 40-50% level. However, the overall level of informatization of these countries is extremely high. Ukraine may reach a self-sufficiency level of 30-40% in the next 3-5 years. To determine the balance of production of domestic and purchase of imported computing equipment (bought from the West and the CIS, namely Russia and Belorus) it is expedient to consider the following recommendations on the main trends of informatization with computing equipment: Purchased advanced foreignequipment Domestic equipment using based on current platfo rms mass-produced computing equipment (workstations, supercomputers, etc.) and equipment for state use 1. High level of professional use in 1. Automation of routine tasks, information science (CAD, CASE, etc.) office work, and in other areas household equipment, etc. 2. Higher specialized education 2. Intermediate and preschool education 3. Flexible automated production robot 3. Automation of basic areas factories, numerical programmable of industry energy, metallurgy, control, etc. machine building, etc. 4. State control of high-level and 4. Systems at the administrative- financial-banking systems with all regional level types of protectio n 5. Special low-level systems with all 5. Special strategic systems types of protection Consequently, the path of providing Ukraine with computing equipment in the next 3-5 years can be represented as follows: a) fostering domestic development and production of defense equipment (all types) and civilian equipment intended to meet the needs for computer equipment in terms of mass informatization based on GOSVT-U, including: basic components of personal computers of low and intermediate performance levels, individual models of micro-computers and small computers, equipment for automated control and measurement systems and general-purpose computing equipment; a basic set of peripherals and media for them; PROM controllers, telecommunication equipment for collective use; computer and game computers, equipment for digital communication networks; consumer micro-electronics; services for the use and repair of the entire assortment of computing equipment (domestic and import); b) creation of joint ventures with advanced firms in the CIS and the West in the production of computing equipment needed for promising areas of informatization, including general-purpose supercomputers, personal computers and workstations, central communication network equipment, and software for it; production of basic components for this equipment with subsequent ``Ukrainization'' of the production of these parts due to accelerated development of analogous domestic production; c) purchase of computing equipment for a single use: unique supercomputers and peripherals, licenses for the use of the necessary software, and high- performance micro-processors and their frameworks; d) provision of preferential conditions for conducting fundamental and applied research and scientific research and design work to create promising original computing equipment with no foreign analogs, as well as competitive types of computing equipment for which research and development is ongoing abroad. 5. Mechanisms to implement computing equipment development programs in Ukraine should take the following basic measures: - restructuring of scientific and industrial potential and the state system of control of these facilities to create a single computing equipment production complex; - creation, based on state and commercial enterprises and organizations in Ukraine, of a number of corporations (concerns, associat ions, technopolises, or other progressive organizational forms), which unite the producers and developers of computing equipment and all technological gamut from scientific research to the production of computing equipment and the elemental base, technological equipment, services, etc.; - provision of financing of the development of GOSVT-U from the state budget, extensive bank credit, customer funds, the budgets of local and regional agencies, etc.; - development of primary standards documents in the Supreme Council and Council of Ministers of Ukraine needed for the development of domestic computing equi pment, including standards to regulate the import of computing equipment and advanced technologies, guarantees of foreign investments, and investors' rights; - creation of joint ventures (primarily for components and materials) with near and distant foreign countries; - creation of a network of support centers for scientific technologies; - advanced development of th e elemental base of computing equipment (microelectronics, electronic radio components, instrument electromechanics, information media, etc.); purchase of licenses for products which define the technical level of computing equipment (microprocessors, memory, cathode ray tubes, lasers, hard disks, etc.); - organization of a network of certification centers for computing equipment; - creation of service systems for computer equipment; - creation of a software industry; - unification of programs for the development of military and civilian computing equipment in order to efficiently use scientific and technical and industrial potential. 6. Further details on the technical policy and development of the Concepts of the Development of Computing Equipment require advanced development of the Concepts of the Informatization of Ukrainian Society, especially in the area of determining the assortment of priority information technologies and systems needed, including the basic requirements on the specifications of hardware and software.
