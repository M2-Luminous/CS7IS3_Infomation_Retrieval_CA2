The mainland co-convenor of the sub-group, Professor Xiao Weiyun, said after it met yesterday that there was no way for the Chinese and British Governments to discuss the appointments of principal officials for the first SAR government following the collapse of the Sino-British talks on political reform. "Under such circumstances, there won't be any talks on the civil service as the talks on the Legislative Council electoral arrangements have broken down," he said. The statement came despite repeated calls by Governor Chris Patten and Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang for China to discuss with the British side the through-train arrangements of principal officials. The decision is set to add further to uncertainty in the civil service, where many senior and middle- ranking officials already feel anxious about their future. Some officials privately are understood to be worried that China may set up a "second stove" for the civil service and allow only officials who have toed Beijing's line to serve after 1997. The Governor's spokesman, Mike Hanson, said last night he was not prepared to comment on PWC meetings. But in Beijing, Professor Xiao said the chief executive-designate of the SAR would name candidates for the positions of principal officials before the changeover to ensure that the SAR government could be formed on July 1, 1997. The precise timing of nominations had yet to be discussed, he said, but suggested the search for the right people could take some time. "It may take three months, six months, or 12 months," he said. The political sub-group decided in its previous session that the chief executive-designate could be named as early as 1996 when the Preparatory Committee for the SAR would be in place. Although the PWC said China should refuse to talk to Britain on the transition of the civil service, Professor Xiao stressed that committee members hoped that most civil servants would stay beyond the changeover. Before the souring of Sino-British relations there had been on the British side an understanding that Britain could consult with China to draw up a list of senior civil service officials to serve beyond 1997. The list would then be taken by the chief executive who would nominate the candidates and report to the central government for appointments. But the latest position as spelt out by the PWC would mean that the chief executive, who will be appointed by the central Government, could choose the senior officials on his own. However, PWC member Lau Siu-kai said it was unlikely that there would be a major reshuffle among the key government officials after 1997. "The number of potential candidates to be major government officials is small. There won't be much choice for the chief executive-designate," he said. Defending the PWC's position, Professor Xiao insisted that the Basic Law did not allow for any consultation with Britain on the through-train for civil service officials. The line-up for the SAR government officials should be decided in accordance with the Basic Law. The Hong Kong co-convenor of the sub-group, Leung Chun-ying, said that there was no way for China to discuss possible candidates with Britain until the chief executive-designate was named. The political sub-group also decided that to ensure a smooth transition in the civil service, China would invite the entire civil service to indicate before 1997 their willingness to stay in the service after the changeover. Quoting Article 100 of the Basic Law, Professor Xiao said public servants in the pre-1997 government might all remain after 1997.
