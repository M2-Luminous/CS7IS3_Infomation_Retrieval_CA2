This poll was conducted with the methodology of simulated vote-casting [votacion simulada] applied to a random sample of 5,479 eligible voters chosen among the group that is most likely to vote nationwide. These subjects used ballots similar to the ones that will be used on the 8 May presidential and mayoral elections. The nationwide poll was conducted by province between 30 April and 3 May 1994. In order to guarantee the accuracy of the information, a pilot poll was implemented on 29 April. This poll was carried out in the homes of persons who interviewed face to face with the pollsters, and had an estimated 3-percent margin of error. In addition to electoral preferences for president, this poll measured people's sympathy toward candidates for mayor in the municipalities of Panama and San Miguelito, and the political parties nominating the various candidates for these positions. Perez Balladares received the highest support rating in Panama Province -- 35.3 percent of those polled, and 31.1 percent in the rest of the country. Subjects ranging from ages 30 to 39 (36.3 percent) make up his support base. Meanwhile, Blades received support from 28.5 percent of those polled in Panama Province vis-a-vis 19 percent in the rest of the country. The age group backing Blades' presidential candidacy is that made up of 18 through 29 year-olds (33 percent). On 2 May, Blades concluded his electoral campaign with a concert staged outside the Rommel Fernandez Arena in Juan Diaz, while Perez Balladares will conclude his campaign today with a rally scheduled for this afternoon in the 5 May Plaza.
