According to Minister Olechowski, a delay in signing the agreements had been caused by weak economic contacts, with which neither side is satisfied. According to Minister Daskalov, the creation of a legal base will give businessmen of both countries a feeling of security and will increase the scope of mutual investments. He said that, next year, Polish-Bulgarian talks might begin on setting up a free trade zone, when negotiations on Bulgaria's membership in GATT will be completed and the issue of Bulgaria's debts to Poland will be resolved (Bulgaria owes Poland 207 million transfer rubles). The Bulgarian minister announced that it was decided during the talks how to resolve a dispute between both states concerning the localization of the Polish culture and information center in Sofia. International issues were also discussed, including the aspirations of both states to the European Union and the situation in former Yugoslavia. The war there not only poses threats to Bulgaria's security but is also causing great economic losses. Daskalow announced that he invited Andrzej Olechowski to pay a visit to Bulgaria.
