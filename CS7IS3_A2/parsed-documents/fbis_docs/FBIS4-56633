They all, however, lauded the steps taken. On 3 May, Chilean Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat and U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor agreed in Washington to hold preliminary talks by late May and formal negotiations tentatively by mid-September. [passage omitted] Senator Sebastian Pinera of the rightist National Renewal Party (RN) said the step taken is positive, "and we now expect the United States to sit at the negotiating table and make it come true." Pinera noted: "There have been many words but few accomplishments," adding that "four years have passed since (former) President George Bush promised Chile would follow Mexico." Juan Salazar, director of economic relations at the Foreign Ministry, expressed greater optimism, stating that "Chile is prepared" to start negotiations because it meets the requirements set by the U.S. Government concerning trade agreements. Salazar added that he believes there is a somewhat unjustified alarm in Chile about the U.S. requirements because the two countries already engaged in consultations and exchanged views on legislation, trade procedures, and the degree of economic opening. In remarks to the newspaper LA NACION, Salazar said: "Chile is at quite an advanced stage in these areas. This is why the United States puts us in first place."
