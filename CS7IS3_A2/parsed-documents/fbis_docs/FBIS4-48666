A special United Nations envoy was meanwhile expected to fly into Kigali from the Ugandan capital Kampala on Tuesday after a dispute with the mainly Tutsi rebels about the planned deployment of 5,500 peacekeepers to staunch ethnic bloodletting in which up to half a million people have been butchered. The envoy, Iqbal Riza, postponed his trip to Kigali on Monday because he said neither rebels nor government forces could guarantee his security. The Army has since promised not to shoot down Riza's plane, and rebels who captured Kigali Airport Sunday have also pledged to hold their fire, UN spokesman Abdul Kabia said. The UN has asked the Army and rebels to extend a shaky two-day truce that began Monday when Riza arrived in northern Rwanda until Wednesday at six p.m. (1600 GMT). Both sides were to respond later Tuesday, Kabia said. Riza held "inconclusive" discussions about the return of UN troops to Rwanda with leaders of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) in their northern stronghold of Mulindi on Monday, Kabia said. "There was a disagreement over the size of the force," he said. The rebels want a maximum of 2,500 UN troops because they fear that 5,500 soldiers could intervene in fighting between the RPF and the Army though intervention is not part of its essentially humanitarian mandate, Kabia said. Relief officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said thousands of people were streaming out of Kigali in a desperate scramble for safety before the rebels seize control of the capital. UN military officials expect the rebels to take over "within a week."
