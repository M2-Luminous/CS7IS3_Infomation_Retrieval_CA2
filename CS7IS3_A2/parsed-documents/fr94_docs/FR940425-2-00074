Purpose Section 748 authorizes the award of grants for planning, developing, operating or participating in approved residency training programs which emphasize the training for the practice of general internal medicine or general pediatrics. In addition, section 748 authorizes assistance in meeting the cost of supporting residents who are in need thereof, who are participants in any such program, and who plan to specialize or work in the practice of general internal medicine or general pediatrics. A separate grant program is in effect for the faculty development component of this provision. In addition, section 748 now authorizes grants or contracts to support predoctoral training in general internal medicine and general pediatrics. Statutory General Funding Preference As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_ (A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or (B) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile of applications that have been recommended for approval by the peer review group.
