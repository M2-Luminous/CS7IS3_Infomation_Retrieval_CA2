After warnings by the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] units stationed in the Republic of Macedonia, that an increased movement of military units is noticed on the other side of the Macedonian-Serbian border, the sources, which asked to remain anonymous, said that the fact of the matter is a regular filling of the border watchtowers with additional reserve soldiers. According to the new organization of the military in rump Yugoslavia, which now massively and actively includes reserve officers, the border units are made up of regular and reserve soldiers. "The increased movement of soldiers along the border objects is owed to the regular replacement of the reserve soldiers," the sources claim, adding that "it is in no way a case of some unusual concentration of armed forces due to military exercises or maneuvers."
