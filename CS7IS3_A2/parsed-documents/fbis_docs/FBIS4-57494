FBIS4-57494 "drlat098__a94005" FBIS-LAT-94-098-A Daily Report 19 May 1994 ANNEX Brazil Court Rulings Block Sarney's Presidential Nomination Court Rulings Block Sarney's Presidential Nomination PY2005030294 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 19 May 94 p 5 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY2005030294 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Portuguese BFN [Excerpts] Former President Jose Sarney was defeated twice on 18 May at the Federal Supreme Court [STF]. By a 10-1 vote, the STF first turned down a petition filed by the Social Christian Party [PSC] requesting an extension of the period in which a prospective candidate can join the party for which he will be running. The STF thus dismissed the PSC contention that the deadlines established by the electoral laws are unconstitutional. By a unanimous decision, the STF also ruled that incumbent senators are not, by virtue of their office alone, entitled to seek their party's nomination to any elective office at the party convention. As a result of those two rulings, Sarney will not be able to join another party to seek his presidential nomination. [passage omitted] Through his aides, Senator Sarney announced that he will not leave the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party [PMDB]. He has already decided, however, not to attend the PMDB convention scheduled for 22 May. He has concluded that the situation within the PMDB remains favorable to Orestes Quercia. Sarney is determined, however, to continue participating in the succession process, but he will only decide how he will do this within the next few days. [passage omitted] Sarney will wait for the Sao Paulo Superior Court ruling in Quercia's case before deciding to support the presidential candidacy of Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso (Brazilian Social Democracy Party). Quercia is facing charges of fraud in connection with electronic equipment imported from Israel during the final stage of his tenure as Sao Paulo governor. [passage omitted]
