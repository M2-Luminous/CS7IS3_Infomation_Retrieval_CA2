I have provided Samdech Chea Sim, Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, and Samdech Hun Sen with the choice of the following two formulas: In my opinion, the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] headed by yourself could be satisfied with the PDK delegation's residence in the Royal Palace near the Khemarin hall, which is presently occupied by His Excellency and Madam Khek Sisoda and Chinese doctors, who have agreed to move out of the building; Or you want our roundtable meeting to be held in my residence at (Fang Sun-on) near Pyongyang in the DPRK. [as heard] 2. Samdech Chea Sim, Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, and Samdech Hun Sen have just given me an unanimous answer that: a. You will be staying in your office next to the Royal Palace, but outside the palace's perimeter. The three samdechs will guarantee 100 percent security for you and your PDK delegation during your stay in Phnom Penh for the round-table meeting. 3. The three samdechs object to your moving the roundtable meeting outside the Kingdom of Cambodia. As for myself, I am of the opinion that if you disagree with the three samdechs on any aspect of the above formulas or have a contradictory request, our roundtable could be held in the future. Somehow, should you agree with the above formulas proposed by the three samdechs, our roundtable would take place as scheduled at the Damnak Chan pavilion in the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh from 2 to 7 May 1994. Security guards to ensure security for you from Pochentong [Airport] to Phnom Penh and vice versa will be provided by the Kingdom of Cambodia's Royal Government. Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen, co-prime ministers of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC], will be in charge of guaranteeing the security of you and your delegation during your stay in Phnom Penh. Your Excellency, please accept my regards and deepest fidelity. [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk [Dated] Phnom Penh, 24 April 1994.
