The talks that took place on this occasion referred to the situation in Prijedor and Gorazde and to ways of improving the humanitarian situation in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. We agreed to make it possible for the people who wish to leave the territory of the Srpska republic to do so. We will provide the necessary security measures and guarantees. Those who wish to stay will be protected by the Serb authorities, Koljevic said after the talks. Koljevic also said that the representatives of the international organizations were told that the Serb authorities insist on the Serbs in Sarajevo, Tuzla, and central Bosnia being given the same treatment, including the right to leave Muslim-controlled territory, if they so wish. He added that the Srpska republic's authorities will discuss all possibilities for giving ICRC representatives access to Gorazde as soon as possible. The UN secretary general's envoy said that "this is not a time for dangerous military activities" and that "the most important thing is the protection of the Gorazde area." The ICRC representative said the agreement that was reached will "satisfy both sides and will provide the answer to the question of how to solve the situation in Prijedor." He also said that a number of "specific measures for improving the humanitarian situation in Gorazde" have been agreed and that the ICRC intends to send food and medicine there as soon as possible.
