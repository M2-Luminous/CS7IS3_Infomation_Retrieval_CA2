V. Sokolovskiy, Atmospheric Physics Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 551.501.7] [Abstract] A computation experiment was carried out for retrieving geopotential and temperature by the Abelian inversion method using meteorological field series from the data archives of the ECHAM global model of general circulation of the atmosphere. Numerical simulation was carried out for the geopotential, temperature and humidity fields stipulated in a standard Gaussian grid with a horizontal resolution 1.125ï¿½ and with a vertical resolution of 19 levels in the altitude range from the surface to 35 km. An algorithm for solution of this problem is given. Results are presented for the distribution of the altitude of the 200-mbar surface and the error in its retrieval, as well as the temperature distribution at this level and the error in its retrieval. It is shown that the error in retrieving potential and temperature by the Abelian inversion method is greater where the horizontal nonuniformity of meteorological fields is greater. The maximum errors are about 30 m for geopotential and about 1 K for temperature. These errors indicate the possibility of using these data in weather and climate prediction problems. Program packages make it possible to proceed to the next step: numerical simulation of assimilation of the retrieved (with errors) geopotential and temperature fields in a model of general circulation of the atmosphere for the purpose of investigating the influence of retrieval errors on the prediction of meteorological fields.
