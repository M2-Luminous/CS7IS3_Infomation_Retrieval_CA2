It debuted with an essay of an advisory character by the board of editors published in issue No. 1/1993. The section has received an enthusiastic response from large numbers of leadership, management, and commanding cadres, and from theoreticians and scientific researchers of various sectors and levels at the center, in localities, and in the people's armed forces. By summing up realities in conjunction with carrying out theoretical research, the section has expressed numerous opinions, has conducted exchanges of experiences, has brought up issues, and has suggested solutions. Some of these opinions have been accepted and are gradually being introduced into life; some have considered on the occasion of the preparation for the Midterm Party Conference of Delegates; and some others call for further research and exchanges of opinions. The board of editors of TAP CHI QUOC PHONG TOAN DAN advocates continuing to expand this section of the journal in 1994 for the same set purposes[.sup]1[/], on the basis of the review of the initial steps of the socialist renovation process in general and the renovation of the task of defending the fatherland in particular as laid down by the midterm party conference of delegates and reflected later in various party resolutions and state positions and policies. To contribute to summing up the initial steps of the renovation process in the task of consolidating national defense and defending the fatherland, this article raises the following issues, which are also issues calling for continued research, exchanges of opinions, and suggestion of solutions in TAP CHI QUOC PHONG TOAN DAN this year. 1. Hostile forces' strategic thinking and our new concepts of the task of defending the fatherland. Monitoring the schemes and tricks used by imperialism to oppose and sabotage socialism in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, our country in the past, we can see that since the beginning of the 80's the strategic thinking of imperialism has changed. From resorting to armed violence combined with nonviolent tricks such as politics, psychological warfare, espionage... as the main way to oppose and sabotage us, imperialism has shifted to relying on tricks involving nonuse of armed violence such as politics, psychological warfare, espionage, economy, culture... as the main thrust, combining them with military deterrence and limited armed aggression, which may turn into war of aggression if an opportunity presents itself and if imperialism believes it can achieve victory within a short period of time. Other hostile forces have also strongly switched to different maneuvers, including the "soft war" trick combined with threat of armed violence and "hard war." Pursuing its "peaceful evolution" strategy, imperialism is feverishly and openly opposing and sabotaging the Vietnamese revolution by means of "free market economy" and "political pluralism-democracy-human rights" in various domains: economy, politics, theory and ideology, culture, art, way of life.... It is prepared to combine subversive rebellion of reactionary forces inside the country and military deterrence and armed aggression from abroad. An extremely dangerous thing is that imperialism is taking advantage of our renovation undertaking itself--which also advocates market economy, but one that is oriented toward socialism--and our broadening of socialist democracy in an attempt to divert our renovation process to capitalism. We can predict that, when the United States lifts the embargo, the enemy's scheme will be stepped up with new tricks--both subtle and glaring--through direct action or under the United Nations banner. Thus, danger will develop right in the opportunity created by the lifting of the embargo. Along with the hostile forces' activities are the destabilizing factors in our internal ranks that we should not ignore: Although our country has overcome the most difficult periods of the socioeconomic crisis, it still has not yet extricated itself from the crisis; although progress has been made in the implementation of democracy among the people, many limitations still remain; corruption and smuggling activities of some people in the state machinery are still serious, causing legitimate indignation among the people; contradictions among the people and religious and ethnic issues can easily be exploited by the enemy to incite public opinion; erroneous political tendencies in a number of circles.... All this combines to increase the dangers threatening the security of the country and of the socialist regime--dangers that lie hidden in many domains of social life. All these possibilities and contingencies have been correctly forecast in various party resolutions. The obvious question is that we must frustrate the "peaceful evolution" strategy and other schemes and tricks of the enemy in peacetime. At the same time we must be prepared to cope with all limited armed aggressions and even with wars of aggression. We do not exaggerate the danger of war of aggression, but we should not be subjective and off our guard. From the aforementioned situation and considering the characteristics and background of the current national struggle and class struggle, we can set forth a number of new concepts of national defense as follows: -- The security of the country; the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the nation; and the stability of the socialist regime depend chiefly and primarily on political stability, economic growth, and scientific and technological development. At the same time, they depend on our national defense and security potential, on the deterrent might of the people's army and people's armed forces, on the people's public security's capability to ensure political security and social order and safety, and on the people's vigilance. Therefore, to defend the fatherland we must concentrate on the task of economic development and national construction; at the same time, we must devoted ourselves to consolidating national defense and security. Developing the economy in accordance with the socialist orientation implies the defense of the regime and the fatherland, although national defense still has its own requirements and although we still have to combine economic development with national defense to make the people prosperous, the country powerful, and the society just, healthy, and civilized. -- Nowadays to defend the fatherland is to defend the socialist regime, a task closely linked with the defense of national independence and sovereignty and the state's territorial integrity (including the land area, the airspace, the sea, the continental shelf, and the exclusive economic zone); with the defense of the peaceful labor and the lives and property of the people; and with the defense of the national characteristics against both foreign aggressors and internal enemies. We should criticize the erroneous concept that although the socialist regime might collapse we could still have the necessary stability and confidence for building an independent, free, prosperous, and powerful Vietnamese fatherland. As past realities in the Soviet Union showed, if the socialist regime in Vietnam collapsed we can predict what Vietnam and its people would become in view of the schemes of the hostile and reactionary forces at home and abroad aimed at exploiting and provoking contradictions in our internal ranks. If that happened, could we have peace in order to make the people prosperous and the country powerful and to defend national sovereignty? -- National defense must be a general strategy in which national defense is closely combined with security and foreign relations; and even national defense, security, and foreign relations themselves must be closely combined with economic development and national construction in all respects. In this strategy, security and foreign relations would become increasingly important as attacking spearheads, while the army and national defense would serve as deterrent fists. For this reason, we must not make light of the role of the people's army and the people's armed forces. Only with sufficiently strong national defense potential and a sufficiently strong people's army will we be able to deter local and foreign hostile forces from engaging in adventurism, to ensure a peaceful environment for economic development and national construction, to create the basis for guaranteeing political security and social order and safety, and to secure the necessary position and strength for the conduct of foreign relations. This is not to mention the fact the army is also duty-bound to participate in ensuring political security, in economic building.... Building the all-people national defense, the people's army, and the people's armed forces is not an undertaking solely designed to prepare us for war; on the contrary, first and best of all it must be aimed at rolling back the danger of war, contributing to frustrating all enemy schemes in peacetime (peaceful evolution, subversive rebellion), consolidating peace, and, at the same time, creating greater potential in all domains so that we can stand ready to defeat wars of aggression in any situation. Generally speaking, that is the modern thinking on the task of defending the fatherland, which calls for the development of a modern model of national defense and the abandonment of the classical thinking on and model of national defense based solely on military forces, although in the modern thinking on national defense the role of armed violence is by no means eliminated; on the contrary, great importance must still be attached to this role. Thus, in the modern model of national defense not only modern weapons and equipment are mentioned, although appropriate modern weapons and equipment are still necessary. 2. Proceeding from the characteristics of the situation in our country, in the region, and in the world, we must thoroughly understand the revolutionary tasks, the socialist renovative line of the party in the national defense and military domains, and must actively build the all-people national defense system and the people's armed forces. The initial success of the renovation undertaking in the domains of military work, national defense consolidation, and armed forces building is primarily a success of the thorough understanding of the situation and tasks of the revolution and the socialist renovative line of the party. To determine the remaining problems in this domain as well as the directions to follow in resolving them, we should learn from the aforementioned lesson. And that lesson is none other than a thorough understanding of the Marxist viewpoint that the military must submit to politics and depend on socioeconomic conditions. Reality has shown that the situation and tasks of the revolution and the socialist renovative line in the economic and political domains have a substantial impact on the building of the all-people national defense system and the people's armed forces. We can cite here some characteristics that have the greatest influence: -- The peaceful situation, which is different from war, although this peace is not yet steady. -- National construction is the foremost task, a factor different from the past, when fighting was the primary task. Construction means that we must overcome backwardness and poverty, a task many times as difficult as the fight against imperialism and feudalism, as Uncle Ho used to say. -- Development of a multisectorial commodity-based economy and a socialist market economy and implementation of an open-door policy; this is different from the past, when a highly centralized, planned, and subsidy-based economy narrowly confined in the socialist system was in force. -- Meeting our own needs for weapons, equipment, and supply of materials for national defense and war; this is different from the past, when we relied on international aid. -- Building of a Vietnamese rule-of-law state of the people, by the people, and for the people under the Communist Party leadership; this is different from the past, when the party assumed many duties of the administration. -- New developments of the modern scientific and technological revolution in the world, which marks a new qualitative advance of human civilization and profoundly influences the economic and military affairs and all domains of social life of each nation and throughout the world. From the characteristics of the aforementioned situation and tasks, we can see that: We have much experience in war especially experience in war of liberation, mainly on the mainland and in the building of wartime armed forces. However, we still have little experience in consolidating national defense and in building peacetime armed forces. Naturally, we still have to pay utmost attention to the fact that peace is not yet steady and that there still are many unsettling factors. Worse still, we lack experience in building national defense and the armed forces on the basis of the socialist market economy and in the process of building a Vietnamese rule-of-law state under the Communist Party leadership. We are good at conducting all-people war but have little experience in building the all-people national defense system and in conducting war for national defense on land, in the air, and on the sea--our country can be called a "marine state" because its sea area is three times as large as its land area. Therefore, we are still unable to satisfactorily combine national defense with economic building and various aspects of national construction in which we should pay much attention to combining national defense activities with economic building on the sea. National defense building remains narrowly confined in many respects and is considered an exclusive duty of the Ministry of National Defense, the people's army, and the people's armed forces; this task has not yet been open to all society and has not yet really become an undertaking of all the people and all branches of the state from the central to the local level, especially the central level. We have not yet promptly made the most of the many achievements in the national renovation undertaking.... Some positions and policies of our party and state on national defense and army building have not yet been in harmony with the market economy and peacetime construction; the supply of materials and budget for this task has not yet been rationally ensured as permitted by the situation of the country. There still are hitches in the relationship between the party leadership and the state management. Party resolutions have not yet been institutionalized; many resolutions have not been implemented. To a certain degree the state still operates on its own initiative, on the basis of personal relations, and according to negotiated agreements. The problem here is that we must learn from and improve on past, diversified experiences and creatively apply them to the new conditions, situations, and tasks. We must overcome conservatism and empiricism while opposing dogmatism and the state of being divorced from reality in the past there had been some dogmatism and empiricism in emulating the socialist countries; now there may be dogmatism and empiricism in emulating the capitalist countries. We must overcome the remaining shortcomings and weaknesses and see to it that our entire political system, including the party, the state, and the mass organizations, really participate in further consolidating national defense and building the people's armed forces. This means that we must thoroughly understand the all-people national defense viewpoint in the conditions of the socialist renovation undertaking, and must pay greater attention to closely combining national construction with national defense. We must strengthen the party's centralized and unified leadership over the two strategic tasks of building and defending the fatherland, and over national defense and security work and foreign relations. We must institutionalize the party's decisions on national defense and security and on people's armed forces building; and must strengthen the state management of national defense work. All party and administrative organizations at the center and in localities, party groups, and party affairs committees of the various ministries, departments, services, and mass organizations at the center... must attach special importance to leading and managing the national defense task according to their functions and duties and must closely combine the two strategic tasks. The Conference on All-People National Defense Work held in November 1993 brought up and resolved numerous important issues such as opposing "peaceful evolution," educating party and state cadres and the people in national defense; building defense zones; building mobilization-ready reserve forces and preparing them for wartime mobilization; and building militia and self-defense forces. Obviously, these tasks can be accomplished only if there is an aggregate strength of the entire people under the party leadership and state management combined with broad mass movements. There is a major issue of national defense relating to the entire national construction task and bearing mostly on various ministries, departments, and services at the central level--an issue that needs to be settled--namely the question of combining national defense with economic development and other aspects of national construction and with investment in the building of national defense industry in order to strengthen economic potential and achieve political stability while strengthening national defense potential. Only on this basis will we be able to draw up accurate wartime mobilization plans, to maintain high combat readiness, and, when required by the situation, to turn the potential of the country and of the all-people national defense system into the strength of people's war for national defense. We all know that combining national construction with national defense is an element of the model of socialism in Vietnam, as reflected in the six characteristics and seven basic directions stated in the seventh party congress Political Program. Settlement of this relationship will have an impact on the entire national development process in general and on each aspect of economic building, national construction, and national defense in particular. This impact is evident and direct in areas such as the building of infrastructure, communications and transportation, roads, airfields, piers, post and telecommunications; in major, long-term economic plans and projects; in economic projects relating to foreign investment. As stated above, this problem has become more complicated in the conditions of the multisectorial economy operating in accordance with the market mechanism; this is different from the past, when there were only two economic sectors--the state and collective sectors--in the highly centralized planned economy. To satisfactorily carry out the tasks of economic building, national construction, and national defense, and to skillfully combine the two strategic tasks, party and state cadres and the mass organizations must have knowledge of military and national defense affairs and military cadres must have knowledge of economic and legal matters and other fields. We must institutionalize party decisions and strengthen the state management of national defense and armed forces building. -- We must determine in the Constitution and the law the national defense duty of all citizens, various economic sectors, production and business organizations, sociopolitical organizations, various ministries, departments, and services of the state at the center and in localities. -- We must have a national development strategy encompassing the economy, national defense, and other areas of construction, and combining the two strategic tasks, which include the national defense strategy or the national defense and security strategy. -- We must adopt major policies to ensure implementation of the national defense and armed forces building tasks. -- We must have an adequate budget; this budget must be reflected in the Law on State Budget and concretely determined in government plans and programs of action for each period of time (five-year and annual plans and programs). The national defense budget is not limited to the budget of the Ministry of National Defense but also includes the military budget contained in the general budget of various sectors at the center and in the budgets of various localities. -- The Ministry of National Defense must fulfill its functions as the principal state management organ in charge of national defense and as a capable staff of the party and other state services in national defense matters. The ministry must inspect the implementation of national defense tasks by various state services, localities, production and business units, economic sectors, social organizations, and citizens. -- The ministries, departments, and services at the center must have components (or specialists) in charge of monitoring national defense work in order to, first of all, satisfactorily fulfill their functions and duties in relation to the national defense task and, at the same time, to satisfactorily carry out the national defense task pertaining to their functions and duties. -- We must develop the mechanism of party leadership and state management in the field of national defense and armed forces building. Concerning the building of the people's army and the masses' armed forces in particular, we must do the following: As a result of our strategic adjustments, our military organization has now been radically turned into a peacetime military organization with its three categories of troops reshaped in accordance with peacetime conditions and with the market economy (they are different from the organization of the three categories of troops during wartime and in the highly centralized planned economy). The problem here is to enhance the quality of the people's army and of all the three categories of troops so that they can meet the demands of peacetime political and military tasks, have sufficient strength to deter hostile forces, and join the entire people in achieving victory in case of hostilities. To step up the building of the revolutionary, regular, well-trained, and gradually modernized people's army, we must basically renovate our thinking on building the people's army in peacetime and in the market economy, on the basis of applying and developing the principled experiences in building the revolutionary army and people's army over the past few decades. We must continue to carry out research on and determine the total troop strength and the rational relationship between the standing army and the reserves. We must renovate the organization of the forces of the three categories of troops, the armed branches and services, the rapid-reaction mobile force, the stationary force, and the militia and self-defense forces in the multisectorial economy. We must do research on combining the military draft system with the volunteer system and broaden the career soldier system. We must basically renovate the army building and army welfare policies and should not confuse the national defense policy with the social welfare policy. We must restore the image of Uncle Ho's soldiers and enhance the standing of the people's army and the officers corps on the social scale of value. We must satisfactorily meet the legitimate and reasonable material and spiritual needs of soldiers, officers, and their families when they are on active duty as well as after they have returned to civilian life. We must develop the people's army politically and build pure and strong basic party organizations in the army. We must provide the officers corps with college education in keeping with President Ho Chi Minh's concept of turning workers and peasants into intellectuals, and must develop a new model and set new targets for officer training according to the three levels of army officers. We must rearrange the military school system in the common training system of the state. We must adopt a policy aimed at attracting talents to serve in the army. We must acquire some new weapons and equipment in conjunction with using and maintaining the weapons and technical equipment currently available. We must improve the quality of military education and training, step up the building of the regular army and comprehensively strong units by stepping up research on military science and technology, on other social sciences, and on the humanities, and by combining practical review with theoretical research. We must improve the economic efficiency of the units engaged in production and economic building. We must enhance the combat readiness of various units, care for the material and spiritual life of cadres and soldiers, and build the army into a wholesome school of culture appealing to the youth. We must make army building a task really of the entire party and people and of all the political system so that it can fully benefit from the achievements in the renovation undertaking in terms of people, spirit, intellect, ethics, and material and technical base, with attention paid to the scientific and technological achievements in the gray area between people's livelihood and national defense. Cadres and soldiers of the people's army themselves must actively strive to fulfill all tasks entrusted by the party, the state, and the people in the national renovation undertaking to defend--and contribute to the building of--the socialist Vietnamese fatherland. In this way they will be making practical preparations for celebrating the 50th anniversary of the heroic Vietnam People's Army (December 1944-December 1994). Footnote 1.
