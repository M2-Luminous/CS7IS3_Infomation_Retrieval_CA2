Interviewed at Beijing Airport, Zhou Guangzhao said that the scientific and technological circles on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should further learn from each other's strong points to supplement their shortcomings in order to develop both sides' science, technology, and economies. [Zhou Guangzhau] "The delegation that visited Taiwan this time consisted of 25 members, including eight CAS academicians." Zhou Guangzhao said: The 25 members of the delegation, including experts from CAS, relevant universities, the General Iron and Steel Research Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and the China National Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation, as well as experts from a few domestic iron and steel corporations who are in charge of technology, took part in the conference on science, technology, and industry of both sides for 1994. At the conference, experts from both sides delivered many reports on iron and steel and materials and exchanged information in this area, touching especially on the prospects for cooperation in the field of rare earths. Zhou Guangzhao said: Scientific and technological experts from mainland China attended the conference at the invitation of Taiwan's Institute of Industrial Technology and iron and steel companies; they were warmly welcomed as compatriots by their counterparts in Taiwan; while in Taiwan, they visited the Taiwan Central Research Institute, the Taiwan Institute of Industrial Technology, the Iron and Steel Corporation in Gaoxiong, Taiwan's Qinghua University, Jiaotong University, the Xinzhu Science-Based Industrial Park, and the Palace Museum of Taiwan. Zhou Guangzhao noted: Mainland China's iron and steel output has topped 80 million metric tons, and further efforts will be made to expand production. In addition to expanding the output quantitatively, efforts will also be made to promote development qualitatively. He said: There has been notable development in Taiwan's iron and steel industry in recent years. Although the island's steel output is much lower than ours, their technology is more advanced. To bring about a massive development of the iron and steel industry in Mainland China in the future, we can invite Taiwan counterparts to participate in certain forms of cooperation, including cooperation in learning from the automated management system for the iron and steel industry developed by Taiwan. [Zhou]: "I think scientific and technological personnel from both sides are very enthusiastic about strengthening cross-strait scientific and technological cooperation." Zhou Guangzhou, president of CAS, said: Scientific and technological personnel from both sides of the strait are every enthusiastic about strengthening cross-strait scientific and technological cooperation. The Taiwan counterparts we have met have demonstrated great interest in expanding cross-strait cooperation. There are many problems in scientific and technological cooperation, however, that require further improvement. For example, we are all Chinese, and we all hope for the peaceful reunification of China. However, at present there is no direct air service. Actually, the flight time from Beijing to Taipei is less than two hours, but to go to Taipei, one must go through Hong Kong. Wang Fosong, vice president of CAS, had planned to go to Taiwan, but he was unable to go because of his status. Many people in Taiwan have expressed their dissatisfaction with this. I believe many obstacles will be overcome in the days to come. Zhou Guangzhao: First, we hope science and technology circles on both sides will strengthen cooperation and exchange in the area of personnel and information. In the future, both sides should cooperate in earnest. On the one hand they should cooperate in transforming scientific and technological achievements into productive forces and expanding the production of rare earths in China, which occupies an advantageous position in the world's rare earth resources. This is because Taiwan needs rare earth materials in developing its high technology. Taiwan can join us in making further studies on investing in the establishment of a rare earth joint venture enterprise. At present, science and technology circles of Mainland China and Taiwan are conducting further consultations on relevant projects for this year. Responsible persons from the Taiwan Institute of Industrial Technology will soon visit the mainland. It is expected that some agreements on cooperation projects may be concluded by the mainland and Taiwan. [Zhou]: "I had always wanted to visit Taiwan. I had also heard many stories from people who have visited Taiwan, but to go there in person is different from hearing from other people. I really felt as if we were one family. I felt the cordiality and the warmth. They gave us a warm reception." In conclusion, Zhou Guangzhao stressed: Through this visit to Taiwan we have gained some personal experience. Taiwan's science and technology circles have overcome difficulties, welcomed their counterparts from the mainland without a hitch, and successfully convened this beneficial conference. With actual deeds, they have expressed their strong desire to push for closer scientific and technological cooperation between both sides. Taiwan has made great progress in developing high technology, especially in the area of computers and microelectronic chips. Their methods of introducing new technologies, making use of them, and assimilating them are worth emulating by the mainland. Both the mainland and Taiwan have their strong points in developing science and technology. We should strengthen cooperation in this area.
