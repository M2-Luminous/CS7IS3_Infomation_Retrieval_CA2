The general attitude, it appears, was expressed by Leonid Polezhayev, the newly elected leader of the Siberian Agreement association and the head of administration of Omsk Oblast: "Gaydar left because the leadership of the country, 'and especially Yeltsin,' finally realized the need to rectify reform--first and foremost on questions of social protection and the revival of Russia's industrial production.'" It was the provincial chiefs who demanded changes in general policy from the government, proposing that the cabinet leadership itself look into "personnel support" of adjustments. As far as SEGODNYA knows, at the famous luncheon with Viktor Chernomyrdin, where the local bosses were being urged, nonetheless, to elect Vladimir Shumeyko speaker of the Federation Council, they refrained from being more precise about personally whose heads should fall as a result. Only Buryat Prime Minister Vladimir Saganov repeated his eternal refrain that "we will never achieve anything with this Fedorov." Now, even compliments can be heard following the reformers who left. Irkutsk Governor Yuriy Nozhikov and Viktor Ignatenko, the head of representative authority, think that "the government aircraft still should have two wings--both directorial and macroeconomic." But Vyacheslav Novikov, a Krasnoyarsk colleague of Mr. Ignatenko, even declared that "not to give money is a remarkable quality for a minister of finance, and Boris Fedorov had it." Now, the "fathers of remote places" are contentedly awaiting the material results of "adjustments in the direction of selective support of the regions and enterprises." In the words of Primorye Governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, 35 billion rubles [R] in fuel subsidies have already been transferred to the territory. Out of this, Valentin Dubinin, his deputy, distributed R5 billion to those rayons and cities where heating and water were starting to be cut off because of a shortage of fuel. Vyacheslav Novikov expressed the hope that a certain sum--"in the form of a credit or subsidy"--would be received quickly by power engineering specialists of Krasnoyarsk Kray, where because of nonpayments the miners of the Borodino open pit mines were threatening to stop dispatching coal. The oil workers of Western Siberia warned of the possibility of a strike--strike committees have already been established there in 12 oil and gas production associations. Yuriy Shafranik, the minister of the fuel and power industry, called for a sharp reduction yesterday in taxes for them, "inasmuch as the power engineering specialists who are delivering fuel despite the nonpayments are now actually engaged in interest-free extension of credits for the entire economy of Russia." The parliament of the Republic of Karelia Thursday resolved to try to get a substantial reduction in taxes from Moscow on profits for enterprises of Karelia. Sergey Yaskulov, its first vice prime minister, justifies this with the fact that "the volume of industrial production in Karelia amounts to 81 percent of the 1992 level, the differentiation in agricultural and industrial incomes has become too wide, and there is a noticeable worsening in the demographic situation." His colleague, Anatoliy Maksimov, sits in Moscow without budging from the place, lobbying for the demands of the region--but to the indignation of the leadership of the republic, "he has been unable to dislodge any kind of money up until now, even what is due northern Karelia." A coordinating council of Siberian Agreement on questions of conversion is supposed to convene Tuesday in Omsk. In the opinion of observers, it obviously intends to use the reorganization of the government to demand additional money from Moscow for the local VPK [military industrial complex]. It seems that the possibility of success among all of the enumerated regional lobbyists is rather high. Especially when it is considered that at a press conference Thursday, Viktor Chernomyrdin promised "immediately to settle up with the most pressing debts--first and foremost for wages, the VPK, the 'northerners,' and the agro-industrial complex." As for the agrarians, they will personally state their claims to the prime minister and to Aleksandr Zaveryukha, his deputy, and no later than Tuesday, when the leadership of 18 agricultural oblasts of central and southern Russia convene in Orel. As Aleksandr Mayorov, Orel deputy governor, declared to SEGODNYA, "They have still not paid us R10 billion for grain, and the situation is about the same in the rest of the oblasts." However, Mr. Zaveryukha, without waiting for the meeting in Orel, has already promised to settle up all agrarian debts in the sum of R1.3 trillion by the end of January. Against all of this background, it is rather difficult to understand the statement of the prime minister that "there is no kind of branch pressure." The pressure, which was clear even before Gaydar's and Fedorov's resignations from the government, is growing along the entire front with increased strength. And strong doubts exist that the cabinet will be able to cope with it, while remaining within the framework of "selective" additional feeding with meaningless money.
