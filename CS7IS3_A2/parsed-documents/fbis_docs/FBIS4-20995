Assistant Principal Commissioner II Hassan Mutalip, chief of the Kuala Lumpur Office of Criminal Investigation, said that during the police raid the police also seized a variety of heroin processing equipment and a large quantity of drugs. It is thought that the heroin seized weighed about 20 kg, including what had not yet been processed. When Assistant Principal Commissioner Hassan Mutalip met with reporters in Kuala Lumpur on 25 January, he said: "Earlier this afternoon at around 1300 a police detachment from the Capital Anti-Drug Branch raided a block of flats at Winner Court B in Petaling Village Center." "In the building police arrested two men and one woman in their 20's." "Also during the raid the police seized eight blocks of material containing heroin which had not yet been processed and a large quantity of processed heroin." Hassan said that the police believe that the flat which was raided was used by the men and the woman involved to process heroin there. However, he said, the police are still investigating to determine how long the men and the women were processing heroin there. According to him, the police are still interrogating the men and the woman who were arrested and will charge them under Section 39B of the Dangerous Substances Act of 1952, which carries the mandatory sentence of death by hanging if they are found guilty. It is thought that the men and woman who were arrested are members of a heroin distribution syndicate in the Lembah Klang area. It is believed that the men and the woman converted the flat into a heroin processing center because it was outside the more crowded, central area of Lembah Klang.
