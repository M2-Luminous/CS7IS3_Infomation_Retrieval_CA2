FR940607-0-00035 FR940607-0-00015 On May 2, 1994 the Supreme Court issued an opinion interpreting Section 3001(i) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 USC 6921(i). City of Chicago v. EDF, No. 92&hyph;1639 ( XX U.S. XX , decided May 2, 1994). The Court held that this provision does not exempt ash generated at resource recovery facilities burning household wastes and nonhazardous commercial wastes (hereafter ``waste-to-energy facilities'') from the hazardous waste requirements of Subtitle C of RCRA. The Court also held that Section 3001(i) terminated a 1980 regulatory exemption for ash generated at waste-to-energy facilities that burn only household wastes. The opinion requires EPA to revise its prior position that both types of ash were exempt from hazardous waste regulation. It abruptly ends nearly a decade of controversy over the regulatory status of ash from these facilities. As a result of this decision, ash from waste-to-energy facilities has the same status as other solid wastes. Persons who generate such wastes must determine whether that waste is a hazardous waste under EPA's hazardous waste identification rules at 40 CFR part 261. Since EPA has not listed ash as a hazardous waste, generators must determine whether ash exhibits any of the characteristics of hazardous waste at 40 CFR 261.21&hyph;.24. Ash that exhibits a characteristic must be managed in compliance with Subtitle C requirements. As explained below, the regulatory status of ash has been the subject of confusion for several years. EPA's action today responds by giving owners and operators of facilities that manage ash that is determined to be characteristically hazardous a reasonable opportunity to obtain interim status by applying for a RCRA hazardous waste permit. Without this opportunity, persons managing hazardous ash would be out of compliance with RCRA's permit requirements and face potentially significant civil and criminal penalties. In this notice EPA is also announcing that it will consider ash that is characteristically hazardous to be a ``newly identified'' waste under the land disposal restrictions. EPA needs time to determine what treatment standards would be appropriate. By considering such ash to be a newly identified waste under the land disposal restrictions, EPA will have an opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of the existing standards and, if necessary, develop new ash-specific standards. EPA notes that all other applicable Subtitle C regulations will apply to ash on the date that the Court's decision takes effect. See the discussion of state authorization below for assistance in determining when the Court's decision will affect particular facilities. The Agency interprets the Court's decision to cut-off the exemption for waste management at waste-to-energy facilities at the point that ash is generated. Subsequent management of hazardous ash on-site is subject to regulation under Subtitle C. B. Nature of Ash From Waste-to-Energy Facilities
