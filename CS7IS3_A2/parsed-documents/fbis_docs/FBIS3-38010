The NATO commander who prior to his appointment to a high post in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization headed the land forces in Britain, said he envied his colleague in Bosnia who had received such a powerful and well trained reinforcement. Speaking on the difficulties connected with the redisposition of the Russian blue helmets, John Waters noted that he knew that Russian commandos' training was passing in much more complex conditions, therefore he would rather be surprised if Russian soldiers and officers had not fulfilled their command's order. The British General highly appraised Russia's efforts aimed at settling the armed conflict in Bosnia and stressed that the NATO welcomed any step which would stop killing people. John Waters noted that air strikes, as the events in the Persian Gulf had shown, would have resulted in unjustified victims amongst the civil population. The general said that additional peacekeeping forces should be brought to the region of confrontation specifying that this problem should be resolved by politicians. The program of the NATO general's visit to Moscow which will last until February 26, includes his meetings with the leadership of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces and the commander-in-chief of the land forces. John Waters will also deliver several lectures on the theme "The NATO Bloc in a Stage of Transformation" to students and teachers of the Academy of the General Staff, and other institutions of the Russian Defense Ministry.
