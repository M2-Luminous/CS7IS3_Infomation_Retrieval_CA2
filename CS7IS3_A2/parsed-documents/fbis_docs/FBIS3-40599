At the same time, she revealed that Pakistan's nuclear program has been frozen since July 1990. She forgot that it was her government that ruled Pakistan at that time. The next day a government spokesman clarified that the program is frozen at the July 1990 level, but it was not frozen by the Benazir government. The government that followed her was responsible for this action. This government spokesman told a "group of newsmen" that Madam Bhutto did not say that the nuclear program was frozen in July 1990, instead it is frozen at the level it was in July 1990. The caretaker government appointed by Ghulam Ishaq Khan was responsible for it. (It should be remembered that this government was led by Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, who is special assistant to Madam Bhutto). Nawaz Sharif left this issue as it was. Now the nuclear program will not be left frozen as the situation has changed. Now the U.S. pressure is decreasing and Pakistan will be freed from the Pressler Amendment restriction without rolling back the nuclear program. At Madam Bhutto's statement, her main rival, Nawaz Sharif, reacted by saying that Madam Bhutto had admitted to her "crime" about freezing the program during her government. Now she was making compromises with the United States, and the nation will not allow her to do that. Nawaz Sharif said in a meeting in Lahore that, by appointing a man like Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali the foreign minister and a journalist like Maliha Lodhi the ambassador to the United States, Madam Bhutto had clearly hinted that she is ignoring Pakistan's interests. The whole nation listened to and read the feelings expressed by the prime minister and the former prime minister with great interest. Interestingly enough, both slipped while trying to push each other. Madam Bhutto did not remember that she was in power in July 1990. Now Nawaz Sharif forgot that Benazir's government was dismissed after July 1990, new elections were held, a new party called the IJI [Islami Jamhoori Ittehad] (coalition of some parties) came to power getting two-third majority, and the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] had failed to form government in any state. The man who won the crown to the prime ministership after this election was Nawaz Sharif. He headed the government from 1990 to the middle of 1993. The question arises: If Madam Bhutto had frozen the nuclear program, why did not Nawaz Sharif disclose this information when he was the prime minister? If this freeze was harmful, why did not he rectify the problem? Why did he not take the nation into confidence and expose all her actions at that time? We should also ask Madam Bhutto if Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi had frozen the nuclear program, and it was an inauspicious act (that is why she hesitates in accepting responsibility for it), then why did she make agreements with Khan and Jatoi? Why did she cooperate with them? Why did she let her representatives to become cabinet members during the caretaker government appointed by Mr. Khan? Why did she go as far as to let her husband be a minister? Why is Ghulam Mustafa her confidant now? Why did she go to his home and ask him to join her caravan? Can or should those who play with the nuclear program be given such revered positions? Madam Bhutto is saying that the nuclear program should not be made a political issue, and, at the same time, is using it as a staff to punish other people. She also wants to take the credit for protecting the nuclear program. At the same time, she is trying to convince the nation that the nuclear program is safer then ever in her hands. Unfortunately, Madam Bhutto has changed her stand on this matter so many times that we are not willing to consider her word on this issue to be firm. She has once said that the nuclear program was under the supervision of the president and the Army, and she did not know anything about it. Nawaz Sharif never announced such lack of authority; however, various members of his government had made some inferences about this issue. Therefore, we cannot say what plans he had for protecting the nuclear program, and what he did achieve in this area. We can argue in his defense that the United States did not reinstate aid of Pakistan during his tenure. It also spread rumors about declaring Pakistan a terrorist nation during that time. This U.S. attitude indicates that Nawaz Sharif did not bow down to the United States and refused to obey it. Some people even say that the United States has punished Nawaz Sharif for his arrogance, and did not stop until he was thrown out of the corridors of power at a time when he had the majority support in the National Assembly and the Supreme Court had decided that the presidential action against him was improper and illegal. Without discussing how much truth there is in this claim, we have to say that some mysterious circumstances surrounded Nawaz Sharif's fall from power. The nation has not found the reason for this action yet. Even when we ignore Nawaz Sharif's and Benazir Bhutto's statements, claims, and assurances, we still feel instead of making the nuclear program an excuse to accuse each other, they should explain what "freezing the program" means and what was its purpose is. Who was responsible for it? How much was our nation hurt by this action? The time for if, but, and because is past now, and neither you or anyone else can be fooled. Therefore, these efforts to dupe the nation should be stopped. The leaders of the government and the opposition should sit down together (the military leadership that ended the long march and assured new elections can arrange this) and instead of playing gulli-danda [Indian/Pakistani game] with it, make joint statements and present facts to the nation.
