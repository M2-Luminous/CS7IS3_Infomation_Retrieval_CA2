Speaking on television's "Sunrise" [Napkelte] program, Krisztina Dobos said they are now beginning to hold talks about this with the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP]. [FKGP Chairman] Jozsef Torgyan does not consider such an agreement to be impossible. According to the Smallholder chairman, as a matter of fact, differences so far have been between the party leaderships not the membership. Bela Csepe, outgoing leader of the Christian Democrats parliamentary group, said that if necessary the Christian Democrats will step back in favor of the MDF.
