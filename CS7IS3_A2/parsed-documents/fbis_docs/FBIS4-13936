This is absurd, especially in light of the fact that these people are responsible for returning everything and uprooting all Israeli presence in order to achieve peace. Do they believe that by some hocus pocus we will be able to achieve peace with another Arab country by exchanging peace for peace? Not even one iota of the Sinai has remained in our hands. I will do everything to avoid such a price for peace. [Israel Television in Arabic correspondent Menashe Bakhar] Are you preparing Israeli public opinion for painful concessions on the Golan Heights in the near future? [Rabin] Look, in the negotiations with Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon we are not talking about interim arrangements. The letter of invitation to the Madrid conference referred to an interim arrangement only in relation to the Palestinians. We are not looking for interim arrangements with the Arab states, but rather for peace treaties. We have very little territorial problems vis-a-vis Jordan and Lebanon. With Syria, on the other hand, we have such problems indeed. I have always said that I personally, and the Labor Party of which I am a member, are ready to make territorial compromises. We have always said so, but previously these statements were not concrete, because Syria was not prepared to enter peace negotiations. Syria has started evincing willingness to enter the path of negotiations only in the wake of the changes in the international balance of power, the termination of the Cold War, and following the Gulf crisis. Generally speaking, I can say that Arab parties enter peace negotiations with us only after they reach the conclusion that they can get nothing from us by violent measures, whether this means all-out war or terrorism. [Unidentified correspondent, in English] Regarding the talks in Cairo, there has been a lot of optimism about an agreement in early May. What new progress has been made, and what obstacles still lie ahead? [Rabin, in English] There is a progress in the negotiations in Cairo, less in Paris on the economic issues. Therefore I believe that we are moving ahead. We are trying to reach an agreement which is acceptable to us as soon as possible. But I would not set any clear-cut date. I hope that by mid-May we might reach an agreement. The real problem is to reach an agreement in details. We need to go through all the details to prevent any misunderstandings once it is implemented. The implementation will take two or three weeks once the agreement will be signed.
