Matrosov: "Defense Against Diphtheria"] [Text] Outbreaks of diphtheria have been noted in a number of cities in Sakhalin. In Nevelsk, for example, eight cases of the disease have been recorded, and two patients have died in Kholmsk. The epidemiological services fear that the isolated diphtheria foci may develop into an epidemic. The problem is that in the past few years the public has not received vaccinations and preventive medical examinations have been put on the back burner. All of this has resulted in a weakening of the adult population's immunity. Emergency vaccination of people on the island has begun. Those who have not been vaccinated are not allowed to work. Emergency epidemiological commissions are in operation in the cities. Physicians have become involved in the defense against diphtheria. The problem is that there is not enough serum.
