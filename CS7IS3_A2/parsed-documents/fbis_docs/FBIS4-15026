Agriculture Ministry experts believe that the drop in effective demand is the main reason holding back production of output for the agricultural sector of the economy. Prices for industrial products which are purchased by the agroindustrial complex are rising more quickly -- 11.4 times last year -- than the prices for agricultural produce, which rose only 8.4 times. Since the beginning of the year many plants have virtually been inoperative. According to Russia's State Committee for Statistics, in January production of mineral fertilizers was halted by the Belorechensk "Minudobreniya" association and the Uvarovo chemical works, and the manufacture of flax harvesting combines ceased even earlier at "Bezhetskselmash," the only manufacturer of this equipment in the country. Things are no better in the workforces which are continuing to work. For instance, at the start of the year the "Rostselmash" association produced only 0.6 percent of the January 1993 level of grain harvesting combines. A no less alarming situation has arisen in the production of components and subassemblies which are used for making up complete units and in repairing equipment. A lack of spare parts has resulted in the fact that in the past year the number of tractor and combine engines repaired at enterprises of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation fell by one-quarter, of tractors and grain harvesting combines by one-third, and of potato harvesting combines by half.
