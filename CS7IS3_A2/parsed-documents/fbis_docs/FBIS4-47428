V. Goncharuk, V. V. Minchenko, V. Yu. Tretinnik, Institute of Colloid chemistry and the Chemistry of Water, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev; UDC 541.18+621.039] [Abstract] The use of existing decontamination solutions, in most cases, does not reduce radiation contamination to a standard for safe use, repair or removal of equipment from the 30-km zone around the Chernobyl atomic energy plant. This is because the many colloid chemical and phsicochemical processes which occur during decontamination have not been sufficiently studied. This article studies in detail various colloid chemical processes that occur in decontamination and develops highly effective decontamination solutions based on domestically produced industrial reagents. The new decontaminant agents yielded a factor of 2-10 increase in the coefficient of decontamination. The best solution consisted of oxalic acid (0.3-01.0 % by mass), ethylenediaminetetraacetate (0.2-0.3%), oxalate of ammonia (0.1-0.2%) and SF-2U (a wetting agent, 0.2-0.3 %) in water. The composition of the wetting agent is given. The example of cleaning transmission parts coated with burnt-on oil is given. Tables 2; references 15 (Russian).
