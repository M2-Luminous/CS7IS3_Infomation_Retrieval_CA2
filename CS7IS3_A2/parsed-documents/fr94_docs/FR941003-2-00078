FR941003-2-00078 FR941003-2-00046 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION Duke Power Company; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;369 and 50&hyph;370] The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements of its regulations to Facility Operating License Nos. NPF&hyph;9 and NPF&hyph;17, issued to the Duke Power Company, licensee for the McGuire Nuclear Station Units 1 and 2. The plants are located at the licensee's site in Mecklenburg, County, North Carolina. The exemption was requested by the licensee by letter dated June 28, 1994, and supplemented by letters dated August 18, 1994 and September 7, 1994. Environmental Assessment Indentification of Proposed Action The proposed action requests an exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 50.60, ``Acceptance Criteria for Fracture Prevention Measures for Light-Water Nuclear Power Reactors for Normal Operation,'' to allow application of an alternate methodology to determine the low temperature overpressure protection (LTOP) setpoint for the McGuire Nuclear Station Units 1 and 2. The proposed alternate methodology is consistent with guidelines developed by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Working Group on Operating Plant Criteria (WGOPC) to define pressure limits during LTOP events that avoid certain unnecessary operational restrictions, provide adequate margins against failure of the reactor pressure vessel, and reduce the potential for unnecessary activation of pressure-relieving devices used for LTOP. These guidelines have been incorporated into Code Case N&hyph;514, ``Low Temperature Overpressure Protection,'' which has been approved by the ASME Code Committee. The content of this code case has been incorporated into Appendix G of Section XI of the ASME Code and published in the 1993 Addenda to Section XI. The NRC staff is revising 10 CFR 50.55a, which will endorse the 1993 Addenda and Appendix G of Section XI into the regulations. The philosophy used to develop Code Case N&hyph;514 guidelines is to ensure that the LTOP limits are still below the pressure/temperature (P/T) limits for normal operation, but allow the pressure that may occur with activation of pressure-relieving devices to exceed the P/T limits, provided acceptable margins are maintained during these events. This philosophy protects the pressure vessel from LTOP events, and still maintains the Technical Specification P/T limits applicable for normal heatup and cooldown in accordance with Appendix G to 10 CFR Part 50 and Section III and XI of the ASME Code. The Need for the Proposed Action 10 CFR 50.60 states that all light-water nuclear power reactors must meet the fracture toughness and material surveillance program requirements for the reactor coolant pressure boundary as set forth in Appendices G and H to 10 CFR Part 50. Appendix G to 10 CFR 50 defines P/T limits during any condition of normal operation, including anticipated operational occurrences and system hydrostatic tests, to which the pressure boundary may be subjected over its service lifetime. 10 CFR 50.60(b) specifies that alternatives to the described requirements in Appendices G and H to 10 CFR Part 50 may be used when an exemption is granted by the Commission under 10 CFR 50.12 .
