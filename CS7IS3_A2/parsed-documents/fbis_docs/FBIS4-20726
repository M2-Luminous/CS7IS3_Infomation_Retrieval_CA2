It is waiting for factories to be modernized and developed and for an improvement in the quality of production in order to confront foreign competition that has surpassed anything ever imagined. Made in Egypt cannot remain a slogan without work to protect it--work in which all efforts and skills join in a concern for overall quality levels, technological development, and greater linkage between centers of scientific research and the various means of production. We must learn from foreign expertise and modern designs. The Egyptian work force must be trained in the most modern packing and preserving methods that science has developed so that we can break into the world's markets and compete at home. We should be interested in good marketing, which has become an independent science in most of the world's countries; yet we still neglect it, despite the importance of this aspect of selling products. There must be skilled and honest oversight to prevent adventurers from playing with the reputation of Egyptian production. Tariffs should be increased on fully manufactured goods that have a counterpart in Egypt. Tax exemptions for investors should be bolstered. Engineer Fu'ad Abu-Zaghlah, chairman of the committee on energy and industry at the National [Democratic] Party's [NDP] general secretariat, spoke first. He said that the trade liberalization that most countries of the world have pursued has caused a kind of intense competition to improve production quality. It has increased the responsibility of private and joint-sector factories and of the business sector to take an interest in quality levels and reduced costs. This requires that management leaders with open minds be chosen who consider all ways to implement a system of overall quality. He declared that the coming period will require increased interest in technological development and greater linkage between scientific research centers and the various means of production in order to avoid traditionalism and bring about modernization and improved quality in various manufactured goods. Employees in the bodies that oversee industries must be chosen from those who possess a good technical and ethical level so that we can guarantee that measures are taken to prevent illegitimate marketing methods, such as flooding the market or using devious means to smuggle goods that do not conform to specifications. Smuggling Abu-al-Sa'ud Sultan, head of the exporters' section, pointed out that Egyptian industry needs protection from dumping, the smuggling game, and false invoices that are presented to customs. Oversight bodies of ability and honesty must be established, because total freedom without order and discipline and without state supervision gives an opportunity to speculators, swindlers, and adventurers at the expense of serious investors and producers. He stressed the need to treat Egyptian production as foreign production is treated in its country. The Egyptian producer must enjoy the same privileges that the foreign producer enjoys. There must be concern for industrial oversight and in developing its role, so as to maintain the level of the Egyptian product. Duties should be increased on fully manufactured goods that have a local counterpart, tax exemptions for investors should be increased, and the banks should give more low-interest loans for infrastructure development. He added that Egyptian factories must be refurbished and modernized, with the banks participating by means of low-interest loans. The latest methods of modern technology should be adopted, and personnel and specialists should be trained in these methods. Two Lines of Protection Engineer Hasan 'Aqil, director of the factories section of the National Plastic Company, said that the protection of Egyptian industry should proceed along two lines. First, customs should be raised on imported products that have a good local counterpart. Opening the door completely will tend to injure many manufacturing projects that have begun to export their product, thus threatening to halt these projects, particularly textiles, plastics, and chemical industries. The technological level of local factories is still modest compared to world factories, and this will affect the quality and competitiveness of the Egyptian product. The second line is to modernize Egyptian factories so as to raise quality and lower costs. In this way the Egyptian consumer will be given an opportunity to prefer Egyptian products. 'Abbudah 'Azzam, a textile factory owner from Shubra al-Khaymah, believes that the problem of Egyptian production lies in low customs duties on foreign products, high taxes on Egyptian factories, and the haphazard judgment of officials. These things tend to impede production and hinder its development. He stated that the smuggling of foreign products is another challenge now facing Egyptian industry. The competition is unequal: these countries are known to be countries with enormous production, and as the volume of production increases, the cost per unit decreases. Also, the governments of these countries subsidize their industries so that they can invade foreign markets. These are things we must take into account. Hisham Hajjaj, a businessman, said that some Egyptian products are superior to imports, but they lack packaging and advertising. Egyptian producers should take an interest in these aspects to assure international competitiveness. He indicated that Egyptian production now faces many difficulties, especially taxes, marketing, and bureaucratic obstacles when the time to export comes. Dr. Fawzi Babawi, a member of the NDP's economic committee, thinks that Egyptian industry need not fear international competition. On the contrary, such competition might help it develop itself and prove its quality, provided that the competition is honest--meaning that the importation of good products of confirmed origin should be allowed, while products of unknown origin should not be allowed. He stressed the need to benefit from foreign expertise and modern designs. Egyptian personnel must be trained in the most modern packing, preserving, and advertising methods that science has developed. He indicated that confronting foreign industries must concentrate on modernizing factories and supporting investments earmarked for that purpose. Part of the participation in development should be offered to employees, so that one does not rely completely on loans. He pointed to the pharmaceutical industry's success in providing 95 percent of Egypt's medicine needs at prices lower than similar foreign-produced drugs. Fahmi al-Suwaydi, an exporter, called for establishing regular maritime lines with some of the markets that absorb Egyptian exports, such as the African and Arab market. Loading and freight charges on ships should be reduced, so that more Egyptian products will be exported to these countries.
