Johnson claimed to have driven Koromah's supporters out of their stronghold at Tubmanburg. It is the latest chapter in the squabble between the two men which held up the formation of the Liberian Transitional Council. Johnson and the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] leader, Charles Taylor, have been accused of joining forces in order to oust Alhaji Koromah. Both have denied the accusation and Roosevelt Johnson even claims that members of his family have been killed. Last night, Alhaji Koromah, who is visiting Guinea, responded with a completely different version of events. From Conakry, Foday Fofona, telexed this report. [read by announcer] Alhaji Koromah vigorously denied claims by Roosevelt Johnson that forces loyal to him captured Tubmanburg, headquarters of ULIMO, over the weekend. Speaking at his home in Conakry last night, Koromah told me that he was thoroughly embarrassed that Roosevelt Johnson was using ULIMO fighters to kill each other. Koromah said that Roosevelt Johnson had been amassing arms and ammunition for some time and had moved his wife and children from Tubmanburg to Monrovia for safety. He said: It is a big lie that his mother had been killed. As of yesterday afternoon, his mother was very much alive in a town called Lofa Bridge. Visibly worried, Koromah told me: It is unfortunate that Johnson has become an agent of Charles Taylor and tried to use the Krahn tribe as a cover for his connections with the NPFL.
