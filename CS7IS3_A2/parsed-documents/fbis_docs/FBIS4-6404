"We have to make utmost efforts within the constraints of the pacifist Constitution," said Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, who spoke to reporters at a Tokyo hotel. Murayama's remarks followed disagreement Monday during talks among representatives of the coalition parties over Japan's stance toward North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program. During the talks, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of core coalition party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], proposed establishing domestic legislation in preparation for a possible naval blockade of North Korea. Ozawa reportedly told the meeting, "Unless Japan prepares its domestic laws beforehand for a quick response to the situation such as a naval blockade, Japan would not be able to do anything at a time of contingency." The SDP opposed the legislation, saying it would contravene Japan's longtime constitutional interpretation that it is not allowed to commit its military for collective military action, even to defend its security. Murayama also told reporters, "It is a prerequisite to make utmost efforts through negotiations (with North Korea) to prevent such a contingency from breaking out." Meanwhile, Murayama called on other coalition partners to speed up the process of naming a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. "We have to launch a new government as quickly as possible and we must conduct preparations to call a parliamentary election to name the new head of government tomorrow," he said. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is head of Shinseito, has emerged as the most likely replacement for Hosokawa, who announced on April 8 that he will step down over an alleged financial scandal and delays in Diet deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget.
