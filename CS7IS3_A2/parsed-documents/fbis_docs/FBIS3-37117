The document says that the republic continues sliding into the economic abyss. This is caused, among other things, by a sharp deterioration of finance, tax, and budget discipline. For example, in the fourth quarter of 1993 taxes accounted for 7.2 percent of the gross domestic product, whereas the appropriate level would have been 20 to 25 percent; in January 1994 this figure dropped to just 2.6 percent. The president regards this situation as undermining the country's economic independence. To prevent this, he has introduced a number of measures by decree. These include creating a department of tax police, substantial fines, withdrawal of registration certificates from companies, instituting criminal proceedings against those concealing their incomes, a tenfold increase in state excise tariffs, and a 20-fold increase in tax on land and in tax on private vehicles. Under the decree, no tax or customs rebates will be granted. It orders that a single computer network listing all tax-payers be created in the country. Declarations of all company accounts as they were on 1 January 1994 are to be submitted. The decree instructs the National Bank to exercise strict control over credits and monetary emission, introduces a limit for bank credits, and completely forbids granting hard currency credits to enterprises. The National Bank is requested to begin immediately those actions aimed at preventing insolvency, including reorganization and -- if necessary -- liquidation of insolvent state enterprises.
