NATO aircraft have bombed Bosnian Serb positions near the town of Gorazde twice in the past two days. In a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher today, Kozyrev said the world might be dragged into the danger of exchange of strikes and he called for maximum restraint. He said the decision to launch air strikes was hasty and "taken without due regard for consequences" and NATO had not consulted the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. Kozyrev, who is accompanying President Boris Yeltsin in Madrid for a visit to Spain, said that the decision-makers should be responsible for "all serious consequences of air strikes." In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Moscow was told that U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali had been informed of the possibility of using aircraft before the air strikes. The statement said Russia also hoped to be informed of the whole incident by U.N. leaders. It called on the United States and other Western countries not to wreck the U.N. decisions or connive at any side. As a direct and active participant in the settlement of the Bosnian crisis, Russia insisted on preventing an escalation of the conflict in the region, the statement said.
