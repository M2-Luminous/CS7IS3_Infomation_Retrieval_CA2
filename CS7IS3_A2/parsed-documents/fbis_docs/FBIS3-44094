The Jordanian Government leader is heading a Jordanian delegation on a visit to South Africa to reciprocate Mr Botha's visit to the Arab state last year. Mr al-Lawzi was speaking after a luncheon hosted by Mr Botha. Mr Botha said the two countries would establish a joint committee to investigate areas of co-operation in the fields of agriculture, trade, commerce, mining and culture. Mr Botha said he had been impressed by Jordan's economic recovery in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War when 300,000 jobless Jordanians who returned to their homeland had to be accommodated economically. Mr al-Lawzi said his government wanted to take the initiative in setting up ambassadorial ties with South Africa. One of his aides said Jordan was looking for a suitable property for its ambassador who would arrive in South Africa within weeks.
