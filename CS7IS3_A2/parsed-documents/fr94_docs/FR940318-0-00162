FR940318-0-00162 FR940318-0-00023 (2) Polyurethane, rigid appliance foam. (a) HCFC&hyph;123. HCFC&hyph;123 (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane appliance foam. (b) HCFC&hyph;141b. HCFC&hyph;141b (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane appliance foam. The Appliance Research Consortium (ARC), a subsidiary of the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM), convened an independent panel of toxicologists to evaluate the risk of potential exposure from foods stored in refrigerators manufactured with HCFC&hyph;141b as the blowing agent in the insulating foam. The panel evaluated the same toxicological data available to EPA, and concluded that the use of HCFC&hyph;141b in this intended application is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) per section 201(s) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 USC section 321(s). 1 1 Peter de la Cruz, Evaluation of HCFC&hyph;141b Potential Dietary Exposure, Keller and Heckman, January, 1994. (c) HCFC&hyph;22. HCFC&hyph;22 (or blends thereof), for reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane appliance foam. (d) HCFC&hyph;142b. HCFC&hyph;142b (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane appliance foam. HCFC&hyph;142b offers an alternative with significantly less potential to deplete stratospheric ozone than CFC&hyph;11. Nevertheless, certain technical problems persist. Namely, plant modifications may be required to allow the use of blowing agents like HCFC&hyph;142b that have low boiling points. (e) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane appliance foam. (f) HFC&hyph;152a. HFC&hyph;152a (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane appliance foam. (g) Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 (or blends thereof) are acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane appliance foam. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 offer the potential of a non-ozone-depleting alternative to the use of CFC&hyph;11 blowing agents in rigid polyurethane appliance foam. Plant modifications may be necessary to accommodate the flammability of Saturated Light Hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6. In addition, the potential for significant increases in thermal conductivity may reduce insulating capacity. Foams blown with saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 must conform with building code requirements that relate to flammable materials. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 are VOCs and will be subject to control as such under Title I of the CAA. (h) Carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in rigid polyurethane appliance foam. (3) Rigid polyurethane commercial refrigeration foam, spray foam, and sandwich panels. (a) HCFC&hyph;123. HCFC&hyph;123, for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;12 in rigid polyurethane commercial refrigeration foam, spray foam, and sandwich panels. (b) HCFC&hyph;141b. HCFC&hyph;141b (or blends thereof), for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;12 in rigid polyurethane commercial refrigeration foam, spray foam, and sandwich panels. (c) HCFC&hyph;22. HCFC&hyph;22 (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;12 in rigid polyurethane commercial refrigeration foam, spray foam, and sandwich panels. HCFC&hyph;22 offers an alternative with significantly less potential to deplete ozone than either CFC&hyph;11 or CFC&hyph;12. However, significant process changes could be necessary to accommodate the low boiling point of HCFC&hyph;22.
