On the basis of the political amnesty proclaimed by the State Duma the court ruled to drop criminal proceedings against former Soviet top officials who organised the 1991 August coup in Moscow. The political amnesty proclaimed by Duma covered the 1991 coup plotters, organisers of the 1993 armed opposition revolt in Moscow and of the May Day demonstration last year. All the three events resulted in bloodshed.
