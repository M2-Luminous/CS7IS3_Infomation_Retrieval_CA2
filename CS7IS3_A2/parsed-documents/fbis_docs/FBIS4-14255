FBIS4-14255 "drnes083_k_94006" FBIS-NES-94-083 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 IRAQ Kuwaitis Blamed for Rejecting Dialogue Call Kuwaitis Blamed for Rejecting Dialogue Call JN2804172294 Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic 21 Apr 94 p 1 JN2804172294 Baghdad AL-THAWRAH Arabic BFN [Editorial: "The Position of the Kuwaiti Rulers and Their Supporters and the Correct Conclusions"] [Text] The speaker of the Kuwaiti parliament has rejected a proposal by Sa'di Mahdi Salih, speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly, expressing the Iraqi Assembly's readiness to discuss with a Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation all outstanding issues in order to serve the Arab national cause, achieve stability, and avoid the conflicts certain well-known quarters are trying to foster. Important facts have been revealed by the Iraqi call for dialogue and the Kuwaiti parliamentary speaker's rejection of this call. It is up to sincere and honest Arabs everywhere to draw the right conclusions from these two stands, especially in the current difficult Arab situation in which Arab national interests need earnest, sincere, and responsible endeavors to solve Arab problems through dialogue and within the Arab framework. Any sincere and honest Arab, whether an ordinary citizen or a government official, must link the Kuwaiti parliamentary speaker's stand with ill intentions, introversion, lack of desire to solve problems through dialogue and within the Arab framework, and more open dependence on foreign powers and their trusteeship over the region. This is nothing strange for the Kuwaiti rulers and their supporters. They created the crisis through their own policies and liaisons, refused to resolve it through dialogue within the Arab framework, and then rushed for the help of the foreigner. Arabs, Iraqis, and Kuwaitis will recall that recent events revealed the facts that Jabir instructed Sa'd [al-'Abdallah] on the eve of the Jeddah meeting not to reach an agreement and to go to the UN Security Council, rather than use an Arab framework within the Arab League. Developments confirm how the stands of the Kuwaiti rulers and their supporters were selfish, mean, introverted, incomprehensible, and arrogant. Those stands, which did not help Kuwait and which in fact harmed the Arab stand, were and still are contrary to the Iraqi stand. Thus, the Iraqi National Assembly's readiness for dialogue with a Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation is based on a responsible Iraqi stand that has tried by every means to resolve differences through dialogue and to find an Arab solution to the crisis that serves the higher Arab national interests and protects Arab national security. The difference between the two stands reveals many of the facts about the previous phase and how Iraq's pan-Arab stands were serious and open-minded. Leader President Saddam Husayn presented the dispute with Kuwait during a closed session of the extraordinary Baghdad summit in a fraternal, calm, and responsible spirit marked by wisdom, courage, and patience. Iraq presented the dispute to the Arab League in a memo addressed by the Iraqi foreign minister on 16 July 1990. A day later, Iraq's leader warned in his speech on the anniversary of the 17 July revolution of the dangers of the continuous harm being done by the Kuwaiti rulers. Throughout the weeks that preceded and followed 2 August 1990, Iraq took initiatives and responded to others in order to resolve the dispute through a dialogue within an Arab framework. However, the Kuwaiti rulers and their supporters followed a course different from that of the nation and brotherhood. Sincere and honest Arabs everywhere are facing these facts anew. They can, after all that has happened, draw the correct conclusions and call a spade a spade. The Kuwaiti rulers and their supporters still reject the resolution of these differences through dialogue within the Arab framework. By holding to that suspicious rejection and continuing to maintain an atmosphere of panic, fear, and lies to justify their alliance with the foreigner and the continued presence of U.S. forces on Kuwaiti territory, they are serving their overlords who are exploiting the Kuwaiti rulers. They will continue to be the ones who determine when and how to provoke or permit the provocation of wars and seditions and guarantee placing the region into the wolf's mouth, as leader President Saddam Husayn said on 17 July 1990. The Kuwaiti rulers and their supporters continue on the path of crisis, divisions, and dispute, while Iraq continues its honest and responsible pan-Arab stands which sincerely seek to resolve all outstanding issues and serve the Arab cause. This makes it the duty of honest men in Kuwait and sincere and honest Arabs everywhere to confront the Kuwaiti rulers' suspect course, which is doing more harm to the region and the nation.
