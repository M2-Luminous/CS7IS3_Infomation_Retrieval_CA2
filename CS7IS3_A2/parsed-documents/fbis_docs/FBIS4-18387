Jonker commentary: "British Sickness Seeps Further Into European Union"] [Text] The crisis that was not a crisis has found a solution that does not resolve anything. Europe can continue on its way. The question is, where is it headed? In an enlarged European Community, 16 member states will cover all the points of the compass if they all indicate the way ahead. What political buoyancy there was following the trauma surrounding the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty to agree on the terms of its implementation was worn out over the past month. Irascibility runs high. A new treaty does not make old dividing lines fade away. As the French say, the British are remaining British and the Germans are remaining German, even if they have been posing as good Europeans for the last 49 years. For France, the vim and vigor with which German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel forced the accession of Austria, Finland, and Sweden upon his EC partners was needless proof of Germany being sure of itself. The open resentment of this, and the public reconciliation which followed, point to excessive flexibility in the axis around which the EC has to keep rotating. The climate is not being improved by the hints of threats aimed at the small member states by Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom. This is the last enlargement in which they will get off so lightly. "It would be absurd if France, Germany, and the United Kingdom could be outvoted by small member states," said Prime Minister Major last week. Neither Bonn nor Paris would disagree. London was counting on it proving easy to sow the seed of dissent. However, it set itself up as an unsuspecting lightning conductor in a charged atmosphere. "Everyone has the feeling that this will not happen again, the British simply saying no and subsequently getting their own way," said one diplomat as early as last week. This was the unequivocal message delivered to British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd when he was offered a final compromise in Ioannina this week. "Take it or be damned," was the edict, which was not meant to be taken personally. European Commission President Jacques Delors had already expressed his amazement at the way in which the amiable and irreproachable Hurd "dazzlingly advocated the impossible." "The flexibility has gone, they are at their wit's end," said Hurd. According to insiders, the tenor of the argument with which Hurd forced his prime minister in the direction of Europe on Monday and Tuesday was that "if we say no again, then we will cause irreparable damage." John Major would appear to have suffered irreparable damage. However, his political decline would threaten to drag down the EC with it. The difficulties arising in the debate on enlargement can only become more serious now that the European Parliament is showing its teeth. In Strasbourg, the members of parliament are fuming over the concession made to the United Kingdom. They cannot let their final opportunity to grab the Council of Ministers by the scruff of the neck before the June elections pass them by. Enlargement is a high price to pay, but it is worth it to save their own credibility, believes a sizeable proportion of the members of the European Parliament, 260 of whom must vote in favor of accession. They are not wrong. The Ioannina compromise on the voting procedure in an enlarged EC can be viewed as a concession of merely cosmetic value to the British. Formally speaking, however, they can only delay a decision by teaming up with one large member state and one small one. They cannot prevent it altogether, as is currently the case, unless they get at least one more small member state on their side. Accordingly, their voice has already been weakened, and the 10 member states [which successfully reached agreement on the voting issue] are getting things their way. And yet the so-called British virus which was already lodged in the structure of the Community when the Maastricht Treaty was signed, is beginning to multiply on the quiet. It is a selective virus, which is merely out to smother political, social, and economic cooperation. Market integration would appear to be largely unaffected. Furthermore, one notable symptom is that it rears its head whenever its own body has been weakened. The virus causes the British sickness and is accompanied by bouts of deep depression in Brussels, and sends waves of nausea sweeping through large groups of people in the rest of Europe. The EC itself, the main pillar of the European Union, which is poisoned by it, was not altogether free of pain, as things were. However, decisions could still be made in major areas in line with the supranational idea that the member states of the Community would relinquish part of their sovereignty even against their better judgement. Now and then that proves painful. However, the political consolation is that the balance of both the negative and positive effects of integration is, by definition, almost positive. For that reason, Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Norway are knocking at the door of the EC. Remember, even the United Kingdom joined back in 1973. It is just that London is inclined to calculate the advantages and disadvantages in terms of clanking coins. Most other countries also take account of the nonmaterial achievements of the EC, which safeguard their freedom within the process of European unification. That is also the most valuable feature of the Union's umbrella in the eyes of the countries of Central Europe. Since the Norman invasion, the United Kingdom has never been enslaved by another European people, and it therefore views the political dimension of the Union merely as a threat to its freedom and independence. "We are all islands shouting lies at each other across seas of misunderstanding," would appear to be an accurate and up-to-date British definition of the EC, even if the writer Rudyard Kipling was actually speaking about himself and his fellow countrymen. A miscaculation was made in the latest crisis. The continental Europeans did not allow themselves to be jostled apart. However, they did make the EC slightly less European and slightly more British. If they want to bring the British sickness to a halt, then there is an effective remedy. Even if Spain and the United Kingdom are both against a proposal, they still need another member state to form a delaying majority. If the Ten were to declare that they will not participate in forming a delaying majority of 23 votes, but only a real blocking minority of 27 votes, then they will take the wind out of the United Kingdom's sails. They can then count on receiving the sympathy of the European Parliament and thus guarantee that enlargement can take place on 1 January. It goes without saying that the Netherlands and Belgium will together be the first to make a unilateral declaration of this kind. They do not recognize the Luxembourg compromise whereby France called a false veto into being, either. After all, the Hague says that it will go along with the compromise merely to preserve the consensus. In this way, the British could be shown that the EC member states are not just islands.
