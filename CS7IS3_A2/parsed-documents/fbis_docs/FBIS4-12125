The men, many of whom will be in positions of authority under Palestinian autonomy, were welcomed by thousands of people. About 28 deportees returned via the Allenby Bridge to Jericho, and reporter Mark Weiss was there when they arrived: [Begin Weiss recording] It was a long wait in the Jericho sun for the relatives and friends who came to greet the deportees at the Allenby Bridge crossing. Because of registration problems at the border, the bus bringing the deportees didn't cross until 8 o'clock in the evening [1700 GMT]. Army jeeps escorted the bus by a back road to a restaurant outside Jericho where the men received a hero's welcome. [passage omitted] In contrast to the group of elderly veteran deportees that were allowed back last year, this group is mostly made up of younger intifadah activists or those deported for student or trade union activity. They are expected to take up leadership positions throughout the territories, as Fatah and the other groups that support the peace process attempt to win over the population. They hope that their return is just the beginning. [end recording] At the same time, at the border crossing at Rafah in Gaza, 23 deportees arrived. Dani Gur-Arye reports: [Begin recording] [Gur-Arye] Palestinians destined to become the new bureaucrats in the Gaza Strip returned home to a warm reception. Dozens of friends and relatives greeted the returnees at the Rafah terminal, while hundreds of others waited outside, chanting and waving the PLO flag. [passage omitted] The returnees, mostly Fatah members, have credentials both in Gaza and in Tunis. They were all grass roots intifadah activists, who were either deported or who fled to Egypt as fugitives. In their years abroad, they were incorporated into the PLO's leadership in Tunis. Now they are back in the Strip, with authority from above and with what the PLO hopes is respect from below. The head of Fatah in Gaza, Zakariya al-Agha, describes the return as a positive gesture. But, he says, the Palestinians are waiting for more serious steps. [Al-Agha] I hope that we will see in the near future the complete evacuation of Gaza from the settlements and settlers, because this is very important and this will remove a large obstacle from the road to attain the full peace we are looking for. [Gur-Arye] The returnees are expected to begin working out of PLO offices in Gaza in the coming days. Officials in Tunis hope their presence will bolster Yasir 'Arafat's position in the Gaza Strip.
