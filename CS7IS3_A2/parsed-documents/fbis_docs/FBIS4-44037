These rumors have drawn a strong reaction from career diplomats, who believe it would be awkward to remove Niles early in order to "accommodate" a political figure who is being removed from the Clinton administration. Oxman succeeded Niles in his position as assistant secretary of state for European affairs, but two weeks ago it was decided to replace him because of ineffectiveness. Oxman is a close friend of the Clinton family and maintains excellent relations with Congress. Niles was appointed by former President George Bush and is connected to the Republican Party. The White House will make a final decision in the next few weeks.
