This debate is expected to be heated, with marked difference of opinion among the political groups now dominating Parliament. This Wednesday [16 Feb], the Bicameral Conference Committee will meet with experts from the Legal Advisory Service of Congress to determine whether the constitutional debate will start from zero, or if it will use the work done by the former legislature, in which deputies approved the first and second readings of the constitutional reform bill, and the Senate left its second reading pending. On this matter there are a number of divergent opinions among members of Congress. Some believe the debate should start from zero, but taking as a base the previous work done. In light of the political panorama the National Congress now presents, Causa R [Radical Cause] believes the constitutional reform debate should start from zero, but first the present Congress should be dissolved. Causa R is actually working on a new Constitution, convening individuals and groups for a national debate. The constitutional reform debate was conducted inside the walls of Congress, and the people did not take part in that debate. A new Constitution requires the people's views and direct participation. Pablo Medina, the head of Causa R's parliamentary group, objects: "Is this fraudulent National Congress going to debate the Constitution? The country does not want this Congress: we, the way things are going...When we hold all these debates on choosing the Treasury inspector and prosecutor, the people are going to call for the dissolution of Congress. We are going to request the dissolution of Congress and the holding of a referendum so the people can decide whether or not this Congress should continue to lead the discussion of bills and the constitutional reform." He added that this Congress has no moral or political authority to debate constitutional reform, as this Congress is the product of a fraud. "There are a million invalid votes. AD [Democratic Action] and COPEI [Social Christian Party] added 40 deputies and that is what gave them a majority. Therefore, they have no legitimacy. This is an illegitimate Congress. It has no legitimacy to function, much less to reform the Constitution." He explained that although the present Constitution does not include a provision for a dissolution referendum, it is possible to conduct a vote of the nation on whether or not the people want this Congress to be dissolved. "In Colombia a Constituent Congress was held and the Colombian Constitution did not include that possibility. They did it for political reasons: it was right for the country. We are considering how to do this, but we are convinced that this Congress should go; it should be dissolved." According to Senator Humberto Celli, the work done by the former legislature on constitutional reform was not exclusive to that legislature, and so it should be considered by the new Congress. He believes that recent years have been quite eventful and the nation's present situation is completely different, "even the political makeup of the chambers is completely diffent, and all this requires a new study which this Congress needs to undertake, while also taking into account the work done by the former Congress." The deputy leader of the COPEI group, Nelson Chitty La Roche, thinks the new definition of the political and parliamentary landscape requires that the constitutional reform debate be started anew. "The parliamentarians who have been chosen by our people to represent them must offer their views, their opinions on the constitutional issue, for we have to realize that our political life is not a two-party system now; the political map is now divided into four, and the social constitution now being debated in the streets is permeated with the spirit of society. It must have some influence on determining what the constitutional reform debate will be." Deputy Nelson Chitty La Roche believes that some of the issues of importance which will have to be dealt with in the constitutional debate are revocation [or dissolution] referenda, the media oligarchy, the military justice system, and the decentralization process.
