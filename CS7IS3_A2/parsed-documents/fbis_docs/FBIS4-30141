FBIS4-30141 "dreas122__a94015" FBIS-EAS-94-122-A Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Hitachi To Boost Electron Beam Equipment Sales Hitachi To Boost Electron Beam Equipment Sales 942A0316A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 1 Jun 94 p 8--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0316A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Hitachi has put together a plan to boost sales of electron beam (EB) drawing equipment, which seems to be promising in next-generation IC [integrated circuit] manufacture use with its high resolution, to 3 billion yen this fiscal year, 1.5 times that of the previous year. Since semiconductor manufacturers are aggressive in new facilities investment, the outlook is for orders to increase for manufacturing process use to draw circuit patterns directly on wafers, in addition to use in mask manufacturing. Other main products such as etching equipment also seem to have surpassed the performance of the previous fiscal year, and the outlook for sales for all semiconductor manufacturing equipment this fiscal year is a 7.5-percent increase (43 billion yen) compared to the previous fiscal year, an increase for the second consecutive year. Besides EB drawing equipment and etching equipment, the company is manufacturing and selling a kind of length measuring SEM (scanning electron microscope) scanning devise. The external sales ratio is over 80 percent. The EB drawing equipment on which sales efforts have been put this fiscal year is a product that began full-scale external sales last fiscal year. Generally, EB's are often used for mask manufacturing, but the company is making its main force the use of "direct drawing" where the pattern is drawn on the wafer without using a mask. Processing speed is slower than a stepper and it seems unsuitable for mass production, but production efficiency is being raised by adopting a new transfer method of putting together patterns in block units, and Hitachi is beginning combined use with a stepper in ASIC (application-specific IC) manufacture. It aims to seize this timing to expand sales.
