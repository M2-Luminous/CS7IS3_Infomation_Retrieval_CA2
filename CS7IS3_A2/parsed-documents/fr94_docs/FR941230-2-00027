S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) responds to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances under the authority of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). Regulations governing such responses are found in the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan or NCP. The process for remedy selection in the NCP generally requires that a remedial investigation be performed to identify the nature and extent of contamination at National Priorities List (NPL) sites. From sampling results, as well as site observations obtained in the field, specific contaminants and exposure pathways of concern are identified and used in a baseline risk assessment performed to determine whether remedial action is warranted. 1 2 1 U.S. EPA. 1989.

Today's Federal Register notice introduces a draft of a new tool which may reduce significantly the time it takes to complete soil investigations and cleanup actions, as well as improve the consistency of these actions across the nation. The draft guidance was written for remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) work at Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) sites. This guidance on developing soil screening levels is expected to assist site managers in quickly identifying contaminated soil of potential concern and in screening out from further consideration those soils that do not warrant additional study. The framework in the draft Soil Screening Guidance presents three recommended methods for developing risk-based, soil screening levels. These levels are then compared to on-site soil contaminant levels. The framework provides the three methods for developing soil screening levels, but emphasizes the simple, site-specific approach. Areas of a site which fall below such levels may be screened out from further assessment. Areas above the values in the guidance suggest that a further evaluation of the potential risks that may be posed by site contaminants is appropriate to determine the need for a response action. While the guidance is recommended for use as a screening tool to determine if further study is warranted at a site, the levels it recommends do not represent cleanup standards for a site. The formulae and exposure assumptions upon which the draft guidance is based have been taken from the Risk Assessment Guidance for Superfund 12 and have been widely accepted in the Superfund program for a number of years.
