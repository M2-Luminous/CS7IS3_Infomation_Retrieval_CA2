Before he left, Xie Shijie granted a special interview to the reporters from this news agency. "Expanding opening up to the outside world is Sichuan Province's top priority this year, and my trip to the United States this time is mainly to enhance understanding, foster friendship, seek extensive contacts with the people from all walks of life in the United States, and expedite Sichuan's opening up to the outside world." Xie Shijie came directly to the purpose of his trip to the United States. Xie Shijie said that Sichuan Province established friendly province-state relations with Washington State and Michigan in October and November 1982 respectively. In the past 12 years, Sichuan Province's friendship and cooperation with the two states has continuously strengthened. During the trip this time, discussions will be carried out with Washington State on further strengthening economic and scientific cooperation, and on developing friendly province-state relations, with Boeing Company and some electronic companies, on agricultural cooperation between the province and the state, and on food processing, exchange of fine seeds for farming, and exchange of technology of low-toxic pesticides; ideas will be exchanged on strengthening thorough cooperation between the medium and small cities in Washington State and in Sichuan Province; discussions will be carried out with the Washington State Zoo on establishing a foundation for protection of the giant pandas and launching cooperation to rescue this endangered species. Xie Shijie said that while in Michigan, he will visit the General Motors Company, and carry out discussions with the state government on the automobile industry, processing of farm products, and transformation of old towns. The humble and pragmatic Xie Shijie has worked in the Sichuan Provincial People's Government for many years, serving as vice governor and executive vice governor; in April 1993, he began to serve as party secretary of Sichuan Province, overseeing overall work in Sichuan Province. Talking about the major measures to expand Sichuan's opening up this year, he said that Sichuan Province is situated in the interior and has a vast area and 110 million people, 10 percent of China's population; this is a huge market, and the potential of this huge market is recognized by knowledgeable persons at home and abroad. Sichuan Province's chemical, electronic, and metallurgical industries rank first in China; Sichuan's space technology is famous at home and overseas; and its abundant farm products and cheap labor resource are also a strong point when Sichuan opens up to the outside world. Xie Shijie said: The basic way to expedite Sichuan's economic development and narrow the difference between it and the coastal provinces and cities rests on reform and opening up. In order to increase the weight of Sichuan's opening up to the outside world, beginning in Chengdu on 28 June this year, an international conference on Sichuan's opening up to the outside world plus an investment forum will be held, and during that period, 306 projects involving a total investment of $13 billion will be offered for negotiations with foreign businessmen. In addition, a number of measures to expand opening up to the outside world, including the transfer of rights to use Chengdu-Chongqing Highway and the right to use state-owned enterprises, will be promulgated one by one. Coming to this point, Xie Shijie said that American consortia, bankers, and entrepreneurs are welcome in Chengdu to participate in the international conference on Sichuan's opening up to the outside world plus the investment forum. While in New York, Xie Shijie will also have contacts with the persons of American financial and securities circles, hold talks with the Sino-U.S. Trade Commission, and inspect development of Sichuan's enterprises in New York. When in Los Angeles, talks will be held with American entrepreneurs... According to information, the number of American investors coming to Sichuan has continuously increased, for example, the Mcgill Group and the American Concord Group in Chengdu, and the plating membrane production line under construction in Shuangliu County--the largest in western China--as well as a pharmaceutical factory in Guanghan.
