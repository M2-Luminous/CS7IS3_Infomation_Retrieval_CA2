"My main task in the assembly hall is to conduct sessions in such a way, so that, without imposing my own point of view, all opinions of deputies are clarified and the rights of the minority protected", Rybkin told the "NEW WEEKLY GAZETTE" [NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA] on Friday. Former parliament Chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov, who was arrested after the October opposition revolt in Moscow, acted in a completely different way, denying the floor to his opponents and imposing his own will on the parliament. Rybkin also said that since the moment of his election as the speaker he had seen no opposition from the president and the prime minister. "From the very beginning of my activities as the chairman of the Duma all contacts with the president, the prime minister, mayors of Moscow and St. Petersburg show that there is no hostility between us. These are normal businesslike relations", Rybkin said and added that some politicians would like it to be otherwise. "Some people, because of their own political interests, do not like such a normal cooperation. But that is their own problem. The question is not whether they belong to Communists or Agrarians, but in whether they want or do not want to work normally", Rybkin stressed. The speaker added that he wants to accumulate in his work everything positive from the experience of pre-revolutionary Russian Duma and the former parliament.
