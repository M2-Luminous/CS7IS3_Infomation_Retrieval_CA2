Lin Liyun, head of a Chinese congressional delegation, made the commitment in her speech at the second general meeting of the Asia- Pacific Parliamentary Forum which opened here today. Lin, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, said many Asia-Pacific countries have proposed to set up an Asia-Pacific security mechanism which fully demonstrates a cherished aspiration of various countries to maintain peace, stability and security in the region. However, she said, China holds that the establishment of any security mechanism must be in line with the regional diversities and complexities. "Only such an initiative proceeds from the actual conditions and special characteristics in this region, can it enjoy the support by the most of the countries," she added. The congresswoman said China will "continue bilaterally and regionally multi-tier, multi-channel and multi-form consultations and discussions with the parties concerned on this issue." As for the economic development, Lin said the rapid growth momentum of Asia and the Pacific region had not been strangled by the dramatic changes of the world's political pattern. With the sustained economic growth for many years, the average increase this year for the whole region is still estimated above 7 percent, much higher than the projections for the rest of the world. Lin said the rapid development of different kinds of economic cooperations would enhance the stability in the region and lay a solid foundation to a comparative stability in the whole Asia- Pacific region. While recognizing that peace, stability and economic development will remain a main stream of Asia and the Pacific, Lin warned against the continued existence of unstable factors in the region such as hegemonism, power politics and wilful interference in others' internal affairs. "It is imperative that all the countries concerned shall make arduous efforts to maintain comparative stability and preserve high- speed economic growth of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1990s and even in the next century," she stressed.
