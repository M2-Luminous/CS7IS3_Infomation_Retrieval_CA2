The National Administrative Department of Statistics, DANE, has disclosed that in 1993 commercial trade increased 4.25 percent, due primarily to an increase in the sale of furniture and electrical appliances which, in turn, was prompted by increased construction. DANE figures show that sales in December increased by 8.79 percent compared to the same period on 1992. Vehicles and replacement parts sold the most at 15.62 percent, and fuel and lubricants sold the least at minus 7.26 percent. Although sales were up, jobs decreased by 1.48 percent in comparison to 1992. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 17 Mar 94 p 4B) The prices of staple products continue to increase in a worrisome manner. During the first 10 days of March the cost of living increased by 1.94 percent, which usually happens every month, but the government fears that if the trend continues throughout the month the quarterly cost of living rate could increase to up to 10 percent. Some analysts believe the excess of money in circulation is also a factor. In 1993 food, which represents 34 percent of the cost of living, increased by only 14.5 percent. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 18 Mar pp 1, 1B) Foreign investment in Colombia increased by 8.6 percent in January compared to the same month in 1993. Total investment, excluding petroleum, was $21.7 million in January 1994 compared to $19.9 million in January 1993. The Investing in Colombia Corporation reported that 89.7 percent of this investment went to the mining sector. The manufacturing sector received 6.2 percent. The United Kingdom was the top investor with $17.4 million, that is, 84.4 percent of total foreign investment in Colombia in January 1994. All of it went to the mining sector. The United States was second with 13.1 percent and it also invested in the mining sector. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 19 Mar 94 p 3B) Colombian purchases abroad increased by 47.2 percent between January and November 1993 compared to the same period in 1992. Exports grew by only 2.7 percent in the same period. According to DANE, imports totaled $8.948 billion, and exports totaled $6.504 billion. Economists think that this is due to the revaluation of the peso. The import of consumer and capital goods and construction materials experienced the highest growth rate, more than 70 percent. The import of vehicles grew by 148 percent and the import of weapons by 215 percent. Exports increased from $6.332 billion to $6.504. Traditional exports, such as coffee, petroleum, coal, and ferrous nickel [ferroniquel], dropped by 6.46 percent. Meanwhile, nontraditional exports grew by 11.37 percent. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 19 Mar 94 p 3B) The Board of the Cartagena Accord has reported that the exchange of goods and services among the members of the Andean Group, comprised by Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, reached $2.886 billion in 1993, that is, a 117-percent increase compared to 1990. Excluding fuel, exports among Andean countries in 1993 reached $2.642 billion, a 34.1 percent increase compared to 1992. In 1993 Colombia exported $1,159,800,000 or 40.2 percent of total intra-subregional trade. Venezuela was the main destination for Colombian exports. Sales to that country totaled $711.6 million. Venezuela was the second Andean Group exporter with $987.5 million or 34.2 percent of total intra-subregional sales. Most Venezuelan exports went to Colombia. Ecuador registered the largest increase in intra-subregional exports with 76 percent. Bolivia increased exports by 8 percent and Peru by 10.4 percent in 1993. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 23 Mar 94 pp 1B, 3B) Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos and Agriculture Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo sent a letter dated 23 March to the newspaper EL TIEMPO stating that the government is not planning to reduce tariffs on and protective measures for the agricultural sector, or alter the price of agricultural produce in order to stop the rise of inflation. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 24 Mar 94 p 8A) The members of the Association of Coffee Producers on 24 March decided to reduce from 20 percent to 10 percent their withholding of exportable coffee, a measure they have implemented since October 1993. They had agreed that as soon as the price of coffee reached 75 cents per pound they would cut withholding by half. This in fact happened because the price of coffee was over 75 cents yesterday. This decision was made during a meeting in London. The member countries decided to continue this strategy because it has so far produced good results. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 25 Mar 94 p 1B) The next government must manage the petroleum bonanza very prudently and save part of those resources if it wants to come out a winner from one of the greatest economic challenges of recent years. President Cesar Gaviria, World Bank officials, and international experts made this recommendation yesterday at the opening of a seminar organized by the National Planning Department. President Gaviria said that the Cusiana oil fields must be used to decrease poverty levels and achieve a sustained growth rate. The country currently has a reserve of 3.6 billion barrels of petroleum. Gaviria pointed out that the country must continue its search for new oil fields. Gaviria urged his successor to follow the example of Indonesia, which progressed after a petroleum boom. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 25 Mar 94 p 1B)
