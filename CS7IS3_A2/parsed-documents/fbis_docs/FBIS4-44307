It is not true if you imply that we are neglecting this issue. The opposite is true. There is no issue that has been more in the focus of all debates and initiatives, both at the summit in Brussels at the end of last year and at the G-7 employment summit in Detroit, where, above all, German initiatives for training, the dual system, advanced training, retraining, were virtually presented as exemplary, where for the first time a policy for medium-sized industries was supported and demanded, as we have demanded for years and decades and in connection with which we have always said that it cannot and will not be just the big ones but also the medium-sized and small units that are able to react quickly and flexibly to these big economic challenges. We have made this an issue. [applause] We have adopted a memorandum on this issue. We have outlined the basic guidelines of economic policy, the growth initiative. And in particular regarding what colleague Rexrodt has suggested regarding deregulation -- an initiative, in which leading industrialists, trade unionists, and scientists are supposed to participate so as to reexamine secondary legislation in Europe, just as it is done here in our country, and to check it for impediments to growth -- I do not understand why you criticize this, which has met with very broad approval and a good reception in Europe and now also at the Commission. I do not know what kind of strangely divided relationship you have with the economic development in Germany. We will achieve a growth of more than 1.5 percent. Even though just a few weeks ago the IMF, OECD, and others predicted a growth of 0.1, 0.9, and 1.2 percent for us, today it is certain that this growth will amount to between 1.5 and 2 percent -- according to some forecasts rather closer to 2 than to 1.5 percent. We should all be happy about this. Does this perhaps not fit your election campaign concept? [applause, unintelligible interjections] If you -- I did not want to do that now, Mr. Klose -- attack us in this way and want to hold us responsible for mass unemployment, then I do not spare you the question about the biggest impediment to investments. This constellation of red-green, and red-green with a popular-front character, as you are aiming for now in Saxony-Anhalt, would mean a disastrous negative growth initiative. [applause, unintelligible interjections] This, colleague Klose, would be a disaster not only for Saxony-Anhalt, it would be a disastrous sign to the world. And I can only call on you, as a responsible politician, to make sure in time in your party that this will not take place in Germany. It would be good for our election campaign but damaging to Germany, Ladies and Gentlemen. [Unidentified Bundestag vice president] Mr. Minister, are you willing to answer a question from Deputy Weiss? [Waigel] Yes. [Weiss] Thank you very much. Mr. Minister, may I reassure you that the popular front, which you see in Saxony-Anhalt, will certainly not come about -- simply because the Alliance 90/Greens in Saxony-Anhalt developed out of the resistance to the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] and has nothing to do with what the SED did. Together with the Social Democratic Party, we will pursue a policy for the citizens in Saxony-Anhalt. [Bundestag vice president] Deputy Weiss, would you please formulate this as a question so that I do not have any problems up here. [Weiss] I asked the finance minister whether I may reassure him and I would like to reassure him. Thank you. [Waigel] Colleague Weiss, if Alliance 90 consisted only of such men and women as you, a different possibility for talks would exist. But you represent neither the Greens in this alliance nor did you say a word about the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. If one depends on the votes of the PDS, this is a fateful development in Germany and not only in Saxony-Anhalt. Therefore, I am not reassured. [applause, unintelligible interjections] In your speeches up to now, Ladies and Gentlemen of the opposition, you did not acknowledge the dimensions of Corfu. It is true that the dispute over persons unfortunately covered the prospects and dimensions that were created. When we hear Russian President Yeltsin speaking of a divided continent growing together again, we can feel a development that 50 years ago our parents, our older sisters and brothers could only dream about. And when, through the expansion of the European Union [EU] by the Scandinavian states there will for be the first time a joint border between the EU and Russia, and when these deeply European states such as Austria and the Scandinavian states fulfill their functions as a bridge and central countries this is a very important time for Europe, of which we all, and especially the Federal Government can be proud. [applause] And if through our constant urging we have succeeded in making a common European initiative a common initiative of the G-7 in Naples, and if the whole world finally realizes that what is happening or could happen in Ukraine, this is part of a newly acquired international responsibility that extends into the future. And, Ladies and Gentlemen, in spite of our tight budget in Germany, if money is required for this, it must be included in the budget. We owe this to our citizens in Europe, in Germany, and in the whole world. That has absolute priority. [applause] Ladies and Gentlemen, the German presidency will give us the opportunity, to achieve significant progress for Europe. And this will be done by stabilizing, dynamizing, and deregulating. Strict budgetary discipline, the modernization and expansion of the European traffic infrastructure are necessary to achieve this. That deficit financing, as was attempted under the concept of global control in the 1960's and 1970's, is no longer feasible must also be known in Europe. It would not make sense to reduce deficits in all member countries to achieve the Maastricht criteria and to conduct deficit financing in the EU Commission at the same time. There are various possibilities of making use of the capital market via the excellent European Investment Bank. And, dear colleague Klose, a short telephone call to your former colleague Roth will convince you that the European Investment Bank is in a position to find the funds for private financing. [unintelligible interjections] Roth is now in perfect order in terms of market economy. It has been a long way, from my having discussions with him on television when he was chairman of the Young Socialists, up to his becoming a defender of the market economy in the Social Democratic Party. No one will see you when you call him. He will be able to convince you that the funds are available. Ladies and Gentlemen, one thing must be clear: When we tackle the convergence process, when we state excessive budget deficits, as is necessary in preparing the second stage of Monetary Union, we will make sure that the criteria are observed strictly. And this must concern everyone, including us. A watering down will not take place, stability criteria have priority. [applause] Regarding expenditure programs, these will be available. And it cannot be true that all the programs that ever existed in the EU will be continued forever. We will have to examine these things, let some programs expire and restructure some. And if by restructuring we can make funds available for the big European traffic infrastructure program, this is a necessary starting point for growth and a better infrastructure in Europe. [applause] And with great determination we will also support the sustained fight against fraud to the disadvantage of the common budget. This is necessary to win the people's acceptance of Europe. Of course, we will also deal with the issue of contribution payments. What has been settled in the medium-term plans up to 1999 will not be changed. Ladies and Gentlemen; we have to consider very carefully whether we want more programs. After all, we will be providing 30 percent of the funds for each program but can get back no more than 19 or 20 percent. Of course, we will have to make sure that more money flows back to Germany. We have to make sure that the most stringent criteria and economy will apply for spending as they do in Germany. Yet, the other European partners must also be able to rely on us, on what was agreed and will, of course, continue. Moreover, the advantage of Europe must not only be seen in connection with the position of being a net payer, but it also has to be seen in terms of the national economy. If every German accounts for $7,000 in exports, every American for $2,000, and every Japanese for $1,850, then everybody knows what open borders mean for us, and what it means for us to be able to export to other countries. [applause] Mr. Klose, as far as the trans-European networks are concerned, this has been identified in a group of Commissioner Christopherson, which is where the responsible officials sit [unintelligible interjections] .... I beg your pardon, but this was State Secretary Haller, an excellent man...and, of course, all this will be done in agreement and coordination with the responsible ministry, which is obvious. We do have such coordination, which you will first have to introduce in your Bundestag group. We will also deal with the following issues -- I just mention keywords: tax harmonization, a most important issue for Europe and beyond. The second issue is the principle of country of origin with regard to the value-added tax; and the energy tax was mentioned before by Mr. Haussmann and by the foreign minister. We are on a good course as far as the economic situation is concerned. We have set the course for the political situation in Europe in an unprecedented way; all that is most closely linked with our contribution, with what Germany is doing in Europe without dominating, but in a great spirit of partnership. In my capacity as finance minister, I also paid a visit to all our partners in the past few weeks and months; a few days ago I also spoke with all finance ministers of the new future members to make preparations for the next six months in a harmonious process of partnership and cooperation. With Germany for Europe -- this is the slogan of our presidency, for which we are well prepared. Thank you very much.
