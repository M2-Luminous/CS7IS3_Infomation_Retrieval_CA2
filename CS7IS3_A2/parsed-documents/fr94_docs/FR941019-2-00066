FR941019-2-00066 FR941019-2-00040 2. We believe that equity requires that we permit interested parties to file nonfrivolous pleadings on confidentiality and related issues. We thus waive the prohibition of ยง20.13 on additional pleadings, and permit necessary additional pleadings to be filed pursuant to the terms of ยง1.45 of the Commission's Rules. 3. We have also received a Motion to Defer Filing Dates. 4 Movants ask that we defer the filing of replies, due October 19, 1994, to either (1) two weeks after opposing parties file any supplemental comments based on the disclosure of confidential information or (2) two weeks after the Commission issues a decision denying access to such confidential information. Movants contend that if additional information is disclosed, this will require supplemental pleadings that will duplicate the October 19 replies and ``needlessly expand the number of pleadings (and the time involved) for consideration by the Commission.'' 5 They argue that a grant of the Motion will expedite review by permitting the filing of a consolidated reply. They add that if additional disclosure is not made, and the Commission moves quickly in reaching that decision, the proposed procedure will result in only minimal delay. 6 4 Motion to Defer Filing Dates (Motion) of Cellular Resellers Association, Cellular Service, Inc. and Com Tech Mobile Telephone Co. (Oct. 4, 1994) (collectively Movants). 5 Motion at 3. 6 Motion at 3&hyph;4. 4. We deny the Motion. As we explained in a recent order granting the parties a 15-day extension to file replies, the Commission must meet a one-year statutory deadline for ruling on the state's petition and deciding any reconsideration. We stressed that, ``The Commission is faced with stringent statutory deadlines in a complex and massive proceeding.'' 7 Although we agree with Movants that disclosure of additional information may require that we permit the parties to supplement their comments, we cannot now predict whether such additional disclosure will be necessary. We believe that efficient administration and docket management requires adherence to the October 19, 1994 deadline for filing replies in this proceeding. For the foregoing reasons, we do not believe that good cause has been shown for the requested deferral. 7 Order Extending Time and Permitting Replies to Revised Petition, DA 94&hyph;1054 (Sept. 26, 1994) at 1&hyph;2. 5. Pursuant to ยง0.331 of the Commission's Rules, 8 the provisions of ยง20.13(a)(5) are waived to the extent indicated herein, the Motion to Defer Filing Dates filed by Cellular Resellers Association, Inc., Cellular Service, Inc., and ComTech Mobile Telephone Company is denied, and PR Docket No. 94&hyph;105 Notice of Ex Parte Contact and Request for Issuance of a Public Notice is dismissed as moot to the extent indicated herein. 8 47 CFR 0.331.
