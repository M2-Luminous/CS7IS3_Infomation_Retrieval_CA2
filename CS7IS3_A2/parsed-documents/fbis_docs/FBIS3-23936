Your takeoff, which occurred several years ago, has been noticed and conceptualized seriously by patriotic circles. Some have sympathized with you, others have called for caution in relation to you. Following the party's victory at the December elections you have become a political star, and for this reason the "Zhirinovskiy in the patriotic movement" problem has become very pertinent, problem No. 1. I would very much like to understand a number of your statements and postulates and to listen to you not as a propagandist formulating a political cosmogony but as an experienced technologist because the political role you have chosen for yourself--No. 1 in the country, president--demands a knowledge of technology. And the task I have set myself is to listen to Zhirinovskiy primarily as a political technologist. You employ, like I myself and my friends, such a category as the Russian idea. In concise terms, the Russian idea in its contemporary interpretation amounts approximately to four or five positions. The first: Russia has to be vast--I refer to the spatial factor. The second: Russia is a polyethnic empire, and Russians, as the dominating people, are nonetheless open to other nations, that is, this is not some mono-ethnic fascist state. The third: Russia must under any system be a country of justice, it is embedded in the Russian idea. And the fourth: Russia is a religious country, a country of mystical search and a cosmic perception of the world. It is in these areas that I would like to talk with you. My first question, therefore, is this. You will agree that this escheated, cloven, diminished, and mongrel so-called Russian Federation is in no way Russia as such. Russia is an empire from Vladivostok, and you would say, to Belgrade even. What do you think, will this weakened, this castrated Russia once again assemble its territories? What political techniques do you see for the reconstitution of these super-expanses? [Zhirinovskiy] When the USSR was falling apart, I was very distressed. I thought that this was a tragedy. Now I believe that this was objective reality. It had to happen. For the real victory of the Russian idea we had to have the collapse of the artificial state of the USSR, in which Russians were swallowed up by the general masses, as in a musical ensemble in which the Russian violin was no longer audible: there are many other instruments, and the violin might go unnoticed altogether. We had to break up in order to tear off from primordial Russia that which was alien which had attempted to make it nondominant. The Baltic, Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia tower up, for example, everyone suddenly pays attention to them, and Russia and its interests are forgotten, as it were. We needed this explosion, an explosion without a war, in order that the skeleton of the Russian state might appear. This skeleton is associated with historical borders--everyone knows where the borders of the Russian Empire with living Russian people ran. The Dniester region, say--there is part of the skeleton, and there are Russian people. There is Estonia, there is Kazakhstan or Kushka, Ashkhabad. There are in our party's administrative machinery several boys from Ashkhabad, Russians. The mother remarried, the father went to Ukraine with someone else--and the Russian boy found himself homeless. The mother in Ashkhabad is abroad, the father in Ukraine is abroad. These are your new families. And they are everywhere, Russian people. It is they that show us the skeleton of the future Russian state, that is, this means the borders, at a minimum, of the USSR. At a minimum! Now about techniques. I was speaking about this long since. You can check this out, MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA some time in August 1988, an article against Novodvorskiy and myself. Such people as Novodvorskiy and Zhirinovskiy, it said, are well known for their antisocialist views and so forth. And what has Zhirinovskiy gone so far as to say? Russian needs to be awaken by blood!... I said this at an Armenian demonstration, near the Armenian Cemetery at Vagankovo. I said that you Armenians are now the victims of Sumgait, you have become victims so that the correct processes in the Transcaucasus might begin. Had Sumgait not happened, everything would have continued to molder on this way. The oppression of Armenians in Nagornyy Karabakh and its absorption by Azerbaijan would have continued, just as they swallowed up Nakhichevan: It used to be 100 percent Armenians there, now they constitute 5 percent. Nagornyy Karabakh--the same thing.... Unfortunately, in Russia also, for the Russian nation to be awaken, it could be awaken by blood. I said this at a time when October 1993 was not even close. Not because I am blood-thirsty. It is simply that the national consciousness and understanding of Russia and Rus have been so enfeebled that the words "Holy Rus" are perceived as a tale--once upon a time there was Holy Rus, some Russian folk heroes, the Russian Church.... What the West European world is doing today we did in 1921--the USSR: a commonwealth of countries and peoples, one language, and a single currency, remaining in principle different peoples, without borders. They are now doing this also, but in a somewhat different way. They simply cannot bring all this to a conclusion. They are afraid of depersonalization, they are afraid that in a commonwealth they will be "Europeans," but will not be, for example, Germans. There would no longer be marks but ECU's. The language would be half-English, half-German, half-French. They are afraid of becoming dissolved and of losing themselves, they are afraid that the influx of Turks, Arabs, Gypsies, Romanians, and others could bring about the degradation and disappearance of certain European nations. We have been fortunate in this respect. It is this component of Russia--its immense space--that enables us once again today to become a great state. And the Serbs told me: We want to be together with the Russians, and a new Slav Orthodox state and new East European community from Vladivostok to Knin--the southernmost Serbian city on the Adriatic coast--would then emerge. Here we are. There are 300-500 million of us in this space, and we have always lived there. We never came as aggressors, as barbarians, we did not destroy cultures--we uplifted them. The Kazakhs lived in tents, the family lived by grazing 20 sheep and was entirely self-sufficient--in food and woolen clothing. It lived without lighting, without books, without an alphabet, without indoor plumbing--without everything. People would sleep on the felt mat, they would cover themselves with the felt mat. It was sheep, man and sheep. All production was concentrated in this, no science, no culture, nothing. We raised up this people to cosmic heights! Russians, on the other hand, we are pulling down.... [Prokhanov] And how will you once again build into Russia these backward outlying areas--via the economy, via their inferiority complex, their ruin, via their internal conflicts and strife, via Russian arbitration, via Russian technology, via the Russian hostages who live there in enormous colonies?... How? [Zhirinovskiy] You yourself, Aleksandr Andreyevich, have answered this question, you yourself have said it all. This is how parties band together. You and I were not together, in one party, but we think identically. Via the economy and the space and the Russians living outside of the present Russian Federation precisely. After all, today, when Russians are leaving Ashkhabad, the ambulance service is ceasing to operate because the physicians were Russians. Russians are leaving Tajikistan, and the airplanes are no longer flying because the pilots were Russians. When the Russians have left altogether, everything will fall apart there, unfortunately. Engineers, economists, production specialists, doctors, architects, teachers--all were Russian specialists, and the Bolsheviks artificially made them deputies. The local was the top man, but it was the deputy, the Russian, who did everything. The top man merely drank tea: the Turkmen, the Tajik, the Uzbek, the Kazakh. The Russian deputy has left, and now everything is caving in.... When we stop the subsidies and sales at low prices, their economy will collapse in an instant. It is caving in already. Tajikistan is already asking back in, as are Georgia and Armenia and Azerbaijan. Even into this weak Russia! And if within a few years--two-four--we have raised it up, they will come running to us! But the military factor is obligatory here because they will clash with one another. Two worlds will collide in Central Asia: the Farsi-speaking, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and the Turkic-speaking, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan. Muslims--two schools here: Sunni and Shi'a--will clash. In the Transcaucasus Christian Armenians and Muslim Azerbaijanis have already clashed, and Christian Georgians and semi-Christian, semi-Muslim Abkhaz have clashed in Georgia. They have all collided already, they are all covered in blood. Were we to halt supplies and trade with them altogether--the end. No more of these states! We may be quite at ease here: In two or three years they would be imploring Russians to return. And they would come back in on the terms of territories, provinces, oblasts. One Russian family returned from Tbilisi a year ago. They said that slogans had appeared on the walls of houses: "Russians, don't go, who will bury the Georgians!" This is the quintessence. When the Georgians have understood that, yes, you can spit in the Russian's face, you can rape a Russian woman, you can drive out a Russian family, you can attack Russian soldiers, but the sole outcome of all this: Who will bury the Georgians? [Prokhanov] So reintegration will take place via the tragedy of these people? [Zhirinovskiy] Via their ruin! The death of millions of Tajiks, Georgians, Uzbeks. [Prokhanov] Is this, possibly, the inevitable price these peoples will have to pay to once again be taken into the fold of the empire? [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, precisely. [Prokhanov] Very well, now the second question. We have said that Russia, the Russian Empire, is a country open to all nations. Russian statehood was never ethnic. We built an empire such that the Russian factor neighbored the Tatar factor, and the Orthodox factor, the Muslim factor. This empire, rolling out the carpet, as it were, encompassed a multitude of faiths and peoples without suppressing them. And now, as I recall from your statements and books, the statehood we are beginning to build will contain traditional features--from the states of Kiev and Muscovy and from tsarism and the empire, that is, formations open to other nations. The Russian dominant essentially presupposes the equality of all nations before the law, before the sovereign, before the territory, before history. This is how it is. But there is this paradox. Here is this dreadful destruction that has befallen us, and the calamities that are to come, that still lie ahead, will be the most dreadful, perhaps. They will require the maximum efforts, colossal sacrifices, essentially, for the revival of our motherland. And these efforts and sacrifices may be made by that same Russian people. Speaking of the equality of the nations before history, therefore, we understand full well that once again incumbent upon Russians will be the immense mission of the creation of this new statehood. And this is not some maniacal approach, what is more, but historical necessity, expediency. We cannot live without an outlet to the Pacific, we cannot live without geopolitical passes through the Dzuunhaar Gate, we cannot live without outlets to the Baltic and the Gulf stream. Do you realize that in constantly repeating "Russians first," "Russians at the center of policy," "the Russian state for the Russians" we are thereby saying: Russians, prepare for sacrifices, Russians, prepare for great building, Russians, prepare for the utterance of yet one more great Russian song? The 20th century was essentially the Russian century--Russians in Africa, Russians in Latin America, Russians at the poles, in space, on the ocean floor.... And will the 21st century be a Russian century also? [Zhirinovskiy] It is here that a new factor, which was not used by the communists at the final stage, when it was clear that there would be no communist world, emerges. The democrats have not made use of it either. We need to make sure that we Russians are paid for the fact that we have saved the world from a general catastrophe--a possible World War III--environmental also. We must show the world that we will not again sacrifice the Russian people just like that. We must force them to first pay us for the sacrifices we have borne, for the fact that they contributed to the destruction of the Russian state. Only on the basis of this will we move ahead. And for this we must make use of the remnants of the Russian Empire and the communist USSR--the powerful military industry, the powerful weapons, and the heroic spirit of the Russian people, but without exposing Russian boys' heads to the bullet or putting our daughters in the beds of all the bordellos of Europe. Via, precisely, the powerful factor of a revival of Russian military industry, when the world would be bound to be in a state of the constant possibility of a terrible war. We would not start it, but the West must understand that to prevent this happening it needs to pay today, to repay its debts to the Russians. I said to the Germans: Why are you paying the Jews, 6 million of them perished? You are paying Israel tremendous amounts annually. They said: Israel means Zionism on a world scale, we have to do this because we are afraid of the further Zionization of Germany, but the Russians, they are no threat to us.... This was a mistake--the withdrawal of our army from Germany. A half million-strong Russian army would be there now also had it not been withdrawn by Gorbachev and Shevardnadze, who pocketed enormous sums--for the pullout of our army and the start of the collapse of East Europe and the collapse of the USSR. We should be telling the Germans today: First pay us for the 26 million dead, then at the start of the century, by the year 2010, possibly, you will reunite with East Germany. But we gave up everything--and for pennies. Kohl offered to pay Gorbachev 10 times more, made the offer himself. Gorbachev said: That's okay. What is this if not treachery? While we still have possibilities, therefore, and we do, we need to start to act. And I absolutely do not believe that Russia might perish, that we will not manage. We will get out, we are already getting out of the situation. For in terms of spirituality the Orthodox world is first today. The West has become completely demoralized. It has nothing left but McDonalds, pornography, and this brutal rationalism: buy-sell, how much, if you have money, you are somebody, if not, you are nobody. The East has its own specific features. It is far removed from us. We cannot be Buddhists. Shintoism, Krishnaism, Hinduism--all this is far removed from us, a different civilization. Nor does the Muslim faith suit us because for them we are the infidel. It is an exploit for them to kill us, the infidel, or to compel us to become Muslims by force. Ours, that of Orthodox, Slavs, remains the sole spiritual world, therefore. And we live compactly. Were we to live in Australia, South Africa, Latin America, we would all perish, there would be no Russians. But Slavs and Orthodox, we truly live by one territory. Even today the Poles, knowing that I am prepared to treat with the Germans for the return of Prussia, are agreeing to negotiate: They understand that they would lose part of Poland, that it is better to go over to the Russians and retain Gdansk, not Danzig, retain Szczecin, not Stettin, Wroclaw, not Breslau. It is this that we have to compel them to do. And I have done so! I, no one as yet, have forced them to do it today--prior to the 12 December elections. They have already taken fright.... The Finnish Army has been arming for two years now because they have been saying there: If Zhirinovskiy comes to power, the return of Finland as part of the empire is possible. I do not want this, but they are afraid. Today they, the Finns, have a poorer life than we do. When I was there, in 1990, they had 50,000 unemployed, today, 350,000. And the Finnish Army is consuming several times more. We have forced them by theory alone, not practice, only theory and a different foreign policy concept, to change, we have made them poorer and weaker! The Turkish Army has today halted demobilization. I do not command the army yet, I am not yet president, but merely having read my book, they have delayed the mobilization [as published] of 1 million Turks--the strongest army on this flank of NATO, trained for an assault on the Caucasus and Central Asia. I am nobody as yet, but with this spirit and this new ideology we have forced neighboring countries to change their policy--both foreign and domestic. The whole of Serbia carried posters, I am forced to say this, and they affirm: "Peter the Great II has come!" They, the Serbs, compare me with Peter I. I have never compared myself with him, of course, I am not a fanatic, and I have no plans to be a chief, to be a great figure. But they, the Serbs, say: "Vladimir, be the leader of the Slav peoples!" They gave me a document attesting the creation of a cultural-political center of Slav states, and they are imploring me to be its president. So it is that we are winning here even today. But if tomorrow I am in the Kremlin, I assure you, just three months, and all the independent states will have collapsed. Because Kravchuk, for example, is saying: Let's do it today, while Yeltsin is in Moscow, tomorrow it will be Zhirinovskiy--that will be it, there will be no sovereign Ukraine. The Tatars in Kazan are saying the same thing. They will understand the mere fact of my accession to power thus: It's all over, there is only the Russian state. Nazarbayev switched television off when I appeared during the elections. Fifteen million inhabitants of Kazakhstan were deprived of the opportunity to watch Ostankino television merely because I was speaking! I was still only a candidate for deputy of the State Duma, and they were already afraid, trembling nervously, and already packing their bags! This is a psychological factor. They know there was a great Russia, the Russian Empire, and that a party has appeared that is saying plainly: "We will restore the borders of the Russian state, but peacefully." Hearing a new, tough Russian language, with a different vocabulary, they are already afraid. Several persons in Turkmenia, fanatics, have already sentenced me to death. A mullah in Ufa has been collecting money to hire an assassin and have me killed. Information has also been received from Zionist circles in Europe. They met and said: We have made an accurate computation--the future president in Russia will be Zhirinovskiy. No one will beat him again, no one. There is just one thing for it--his physical removal. Only this.... Others are attempting bribes. Some $100 million are being offered for me to quit politics. Talk about a factor! I am still nobody, I am the leader of a faction, which has only 64 deputies out of 450, not even half the deputies, not even one-third, are mine, and they are already so afraid that they are prepared to kill me or pay me off. But they forget that killing would mean causing a terrible wave of anti-Semitism throughout Europe. The Jews would be wiped out completely, they would be burned everywhere--in Germany, in Serbia, in Russia.... Buying me is impossible--I am not for sale. Once again, the greatness of the Russian spirit. Were I a Lutheran, were I, say, a Protestant, a Catholic, they would buy me. A hundred million--you could live your whole life on the interest, your whole family, at the best resorts of Europe. I shall not sell myself, however, even if the entire budget of all the Zionists is offered. I do not want their money. I want the homeland, my fatherland. I will stand in a torn coat, stand on Russian soil, so that the Russian flag fly and this be our country! It is this that they cannot understand, that they cannot get.... [Prokhanov] Truly, giant potential is, evidently, bottled up in our people. They are prevented from showing what they are capable of, they are continually being beaten down, driven into the dust, into the earth. So that were this potential to be revealed, an absolutely new situation, global situation, would arise, as would that resource with which it would once again be possible to marshal an empire and throw funds into a breakthrough into the technotronic era, into a new civilization. And, as far as I understand it, this entire potential, being realized, would, truly, force the world to pay its arrears for World War II and for this immense cordon we have erected along the Urals and for that essentially mystical energy which Russia is continually reproducing in the world. Have I understood you correctly? [Zhirinovskiy] Yes. It was for this great breakthrough that the potential of the great nation, which has been struggling continuously for a thousand years, was created. We will break through for the added reason that the Mongols were here for 300 years, because Charles XII was here, there was Napoleon, there were the German fascists, and 30 wars with Turkey. This is embedded in the blood of each Slavic, Russian boy raised on this history. It is all this that will produce an explosion. When I was in Serbia, I saw combatants of the Serbian Unity Party--these Orthodox boys in black uniforms. This is it, the new Orthodox army! These are men condemned to die, they will sweep aside all in their path. And these are Serbs, a small people, a small country! And were Russian boys to rise up this way, with our great science, with our tremendous military potential, with our missiles, with our Buran, with our tanks and vertical-takeoff aircraft, with our new weapons! The world would tremble. After all, I alone have caused so much clamor, take a look at the press for December 1993--they all went mad! I merely amassed 13 percent in the Duma, and the world is already going mad! They have all already taken fright. They have come to a halt because they have seen the new Russia. Even if this might well not be in my person. But they have sensed the beginning of the collapse: of both socialist Russia and pseudo-democratic Russia, and that the new Russian state is emerging. This is putting them in all in a fearful quiver for it is smashing all their plans. [Prokhanov] All that you say impresses the Russian imperialist and the Russian nationalist and the Russian patriot. This is, most likely, correct. Now tell us about the third postulate of the Russian idea. This is the proposition concerning justice. Truly, "God is not in strength but in truth," God is not in a vertical-takeoff aircraft but, in some relationship of the pilot and copilot, probably, or the sailor, who puts this craft into the air and brings it in, lacerated, onto the deck of the carrier. What do you think, what path will the building of Russian statehood take? What will it be--tsarism, a monarchy, a dictatorship, a country of presidents, a country with a chief, a parliamentary republic, an assembly, a town meeting? After all, Russia has tremendous experience of state building and a multitude of options. One collapses, another jumps to the surface. And embedded in all this is the idea of fraternity, the idea of mutual assistance--give the last crumb to your loved one, give the last shirt off your back. What do you think, will the principle of justice be embedded in the institution of state power? [Zhirinovskiy] I am a supporter of the modern form of government here. I am not a monarchist. I understand that monarchy and Orthodoxy were the basis of the Russian Empire. But, nonetheless, I believe that to call the head of state the Russian tsar, in a polyethnic state, would today be something of an impediment for us. Were there a purely Russian state, there would be the town meeting, the tsar--everything Russian. But considering the polyethnic composition of the population, it is better to take the international form in the shape of a presidential republic. He could be called in Russian chairman of the republic, as with the Chinese. This would be easier for the world, the word "empire" is intimidating. It is a good word, Russia needs it, but it intimidates part of the populace, just like the idea of communism--also not bad in itself but it intimidated people by the methods of its implementation. We should keep the word "republic," we should keep the form of presidential republic where the head of state has the greater powers for parliament with us will willy-nilly become polyethnic, and we will have, like it or not, to decide questions of the territories there. The nationality issue will arise. And we provisionally need a strong executive so that we not deliberate but execute, and swiftly, within the framework of the law, because certain questions simply cannot be raised within the framework of parliament. The treaty with Georgia today, for example. We don't need it. The president is wrong, he is making a mistake in concluding a treaty with Georgia. But this is not what I'm talking about. Had this issue been discussed in parliament, this would have evoked, in Georgia, for example, many reasons for not approving it. Let us look at this event from the other side. Let us imagine that the president was someone else, that he was myself. Shevardnadze calls Yeltsin: Let's conclude a treaty, look at what's happening, help me, save me, we were, after all, in the Politburo together. He would not talk to me this way because he and I were not in the Politburo together. This is what the idea of a new president consists of! So that Shevardnadze, Aliyev, Karimov, Nazarbayev cannot bring it up: We are party comrades, we were in the same Central Committee, help me, as a party comrade. The "party comrades" business is over! With me there would be one thing: We are the Russian state. We will accept you, certainly, as Tiflis Province. Certainly, we could agree provisionally to you, Eduard Amvrosiyevich, being governor of this province. But it would be even better were there a Russian there.... But the way in which this is happening today--the attempt to reconstitute the amorphous CIS in the form of the former model of the USSR--we don't need this. The state, therefore, should be only Russian, only a republic. God forbid that we have some autonomies, republics within Russia. Only provinces--40 large provinces. We are now 160 million--4 million in each. If we get back the former territories, we will be 300 million, that is, this would be approximately 80 provinces with a purely administrative division. Forget about national state formations within our state! This would then be a modern republic with a strong presidential regime, a strong parliament, and a strong government. And, in addition, another judicial system--we need to return to the jury system, where the best people of the city--about 20 persons--decide, and a highly skilled legal expert formalizes this decision. It is Russian statehood that is needed, and it is in this that this goodness of ours and our attitude toward the peoples, which we did not destroy, consists. We made mistakes here and there. Destroying was out of the question, but so was elevating them artificially, belittling Russians here. Only that which was surplus should have been given. But under no circumstances the very last thing. It was this goodness of ours that was excessive. And here is the drawback of the Mongol invasion. When the Russian was down to his last shirt and went against the conqueror with his spear, he could, indeed, share his last crust. But seven centuries have gone by. We are not the same. We cannot today undertake the privatization of forests for the Yakuts so that they might have hunting grounds on private property. Three Yakuts would have 10,000 square kilometers of forest, and 9 million-strong Krasnodar Kray, where Russians live, would have nothing. Privatization would not come off on a national basis either. We are Russia--one state. [Prokhanov] You mentioned that Russia and the Slav world have a mysterious inexhaustible spiritual energy. As though we derive this energy from our valleys, expanses, and rivers, from history, from space, and this is, evidently, as giant a resource, as much a source of wealth, more even, perhaps, as uranium, as production itself, as, iron, steel, and the professional skills of the nation. It is very often asked what kind of system for Russia you see in the future: communist, bourgeois, mixed, primitive-communal.... In actual fact, the future will most likely be an absolutely new civilization, which will not lend itself to such classical descriptions. And this potential of spirituality--awareness of God, sensory perception, and use of the colossal elements of history and the nation--will essentially become the driving factor of society, the body politic. New ethics, new environmental consciousness. When the perception of the life of grass, a rock, or a river, like the life of your own family.... So if we are speaking of this component of religious, mystical, and scientific cognition, which will become the principal resource for the future state and which Russia possesses like no other nation--how will you avail yourself of this resource in the building of the future body politic? Primarily, of course, the economy, plants, the organization of the plants--and how will this be? Will the country be ruled by an oligarchy or, on the other hand, an equals sign?... How do you conceptualize this new civilization in your program of future restoration? [Zhirinovskiy] The equalizing principle is just is some places. A person is born and wants to have good clothes, a good house, good food. But economics requires that gifted people get more, for all that. Not because he needs black caviar, but it is simply that he has to see this appreciation of his labor in order to work harder and do more for others. Remuneration not on a party basis, it is not the communist who should receive more, not the mafioso, not the partocrat but the gifted individual, in any sphere: the gifted cabdriver, the gifted janitor, the gifted manager, the gifted scientist. We must pay talent in any sphere. This must be a rule of the evaluation of labor.... I go abroad. Everyone knows and talks about us: Dostoyevskiy, Pushkin, Tchaikovsky. Throughout the world, the names of great Russians are known everywhere. Everyone knows Lenin also, Stalin--although with the blood and violence there--they know him, then space--Gagarin.... Russia has influenced the world consciousness to such an extent that any country will name someone Russian for you. About Poles--nothing of the sort. I know Oginski's polonaise, I like it, the rest are not known. Or Bulgaria--some people simply do not know that there is such a country. We are already putting pressure on the whole world psychologically, for we have in some respects become engraved on the consciousness of all of mankind. But for this new Russian state we must have an additional source of financing in order to more quickly raise up research and our education. We need to clear out all the inter-nation higher educational institutions. No University of Friendship of the Peoples--a Russian national university! And we must teach our children--Russians, Slavs. Why are we teaching tribes which are returning to Africa and destroying one another? They are, after all, still cannibals, and we are teaching them! Had we ourselves assimilated the entire potential which the communists threw virtually free of charge into assistance to the world--Cuba, Nicaragua, Laos, Vietnam, Africa--we would be a very rich state. We need to stop helping others. We need to stop temporarily being kind. Let us be kind to ourselves and think about ourselves a little. Let us be kinder among ourselves--we are, after all, Slavs, Russians, Orthodox. Let us get by without helping those who are living better than us. If we stop feeding people who today have a hostile attitude toward us, we will win automatically! Nationalism has today been imposed artificially. Were we to halt supplies of Russian timber to Central Asia, all their construction projects would come to a halt. They would be left roofless, without homes. They should know: We would not perish without Uzbek cotton, Egyptian cotton is of better quality, and the Egyptians still owe us for the Aswan Dam. We would obtain cotton from Iraq, Iraq owes us too. But Uzbeks without Russian timber--that would be it, the end. The end for all of Central Asia--Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzia and Tajikistan. The Transcaucasus particularly--they have all been living on subsidies. Within the next 10 years the new Russian state will be a leading light. Delegations of dying nations, worn out and bled white by a lengthy war, epidemic disease, and gangster raids, will be applying to join us--standing in line to get into the Kremlin, to see another president. They will beseech the president of Russia to incorporate them as a territorial unit within Russia. We can do all this only thanks to the existing Russian industry, science, and culture. We need only a different form of government. To free ourselves from the vestiges of the communist past and this entire fraudulent democracy and to return to the best that had been accumulated in the Russian Empire, to some of the positive aspects in the communist USSR, to some positive endeavors at this time. We have some pluralism, for all that. Despite all these bloody events, Russia is still without civil war. There is somewhat of this in the North Caucasus and in the Transcaucasus, but it is not taking place on the territory of Russia. We have been able to negotiate this tight spot. Even today more than half the Russian Parliament practically is composed of the new, patriotic Russia. Five of the eight traitor-ministers have already left the government, just three remain. I will name them: Kozyrev, Chubays, Shokhin. Just three out of 23! And there are a further 56 committees, that is, out of the almost 80 members of the government, just three traitor-ministers. This is negligible! And the most repulsive faction of deputies consists of just 76 persons. Out of 450! Were they to unite, there would be 150 of them, but no more. And 300 are different deputies. We have already won! And the Russian Army is already restoring its might, our new MiG's are the fastest fighters, and no one has surpassed our Buran. In half an hour it can deliver a 60-tonne payload to any part of the planet. The Americans do not have anything like this. We have the necessary power today even. We need only a conclusive change of political leadership. We will restore what we had and will develop further. Our scientists will return, our daughters will return, our boys will return from all the "flash points," families will be restored, and our economic potential will begin to work. The Serbs are saying: We will clothe you and feed you, give us your raw material. Our chemical plants are at a standstill, you used to supply us with phosphates, let us have them today. India is saying: Let us have 100 submarines, and we will clothe you and feed you. Saddam Husayn said to me: I don't understand you, I owe you $10 billion--take it. Why don't you take it? Were we to revise our foreign and domestic policy a little and take what we are being given, being implored to take, this in itself would have an enormous effect. But we need to quit the blockade of Iraq and the blockade of Yugoslavia and to restore normal relations with India, China, Japan. And we would resolve all our problems! Two or three years, and Russia would be unrecognizable. But for this one last step is needed--elections to the Russian Parliament once more, elections for the president of Russia once more. That's all! [Prokhanov] I am most grateful to you for the interview. I have deliberately not commented on what you have said, merely asked you questions. And you have stated your ideas frankly and with absolute candor. I believe that what you have to say will be of interest to the readers of my newspaper and to patriotic intellectuals, who are concentrated around the newspaper, in general. I repeat: I have no desire to comment on it, to dress it up. Here is Zhirinovskiy extempore, in this interview.... But the final, very brief, question. When do you plan the breakthrough into the Kremlin? What difficulties do you expect on this path and when do you intend to concentrate your entire willpower and your entire party machinery and potential for this surge? A push not to the South but to the Cathedral of the Assumption.... [Zhirinovskiy] We will officially begin our campaign on 2 April--the party's fifth congress. We will begin a furious campaign for elections both for a new parliament and for the president of Russia. Some fall of 1994 option is entirely possible, I believe.... [Prokhanov] Your intuition tells you this, as a political improvisation? [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, yes, this is possible. The fall could once again bring surprises. When we put on one more spurt and the Kremlin is finally purged of anti-Russian forces.
