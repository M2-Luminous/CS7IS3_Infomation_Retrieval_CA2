While visiting the Golden Triangle, the SISA team learned that a Korean man has been working for Khun Sa and that Khun Sa's international narcotics organization has selected Korea and Japan as its "next heroin markets" because heroin supply routes to the United States have become increasingly dangerous, while Korea and Japan are easily accessible by sea. Korean smugglers already use the open seas as smuggling routes to transport gems, aged teak roots, tiger skin, bear's gall bladers, etc. from Southeast Asia. The Korean Government reportedly has no means of stemming the flow of heroin into the country. The SISA team is urging the government to shift its attention from philopon (crystal methamphetamine) to Khun Sa's heroin.
