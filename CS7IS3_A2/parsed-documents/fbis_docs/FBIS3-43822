The PAC's armed wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Front, APLA, is against the negotiated package of reforms, and attacks police officers and predominantly white venues in its fight against white rule. The PAC's decision follows widespread condemnation of its violent tactics from within and outside South Africa, including Tanzania, which on Tuesday [11 January] barred APLA from launching attacks from its territory. On the line to Johannesburg, Audrey Brown asked Thobile Gola, deputy secretary general of the PAC, why they have decided to suspend the armed struggle now. [Begin recording] [Gola] Now that the Electoral Act was promulgated this week, we had to prepare ourselves for elections, and it is not feasible that you shoot this side and you campaign for elections this side. For the sake of peace and free and fair elections we wanted the PAC to be cleared of all forms of hostilities or so-called violence, so that they will remove all excuses that will deny the PAC an opportunity to participate freely in the elections. [Brown] Could the adverse [word indistinct] are recent, and I say to you: The question of the PAC pursuing negotiations on the ending of hostilities started as far back as 1990. So, we are not really influenced by any recent bad publicity or attacks on white people. The PAC has all along been working toward a mutual ending of all hostilities by all the parties in conflict -- that is, the regime and APLA in this case. But, that has not worked out. But now we are facing elections. It is our own decision to participate, and therefore we decided today to declare what we call a unilateral moratorium on armed struggle. [Brown] So, does that mean that in your negotiations with the government you did not obtain mutual cessation of hostilities, as you call it? [Gola] It has not been formally agreed. The negotiations with the regime will continue. We shall pursue those negotiations to reach a formal mutual cessation and get all that we need from them -- the amnesty for all those people who are in prison and all those who are still in exile, and, of course, talk about what to do with the armed formations in the country. That agenda still stands and the regime was been dillydallying all the time when we demanded these meetings. [Brown] But doesn't this weaken your position, the fact that you suspended your armed struggle now, because it seems like your main trump card against them was that you could launch attacks against them? [Gola] No, our position is not weakened at all. The first thing you must understand is that by declaring ourselves ready to go to elections, we needed a climate of peace in the country. We feel that we are not weakened. Actually, we are strengthening our position by taking that direction. [Brown] But it is possible to see that in another light. It is possible to see it in the sense that the PAC is coming under growing pressure and it is losing support by pursuing an armed struggle and that is why you had to declare your suspension now? [Gola] I am not sure about losing support. I do not know from whom are we losing support. We are pursuing a program here, and a decision was taken by the highest organ of the PAC to prepare for elections. [Brown] Is there a sense of sadness in the PAC or amongst people that the armed struggle has been given up, because it seems like it was, you know, one of the things that the organization prided itself in, in that it was fighting back, it was fighting the South African Government? [Gola] I have not received any report to say some people feel bad about it or feel sad, and therefore I am not worried about whatever fears you might have. [end recording]
