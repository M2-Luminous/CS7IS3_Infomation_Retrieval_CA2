"I am deeply moved by what we have just experienced at the opening of the congress. The sincere elite, which took the initiative 16 years ago in establishing the first human rights movement not only in Tunisia but also in the Arab world, in Africa, and beyond--that elite would never have thought that one day we would be experiencing moments like those we have just witnessed. It was my duty to say this to you because that is what I deeply feel." That was how Hassib Ben Ammar, president of the Arab Institute of Human Rights and one of the LTDH founding fathers, addressed members and congressional delegates from the rostrum of the fourth LTDH Congress. In a trembling voice, he expressed and showed his emotion and pain at the distressing spectacle the LTDH made of itself before its members and everyone else during the first few minutes of a congress that was supposed to have marked the organization's rebirth. Flashback: In an electric atmosphere and in the presence of 24 other members of the LTDH Managing Committee--their faces as tense and somber as his own--Moncef Marzouki, the organization's president, stepped before a microphone and, surprisingly, began singing the national anthem. The audience hesitated a moment before singing along with the LTDH president--whose action seemed intended as a response to those who, in his own words, say that he is "a tool of foreign interests"--but join in it did. Then Marzouki said: "With head held high, I open this congress, the fourth congress of the Tunisian Human Rights League." He immediately launched into a severe indictment of the government's policy on individual and collective freedoms and human rights. In passing, he responded to the criticisms leveled at him by certain people and their accusations concerning him--including the charge, which he himself mentioned, that he had not sought consensus. The speech by the LTDH president was not to the liking of a great many people, and among his colleagues on the Managing Committee, Vice President Khemais Chammari was the first to show his displeasure and express it loudly. As soon as it became evident to him that the LTDH president--who had long been complaining to anyone who would listen that he was being "deprived of the right to speak"--was not going to simply welcome the key personalities invited by the LTDH to the opening session of its fourth congress, Khemais Chammari stood up and went to sit in the second row on the rostrum. It was a way of expressing his reservations about the speech being delivered by the LDTH president, and Hichem Gribaa soon followed suit by leaving the rostrum altogether. "So many hardships endured by this league...." When he realized that the LTDH president was going to take his sweet time, Khemais Chammari let his anger burst into the open and began protesting Moncef Marzouki's attitude. That is what he and other members of the Managing Committee had threatened to do if Marzouki did not prepare his speech--supposedly to be delivered in the name of the Managing Committee--and submit it to the other committee members for their approval. Their vain attempts to get him to do so had been evaded by Marzouki on various grounds during the three weeks preceding the congress. In Amilcar on Day "J-1," the members of the Managing Committee returned to the attack. This time Moncef Marzouki flatly refused to comply, then changed his mind and promised to prepare a text and submit it on Saturday just before the congress opened. But the congress was scheduled to open at 1000, and the LDTH president did not arrive in Amilcar until 0940. That made it impossible for the Managing Committee to meet and pin down the text of the opening speech. It was on the steps of the hall where the congress was to meet that the president of the LTDH let a member of the Managing Committee in on the contents of the speech he prepared. But that member realized afterward that the league's president had, in fact, read only the first two or three pages of the speech to him, and there was almost nothing offensive in those pages. The speech of the LDTH president antagonized not only his colleagues on the Managing Committee but also some of the guests, especially Yadh El Ouedreni, minister-adviser to the chief of state for human rights; Minister of National Education Mohamed Charfi; and Hatem Ben Othman, deputy secretary general of the Constitutional Democratic Rally, all three of whom left the congress auditorium as a sign of protest against the speech by the LDTH president. At that point, chaos broke out. An infuriated Khemais Chammari was less and less able to control his anger. For his part, Moncef Marzouki began translating his own speech from Arabic into French--even though three interpreters hired by the LTDH were in the auditorium. Then, imperceptibly, the LDTH president began speaking more in French and giving only a condensed translation in Arabic, as though the ambassadors and the representatives of international organizations became, as Hassib Ben Ammar put it, his main audience and the congress delegates merely a secondary group of listeners. Following a brief interruption, Moncef Marzouki resumed the reading of his speech after Taoufik Bouderbala, LDTH secretary-general, stepped in to ask the audience to stop interrupting the speaker. In a voice hoarse with emotion, the LDTH president offered "the apologies of the league, because I was a man prevented from speaking for months." That brought another interruption by Khemais Chammari: "My brothers and sisters, the problem is simple: up until this morning we had not read the text. Moncef refused. This has been going on for five years. Unfortunately, he rejects collective action." There was a second attempt by the LTDH secretary-general to calm a number of delegates standing up for Moncef Marzouki: "No, no, please; our work is not going to progress normally and be profitable if this keeps up. Please let him finish. This is not the way the league is in the habit of opening its congresses. We have only one objective, and that is to preserve the league, preserve its unity and independence, and make the congress a success." The LTDH president resumed his speech, but again he was interrupted by several members of the Managing Committee, who reminded Marzouki that there was no need for him to translate his own speech. Suddenly the LDTH president changed his tone and attitude. He dropped a bombshell: "In order to help the league, I am informing you officially and definitely that I have decided to withdraw my candidacy for the Managing Committee and the presidency of the league, and the reason is what you have just witnessed in this auditorium. I am withdrawing from this congress, and I call on you to continue the struggle." Before carrying out his decision, the outgoing president of the league made a gesture intended to give the thumbs up to his friends and allies, calling on the congress to support "the militant, progressive, and independence-minded league" and to elect "a leadership made up of the most courageous men and women in order to face up to this difficult situation." Some of the delegates halfheartedly opposed Moncef Marzouki's decision, but a Managing Committee member shouted to him that: "there is not going to be a plebiscite." While refusing to speak himself, Taoufik Bouderbala offered the opportunity to those members of the Managing Committee who wanted to say something. Frej Fennich accepted that responsibility and the risk it involved. He spoke mainly in response to Moncef Marzouki. Unlike the outgoing president of the LTDH, who spoke in the first person singular, Frej Fennich spoke on behalf of all the members of the Managing Committee. So while Moncef Marzouki claimed to have his "head held high," Frej Fennich claimed that "with heads held high and on behalf of the LTDH Managing Committee, we collectively welcome the congress delegates and guests." Frej Fennich directed another shaft at Moncef Marzouki when he proclaimed that "the league is the league of all Tunisians," that "we thought we had left the era of personal power behind," and that "the congress delegates are sovereign." Helped by Hassib Ben Ammar, the members of the Managing Committee were able to restore calm in the auditorium. After first announcing, it is true, an effort to persuade Moncef Marzouki to come back into the auditorium. The LTDH president eventually agreed. But once back on the rostrum, he stated firmly: "I am not withdrawing my decision to withdraw my candidacy. And I do not take back a single thing I have said." At the end of the opening session, Moncef Marzouki left the congress auditorium and the hotel. And he did not set foot in it again. His absence when deliberations resumed intrigued his friends. Worried by his prolonged absence, they briefly considered informing the delegates of "Moncef Marzouki's disappearance." Most members of the Managing Committee opposed the idea. Some of them, including Hassib Ben Ammar, contacted several members of the government by telephone. The latter informed them that the authorities concerned did not know where Moncef Marzouki was. His whereabouts were learned early that evening: he had simply gone back to his home in Sousse.
