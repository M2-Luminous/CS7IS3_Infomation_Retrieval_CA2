"The direction remains unchanged," Fujii said, referring to earlier promises by the government and the ruling parties to draft concrete full-fledged tax reform bills by the end of this month. Fujii made the comments to reporters after the day's regularly scheduled cabinet meeting. He was also clarifying recent comments by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata regarding the "conclusion" and "direction" of the tax reform also promised in the March market-opening package to be detailed by the end of June. The United States is closely waiting for the decision after pressuring Japan to continue with 5.5 trillion yen in income tax cuts now limited to the current fiscal year as a measure to boost domestic demand and curb the trade surplus. Regarding concrete figures, especially on a tax rate hike, Fujii said his ministry as "an administrative body" expects the bills to include them. He also reiterated his unchanged policy for enacting a tax hike and offsetting tax cuts in a single package to avoid the "untreated" issuance of deficit-covering bonds. U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who had criticized the planned tax hike, recently eased his stance to accept Japan's plan to separate tax cuts and a hike "substantially" for at least three years. The government and the ruling parties decided to issue "stopgap" red-ink bonds to finance the single-year tax cuts with a promise to decide on full-fledged tax reform after scrapping the 7 percent "national welfare tax" plan announced in February by then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Hosokawa's plan was seen as stemming from strong opposition by the finance minister over deficit-covering bonds. With the promised tax reform, Fujii noted that he expects a net tax revenue increase with tax cuts and a hike to fund welfare spending because of Japan's aging society. The Tax Commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister, asked the ministry to take into account conditions for a net tax revenue increase for the recently issued "mechanical calculations" on revenue estimates in fiscal 2000 under the tax reform, Fujii said. The ministry's estimates called for a three-year time lag between 6.2 trillion yen in tax cuts and a consumption tax hike, and cited a tax hike to above 6 percent from the current 3 percent as the only way to attain a net revenue increase. "But I don't know what the panel will do with its report" slated to be issued soon, Fujii added. Meanwhile, the ruling coalition parties issued a report Thursday, saying a consumption tax hike is inevitable with the aging society. Fujii said discussions in the government and ruling parties are progressing smoothly toward drafting the bills by the end of June. But uncertainties remain as panel and coalition sources have said concrete figures might not be included to avoid disputes with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) which is sensitive to the issue of hiking the consumption tax. The SDP departed the ruling camp in April when the Hata cabinet was formed, thus giving the coalition shaky minority rule.
