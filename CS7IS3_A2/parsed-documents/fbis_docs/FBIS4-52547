"We cannot but raise a question about such behaviour of the United States," he said. "Making frequent visits to Mideast countries in late April and early May, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher put pressure on Arab countries to withdraw their economic sanctions against Israel," the spokesman noted, and went on: "While trying to get economic sanctions lifted on Israel which is threatening peace in the Middle East with nuclear weapons, the United States is blaring that "sanctions" will be taken against the DPRK which has no nuclear weapons in actuality. This is a reversed logic and the undisguised application of double standard to the international relations. "This contradictory act of the United States makes it plain that the `nuclear issue' over which it is raising a hue and cry is a fiction invented by it for the sinister political aim of isolating and stifling the DPRK. "The United States must not apply a double standard to the solution of international issues including the nuclear issue. "The world people will approach with high vigilance the unjust act of the United States which is trying to impose its unilateral assertion on others, ignoring the stand of the parties concerned, styling itself the international police."
