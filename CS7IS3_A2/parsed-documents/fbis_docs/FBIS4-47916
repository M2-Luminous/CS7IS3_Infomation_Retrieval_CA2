This was stated today by Tanzanian Foreign Minister Joseph Rwegasira following the two-day session in Arusha which was convened again by the special facilitator in the Rwandan crisis, President Ali Hassan Mwinyi. The meetings were chaired by the prime minister and first vice president, Honorable John Malecela, on behalf of President Mwinyi, and were attended by representatives of the interim Government of Rwanda and the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]. Minister Rwegasira said that Malecela met and held talks separately with both sides because the RPF delegation refused to sit at the same table as the Rwandan interim government delegation. Minister Rwegasira added that although the government delegation signed the peace proposal tabled by the facilitator, the RPF refused to sign it but they were ready to stop fighting as proposed. [passage omitted including indistinct portion] Despite refusing to sign the agreement, the RPF has agreed to implement it with effect from the day after tomorrow, 7 May in the areas it occupies throughout the country. The final signing ceremony was attended by the OAU secretary- general Dr. Salim Ahmad Salim, representatives of all the Western ambassadors in Tanzania, and other observers from the member countries of the UN Security Council. Hon. Malecela returned to Dodoma town today.
