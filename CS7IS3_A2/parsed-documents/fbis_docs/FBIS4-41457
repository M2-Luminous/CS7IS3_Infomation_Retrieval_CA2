Chernomyrdin was confident that the Jackson-Vanik amendment would be declared null and void and that there was no chance for the emergence of a new COCOM [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] which jeopardized bilateral relations by introducing restrictions on high tech trade. But, Chernomyrdin said, the United States and Russia no longer showed critical difference of views. Nonetheless, he said, the Gore-Chernomyrdin commission was planning to submit a few issues, for example, health care, to the attention of the Russian and US presidents. Chernomyrdin said that 22 Russian-US agreements and 4 agreements between Russia and the World Bank, including those on loans and to the agrarian sector and banking system, for the total worth of half a billion US dollars, were signed during his visit to the United States. Chernomyrdin said 400-million-dollar deals were concluded for cooperation in outer space. And, he said, the two countries had come very close to the conclusion of another batch of space cooperation agreements, for the total worth of 300 Mn dlrs. Chernomyrdin compared his visit to the United States and talks with President Clinton to Boris Yeltsin's visit to the island of Corfu where a partnership and cooperation agreement was signed between Russia and the European Union. In Chernomyrdin's view, the Russian-EU agreement would help Russia promote new relations with the European nations and belonged in the packet of documents he signed in the United States. Both President Yeltsin and the Russian government envisaged the stage-by-stage incorporation of Russia into the European Union, Chernomyrdin said. This stage called for Yeltsin's participation in the political part of the G-7 summit, scheduled to be held in July in Naples. Chernomyrdin made special mention of his talks with the General Motors Corporation which, he said, would like to cooperate with Russia and launch joint projects with the VAZ and ElAZ car plants. It was about time we stopped talking, Chernomyrdin said, and switched over to practical action. Chernomyrdin hoped that Monday's session of the government's consultative investment council would enable Russia and its western partners to replace negotiations with practical action.
