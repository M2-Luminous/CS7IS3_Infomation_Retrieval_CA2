Many American companies, he added, are now urging the US Government to fully normalize its relations with Vietnam and soon give the country the 'most favourable national' status so that they can have favourable conditions to do business in this prospective and potential market. Asked about the fields of potential cooperation between the two countries, the deputy prime minister said that American companies were interested in all fields that Vietnam was calling for foreign investment. The two sides, he said, have the same interest in such important fields as oil and gas, post and telecommunications, electronics, informations, and so on. Apart from investment in industry, Mr. Luong went on, financial and banking activists of high prestige in the United States would soon come to Vietnam. On the prospects of the relations between the two countries, Deputy Prime Minister Luong said strategically the two countries have realized the need to build normal relations leading to cooperative and friendly relations in a constructive spirit. This is a persistent principled standpoint, he stressed.
