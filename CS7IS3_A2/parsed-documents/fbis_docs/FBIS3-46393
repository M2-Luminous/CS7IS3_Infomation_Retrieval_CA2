It contained the following three points: First, it arbitrarily regarded the constantly soaring airport construction costs as "reducing costs" and having achieved "cost control." Second, it regarded the borrowings of the Provisional Airport Authority and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation [MTRC] as conforming to the memorandum of understanding [MOU] on the airport project and the 45 billion dollar debts left to the special administrative region [SAR] as "not government borrowings." Third, it regarded all contracts unilaterally signed by the British Hong Kong Government, which straddle 1997 and which are not approved by the Chinese side, as conforming to the Basic Law and called for SAR government protection. This is a blatant revelation of the British colonialists' fraudulent diplomatic tricks and serves as lively teaching material in modern bandit diplomacy. When signing agreements with Britain in the future, all governments should be more clever. They should first study clearly how the British Government has failed to keep its word in the past, how changeable it has been, and how it has perpetrated frauds, confounded black and white, and willfully tampered with or distorted agreements, lest they should be taken in. In the joint declaration and the MOU on the new airport project, the British Government has made a commitment, namely, with regard to all matters straddling 1997 which require the SAR government to take responsibilities and fulfill obligations and which involve the transfer of power, China and Britain must first discuss and examine them, reach a consensus, and come to an agreement. How can it now say that, in the absence of agreement from the Chinese side, all contracts unilaterally signed by the British Hong Kong Government can go beyond 1997? If such is the case, is it not possible for the British Hong Kong Government to change the names of the governor as well as the Executive Council into the Hong Kong Administrative and Economic Corporation, and then sign a 53-year contract with Chris Patten to enable him to serve as general manager of the company. In this way, cannot the colonialist governor hang on in Hong Kong for a long time? If the chief secretary, financial secretary, and all departments at the secretariat, directorate, and bureau chief levels can be corporatized in the wake of the Legislative Council hastily passing the so-called "Corporate Regulations," and then the British Hong Kong Government signs contracts on all administrative posts without regard for the nationalities of those holding the posts and gives all of them enormously high salaries and unsupervised power, is it not possible to extend the British colonial rule forever? Will there still be China's sovereignty over Hong Kong to speak of by 1997? The British Hong Kong Government's theory that "the contracts straddling 1997 which it has unilaterally signed conform to the Basic Law" is, in fact, a British theory of unlimited sovereignty. It totally contravenes the principle of power transfer outlined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The "theory of not government borrowings" is also quite preposterous. We should be thankful to the British Hong Kong Government for advocating at this moment the fallacy that "the Hong Kong Government itself does not incur debts" because it enables people to see clearly the motive behind the British Hong Kong Government move to suddenly change the "Airport Authority" laid down in the MOU into an "Airport Corporation." The secret is that the Airport Authority is still a framework of the Hong Kong Government and that, by changing the signboard and turning it into a corporation, the British Hong Kong Government can sidestep the clause that "government borrowing should not exceed 5 billion dollars" as stipulated in the MOU. This is only a clumsy trick employed by a swindler to escape by a cunning maneuvering. Despite the changes, the "corporation" is still a variety of the Hong Kong government framework. The British Hong Kong Government still wholly owns its assets, works out its regulations as it pleases, and appoints its administrative personnel, and "the corporation can borrow as much as it wants." Unexpectedly, the British Hong Kong Government still says this is in keeping with the MOU and that "this is not government borrowing." Is this not a flagrant violation of international law? According to international law, the transfer of power must include the transfer of all government assets. Otherwise, it is tantamount to tearing up an agreement on the transfer of power. The assets of the MTRC and the Airport Authority belong to the Hong Kong Government. When money is borrowed with these assets as collateral, it will certainly lead to changes in Hong Kong Government assets. This is the same as government borrowing because the Hong Kong Government must be responsible for the clauses on the borrowing by either making repayments itself or allowing the banks to confiscate the collateral. If the British Hong Kong Government deliberately creates a situation in which the project cannot be finished as scheduled and the MTRC and the Airport Authority are unable to repay debts, the SAR government must inject funds to repay the debts. Therefore, the Hong Kong Government's argument that "this is not government borrowing" is logically untenable. Even according the existing common law, a parent company must implement a takeover agreement when the company rights are transferred to a new boss. It should not borrow a lot of money and use it up, still less should it regard the debts of a subsidiary as "having nothing to do with the parent company." The fact that the Hong Kong government spokesman has trampled the law to such an extent can only show that the Hong Kong Government is in the wrong in terms of legal principle and that it resorts to unilateral, reckless acts in looking for a way out. In his statement, the Hong Kong Government spokesman has consistently evaded the most substantive issue, i.e. whether it is necessary to abide by the series of agreement reached between China and Britain. It will not do to quibble and make a scene by tampering with the MOU and quietly changing names, for it only serves to lay bare even more the evil intentions of the Hong Kong Government in failing to keep its word. It is clearly stated in the MOU on the airport project: "Debt in excess of 5 billion dollars can only be incurred after both parties reach a consensus on the debt proposal." According to this clause, the British Hong Kong Government cannot borrow in excess of the amount for the airport project, nor can it borrow in excess of the amount in the name of its fully funded and controlled corporations. By refusing to take the correct path of making more capital injections, the British side cannot but come to a dead end.
