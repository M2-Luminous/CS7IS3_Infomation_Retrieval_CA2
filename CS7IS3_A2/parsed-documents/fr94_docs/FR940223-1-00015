FR940223-1-00015 FR940223-1-00001 The witness testified that within the original area, without the 15-mile adjustment, there already is enough milk to satisfy the needs of Spokane pool plants, so there is no need to provide a further incentive to move milk that is located in that 15-mile area closer to Sunnyside. The Sunnyside milk also can and does supply Seattle pool plants and could service plants in Portland and Spokane. A similar analysis shows that there is far more milk in the areas closer to Seattle and Portland than needed by pool plants in those areas. Therefore, the 15-mile incentive which the 6-cent location adjustment represents is not really needed as an incentive to move milk to those market centers. The witness noted that the combination of some Yakima Valley milk that is surplus to the Sunnyside plant's capacity, plus the western Washington milk, is adequately supplying the needs of all the plants in western Washington. Three other witnesses testified on Proposal No. 3. The witnesses for Portland Independent Milk Producers Association and Olympia Cheese Company were opposed to Proposal No. 3, and the witness from Inland Northwest Dairies, Inc., also expressed reservations. Two briefs discussing Proposal No. 3 were filed, one by Darigold Farms in favor of the proposal, and one by Portland Independent Milk Producers Association opposed to the proposal. Portland Independent Milk Producers Association opposed Proposal No. 3 to change the zone classification for plants in Yakima County from Zone 4 to Zone 2 to reflect the same location adjustment that Whatcom County currently enjoys. The witness testified that the theory behind a location adjustment is to be able to attract producer milk from outlying areas to market centers. He pointed out that the proposed zone change in the proposal appears to have the opposite effect in that it would increase the return to producers delivering milk to plants located in Yakima County. The witness noted that increased returns could send two signals. One signal is that there is actually an additional demand for fluid milk to be delivered to Yakima County, which is not believed to be the case. There appears to be more than an adequate supply of milk for the Yakima County fluid operations. The second signal sent to producers when there is a situation of increasing returns is to increase production. The witness did not feel that either of these signals is appropriate in light of the theory behind a functioning location adjustment program or the already increasing supplies of milk surplus to fluid market needs in these areas. The witness also expressed concern that there is an increasing imbalance between freight costs of milk produced in the Yakima Valley area and delivered to local plants and that milk which moves up to 200 miles to the market center. He argued that acceptance of Proposal No. 3 further accentuates the potential imbalance. The witness stated that it was their understanding that Yakima County is the type of market situation that a location differential program is designed to protect. In comparing Whatcom County to Yakima County in this proposal, the witness extended that comparison by quoting from the 1988 final decision (53 FR 49165) which merged the Oregon-Washington and Puget Sound-Inland Federal milk orders into the Pacific Northwest order and established the current location adjustment program under the merged order. Proponents' arguments for reducing the present six cent location adjustment at locations in Whatcom County, Washington, are less persuasive. The location adjustment should not be reduced. One reason given for such a reduction was that the nearby manufacturing plant in Lynden provides an outlet for milk surplus to the market's fluid needs while location adjustments are still needed at locations in southern and central Oregon and central Washington precisely because no nearby manufacturing plant exists to provide an outlet for surplus milk produced in these areas. In fact, the situation thus described by the Darigold witness should result in a greater location adjustment for Whatcom County, for instance, than Jackson County, Oregon. The receipt of milk at a manufacturing plant located in an area of heavy milk production at some distance from the market's center is the classic situation to which location adjustments were designed to apply. Prices paid for such milk are adjusted downward for location to compensate for the fact that the milk has not been hauled to distant bottling plants but instead has been shipped a relatively short distance at a significantly lower hauling cost. The witness quoted another passage from that decision where it states,
