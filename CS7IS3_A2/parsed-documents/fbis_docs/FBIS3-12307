Shahin] [Text] Amman--Political and community leaders reacted vehemently Friday [25 February] to the massacre of over at least 60 Palestinians at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron and called on Jordanians to observe three days of mourning and calling for an end to peace negotiations with Israel on all fronts. "We call on all Jordanians to let black flags fly over their homes for three days and to abstain from working for a symbolic 1/4 of an hour Saturday in commemoration of the martyrs," read the announcement distributed by the professional associations and leftist, pan-Arab and Islamist political parties. The groups announced that a march would be held Suunday at 14:40 from the professional unions building to the al-Hashimiyah Square in downtown Amman to mark "the anger in our hearts and our rejection of the peace process as it stands." Leaders of political parties, popular unions and organisations as well as members of Parliament and Palestinian activists met Friday to declare their outrage at the massacre in a heated atmosphere which brought tears to the eyes of many and would-be fistifights on several occasions. Less than an hour after news of the attack was broadcast. representatives and members of Jordanian and Palestinian popular unions and organisations marched from the professional associations complex in al-Shmaysani to the Red Cross office asking for international protection for Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. Almost simultaneously after the noon prayers demonstrations broke out in several Palestinian refugee camps in greater Amman and al- Baq'ah. In the al-Baq'ah refugee camp, Lower Houser member Muhammad 'Uwaydah and Islamic Action Front representative Muhammad Abu-Faris joined demonstrators in condemning the attack and calling for an end to the peace process. But the IAF was not the only group to call for an obrogation of the peace process. Wahid al-Ja'bari, president of the Khalil al-Rahman society, also known as the Hebron Community Society, called on Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to "resign immediately." There should be an immediate vote of no confidence for Yasir 'Arafat and anyone involved in the peace negotiations." Mr. al-Ja'bari told fellow Hebronites gathered at the society in a massive condolence ceremony for the relatives of the victims of the massacre. Mr. al-Ja'bari, a Hebron notable known for his close ties to the Jordanian government rather than the PLO leadership, said "all Palestinians should withdraw from the negotiations." Mr. al-Ja'bari headed rows of Hebronites receiving condolences from Jordanian government officials, foreign diplomats as well as political party heads and leaders of popular organisations, union and professional association heads. Lower House of Parliament Speaker Tahir al-Masri visited the society shortly after news of the massacre spread through Amman. "The speaker gave us his condolences and expressed his outrage at the massacre." Mr. al-Ja'bari said. But not all visits by officials to the Khalil al-Rahman Society were well received. Leading members of the PLO such as 'Abbas Zaki, acting speaker of the Palestine National Council Salim al-Za'nun and FIDA representative in Amman Salih Ra'fat were booed and Mr. Ra'fat was physically attacked during his visit. The three Palestinian officials were not held welcome because they represent the negotiators who are responsible for the massacre. said one Hebronite. the three were rushed out of the society under protection. The attack on Mr. Ra'fat came after Lower House Member Shaykh 'Abd-al-Mun'im Abu-Zant called for the "liquidation of the PLO and the establishment of an Islamic leadership for the Palestinian people." A member of the Palestine Central Council, Mr. Ra'fat stood up calling for "national unity in this time of mourning." A member of the audience subsequently "got up and rushed towards Mr. Ra'fat attempting to throw him on the ground," one observer told the Jordan Times. The attacker was taken away by other members of the audience and expelled from the main hall of the society. Nominal head of the IAF 'Abd-al-Rahman Khalifah brought many members of the audience to tears with an eloquent speech in which he referred to historic Muslim rights in Hebron and the "humiliation of the all Muslims on this day." "As our brethren kneeled at dawn to pray, they becaome martyrs and we must join them in their jihad to regain the Bayt al-Maqdis," said Shaykh Khalifah. "It is our jihad against the "world Zionist conspiracy lead by U.S. President Bill Clinton," said Mr. Khalifah. "This proves once and for all that the peace negotiations are dead," added head of the IAF Executive Committee Ishaq al-Farhan. Amman based Hamas officials Ibrahim Ghawshah and political bureau members Musa Abu-Marzuq addressed audiences in the Khalil al-Rahman Society and in the professional Associations complex. But not all Palestinian parties which have operating offices in Jordan blamed Friday's massacre on the PLO and the negotiations. The Palestine People's Party, one of the three party's along with the mainstream Fatah and FIDA to participate in the peace talks, put the blame for the massacre firmly in the Israeli camp. "We hold the Israel government and security forces responsible for Friday's massacre," said a statement by the party. The group called on a halt to negotiations till "settlers are disarmed and international protection is provided for Palestinians under occupation. [no closing quotation marks as published] Participants in a meeting held at the professional Associations complext called for the donation of one day's wages to the families of persons killed or wounded in the massacre and urged the organisation of a blood donation drive for the wounded. The participants, who included representatives of political and private organisations, also called for the secondment of a medical delegation to the occupied territories to offer medical assistance to the wounded and called for discussing the prospect of bringing to Jordan wounded Palestinians to receive treatment in Jordan.
