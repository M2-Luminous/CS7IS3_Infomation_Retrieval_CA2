After taking a neutral position in the conflict caused by the national board's decision to veto the bloc's participation in the constitutional review, Lula decided to support the congressmen. During the meeting to be held with the national board on 17 February, they will try to ensure their right to autonomously choose the tactics they will use in the sessions in which the constitutional reform will be discussed. Since the congressional bloc is an important tool to neutralize the radical arguments, the PT leadership believes that by meeting the congressmen's demands in this regard it can display the image of a less intransigent party and open the path to a more flexible program. One of Lula's friends said: "The leaders' inflexibility can ruin everything." The program drafted by radical PT members favors a moratorium, or suspension of payments on the foreign debt; compulsory rescheduling of the domestic debt; the end of privatizations (and reviewing the situation of some companies already privatized); and reactivation of military programs and re-equipment of the Armed Forces. Believing that it will be difficult to win a two-stage election with this program, Lula thinks that it is fundamental to strengthen the congressional bloc for the debates on the government program. Regarding this program, however, the bloc is not as united as it was during the impasse resulting from the prohibition to participate in the constitutional review works. Deputy Jose Dirceu (SP [Sao Paulo]), for example, supports the idea of using the moratorium as a persuasive tool. Dirceu, who is a member of the Articulation faction that supports Lula, said: "I do not understand why the right is so scandalized. Even Delfim Netto failed to comply with the agreements signed with the IMF while he was [economy] minister in the military regime. He then said that letters of intent were written to be torn up afterward." Deputy Aloizio Mercadante (SP), who also is a Articulation faction member in addition to Lula's economic adviser, said a PT administration must exert pressure on creditors to renegotiate the debt, but he discarded the possibility of declaring a moratorium. Deputy Eduardo Jorge (SP), however, asserts that the program proposals for the military cannot be supported by a party that claims to be democratic because they imply accepting an authoritarian concept "very typical of a leftist faction that still preaches dictatorial attitudes by parties." Jorge is a member of the Radical Democracy faction, known as the "PT right wing." Dirceu retorted: "These proposals have civilian goals and cannot be mixed with the military regime programs. Only a person like Eduardo Jorge can oppose them." Deputy Jose Genoino (SP) believes the PT program's economic nucleus is "too narrow." He also criticizes the program's concept of creating an administration with socialist prospects. He said: "A leftist party must fight to have socialist values and ideals incorporated in the process and thus broaden the concept of citizenship."
