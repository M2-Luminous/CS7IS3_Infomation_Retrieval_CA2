His majesty also faulted the Arab handling of the issue and Arab approaches to the draft resolution and the Hebron tragedy. His majesty indicated that Jerusalem need not have figured in the resolution. Instead a reference might have been made to the Geneva Convention, which stipulates protection for the Palestinians under occupation. In an interviewed with the French news agency today, his majesty said: We may be better off as a result of the resolution and the United States abstention, which one may interpret as a shift in Washinton's position on Arab demands and claims on Jerusalem. [sentence as heard] His Majesty King Husayn wondered whether or not this signals a change. He indicated that he will call on the United States to spell out its stand, since one cannot say for sure that there has been a change in the U.S. position. We need to receive assurance that the U.S. policy on Jerusalem has not changed as happened in the past when Washington viewed the settlements as being illegal to begin with and later as an obstacle in the path of the peace process. His majesty warned of the detrimental implication of the lack of Arab coordination for Arab interests, particularly on delicate issues and in hard times. He majesty indicated that the Arabs have not been able to work out a serious position on a comprehensive, just, and lasting settlement acceptable to future generations. He said that as things stand now, there is no room for optimism because Israel presents a solid, single front and we are split into several fronts. His Majesty King Husayn said: We were surprised by the wording of the Security Council resolution that was the outcome of contacts involving the Palestinians, the Americans, and other parties, not including ourselves. His majesty said he tried to do the impossible at the eleventh hour before the resolution was passed by contacting a number of Arab leaders to achieve a semblance of Arab coordination. The aim, his majesty explained, was to minimize the chances of a veto or an abstention, particularly by the United States. As an occupying power, Israel, his majety said, is responsible for a string of crimes, including the arson attack at al-Aqsa Mosque in 1969, violations of Christian holy places, and the latest al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. His majesty asked whether Israel has done its duty in the way of protection for the sacred places. His majesty said he will travel to the sultanate of Oman tomorrow and from there proceed to visit Qatar for consultations and coordination with their leaders.
