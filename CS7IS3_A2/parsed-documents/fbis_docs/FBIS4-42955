FBIS4-42955 "drweu112_q_94020" FBIS-WEU-94-112 Daily Report 9 May 1994 TURKEY * `Heavy Blow' to Hezbollah Reported * `Heavy Blow' to Hezbollah Reported 94WR0172 Istanbul CUMHURIYET in Turkish 9 May 94 pp 1, 6 94WR0172 Istanbul CUMHURIYET Turkish CSO [Article by Ergun Aksoy: "Heavy Blow to Hezbollah"] [Text] Security forces reportedly arrested 22 militants of the "Menzil" branch of Hezbollah, including its "jihad director" Emin Teysi, in an operation against the "Menzil" and "Ilim" branches of Hezbollah. Diyarbakir State Security Court (DGM) noted that the suspects interrogated were responsible for carrying out more than 30 perpetrator-unknown killings. The leader of the Menzil branch, which aims to establish an independent Kurdish state based on Islamic principles, is wanted in Istanbul, it was announced. In the southeast, where approximately 1,600 unresolved killings have been committed since 1990, the operation is reportedly continuing against Hezbollah, called "Contra-Hezbol" by some. The Menzil branch of Hezbollah has reportedly been largely wiped out as a result of the operations concentrated in Diyarbakir, Batman, Silvan, and Van. Twenty-two of the organization's militants were arrested along with the head of its military wing (jihad director) Emin Teysi. Twelve weapons used in actions were also seized along with the militants, and more than 30 unresolved killings were cleared on discovering that the suspects were responsible for them, it was stated. Emin Teysi and the 22 militants are now under interrogation at the Diyarbakir DGM. The investigation will reportedly be completed this week. Mumcu, Ucok, Aksu Speaking to CUMHURIYET, Diyarbakir DGM authorities said that the militants' activities were concentrated in the southeast. "They have no connection with the well-known murders of Ugur Mumcu, Bahriye Ucok, Muammer Aksoy, Mehmet Sincar, and Musa Anter. The organization has two leaders, but they have not been apprehended yet. We sent wanted notices for these two persons to all units. They are most likely in hiding in Istanbul." Authorities pointed out they were unable to establish any link between the Menzil members and Iran and said that the organization's goal is "to establish an independent Kurdish state based on Islamic principles" in the southeast. Authorities said: "We can describe the Menzil branch as a splinter group broken off from the Ilim group, but there is not much information about the reasons for the split. These two groups are still fighting. Many of the killings committed by the Menzil members are directed at Ilim members. Actions against the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] and PKK sympathizers are relatively few. The Menzil is a new movement. They presented themselves to the public as an antiviolence movement when they first emerged. However, they have changed their policies in the past year and become defenders of violence. They want to get their own forces accepted instead of the Ilim branch. They want to be sole leaders of the organization." Ilim Branch The Ilim branch of the Hezbollah which has defended armed struggle since its origin reportedly has its headquarters in Diyarbakir. Huseyin Velioglu, a native of Batman who is said to be the leader of the Ilims, who meet near the Ilim Library, reportedly has connections with Iran. It was noted that security forces do not have much information about the Ilims, whose organization resembles Iranian Hezbollah. Diyarbakir DGM authorities said the following in relation to the Ilim branch of Hezbollah: "Ilim is a more dangerous movement than Menzil. Members of the Ilim group have been arrested, but we cannot get a breakdown of the organizational structure because they are only from the ranks. Hezbollah is called the `Party of God,' but we have no information as to whether Ilim and Menzil are connected with the true Hezbollah in Iran and Lebanon. However, we have heard that the Ilim group is close to the Iranian Hezbollah and its militants are trained in Iran. It is difficult to draw an organization chart as long as no top level administrators can be apprehended."
