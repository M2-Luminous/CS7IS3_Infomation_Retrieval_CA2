The Christian Democratic People's [KDNP] Party, often described as having a minor role in the coalition, is doing just this. Others call the Christian Democrat leaders grey and public opinion polls predict relatively few votes for the party. What are the views of Chairman Laszlo Surjan, who has recently been more prominent in public affairs, about all this and what are his actual plans? Eszter Radai interviewed him. [Radai] The KDNP has been a dark horse for political analysts and the public for a long time. In the past, many people thought that the party would have multiplied its supporters by the end of the electoral cycle. However, this prediction does not seem to be coming true. According to opinion polls, the KDNP occupies one of the last two places among the parliamentary parties just as it did before. [Surjan] The KDNP treats the results of opinion polls with care and caution. It does not ignore apparently unpleasant data but we do not start to celebrate even when the results are good; instead, we analyze them. In political speeches -- when one is a little bit more outspoken -- I usually say that in 1990, 2 percent was predicted for us and we received 6.5 percent. If we again triple the predicted amount then I will be satisfied. [passage omitted] [Radai] Of all the coalition parties, the KDNP has appeared to be the "most suitable for coalition" up to now, it was an acceptable partner for all the parties without exception, and it was included in all coalition speculations. Now, it seems to be you who are narrowing your options by saying that, in addition to the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], you cannot imagine a coalition with the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], either. [Surjan] This formulation fits into the general tactics whereby party leaders do not make final and irrevocable statements; they only indicate their willingness for cooperation or the lack of it. The KDNP indeed does not have any desire to cooperate with the MSZP, and this is not being outlined with the SZDSZ, either. Many people are saying that a forced coalition might have to be formed in 1994. When the election results are known, all the parties will have to examine their consciences and they certainly must not forget about the governability of the country. Therefore, we will have to ponder about what consequences our participation or absence will have for the country. Can we follow or accept the former Italian model with governments changing every month? Is our economy already operating so well that it can run the country without politics mattering too much? Or is our situation quite different? In the meantime, the electors have the right to know what I will "bring upon them," what kind of government they are voting for when voting for me. The party leaders are not in the position to give clear answers to this. Therefore, they usually only express their willingness for collaboration and, naturally, rejections are expressed at various levels of leadership. However, it has to be seen that the issue will not be decided by them but, in the case of the KDNP, for example, a 50-member body will decide when the election results are known with whom and how we will negotiate. Coalition -- With Whom? [Radai] Does this mean that you would not like to enter into coalition with the SZDSZ but would not reject it either? [Surjan] When talking about the KDNP's center party position -- which is of course misunderstood by many people -- I usually refer to the fact that human dignity and the freedom of personal decision occupy a central place in the intellectual world of Christian democrats. Therefore, these parties can also come to an understanding with liberal parties; Germany is the best example for this where a successful coalition on this basis has been operating for years. However, the deep social commitment of this line is also well known, so a Christian democratic type party is also acceptable to social democrats, of which Austria is a good example. Therefore, our party is open in principle. On the other hand, we must not forget, either, that while all the parties are having sharp debates before the elections, these are actually artificial in terms of economic policy because almost everyone wants the same. [passage omitted] [Radai] In your view, which is the KDNP's real face? The one represented by you, one of the leaders of European Christian democracy, or the one shown by the Mikloses [Gaspar, Hasznos, and Palos], those relentless justice makers and radicals, who sometimes even flirt with the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP]? And you also have so-called pragmatic people, who, being local government politicians, have not yet acquired national fame. A political analyst said that "the party chairman has been able to hold together people attracted to the radical right wing, followers of modern European Christian democracy, and the socially deeply committed Christian socialists." Which is the real KDNP? [Surjan] I do not think that you mean this offensively but I have to reject it. It actually contradicts the statements that our opponents have been making for years, namely that this is a grey party. The point is that here, as in all normal parties, there is a constant movement, new colors are appearing, and if this party still manages to present a united front then this harmony is composed of diversity, rather than greyness. [passage omitted] [Radai] Can you see any tendencies in the fact that the so-called radicals occupy prominent places on the KDNP's national list while the pragmatic young people are pushed low down, and only a few of the old and eminent politicians who are attracted to modern European Christian democracy are on it, and only then after a debate? [Surjan] Nevertheless, of the older generation that you mention, we have Deputy Chairman Laszlo Varga in a prominent position on the list, and Sandor Keresztes, too, so this criticism is not justified. It is true that my idea and goal was that the members of a potential Christian Democratic government should be at the top of the list. However, the majority of the National Committee did not agree with this and I was in a minority at the voting. Tactics -- How? [Radai] I have also heard views from certain Christian Democratic politicians that the prominent position of the radicals on the list is part of your election tactics. Through them -- they hope -- many votes can be gained from the extreme right in the second round of the elections. [Surjan] I am not sure if election tactics can be the subject of interviews. A party that is able to gain voters from the extreme parties, therefore, is able to draw an uncertain section of society from the extreme to the center, and, I believe, is doing a service to the nation.
