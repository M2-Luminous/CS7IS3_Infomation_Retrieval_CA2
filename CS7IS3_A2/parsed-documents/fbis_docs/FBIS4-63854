In an interview with ITAR-TASS Osadchy said that funds allocated at present to the defence industry automatically put servicemen in an unequal social position. The military budget has been scheduled so that at least half of servicemen will not be given pay in at the time envisaged by law. Two or three months of existence without pay will enviably worsen the situation among the military personnel and in military garrisons, Osadchy said. In his opinion, parliamentary hearings on social aspects of the military reform scheduled in the State Duma on Wednesday [25 May] will help clarify the situation. The Defence Ministry does not claim privileges in financing, taking into account budgetary difficulties faced by the country. However, it is inadmissible that electricity, fuel and food supplies be stopped to garrisons and military canteens because of the lack of funds, Osdachy said. The Defence Ministry must pay both for military hardware and ammunition, while there are no funds to do so," Osadchy said. The Duma committee for defence has repeatedly brought up the subject of defence financing. However, constructive and competent resolutions adopted by the committee do not always meet the support of lawmakers, Osadchy said, adding that some lawmakers use debates on the military budget for purposes which have nothing to do with Russia's national interests.
