The estuary and the numerous rivers that feed it, poisoned daily by tens of millions of gallons of raw sewage and toxic industrial waste, symbolised a dramatic decline in the health of Britain's rivers following decades of government neglect. Mr Heseltine pledged that the Â£4 billion Mersey Basin Campaign, with investment spread over 25 years, would bring back plentiful fish life to one of Europe's most polluted waterways. The dumping of untreated factory waste and sewage, he said, had created `an environmental disaster which is an affront to the standards which people rightly now expect.' Ten years on, the flagship clean-up programme is in jeopardy because of Ministers' determination to dishonour a decade of political promises in order to avoid unpopular increases in water bills. Almost half of the Mersey Basin's 500 miles of waterway remains classified by the National Rivers Authority as `grossly polluted' -- that is, unable to support life, useless for drinking water and dangerous to swim in. Leaked Whitehall correspondence passed to The Observer confirms the Mersey Basin is one of many pollution blackspots where clean-up efforts are likely to be postponed into the next century to keep down costs for the privatised water companies. A letter from Neil Summerton, head of the Department of the Environment's Water Services Directorate, to Ed Gallagher, chief executive of the NRA, makes it clear that the Government plans to break repeated promises to establish a national programme of legally binding water quality standards for the 26,000 miles of rivers in England and Wales. Ministers have been promising since 1986 to introduce these standards, known as statutory water quality objectives, coupled with compulsory clean-up targets for water companies and industry. The NRA's regional offices have drawn up draft standards aimed at reducing levels of sewage, industrial and agricultural pollution discharged into rivers. And, two years ago, the authority stated that it aimed to clean up most of Britain's 2,500 miles of `grossly polluted' rivers by 1995. But the letter to Mr Gallagher states that John Gummer, the Environment Secretary, and John Redwood, the Welsh Secretary, have decided that `in general' there should be no allowances made for spending by water companies to meet these river quality targets in 1995-2000. The only exceptions are likely to be `high-profile schemes that Ministers would wish to proceed because of the political commitments that have been given.' The Mersey Basin, it adds,`may ... fall into that category.' Other long-awaited programmes to clean up Britain's most polluted rivers -- including the Aire, the Tees, the Trent and the Tame -- by the end of the decade are also in serious jeopardy, say NRA sources. All are virtually lifeless waterways, polluted by sewage debris and stinking industrial effluent. Ministers claim expenditure on meeting river quality targets must be postponed because of the high cost of reducing sewage pollution under the EC Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive of 1991, which threatens to increase water bills substantially. The European law will set minimum standards for sewage outlets to rivers and coastal waters serving more than 10,000 people. But environmentalists fear that the clean-up will not be as stringent as the NRA's planned targets for the worst pollution blackspots. They claim the Government will set the lowest levels of treatment allowed under the directive for ecologically sensitive rivers, estuaries and coastal waters. They argue that these sites, including important wildlife sanctuaries, will be properly protected only under a comprehensive national programme. Andres Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, said: `Ministers are using the fear of higher water bills as an excuse for reneging on repeated promises to set tough national water quality standards. `Instead of forcing the public to finance the clean-up out of current charges, they should be required to cut their record profits and spread the clean-up costs over a longer period of time.'
