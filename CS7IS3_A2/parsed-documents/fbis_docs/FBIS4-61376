The message by the RMK authorities confirmed a cease fire agreement, starting 0:01am on April 29, on conditions stipulated by the Moscow agreement of February 18. Mr. Zurabyan noted that the Azeri proposal was for a short term (10 days) cease fire, which would be used to "take a breath" in order to restart the military operations with new force. At the same time, the Azeri side takes no obligations by this cease fire, which is naturally not acceptable for Mountainous Karabakh. It was stressed that Mountainous Karabakh will establish a cease fire only in case, all topics of the above mentioned agreement are met. "Armenia completely agrees with the position of Mountainous Karabakh", Zurabyan said.
