The two sides discussed in detail the draft agreement on three issues including repatriation of those who have entered the areas of the other side in violation of relevant regulations. Sources said that the two sides made progress in their talks but differences remained. According to the arrangement of the talks decided upon by the two sides yesterday evening, today's morning session covered the topics "Repatriation of Hijackers Across the Taiwan Straits" and "Repatriation of Those Who Have Entered the Areas of the Other Side in Violation of Relevant Regulations." The afternoon's topic was "The Settlement of Fishing Disputes at Sea Across the Straits." Sun Yafu, deputy secretary-general of ARATS, said that the common understanding and opinions voiced by the two sides are serious and responsible. He said that the fourth talks aimed to finalize the written form of the agreement as soon as possible. On repatriation of hijackers across the Taiwan Straits, Sun said that the issue had been discussed three times. During the last talks in Taipei, the two sides reached a basic framework for an agreement. He said that now the talks were focusing on arrangements regarding factors that might crop up. Liu Huiyou, SEF's deputy secretary-general, said that both sides maintained the original understanding on the issue, that is, that hijackers should be prosecuted. Liu also mentioned differences on the issue, such as the application of the provision about non-repatriation, time limit for repatriation and other related issues. Sun Yafu pointed out that the mainland side will not accept the term that people of their own side shall not be repatriated as it is the refurbished version of extradition between states. He said that as a matter of fact, repatriation of criminals or suspects between the two sides can be conducted according to the "Jinmen Agreement", which still remains valid. The two sides also differed on the issue of the settlement of fishing disputes, according to Sun.
