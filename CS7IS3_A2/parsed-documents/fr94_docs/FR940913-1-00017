FR940913-1-00017 FR940913-1-00005 The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing Amendment 39&hyph;6138 (54 FR 6391, February 10, 1989), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), to read as follows: The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation (Enstrom): Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;27&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09, Amendment 39&hyph;6138. Applicability: Model F&hyph;28, F&hyph;28A, F&hyph;28C, F&hyph;28C&hyph;2, F&hyph;28F, 280, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the main rotor transmission clutch assembly (clutch assembly), loss of control of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following: (a) For Model F&hyph;28, F&hyph;28A, F&hyph;28C, F&hyph;28C&hyph;2, 280, and 280C series helicopters, equipped with clutch assembly part number (P/N) 28&hyph;13401&hyph;1 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;1 through&hyph;7) perform the following: (1) Before the first flight of each day, before takeoff, gently close the throttle, splitting the tachometer needles to verify proper operation of the clutch assembly. If the tachometer needles do not split, before further flight, inspect the clutch assembly in accordance with paragraph (a)(4). (2) At the conclusion of the last flight of each day, after engine shutdown, while the main rotor is still running down, listen for any abnormal noise (such as a clicking or racheting sound) from the area of the upper pulley that houses the clutch assembly. If any abnormal noise is heard from the clutch assembly, inspect the clutch assembly in accordance with paragraph (a)(4). (3) The operational checks required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) may be performed by an owner/operator holding at least a private pilot certificate and must be entered into the aircraft records showing compliance with this AD in accordance with 14 CFR 43.11 and 91.417(a)(2)(v). (4) If any irregularities are noted while performing the procedures required by paragraph (1) or (2), inspect the clutch assembly to determine if it is locked-up, or if the upper pulley will rotate. Rotate it in both directions while feeling for any bearing roughness and listening for any bearing noise. The upper pulley should free-wheel if rotated in a clockwise direction and engage if rotated in a counterclockwise direction. (5) Within the next 25 hours time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD), make an entry in the aircraft log book documenting the clutch assembly part number, the number of hours TIS, and the date.
