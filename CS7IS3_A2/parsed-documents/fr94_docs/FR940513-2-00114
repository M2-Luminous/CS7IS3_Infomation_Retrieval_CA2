FR940513-2-00114 FR940513-2-00047 (6) Entity Participation Covered entity participation in the section 340B drug discount program is voluntary. Once an entity has elected to participate in the program, it must wait to enter or withdraw from the program until the next official updating of the eligible entity list. The Office of Drug Pricing will update this list two weeks before each calendar quarter. The entity must comply with all program guidelines until the date it is removed from the eligibility list. (7) Group Purchasing A DSH may participate in a group purchasing arrangement for inpatient drug use without affecting its eligibility to purchase section 340B discounted drugs. If a DSH participates in a GPO or other group purchasing arrangement for covered outpatient drugs, the DSH will no longer be an eligible covered entity and cannot purchase covered outpatient drugs at the section 340B discount prices. States, or other groups, which purchase drugs for covered entities (other than disproportionate share hospitals) are not included on the list of covered entities; however, they are eligible to purchase at the section 340B discount if the following requirements are met: (1) the group purchasing arrangement must be comprised of only covered entities, (2) if group purchasing arrangements contain entities which are not eligible for the discount, separate purchasing accounts and dispensing/distribution must be maintained, and (3) the purchasing group has written authority from the covered entity to purchase covered outpatient drugs on its behalf. (8) Purchasing Agents A covered entity is permitted to use a purchasing agent without forfeiting its right to the section 340B drug discounts. If a purchasing agent is used, the arrangement must be in writing and the terms of the agent's relationship with the entity must be clearly defined. The entity and the agent should decide whether the agent simply negotiates the drug purchasing contracts on behalf of the entity or actually receives drug shipments for distribution to the entity. If the latter, the transfer of purchased pharmaceuticals from an agent to the entity would not be viewed as drug diversion. For purposes of the DSH/GPO prohibition only, a purchasing agent may be distinguished from and would not be considered operating as a GPO or other group purchasing arrangement if the following conditions are met: (1) the purchasing agent is not associated with a GPO or other purchasing arrangement; (2) no collective bargaining by a group of hospitals occurs; (3) the negotiations for PHS pricing are separate activities for each individual DSH; (4) a separate agreement with each DSH is executed; (5) as part of the agreement, there will be no sharing of pricing information; and (6) all final decisions concerning product and price acceptance will be made by each individual DSH. (9) Definition of Covered Outpatient Drug Section 1927(k)(2) of the Social Security Act defines ``covered outpatient drug'' to include most drugs and biologicals which may be dispensed only by prescription and which require approval by the Food and Drug Administration or a license under section 351 of the PHS Act. Section 1927(k)(3) limits the definition of ``covered outpatient drug'' to exclude certain settings (e.g., such services as emergency room, hospice, dental, physician, nursing facilities, x-ray, lab, and renal dialysis) in some instances. In these settings, if a covered drug is included in the per diem rate (i.e., bundled with other payments in an all-inclusive, per visit, or an encounter rate), it will not be included in the section 340B discount program. However, if a covered drug is billed and paid for instead as a separate line item as an outpatient drug in a cost basis billing system, this drug will be included in the program. (10) Dealing Direct or Through a Wholesaler If a manufacturer has customarily dealt directly with a particular covered entity, then requiring the manufacturer to continue this form of purchasing with the covered entity is reasonable. When dealing directly with a covered entity, manufacturers must offer covered outpatient drugs at or below the section 340B discount prices. If a manufacturer customarily uses a wholesaler as a means of distribution, then requiring the manufacturer to continue this form of purchasing with covered entities is also reasonable. If the manufacturer's drugs are available to covered entities through wholesalers, the discount must be made available through that avenue. Manufacturers may not single out covered entities from their other customers for restrictive conditions that would undermine the statutory objective. Manufacturers must not place limitations on the transactions (e.g., minimum purchase amounts) which would have the effect of discouraging entities from participating in the discount program. (11) Manufacturer's Contracts Requiring Entity Compliance A manufacturer may not condition the offer of statutory discounts upon an entity's assurance of compliance with section 340B provisions. Covered entity assurances regarding the following activities may not be required: (1) eligibility to participate in the program; (2) utilization of covered outpatient drugs only in authorized services; (3) maintaining the confidentiality of the drug pricing information; (4) permitting the manufacturers to audit purchase, inventory, and related records prior to the publication of approved PHS guidelines; and (5) submitting information related to drug acquisition, purchase, and inventory systems. Entities are not required to sign agreements assuring manufacturers of their compliance with section 340B provisions. (If a manufacturer asks a covered entity whether the entity is in fact participating in the section 340B discount program, the entity must supply the manufacturer with this information). This prohibition does not include provisions that address customary business practice, request standard information, or include other appropriate contract provisions. Dated: May 9, 1994. John H. Kelso, Acting Administrator, Health Resources and Services Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11643 Filed 5&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;15&hyph;P&hyph;M
