FR940325-2-00196 FR940325-2-00092 [Release No. 34&hyph;33782; File No. SR&hyph;ICC&hyph;94&hyph;02] Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Intermarket Clearing Corporation; Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule Change Relating to Rules Regarding Insider Trading Prohibitions March 17, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 notice is hereby given that on January 25, 1994, The Intermarket Clearing Corporation (``ICC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been primarily prepared by ICC. On February 25, 1994, ICC submitted an amendment to conform the proposed rule change to comments received by ICC from the staff of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC''). 2 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 Letter from Robert S. Steigerwald [Attorney], ICC, to Jerry W. Carpenter, Chief, Branch of Equity and Derivative Clearing Agency Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (February 25, 1994). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend ICC's Rules prohibiting insider trading to conform with recent amendments to Regulation 1.59 3 of the CFTC. 3 17 CFR 1.59. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, ICC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. ICC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The proposed rule change will amend ICC's Rules prohibiting the misuse of material, nonpublic information to conform with recent amendments to CFTC Regulation 1.59. In general, conforming amendments to ICC's Rules are necessary because Regulation 1.59, as amended: (1) Changes certain of the definitions that are effective for purposes of the insider trading rules of self-regulatory organizations (``SROs''); and (2) requires SROs to adopt and maintain rules prohibiting trading in commodity interests traded on or cleared by linked exchanges of such SROs. In addition, amendments to ICC's Rules are necessary to ensure the conformity of references to the term ``non-public.'' Conforming references to the term ``non-public'' have been made throughout Rule 222 and reference is made in Rule 222 to the Interpretations and Policies following Rule 222. In addition, the scope of ICC's insider trading prohibition is extended to reach any commodity interest traded on or cleared by any linked exchange of ICC. 4 At present, there are no commodity interests that are traded on or cleared by any linked exchange of ICC. The definitions of the terms ``linked exchange,'' ``material information,'' ``non-public information,'' and ``related commodity interest'' have been amended in Interpretations and Policies .01 of Rule 222 to conform with amendments to CFTC Regulation 1.59. 4 ICC Rule 222(b). ICC believes the proposed amendments are consistent with the requirements of section 17A(b)(3)(F) 5 of the Act in that the amendments will protect investors and the public interest by extending the reach of ICC's prohibitions on the misuse of material, non-public information. 5 15 U.S.C. ยง78q-1(b)(3)(F). B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition ICC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others Comments concerning the proposed rule change were not and are not intended to be solicited in connection with the proposed rule change, and none have been received by ICC. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(i) 6 of the Act and pursuant to Rule 19b-4(e)(1) 7 in that it affects the interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration, and enforcement of ICC's existing rules relating to insider trading prohibitions At any time within sixty days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 6 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(3)(A)(i). 7 17 CFR 240.19b-4(e)(1) (1993).
