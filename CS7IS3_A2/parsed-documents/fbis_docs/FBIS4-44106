It Is All Roses and Fiori"] [Text] Rome -- The squeeze is on its way. These are the words of Treasury Minister Lamberto Dini. Meanwhile, however, Transportation Minister Publio Fiori is suggesting how the council of ministers can recuperate 50 trillion lire without cuts or taxes. He is practically a magician: "It involves five items," he explains to L'INDIPENDENTE, "that will enable us to block the INPS [National Institute for Social Security] deficit. Trust in me." The trust is granted. Meanwhile, Fiori is expecting a less drastic budget that will relaunch the economy. [Fatone] Minister, what deadlines do you foresee? [Fiori] We must start immediately. A climate of uncertainty is emerging both in the internal and international markets. And this may not encourage the signs of recovery in our country. [Fatone] Must we speed things up? [Fiori] Yes. We must immediately clarify what policies the government intends to adopt. [Fatone] Should we expect a drastic budget? [Fiori] No. But I trust in a very serious budget. [Fatone] In what sense? [Fiori] In the sense that we must not focus on the theme of public finances. Instead the first concern must be the development of the economy. [Fatone] Could you explain yourself better? [Fiori] Certainly! Perhaps, for too long now we have made the mistake of sacrificing the economy to balance our public accounts. While, if by absurdity, there was to be a period of confidence among our citizen voters, we could even draw up a medium-term plan that would take account of a worsening in the public accounts, provided, however, that it would be drawn up with the intention of relaunching the economy. [Fatone] Excuse me, but your thesis is still unclear. [Fiori] Let me explain myself better then. What I want to say is that we must not work at balancing public spending at the cost of suffocating the economy, but that we need to relaunch the economy to pay for the public deficit with the wealth that would be produced. [Fatone] Yet the lancets of the cuts will affect spending. Pensions are the target... [Fiori] This is absurd. It would be a mistake to start with the policy of cuts again. Pensions have been sacrificed for years and it would be unjust to think that recovery can be made to bear upon the shoulders of the weak, the pensioners again. [Fatone] According to you, would it be necessary to reverse the trend? [Fiori] Of course. Not only this: The pensioners must be guaranteed that which has been established by the Constitutional Court, and pensions must also be linked to salaries. I repeat, the continuation of the phenomenon of year-based pensions that we all know is unjust. [Fatone] There is no doubt, however, that the financial burden will be considerable. Do you agree? [Fiori] Certainly. However, we must immediately work out a reentry system and at the same time reflect on how to manage the payment of this debt. This is not an impossible operation. There are already some rather clear ideas on how to overcome this obstacle easily. [Fatone] Many people, however, expect to see cuts in public spending in the budget. The axe could even fall upon transports... [Fiori] Anything can be done under a budget. I would exclude any transport cuts, however. It is a wrong political choice. [Fatone] Why? [Fiori] Transportation infrastructures form the basis of any development program in a modern society. If the cuts were to affect the transport sector, in the medium term we would pay for this with a fall in production, trade, and consequently GDP. The effect would be a worsening in the public accounts. [Fatone] Do you have faith in [Prime Minister] Berlusconi? [Fiori] Certainly. I find that Berlusconi possesses an exceptional lucidity and simplicity in these problems. [Fatone] Have you any suggestions to give to Berlusconi concerning the budget? [Fiori] Yes. We can rake in 50 trillion lire without having to resort to cuts and new taxes. We will succeed in blocking the INPS abyss. [Fatone] And where do you intend getting these 50 trillion lire from. [Fiori] I will communicate this at the right moment. First I must complete the plan that I will offer to the council of ministers. [Fatone] Can you give us a preview of your recipe? [Fiori] I can only say that it concerns four or five items. Trust in my words.
