'Ashrawi urged Palestinians, including the opposition, to join in building Palestinian society, both in the national authority, the administrative agencies, and the institutions. She said members of the authority must have competence and credibility and be able to show commitment and will power so they can win the approval of all segments of Palestinian society. She said: There must be an integrated plan for reconstitution with the participation of all. No one can escape their responsibilities and the future challenges. [passage omitted]
