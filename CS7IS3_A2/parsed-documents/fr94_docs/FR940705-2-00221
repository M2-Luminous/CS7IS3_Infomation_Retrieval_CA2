FR940705-2-00221 FR940705-2-00091 Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;3&hyph;a. Will cells (e.g., bone marrow cells) be removed from patients and treated ex vivo? If so, describe the type, number, and intervals at which these cells will be removed. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;3&hyph;b. Will patients be treated to eliminate or reduce the number of cells containing malfunctioning genes (e.g., through radiation or chemotherapy)? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;3&hyph;c. What treated cells (or vector/DNA combination) will be given to patients? How will the treated cells be administered? What volume of cells will be used? Will there be single or multiple treatments? If so, over what period of time? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;3&hyph;d. How will it be determined that new gene sequences have been inserted into the patient's cells and if these sequences are being expressed? Are these cells limited to the intended target cell populations? How sensitive are these analyses? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;3&hyph;e. What studies will be conducted to assess the presence and effects of the contaminants? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;3&hyph;f. What are the clinical endpoints of the study? Are there objections and quantitative measurements to assess the natural history of the disease? Will such measurements be used in patient follow-up? How will patients be monitored to assess specific effects of the treatment on the disease? What is the sensitivity of the analyses? How frequently will follow-up studies be conducted? How long will patient follow-up continue? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;3&hyph;g. What are the major beneficial and adverse effects of treatment that you anticipate? What measures will be taken in an attempt to control or reverse these adverse effects if they occur? Compare the probability and magnitude of deleterious consequences from the disease if recombinant DNA transfer is not used. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;3&hyph;h. If a treated patient dies, what special post-mortem studies will be performed? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;4. Public Health Considerations. Describe any potential benefits and hazards of the proposed therapy to persons other than the patients being treated. Specifically: Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;a. On what basis are potential public health benefits or hazards postulated? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;b. Is there a significant possibility that the added DNA will spread from the patient to other persons or to the environment? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;c. What precautions will be taken against such spread (e.g., patients sharing a room, health-care workers, or family members)? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;d. What measures will be undertaken to mitigate the risks, if any, to public health? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;e. In light of possible risks to offspring, including vertical transmission, will birth control measures be recommended to patients? Are such concerns applicable to health care personnel? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;5. Qualifications of Investigators and Adequacy of Laboratory and Clinical Facilities. Indicate the relevant training and experience of the personnel who will be involved in the preclinical studies and clinical administration of recombinant DNA. Describe the laboratory and clinical facilities where the proposed study will be performed. Specifically: Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;5&hyph;a. What professional personnel (medical and nonmedical) will be involved in the proposed study and what is their relevant expertise? Provide a two-page curriculum vitae for each key professional person in biographical sketch format (see Appendix M&hyph;III&hyph;E). Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;B&hyph;5&hyph;b. At what hospital or clinic will the treatment be given? Which facilities of the hospital or clinic will be especially important for the proposed study? Will patients occupy regular hospital beds or clinical research center beds? Where will patients reside during the follow-up period? What special arrangements will be made for the comfort and consideration of the patients. Will the research institution designate an ombudsman, patient care representative, or other individual to help protect the rights and welfare of the patient? Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;C. Selection of the Patients Estimate the number of patients to be involved in the proposed study. Describe recruitment procedures and patient eligibility requirements, paying particular attention to whether these procedures and requirements are fair and equitable. Specifically: Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;C&hyph;1. How many patients do you plan to involve in the proposed study?
