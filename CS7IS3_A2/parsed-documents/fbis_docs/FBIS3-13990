The anti-Indian component of this love for Pakistan is apparent in their Kashmir policy. The recent round of U.S. love for Pakistan began intensifying after Bhutto returned to power. U.S. expressions of love before this were more subdued. Now, the United States is beating the drums and openly offering its love. The United States supported Pakistan at the time of the Bangladesh war. The United States failed at that time to protest the extensive atrocities and murders of civilians committed by the Pakistani army in Bangladesh. On the contrary, the Pakistani military leaders received assistance. After India defeated Pakistan in the Eastern Theater of war [Bangladesh], the United States made all types tof arrangements to assure that India would not advance on the Western Theater [Pakistan]. The United States,though, had not then openly supported Pakistani statements on Kashmir. Now they are. They have stated that Kashmir cannot be considered an indisputible part of India. The United States is not even prepared to recognize the part of Kashmir under Indian control as a part of India. Their position is that all of Kashmir is disputed territory. Apart from that, recently, the U.S. Government has shed a lot of tears over Kashmir and how the Indian Government has curbed Kashmiri rights and is committing atrocities. Even Clinton is claiming how pained he is over all this. The reason the U.S. Government has suddenly become agitated over Kashmir is its newfound love for Pakistan. If U.S. officials were not under pressure to appease Pakistan, then why would they be crying so much? The main reason for their tears is to avoid criticism by Pakistan and the Muslim world. There is no doubt that democracy is deep-rooted in American society. They do not want to see people deprived of democratic rights. Americans become very agitated upon hearing that human rights are being violated and governments are torturing their people. But there is no reason to believe that the U.S. Government is fond of human rights. U.S. foreign policy is based on American economic interests. They show interest in the abrogation of human rights when American economic interests are involved. When these interests are involved, they make a hue and cry all over the world. There are many examples of this in history. Despite this, the United States continues on this path. One example is when the United States some time back made a big fuss over human rights violations in China. Now they have shut up. They are worried about losing markets in China. Thus the United States simply cannot worry about the lack of progress in human rights there. U.S. officials never raise the subject of Saudi Arabia's lack of democracy or how torture is practiced there. This is due to the Saudis' willingness to keep in mind U.S. economic interests. When Khomeyni took power in Iran, however, U.S. officials became worried due to his unwillingness to protect U.S. interests as had the Shah. [passage omitted giving other examples] Now, the United States is suddenly worried about Kashmir! The concern shown by the United States over human rights violations, however, is really an expression of concern over economic interests there. The United States wants to establish economic domination over Pakistan and needs a military base in Kashmir. Thus, the United States is about to restore aid to Pakistan. The United States wants to take steps to appease Pakistan and the Muslim world. U.S. officials regard the Kashmir problem as a religious issue for most of the world's Muslims, a jihad to free Muslims from Kafirs. They believe that world Muslim sentiment is involved in this matter. This is why the United States is supporting the Pakistan position. This explains why U.S. officials are silent over the support for militants which Pakistan offers year after year, creating a nightmare in the region. They have not uttered a word about about the atrocities committed by Pakistani militants in Kashmir. They have not uttered a word about the pitiful plight of Hindus and Buddhists who have been driven from Muslim-majority areas. This despite being the same U.S. officials who threatened Pakistan with terrorist-state designation just some time ago. The question arises, why is the United States such a lover of Pakistan and appeaser of Muslims? There are many reasons. First, the United States wants a military base in Kashmir in order to keep an eye on the oil-exporting regions of the Middle-East and Russia. U.S. economic interests in these regions is vital. A military installation would allow U.S. planes and military forces to be rapidly deployed in support of U.S. interests. The United States is very worried about miltant Islam. They view with alarm the regime in Tehran. They know that anti-U.S. sentiment amongst Muslims is still very high after the Gulf War. The Muslim World is not content with simply being regional in scope, they want a place on the world stage. The United States is willing to appease this wish to gain the support of the majority of Muslims. The United States, by allowing the Muslim world to grow stronger, also creates a check on Russia, India, and China. Thus, these countries will not be able to oppose U.S. economic imperialism. This is why I have written that U.S. tears shed for Kashmir are not due to human rights violations. They are shed with a view to advancing U.S. economic interests. *
