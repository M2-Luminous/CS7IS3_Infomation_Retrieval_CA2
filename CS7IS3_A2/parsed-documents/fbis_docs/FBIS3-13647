The vacated area went back to the residents of the neighborhood. Confirming the report, official military sources noted that the evacuation came as part of the redeployment of troops in the Gaza Strip. [passage omitted] Military correspondent Arye Kiesel adds: The evacuation of the base yesterday came after Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin gave his consent to begin a real evacuation from the Gaza Strip. A senior military source in the Southern Command said yesterday: "We are done with `thinning out the fat' from the Gaza Strip. The work was done in accordance with the operational order concerning a redeployment in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, and regardless of the massacre in Hebron." Defense establishment sources voiced their assessment yesterday that the prime minister had given his consent for two reasons: First, as a public gesture to the inhabitants of the Gaza Strip and Fatah members there; second, to enable the IDF to carry out a rapid evacuation in the event that the peace talks resume and an agreement is reached on the beginning of the evacuation.
