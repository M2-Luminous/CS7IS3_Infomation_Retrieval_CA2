He said in a statement middle-income taxpayers would be hardest hit. Individual taxes were up 18.4 per cent and had more than doubled in the past five years. The R6.5 billion [rand] additional revenue from taxes on individuals' incomes was "the highest ever". The government was still living beyond its means. Continued budget deficits were mortgaging South Africa's future and pushing it ever closer to the debt trap that had financially ruined many developing countries. Mr Andrew said the government should have cut defence spending, not increased it by 13 per cent. In contrast, spending on police was up by only 6.5 per cent, less than the inflation rate, at a time when crime was rampant. This made no sense. The DP was not opposed in principle to the one-off levy to finance South Africa's transition to democracy but was alarmed by the enormous cost of the transition. The party would question whether the money had been properly spent and adequately controlled.
