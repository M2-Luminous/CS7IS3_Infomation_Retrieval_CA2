"I am asking the hijaz government that how fratricide in Yemen might benefit you," he questioned as he referred to the Saudi provocations in the on-going civil war in Yemen. [sentence as received] "Arabia cannot tolerate a powerful country in its neighbourhood according to a historical logic," he added. Saudi Arabia supported the Iraqi regime in its war against Iran (1980-88), and supported Kuwait in the Persian Gulf war, he said, however, documents were disclosed later on which showed that Saudi Arabia did not like the disputes to be settled. Criticizing Riyadh policies in the region, Rowhani advised the Saudi rulers to take lessons from bitter experiences of the past, and choose the path of peace, stability and brotherhood. "Iran has always extended friendship and brotherhood hand to her neighbours within the framework of Islam and international regulations." Pointing to the Saudi helplessness to carry out a correct planning and to guarantee the security of the hajj pilgrims, Rowhani said administration of a ceremony in a holy site, where 2.5 million pilgrims are present, is a heavy burden on Saudi Arabia. "We knew from the very beginning that the Saudi administration with all its money and massive presence of foreigners in that country, would not be able to administer the hajj ceremony in a proper way," said the vice-speaker. He said the death of the hajj pilgrims in Mina is not only limited to the current year. Whenever there is a crowd of pilgrims, the Saudi police think that a demonstration is to be organized, and therefore, attack the people with anti-riot equipment, causing multiple death of the pilgrims. "If the Saudi police did not involve in the Mina incident this year, the number of victims did not exceed 30," he regretted. Reiterating the previous proposal by Iran on the administration of the hajj ceremonies by the Islamic countries, he said if Saudi Arabia is not ready to accept the proposal, at least it can accept help by volunteer countries. "We are sure that if we help Saudi Arabia, hajj pilgrims will not lose their lives to this extent, and the ceremony will be held more appropriately," Rowhani said.
