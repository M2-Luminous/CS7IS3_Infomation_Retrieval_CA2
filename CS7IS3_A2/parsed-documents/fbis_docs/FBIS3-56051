Talking with a UNIAN correspondent, he pointed out that future negotiations testified to the fact that Ukraine was recognized as a partner possessing equal rights. The fact that negotiations were being held, in Volodymyr Klymchuk's view, means that the United States and Russia agree to make concessions, and it is quite possible that a decision will be made that will be favorable for Ukraine. "Anyway, political trading is better than war," the LDPU chairman said.
