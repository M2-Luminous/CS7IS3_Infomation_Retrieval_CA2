He pointed out that the world community has gotten used to Israeli massacres. Ambassador 'Imran noted that this is not the first and will not be the last massacre unless real international deterrent measures are taken. He pointed out that the Israeli settlement policy defies the Geneva Conventions and the UN Security Council resolutions. He added that this policy was not made by settlers but by the Israeli governments, which set up these settlements, are responsible for arming the settlers to seize Arab territories, and permitted them to use their weapons at their personal discretion. This, he added, shows that the Israeli authorities are responsible for writing the scenario of the massacre.
