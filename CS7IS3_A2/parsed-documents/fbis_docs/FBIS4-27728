FBIS4-27728 "dreas108_j_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-108 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 Indonesia German Minister Views Proposed Wood Ban German Minister Views Proposed Wood Ban BK0606114994 Jakarta ANTARA in English 0939 GMT 6 Jun 94 BK0606114994 Jakarta ANTARA English BFN [Text] Jakarta, Jun 6 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Visiting German Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Carl-Dieter Spranger on Sunday blasted as "unrealistic" the proposed ban on the import of tropical wood products and said the ban will impede the conservation of tropical forests which serve as the lung of the earth. "If the ban on the import of tropical wood products is effective, these forest products might give no economic advantage to countries which have tropical forests, and that they will find it difficult to conserve their forests," Spranger told the press at the Sukarno-Hatta airport a moment before he left for home. Environmentalists in the United States and Europe have proposed that their governments impose a ban on the import of tropical wood products from developing countries. Spranger said he had seen for himself Indonesia's well-planned efforts to conserve its forests without necessarily sacrificing the ecosystem. It was natural for Indonesia which had huge tropical forests to utilize its natural resources, including tropical forests, he said. Earlier, Forestry Minister Jamaludin Suryohadikusumo briefed the German minister on the management of Indonesian tropical forests. Spranger also visited tropical forests in East Kalimantan during his stay. According to Spranger, the Indonesian Government was determined to conserve its tropical forests while exploiting part of them to gain foreign exchange earnings. He said he was in support of Indonesia's efforts to disseminate objective information on the management of tropical forests in developing countries. In 1993, Indonesia exported an estimated nine million cubic meters of tropical wood worth U.S.$6.5 billion. Japan was the biggest market for Indonesian tropical wood, followed by the United States and European countries. Spranger said Germany was prepared to provide the Indonesian Government with technical assistance to manage its tropical forests.
