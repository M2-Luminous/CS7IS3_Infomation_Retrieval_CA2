Bonn has not yet definitely approved this idea. However, it is said that the implementation of a peace plan is the decisive thing; following the movement that brought Moscow into the political game Russia wants to continue to be visibly involved. Regarding Moscow's role, one can hear it said in Bonn that the NATO ultimatum permitted Yeltsin to put pressure on Serbia; this permitted the Serbs to preserve their face by saying they were heeding the wish of the friendly Russians. While Yeltsin remained incommunicado for days, the plan for Russian influence on the Serbs and participation in the decisions of the United Nations and the Western states was worked out in Moscow, it is said in Bonn. Obviously, Russia's "Yugoslavia" envoy Churkin let Foreign Minister Kinkel know in Bonn on Tuesday [22 February] that the West should not set new ultimatums because Moscow could not tell the Serbs every day that they have to give in again or else NATO would take action. Kinkel indicated that Russia should be included in the process, but Moscow could not claim a veto right. Now the respective possibilities of influence should be used: The United States, Germany, and the Netherlands are the most important interlocutors of the Muslims; Germany could influence the Croats; Russia, France, and Greece are listened to by the Serbs. In Germany's view, Russia should particularly influence Serbian leader Karadzic so that Tuzla airport can be opened. In Bonn one can hear that Russia is trying that, but it does not want pressure to be exerted on Moscow to accept new ultimatums. In a telephone conversation with Kinkel, NATO Secretary General Woerner warned against threats by the West against the Serbs so long as military actions have not been examined thoroughly as to their effectiveness and have been prepared. Nevertheless, NATO must reserve itself the right to set further ultimatums. Kinkel, too, thinks that ultimatums can be applied to other areas in Bosnia; however, action will not be taken by automatically following the pattern of Sarajevo. The Federal Government does not want to act as mediator in the search for peace for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Kinkel wants to provide a an "offer of good services" in arranging meeting places in the technical sense. Chancellor Kohl's many telephone conversations with President Clinton, contacts between European foreign ministers, and the German humanitarian performances are also below the threshold of concrete mediation. In Kinkel's view, Germany should not permit itself to be thrust into the role of an official mediator; because of the still unclear interpretation of the Basic Law and the historic burdens, Germany must be cautious. One must also bear in mind the Serbs' sensitivity about Germany. Obviously, Bonn does not want to push ahead against the smaller partners in the European Union and potentially distrustful governments, such as the British. However, it is said that the Federal Government is already preparing for the fact that it will hardly be possible for Germany to continue to play its modest and restrained role in this way, if in May the Federal Constitutional Court were to affirm that out-of-area military operations are permissible. In addition, the German presidency of the European Union during the second half of this year requires the Germans to coordinate efforts. So far, the Federal Government has insisted that, for historical reasons, participation in missions in the area of the former Yugoslavia will not be possible even if the controversy about the interpretation of the Basic Law is settled. On Wednesday Foreign Minister Kinkel talked to Croat Foreign Minister Granic in Bonn about the latter's talks with Haris Silajdzic, the representative of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Bonn meeting was dedicated to efforts to harmonize the differing attitudes of the Croats and the Muslims in negotiations about varieties of a confederation plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina. On Wednesday there was a round of talks in Zagreb with mediators Stoltenberg (United Nations) and Own (European Union). Kinkel gained the impression that the Croats are flexible regarding confederation plans. The events surrounding Sarajevo are causing pressure on the parties to the conflict and, therefore, the prospects for an agreement have improved. Kinkel also discussed with Granic suspicions that regular Croatian troops are fighting in Bosnia. Granic answered that there are three groups. Bosnian Croats, who had been in Croatia during the fighting there, and who returned to Bosnia after the war in Croatia and are now fighting in Bosnia. The Government in Zagreb cannot do anything about them. In addition, volunteers from Croatia have gone to Bosnia and are participating in the fighting against Muslim units in central Bosnia. The Croatian Government cannot stop volunteers. Finally, regular Croatian troops have also stayed on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina along the Neretva River, which flows into the Adriatic. A total of 600 of these soldiers have been withdrawn over the past few days. The rest -- Granic obviously did not say how many -- will follow. The accusation of involvement by Croatian troops in the fighting only refers to the last group and will soon be settled. Kinkel asked Granic about Croatian prison camps in Bosnia. Granic said that 100 Muslim prisoners-of-war are being held in a prison near Mostar. In addition, the Bosnian Croats have a camp with 1,200 inmates. The other camps have been disbanded. The Red Cross has free access to those camps that still exist. In contrast, the Muslims are holding 5,000 to 6,000 prisoners in camps, and the Red Cross does not have access to them. Granic asked Kinkel about the possibilities of German economic aid. Kinkel promised that, after an overall settlement has been achieved and if Zagreb shows the appropriately flexible attitude, Germany will support Croatia's wish to be quickly brought close to the European Union. Germany will also provide economic aid. Kinkel did not supply any figures for this declaration of intent.
