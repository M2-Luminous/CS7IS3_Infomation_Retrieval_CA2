This agreement is viewed as the first stage towards getting close with the central and eastern European states and the European Union and further integration with them. The Baltic states have already signed a similar agreement with the European Union and negotiations are being held with Russia, Ukraine, and Moldova. Thus, Georgia is the first Caucasian state with which the European Union decided to negotiate about the agreement. The next stage of the European integration is getting a status of an associate member, which has been granted to a number of the former socialist countries in Europe: Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. The agreement on cooperation will create a legal basis for developing comprehensive relations with the 12 member states of the European Union and envisages a number of practical privileges in the sphere of political contacts, economic links, and trade.
