The seine fishing vessel Kamsuda III, belonging to a private company of the same name, was fishing for cod in the area of Asacha Bay, southeast of Kamchatka. About midday, the echo sounder indicated a large school of cod on an isobath of two hundred meters 10 miles from shore. It was decided to set the pair of seine. When the sweep was completed and retrieval of the half-kilometer seine lines began, something puzzling happened. The vessel stopped, then slowly began to reverse although the engines were on slow forward. At first it was thought the bottom had been snagged. However, the cables became taut, one of them snapping and the second beginning to feed out from the hold. The ship began to list to starboard. The seamen on deck realized that something was not right and elected to seek shelter behind the deck structures out of harm's way. The captain could in no way understand the reason for what was going on, because in his many years of experience nothing like this had ever happened. All this occurred in the space of minutes. The conning tower of a nuclear-powered submarine emerged from the water literally a few meters from the vessel and just starboard of the seiner's stern, while the stern rudders of the submarine were port of the seiner's bow. That is, the submarine was directly beneath the vessel. While the stunned crew was gathering its wits, the submarine disappeared in a northerly direction, dragging off with it the pair of seine and two and a half kilometers of cable, leaving the trawler without fishing gear or cable. The damage caused by the nuclear submarine was approximately 20 million rubles, not taking into account lost profits and valuable fishing days. The seiner was fishing in an authorized area, and there was no advice on any closure of the area. The captain immediately reported the incident to the expedition chief aboard the BMRT [large refrigerated fishing trawler] Tselihar and headed for port. Of course, there was nothing left to fish with. On arriving in port, the sailor who was handling the cable in the hold and miraculously remained alive after the capture of the submarine, immediately signed off the vessel. When the VESTI correspondent arrived aboard the vessel he encountered Captain Second Rank Gritsay, Kamchatka Naval Flotilla's assistant flag navigation officer. Gritsay calmed the correspondent by saying nothing happened, and that the vessel simply snagged bottom; none of this was connected with any submarines. However, the submarine--which had returned to port--was supposedly merely carrying out its combat mission. When the author of this report expressed his interest as to why such a high-ranking military chief was aboard such a humble seiner, the captain second class replied he was simply visiting an old friend. Meanwhile, the seiner's captain involved in the incident was intensely writing explanatory notes and making extracts from the ship's logs. I will add that this is the second occasion in which a submarine was caught off Kamchatka. In 1976 the medium refrigerated fishing trawler Som, belonging to the Kamchatrybkolkhozobyedineniye fishing fleet department--presently called the Akros Company-- caught a submarine in an authorized fishing area.
