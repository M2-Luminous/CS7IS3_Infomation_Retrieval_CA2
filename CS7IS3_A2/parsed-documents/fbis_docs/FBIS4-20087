Working Under Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, a crisis group established a command center to monitor the three fronts around Turkey round the clock. Gorazde was not the only case on the Ministry's agenda. The crisis group also focused on the incidents in Azerbaijan and northern Iraq. Cetin arrived at the Ministry and set up his working group early in the morning. They worked until midnight. Undoubtedly, the priority issued on the crisis group's agenda was that of the incidents in Gorazde, which is about to fall. Cetin kept calling President Suleyman Demirel and the officials in Bosnia. The group studied events in Gorazde minute by minute. The Serbian forces had advanced almost up to Gorazde's central areas. The city was about to fall. But NATO remained inactive. It failed to launch the necessary operations. When, If Not Today? The most important piece of information Cetin received was as follows: Commander Rose of the UN forces in Bosnia had called for urgent air support. But UN representative Akashi was undecided on the issue. And it couldn't be said that he was in favor of the idea. That was why the expected NATO operation was not launched. Cetin's views on NATO gradually began to change in the afternoon. When would NATO use the authority transferred to it if it didn't use it today? The view that gained weight in Cetin's consultations with his close colleagues was: "NATO will suffer seriously if it fails to achieve a result. No one has the right to place NATO in such a situation. NATO has remained helpless." Remove the Helplessness That viewpoint spread by late afternoon. The developments that took place would most likely place NATO in a helpless situation. One of the two British aircraft that took off to bomb the Serbian positions around Gorazde was shot down. That made NATO look like a ridiculous organization. And that along with its helplessness. Conflicting reports came in from Italy. One of them said that several NATO aircraft took off for Gorazde. But neither the NATO general headquarters nor the UN organization in New York confirmed it. Tension emerged at that time. Did NATO aircraft take off? If so, would they attack the Serbian forces? That NATO would not launch an operation against them became apparent by 2100. This seriously disappointed the crisis group. Cetin began to talk in a loud voice. No one had the right to place NATO in such a ridiculous situation. NATO was not a helpless organization. Why did it agree to shoulder such an important responsibility if it was reluctant to fulfill its requirements? What was even worse was that NATO would be unable to achieve effective results in its humanitarian mission. Considering that, Cetin prepared to make a harsh statement against NATO the next day. He decided that the following day he would outline the feelings and views he couldn't express that night. Developments in Gorazde have raised serious questions in Turkey regarding its confidence in NATO. Obviously, Turkey will be deeply worried by NATO's situation if Cetin's views forms the basis of Turkey's general policy. Turkey's Approach to the CSCE Undoubtedly, the anxiety NATO has caused in Turkey may have a bearing on Ankara's approach to the CSCE, because very important humanitarian problems were uncovered in the world after the CSCE was established. The situation in Azerbaijan is an example. The tragic developments in Azerbaijan and Bosnia were important humanitarian issues, which are within the framework of CSCE's basic principles. The CSCE has no mechanism to obstruct a war. NATO and the UN establishments are the only mechanisms it can use. But neither the UN peacekeeping forces nor NATO has been able to influence a country like Serbia, the economy of which is almost on the verge of collapse. NATO has been reluctant to take any action to protect the 70,000 people who are faced with the threat of massacre, regardless of the authority it received from its general headquarters and the UN organization, the Kaaba of the world. How can NATO be effective on other issues if it fails to act as an effective organization on Bosnia? Hair-Raising Views Undoubtedly, many questions can be asked if we look into the past. Turkey is one of NATO's flank countries. It served that organization against the former Soviet Union for many decades. It fulfilled all its obligations as a NATO country in a dangerous geographic location. In fact, it even allowed the U-2 reconnaissance aircraft to take off from its territory. In other words, compared with the other NATO members, the threat Turkey was confronted with was the most serious at the time. The question that should be asked is this: How would NATO have acted as a deterrent organization if a clash had taken place between its members and the former Soviet Union? The views and convictions on the developments that took place in the past become more and more hair-raising when NATO's approach to Bosnia is considered. Would NATO have moved to support Turkey in a clash with the former Soviet Union in the past? Or, would it have contented itself with sending two aircraft to help Turkey, one of which would have most likely been downed in the northern Black Sea region and the other would have escaped with great difficulty? Political Geography Can Change NATO's helplessness regarding Bosnia may upset many of the scenarios and projects on serious international projects. It may encourage many governments that have problems with their ethnic communities. NATO and the United Nations have failed to protect the Bosnian people against genocide. Will they be able to protect the minority communities from the threat of a massacre in remote countries in the future? Yes, NATO's helplessness on Bosnia may change the scenarios in the political geography in the world. Dictators may become more daring. The humanitarian principles that have been established by the CSCE may be undermined. The people who struggle for their cultural rights and ethnic traditions in many parts of the world, including those who believe that they have almost achieved their objectives, may be seriously disappointed. Bosnia Would Have Saved the World A NATO operation in Bosnia would not have been only for the Bosnian people. It would also have been a lesson to the forces in other countries that are inclined to create a situation similar to Bosnia. Unfortunately, the helpless situation in Bosnia has created an atmosphere suitable for a new kind of political psychology in various parts of the world. Yesterday, HURRIYET described NATO in its headlines as a "helpless organization." As far as the world is concerned, the cost of that state of helplessness may be very high.
