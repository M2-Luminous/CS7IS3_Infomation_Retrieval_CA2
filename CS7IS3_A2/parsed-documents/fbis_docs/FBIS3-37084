Demurin, speaking about a program "to protect ethnic Russians in the CIS countries and the Baltic states," noted that "diplomatic means are not sufficient to resolve the problem." Estonia's reaction to Demurin's statement was sharp: Estonian ambassador to Moscow was instructed to present a demarche and President Lennart Meri asked Russian ambassador in Tallinn for explanations. The Russian embassy in Tallinn disseminated the full text of Demurin's address. It reads as follows: "The program is being drafted because, in our opinion, solely diplomatic means are insufficient to solve the problem of Russians in the territory of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Baltic states. The work on a program to protect the interests of and to support ethnic Russians began over a year ago. It concerns measures such as special tele- and broadcasts, humanitarian aid to the needy, support for Russian businessmen, customs and other preferences, support for enterprises that mostly employ Russians, cooperation between banks, etc." "It is perplexing that some Estonian mass media and politicians should take one phrase out of context and interpret it as another threat," the statement of the Russian Embassy says.
