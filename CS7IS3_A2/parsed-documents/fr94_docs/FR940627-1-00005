FR940627-1-00005 FR940627-1-00003 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Customs Service 19 CFR Parts 141 and 177 Withdrawal of Proposed Customs Regulations Amendments Relating to Tariff Designation on Entry Documents AGENCY: Customs Service, Treasury. ACTION: Notice of withdrawal. SUMMARY: This document withdraws proposed amendments to the Customs Regulations which would have provided that a person, having received written notice from a Customs official of the Customs designation of the duty/statistical reporting number for imported merchandise, must provide that designation to Customs on the entry summary (Customs Form 7501) or other applicable forms. The proposed amendments also would have provided that a failure to furnish the required designation may subject the person to a claim for monetary penalty under 19 U.S.C. 1592. In view of the subsequent enactment of Customs modernization legislation which amended the statutes upon which the published proposals were based, those proposals are now outdated and therefore should be withdrawn. DATES: Withdrawal effective June 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Charles Ressin, Penalties Branch (202&hyph;482&hyph;6950). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On September 28, 1987, Customs published a document in the Federal Register (52 FR 36279) proposing to amend ยง141.61(e), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 141.61(e)) to provide that an importer or customs broker, having received any of several specified types of written notice from a Customs official of the Customs designation of the duty/statistical reporting number applicable to imported merchandise (or, in the case of a broker, where the broker has actual knowledge that his importer-client received such notice), must provide that designation to Customs on the entry summary (Customs Form 7501) or other applicable forms filed by the importer or broker. In addition, ยง141.61(e) would have been amended to provide that a failure to provide the required designation may subject the importer or broker to a claim for monetary penalty under section 592, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592). The document also proposed to amend ยง177.8, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 177.8), by adding thereto a cross-reference to the requirements in subpart E of part 141 relating to presentation of entry papers. In support of the proposed regulatory amendments, Customs noted at that time that: (1) Section 484(a)(1)(B), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1484(a)(1)(B)), required that an importer of record file with Customs documentation to, among other things, enable a Customs officer to properly assess duties on imported merchandise, collect accurate statistics, and determine whether any other applicable requirement of law is met; and (2) section 500, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1500), placed the obligation on Customs to ``ascertain the classification and rate of duty applicable to [imported] merchandise.'' Customs further pointed out that because of substantial increases in annual import volume and as a result of the development of the Automated Commercial System (ACS), more accurate reporting data had become necessary and Customs had to place increased reliance upon information contained in entry documents. Thus, the proposed regulatory amendments, if adopted as a final rule, would have enabled Customs to better carry out its statutory duty under 19 U.S.C. 1500 and would have assisted Customs in establishing one of the levels of culpability necessary to constitute a violation under 19 U.S.C. 1592 in appropriate cases. As a result of the subsequent adoption of Customs modernization legislation (Title VI of Public Law 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057, 2170), the legal basis for the proposals set forth in the published document has been altered somewhat. In this regard Customs notes that, in furtherance of the principle of informed compliance, sections 637 and 638 of Public Law 103&hyph;182 amended 19 U.S.C. 1484 and 1500, inter alia, by shifting, from Customs to the importer of record, the legal responsibility for initially valuing, classifying and determining the rate of duty applicable to imported merchandise and by imposing on the importer of record a ``reasonable care'' standard in carrying out that responsibility. Since the published proposals have become outdated by virtue of the statutory changes described above, Customs believes it is preferable at this time to withdraw them. Customs intends to look at this matter further in connection with the overall review of the Customs Regulations for purposes of implementing the Customs modernization provisions, with a view to possible publication of new proposals for public comment at a future date. Until any such further public notice procedures are concluded, Customs will enforce existing statutory and regulatory requirements in this matter on a case-by-case basis. Samuel H. Banks, Acting Commissioner of Customs. Approved: June 14, 1994. John P. Simpson, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.
