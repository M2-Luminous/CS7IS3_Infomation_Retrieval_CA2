It appears that Hata, Japan's 51st prime minister who was elected by the Diet (Parliament) Monday [25 April], will have no choice but to dissolve the House of Representatives and call a general election once he gains Diet approval of the long-delayed fiscal 1994 budget, political observers say. There is little doubt that the Hata administration, the fifth minority government in Japan since the end of World War II, will achieve its goal of enacting the state budget since the SDP, once the largest contingent in the former ruling coalition, has promised to assist in securing its approval. But Hata will stumble over ways to address key policy issues such as the proposed consumer tax hike, trade friction with the United States and the country's stance on the suspected nuclear development program on the Korean peninsula. He is fully aware that coordinating policies within the ruling parties on those issues is crucial before the summit meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations meet in Naples, Italy in July. Given the SDP's withdrawal from the nine-month-old alliance, however, the shaky minority government is unlikely to be capable of making effective decisions as the SDP is no longer bound by a coalition policy platform it earlier signed with the other parties. Japan needs to hammer out substantial and specific macro-economic steps to improve its ties with the United States, over which a shadow has been cast since the breakdown of bilateral trade "framework" talks in February. The steps which have to be taken by the end of June include concrete measures on Japan's tax system reform and deregulation. Japan's market-opening package compiled by the coalition government of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in late March was rebuffed by the United States as a "half-finished work." The SDP, meanwhile, is strongly opposed to an increase in the 3 percent consumer tax, which essentially is inevitable if the government is to finance multiple-year income tax cuts. The SDP's opposition means that Hata's government may fail to enact necessary legislation by the end of the year and the party's defection from the coalition has even made the settlement of the tax matter before the July G-7 summit meeting more difficult and unlikely. The SDP quit the coalition immediately after the ruling parties struck a deal on policy issues, including the tax hike, to protest the sudden setting up of a 130-strong parliamentary group by Hata's Shinseito (the Japan Renewal Party) and other partners which excluded it. Now the Hata government even seems unable to tide over difficulties in its handling of the alleged nuclear issue with the DPRK. The SDP is also opposed to revising Japan's self-defense forces law to allow it to provide logistical support to U.S. warships in the event of a contingency demanding such action. It argues that such an extension of logistical support would run counter to Japan's constitution of renouncing war-like activities, which is generally interpreted to mean that is opposes collective security measures. Hosokawa's government was riven by cracks and mutual distrust after the coalition achieved the shared goal of passing political reform bills. Earlier this year, some analysts predicted that the coalition was filled with internal contradictions which could topple it if those conflicts escalated into open hostilities. The SDP's withdrawal from the coalition has opened a new chapter in Japan's political realignment but should Hata lose his sense of proportion for which he is acclaimed, his government is expected to collapse, even if there is no strong opposition from outside.
