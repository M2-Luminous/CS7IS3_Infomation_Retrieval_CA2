Reporters from Russian papers and news agencies attended the news conference. Our country's ambassador Son Song-pil answered reporters' questions. He explained in detail the background of our country's Foreign Ministry statement and pointed out: A spokesman for our country's Foreign Ministry issued a statement taking stern measures against the IAEA's unjust maneuvers of imposing sanctions against our country and its attempt to intrude into our country's military sites. The action taken by our country is a due measure against the IAEA's unjust maneuvers. The IAEA Board of Governors meeting, following the U.S. policy of crushing the DPRK, adopted a resolution on suspending the agency's assistance to our country and demanded the opening of our military sites. This is obviously the agency's sanctions against us and, in essence, a prelude to UN sanctions. Saying that we have made every possible effort regarding the core refueling operation, the envoy continued that the United States and the IAEA are, however, making a stir to impose sanctions and said: The IAEA sanctions are an intolerable humiliation to our people. Our people cannot negotiate with someone that infringes upon our nation's sovereignty and dignity. The more sanctions or pressures that are imposed on us, the stronger our volition will become and the freer our peaceful nuclear activities will become The stronger the pressure becomes, the more our people will sternly deal with it. It is our principled stance to respond to dialogue with dialogue and war with war. Sanctions and dialogue are incompatible. It is absurd that they insist on having dialogue while imposing pressure and sanctions. He then answered the reporters' questions.
