FR941012-0-00094 FR941012-0-00011 Discussed below are the specific PPE requirements of the final rule. OSHA notes that each of the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1)(iv) through (vii) require that the employer assures that the employee wears PPE meeting the requirement of the final rule. It is the responsibility of the employer to assure that serviceable PPE is available and worn by employees when required by the final rule. As discussed above in the Major Issues section, with the exception of logging boots, these specific PPE requirements impose on the employer the obligation to provide such PPE at no cost to the employee. Gloves Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this final rule requires that the employer provide, at no cost to the employee, and assure that each employee handling wire rope wears cotton gloves or other equivalent hand protection. In the proposed rule, OSHA specified that the employer provide hand protection consisting of suitable heavy-duty puncture-resistant gloves when employees were working with wire rope. Several State logging standards also require the use of gloves for employees working with wire rope (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38K). OSHA received many comments regarding the proposed requirement (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;30, 5&hyph;32, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;44, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;62, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92; Tr. OR 104). Many commenters objected to the requiring the use of puncture resistant gloves, such as leather gloves, for logging operations. First, commenters argued that there are no gloves that are puncture resistant in all circumstances (Ex. 5&hyph;54; Tr. OR 104). They argued that wire rope can puncture even leather gloves. Second, several commenters indicated that cotton gloves have become the industry standard and that their experience had shown that medium weight cotton gloves are considered safer than leather gloves in logging operations when punctures can occur. According to these commenters, cotton gloves give the logger a better feel of jaggers (broken wires in a wire rope) when they penetrate so the logger is able to quickly let go of the wire rope (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). They added that break-away gloves are imperative when the wire rope travels at high speed and reaction time is critical (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). They said that cotton gloves, but not leather gloves, will tear away from the hand when caught by a jagger rather than forcibly pulling the hand along with the jagger, causing the employee to fall and possibly into the path of the log (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). These commenters argued that pulling of the hand and glove could make a minor hand injury more serious such as making a small puncture wound a tear or laceration of the skin (Ex. 5&hyph;29). Third, one commenter indicated that cotton gloves provide adequate protection because a review of their recordable accidents since 1982 indicated that no employee wearing cotton gloves while handling wire rope had suffered an injury requiring medical attention (Ex. 5&hyph;45). Fourth, these commenters said leather gloves are generally considered hazardous for logging operations because they do not have good gripping ability on cable when wet (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;46). These commenters asserted that cotton gloves provided better gripping ability in the same circumstances. Fifth, commenters argued that the required gloves must be applicable and efficient for a wide range of logging activities. One commenter pointed out that employees who use saws also work with wire rope, and very few will take the time to change gloves between each operation (Ex. 5&hyph;35). For these reasons, OSHA has, in this final rule, changed the requirement for the use of hand protection to specify that cotton gloves or other equivalent hand protection must be worn when handling wire rope. Leg protection. At paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the employer provide, at no cost to the employee, and assure that each employee who operates a chain saw wears leg protection. This paragraph requires that the leg protection be comprised of ballistic nylon or other material that the employer demonstrates provides equivalent protection. In addition, this paragraph requires that the leg protection cover the full length of the thigh to the top of the boot on each leg. The pulpwood logging standard did not have a requirement for the use of chaps or other leg protection. The proposed rule would have required that chain-saw operators wear ballistic nylon or equivalent protection covering each leg from upper thigh to boot top or shoe top. Both the State of Washington and the State of Oregon logging standards require the use of leg protection by chain-saw operators (Ex. 2&hyph;22, 38K).
