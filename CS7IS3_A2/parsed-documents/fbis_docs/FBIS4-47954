His warning follows reports which say that part of the bridge has been in the hands of RPF soldiers on the Rwandan side of the border since the end of last month. Speaking after issuing a statement on defense and security in Ngara District, and after touring the bridge at the border, General Mboma said the Rusumo Bridge belonged to Tanzania. He told a representative of the RPF chief of general staff, Colonel William (Mbagile), that the Kagera River also belonged to Tanzania. He warned that Tanzania would not tolerate seeing its citizens, who use water from the Kagera River, continue to drink water contaminated with corpses from Rwanda. General Mboma also held talks with the Burundi chief of general staff, Lieutenant Colonel Jean Bikomagu, who assured him that the government and the Burundi Army are making efforts to restore peace in their country.
