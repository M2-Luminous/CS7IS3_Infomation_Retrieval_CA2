"Some progress was certainly made during 36 hours of negotiations, but it was insufficient," Sha'th told AFP. PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres are due to meet in Davos, Switzerland, on Saturday in a new effort to break the deadlock. They will examine 12 points of disagreement drawn up by the negotiators. Stressing the Palestine Liberation Organisation's "attachment" to the autonomy accord signed in Washington on September 13, Sha'th said the PLO "insists that the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho ends on the date set by the accord" -- April 13. "We will not accept any delay," Sha'th added. Israeli troops were to have begun withdrawing on December 13. Sha'th said he would attend the Davos talks with PLO economic department chief Ahmad Quray' (Abu-al-'Ala'). The two sides are trying to resolve differences over control of border crossings and the size of the future autonomous Jericho area in the West Bank. The PLO representative in Cairo, Sa'id Kamal, said that if 'Arafat and Peres ironed out the differences in Davos, negotiators would meet in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Taba to prepare the text of an agreement. 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin would then sign the agreement, he added. However in Jerusalem, Peres said Israel and the PLO still had much work to do before launching Palestinian self-rule. "Although I am generally an optimist I cannot promise that an accord will be reached in Davos," Peres said before leaving.
