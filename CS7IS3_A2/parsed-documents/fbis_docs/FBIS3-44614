A package of house sale policies has been worked out by the government to enable people to buy their homes. Analysts say that the sale of public houses is an "inevitable measure" in housing reform. Full-scale housing reform is to start this year and is to focus on selling most public houses while raising rents to cover future construction costs. A two-tier price system is to be set up. One system will apply to high income earners, under which prices will be set according to market levels. The other system, for middle and low income residents, is to be in two forms, low-profit price and standard price. Low-profit prices are set after deducting construction costs, sewage and utility fees, and the profits from real estate development. Standard prices cover the cost of building the apartments. The standard price of a new two-room apartment in 1993 is three times a couple's average salary in 1992. They are to pay 12 per cent of their income annually over the span of 25 years until they become owners of the houses. The scale for determining low and high income people will vary from region to region. The standard price will be an "active" one, meaning it will steadily reach up low-profit price by the year 2003, said Liu Zhifeng, Vice-Minister of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System. Houses will belong to buyers, said Liu, who is also the director of the Housing Reform Office under the State Council. China's public living quarters cover 2.7 billion square metres. Every year the government and enterprises spend at least 26 billion yuan ($2.9 billion) on maintenance. If 10 per cent of these houses were sold, even at 350 yuan ($40) per square metre, 94.5 billion yuan ($10.8 billion) could be recovered, according to Liu. Officials have said that public housing should not be sold at prices lower than government-set levels, so as to prevent corruption and wild speculation of State property. Officials from the Ministry of Construction said the development of real estate industry will also promote the construction materials metallurgy, machinery, chemistry and forestation industries. Western countries get 10 per cent of their revenue from the real estate sector. China earned only 2.3 per cent last year. Raising rents is also an important part of reform. According to the plan, rents will cover the costs of repair, management and depreciation through the end of 1995 and will later expand to include interest on capital investment and housing taxes. To help urban residents buy houses and pay rents, more housing accumulation funds will be set up. Shanghai was the first Chinese city to set up the fund. Since then, 104 of China's 194 cities above the prefecture levels have set up the accumulation fund. Every month, when the couple and their employers pay 5 per cent of their salary into the fund, the money is kept in the bank under the couple's name. The money from the fund can only be used to buy housing or pay the rent and maintenance costs. City residents can also get mortgage loans from the bank to buy houses and have been encouraged to buy in installments. The emphasis in housing reform will be put on large and medium- sized State enterprises, Liu said. Almost all provinces in China have drafted housing reform programmes and the plan has been implemented in more than 10 provinces and 30 cities. Zhangjiagang Port Administration in East China's Jiangsu Province has raised rents by a big margin and sold public housing to employees at low-profit price and market price. At present, about 92 per cent of the public housing has been sold. The government has also encouraged real estate companies to build more low-profit houses. Officials said at least 20 per cent of housing built by real estate companies should be affordable to the ordinary.
