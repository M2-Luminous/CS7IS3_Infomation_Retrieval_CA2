FR940825-0-00120 FR940825-0-00020 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Parts 204 and 642 [Docket No. 940553&hyph;4223; I.D. 050394A] RIN 0648&hyph;AE98 Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: NMFS issues this final rule to implement Amendment 7 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic (FMP). Amendment 7 divides the eastern zone commercial quota for the Gulf migratory group of king mackerel into equal quotas for the Florida east and west coast fisheries, further divides the quota for the west coast sub-zone into equal quotas for hook-and-line and run-around gillnet harvesters, and allows persons to fish under the gillnet quota in the west coast sub-zone only aboard vessels that have endorsements on their Federal commercial mackerel permits to fish with gillnets in that sub-zone. The intended effect of this rule is to allocate equitably the eastern zone commercial quota among users and avoid the negative social and economic emergencies related to a recent, disproportionately large, west coast harvest in the commercial fishery for Gulf group king mackerel off Florida. This rule also informs the public of the approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) of a collection-of-information requirement contained in this rule and publishes the OMB control number for that collection. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 23, 1994, except that the amendment to §204.1(b) is effective August 24, 1994; §642.4(m) is effective August 24, 1994, except for §642.4(m)(4), which is effective August 24, 1994, through October 31, 1994; and §§642.7(t), (u), and (v) and 642.28(b)(2) are effective November 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Requests for copies of the final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) may be sent to: Southeast Regional Office, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center Drive, St. Petersburg, FL 33702.
