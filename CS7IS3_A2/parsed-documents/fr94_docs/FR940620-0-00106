FR940620-0-00106 FR940620-0-00029 Response. The NPRM included an exception at 11.6 for doors on an accessible route through fixed security barriers. Under this exception, doors operated only by security personnel were exempt from the requirements for maneuvering clearance at doors (4.13.6), accessible door hardware (4.13.9), opening forces (4.13.11), and specifications for automatic doors (4.13.12) if provided. This exception has been moved to ADAAG 11.5 (Restricted and Secured Entrances) to apply to secured entrances. In addition, a reference to the requirements for door closers (4.13.10) has been added to the exception. Comment. In the NPRM, at least one restricted and secured entrance was required to be accessible according to ADAAG 4.14 (Entrances). ADAAG 4.14.1 requires, in part, that accessible entrances ``shall be connected by an accessible route to public transportation stops, to accessible parking and passenger loading zones, and to public streets or sidewalks if available *␣*␣*'' One comment indicated that entrances used by inmates or detainees and not the public should not be required to be connected by an accessible route to such elements since inmates usually arrive from system-operated vehicles and not from public transportation stops, parking spaces, or public streets and sidewalks. Response. ADAAG 4.14 requires accessible entrances to be connected by an accessible route to public transportation stops, accessible parking, passenger loading zones and public streets or sidewalks if available. The interim final rule contains an exemption at secured entrances for a connecting accessible route to public transportation stops, parking spaces, or public streets and sidewalks but not passenger loading zones. An example of a passenger loading zone at a secured entrance would be where detainees arrive or depart from a system-operated vehicle. The provision clarifies that such passenger loading zones, where provided, must comply with ADAAG 4.6.6 (Passenger Loading Zones). 11.6␣Security Systems This provision requires an accessible route complying with 4.3 (Accessible Route) to be provided through fixed security barriers at required accessible entrances. Where security barriers incorporate equipment such as metal detectors, fluoroscopes, or other similar devices which cannot be made accessible, an accessible route is required adjacent to such security screening devices to facilitate an equivalent path of travel. Few comments were received regarding this provision and no changes were made. The interim final rule has been clarified to require an accessible route through fixed security barriers at required accessible entrances. Where additional accessible entrances with security systems are provided, it is recommended that an accessible route be provided through those security systems as well. As discussed under section 11.5 (Restricted and Secured Entrances) the exception for doors and doorways has been moved to section 11.5. 11.7␣Two-way Communication Systems This provision requires that where a two-way communication system is provided to gain admittance to a facility or to restricted areas within the facility, the system shall provide both visible and audible signals and shall comply with 4.27 (Controls and Operating Mechanisms). Few comments were received regarding this provision and no changes were made. 11.8␣Electrical Outlets, Wiring and Conduit This provision requires that electrical outlets and appropriate wiring, conduit, or raceways be provided in specific areas to support communication equipment for persons with disabilities. State and local codes may contain provisions for the number and general placement of convenience outlets. This provision would require additional outlets to accommodate specific use requirements for communication access. Examples of current technology which assists persons with hearing impairments include assistive listening systems, or computer assisted real-time transcription. Examples of current technology which assists persons with vision impairments includes computerized reading devices with braille or magnification capability or closed circuit television reading or viewing devices. Where State and local codes specifically require outlets to support communication equipment, this provision would be satisfied if such outlets are provided in the specific locations required by this provision. Comment. The NPRM sought comment on the cost of providing wiring, conduit or raceways in new construction. Several commenters considered the cost minimal in new construction. The majority of commenters supported the provision. A few comments from individuals with disabilities and their organizations recommended including spectator areas, bailiffs' stations, speakers' rostrums, raised daises and all meeting rooms, not just those designated for public use, to the provision. Other commenters questioned the need for this provision as future technology may utilize infrared/wireless or fiber optics. Response. Language has been added to this provision to include spectator areas. While technology such as infrared/wireless or fiber optics is rapidly developing, it is not yet readily available. However, this provision would not prohibit the use of technology utilizing infrared, wireless or fiber optics when it is readily available. Comment. One commenter requested clarification on whether the recommendations for duplex outlets in the U.S. Courts Design Guide satisfies the ADAAG requirements in section 11.8 (Electrical Outlets, Wiring and Conduit). Response. The U.S. Courts Design Guide recommends that adequate power outlets be provided to support a wide variety of automated and regular office equipment. This provision specifically requires electrical outlets to support communication equipment for persons with disabilities. Comment. One commenter requested that persons with speech/language disabilities be mentioned as benefiting from this provision as augmentative or alternative communication devices may need recharging. Response. The Board agrees with the commenter that persons other than those with hearing and vision impairments will benefit from this provision. The interim final rule deletes the specific reference to persons with hearing and vision impairments. 11.9␣Permanently Installed Assistive Listening Systems This section requires certain areas in judicial, legislative and regulatory facilities to have a permanently installed assistive listening system.
