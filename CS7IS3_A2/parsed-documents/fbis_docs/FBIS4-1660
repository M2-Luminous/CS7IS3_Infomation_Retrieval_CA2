All trade unionists attending the "two sessions" were aware of their own new role: Being the "mouthpiece" of the interests of staff members and workers. They presented their views vehemently on numerous issues ranging from staff and worker ability to withstand the strains that should be given consideration in the course of reform, the status of workers and trade unions after the introduction of "a company system" to state-owned enterprises, protection of the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese personnel of foreign-funded enterprises, and perfection of a social security mechanism. Under the planned economy characterized by single ownership, the main role of trade unions was to care for staff and worker well-being and to ensure production. Thus the work of the then trade unions was figuratively summarized into "issuing film tickets, managing meal coupons, and collecting bathing tickets." China's trade unions are now becoming "antishock valves" enabling reform to progress in a stable society. At present the problem of Chinese enterprises suffering losses in operation, and suspending or partially suspending production remains pronounced. In many localities, prices have gone up quite rapidly, making life difficult for some staff members and workers. Many deputies to the National People's Congress and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference who were trade union members appealed to the government to give full consideration to the economic and mental ability of the general public to withstand the resulting strains of the various major reform measures to be taken. Meanwhile, they also briefed the sessions on moves taken by the trade unions in various localities to alleviate contradictions and reduce friction. Sun Hongrong, president of the China Textile Trade Union, said: As Shanghai's textile industry was confronted with structural readjustment, staff and workers would have to leave their current posts and seek new jobs. The trade union of the municipality's textile departments sponsored all types of training courses to pass on job-seeking knowledge free of charge to staff members and workers who had quit their current posts, and ran job introduction centers and undertakings in the tertiary industry to find jobs for them. Li Guozhong, president of the Liaoning Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, remarked: Liaoning is a heavy industrial base. In recent years, some enterprises have been in depression. Trade unions kept files of staff members and workers who had exceptionally great financial difficulties and reported their situations to the government so they could receive relief funds. Trade unions also organized retired staff and workers of state-owned enterprises to do part-time jobs in township and town enterprises. This enabled them both to bring their remaining energies into play and to increase their incomes. Whether the status of staff members and workers drops after state-owned enterprises establish a modern enterprise systems is also a hot point with which trade unionists are very much concerned. In the past, a state-owned enterprise had an enterprise management committee, a congress of representatives of staff members and workers, and an administrative affairs office, dubbed "three old bodies," and its staff and workers had a great say in enterprise policy making. Once enterprise structural reform is introduced, an enterprise has a congress of shareholders, a board of directors, and a supervisory organ, dubbed "three new bodies." In some newly established shareholding enterprises, the "three old bodies" have come to a standstill. Fang Jiade, vice president of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, informed this reporter: Currently, in giving publicity to enterprise reform, undue emphasis is laid on property rights relationship to the neglect of labor relationship and on funds and equipment to the neglect of the role of laborers in pushing productive forces forward. As China further opens up to the outside world and the number of foreign-funded enterprises expands, labor-capital disputes are also increasing in number. The question of infringement of the rights and interests of Chinese personnel has attracted the attention of trade unionists. Jiang Rong, former president of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, provided this reporter with material like this: A foreign-funded restaurant in Shanghai gave half an hour for job aplicants to read the Chinese- version contracts and then asked them to sign English-version contracts. During the probation period, when the employees who could not bear the illegal actions of searching their bodies and bags asked to renounce their contracts with their 340 yuan in cash pledge lost in accordance with the Chinese-version contracts, the enterprise showed them the English-version contracts, which stipulated that if the employees wanted to renounce contracts, apart from returning their cash pledge, they should pay 5,000 yuan in compensation fees. Hence, there was an outcry among the employees. On the issue, he said: In foreign-funded enterprises, it is imperative for trade unions to hold collective talks with enterprises on the employees' behalf on such issues as wages, working hours, labor protection, and safety in production, and to sign common collective contracts. The pressing matter of the moment is to speed up establishment of trade unions in foreign-funded enterprises. According to statistics, of the foreign-funded enterprises which have already started operation, less than a half have set up trade unions. Trade unionists also confessed: To safeguard the interests of staff members and workers once and for all, it is necessary to perfect the social security system and solve for members of society the difficulties caused by old age, diseases, injury and disability, unemployment, and poverty. At present, it is necessary to enact "labor," "social security," "labor protection," "minimum wage," and "labor contract" laws as quickly as possible. Trade unions should be invited to participate in the whole process of drafting laws which have a bearing on staff member and worker immediate interests. Just as a labor expert said: Internationally, no country in the world can effect an economic takeoff when labor-capital relations are strained and society is turbulent. In countries with a developed market economy, a "three-party" principle has been developed, under which labor relations are handled by the government, enterprises, and trade unions through consultations. China joined the "Treaty on Promotion of the Implementation of International Labor Standards Through Three-Party Consultations" four years ago. This clearly shows China's positive attitude toward the issue. With the improvement of the socialist market economic structure, the "three-party" principle will be gradually established in China and the status or role of trade unions will become increasingly important.
