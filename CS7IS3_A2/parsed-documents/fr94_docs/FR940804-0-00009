FR940804-0-00009 FR940804-0-00005 19 CFR Part 4 [T.D. 94&hyph;63] Addition of Italy to the List of Countries Entitled to Reciprocal Cruising Licenses for its Pleasure Vessels AGENCY: Customs Service, Treasury. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document amends the Customs Regulations by adding Italy to the list of countries whose pleasure vessels may be issued U.S. cruising licenses. Customs has been informed that yachts used and employed exclusively as pleasure vessels belonging to any U.S. resident are allowed to arrive at and depart from Italian ports and cruise in the waters of Italy without being subjected to formal entry and clearance procedures. Therefore, Customs is extending reciprocal entry and clearance procedures to Italian-flag pleasure vessels. EFFECTIVE DATE: These reciprocal privileges became effective for Italy on March 11, 1994. This amendment is effective August 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Barbara Whiting, Carrier Rulings Branch, 202&hyph;482&hyph;6940. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 4.94(a), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.94(a)), provides that U.S. documented vessels with a recreational endorsement, that are used exclusively for pleasure and not engaged in any trade and that do not violate the U.S. Customs or navigation laws, may proceed from port to port in the U.S. or to foreign ports without entering and clearing, provided they have not visited a hovering vessel. However, when returning from a foreign port or place, such pleasure vessels are required to report their arrival pursuant to §4.2, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.2). Foreign-flag yachts entering the U.S. are generally required to comply with the laws applicable to foreign vessels arriving at, departing from, and proceeding between ports of the U.S. See, for example, §433, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1433). However, §4.94(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.94(b)), provides that pleasure vessels from certain countries found to exempt U.S. pleasure vessels from certain formal Customs procedures may be issued cruising licenses that reciprocally exempt them from similar, U.S. formal entry and clearance procedures ( e.g., filing manifests, obtaining permits to proceed, and paying entry and clearance fees). Then, upon arrival at each U.S. port of entry, the masters of such licensed vessels simply report the fact of arrival to the appropriate Customs office. Also, yachts or pleasure vessels not carrying passengers or merchandise in trade are exempt from paying tonnage tax and light money pursuant to §4.21(b)(5), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.21(b)(5)). The list of such countries that have been granted reciprocal customs privileges is set forth at §4.94(b). By diplomatic note dated January 20, 1994, the Embassy of Italy, in Washington, D.C., informed the Department of State that Italy allows U.S. yachts and other pleasure boats to arrive at and depart from Italian ports and to cruise without payment of import duties or taxes and free of import prohibitions and restrictions, subject to re-exportation and certain other conditions. By letter dated March 7, 1994, the Department of State advised the Chief, Carrier Rulings Branch, U.S. Customs Service, that the Italian treatment of U.S. pleasure vessels in Italian waters appeared to satisfy the conditions for reciprocal customs privileges and recommended that Italy be added to the list of countries under the provisions of 19 CFR 4.94(b). The Director, International Trade Compliance Division, is of the opinion that satisfactory evidence has been furnished to grant the reciprocal privileges allowed under §4.94(b), effective March 11, 1994, and requested that Italy be added to the list of countries enumerated at §4.94(b). Authority to amend this section of the Customs Regulations has been delegated to the Chief, Regulations Branch. Inapplicability of Public Notice and Comment Requirements, Delayed Effective Date Requirements, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and Executive Order 12866 Because this amendment merely reflects a statutory requirement that confers a benefit upon the public, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), notice and public procedure thereon are not required. Furthermore, for the same reasons, good cause exists for dispensing with a delayed effective date under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) (1) and (3). Since this document is not subject to the notice and public procedure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553, it is not subject to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). This amendment does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in Executive Order 12866. Drafting Information The principal author of this document was Janet L. Johnson, Regulations Branch. However, personnel from other offices of the Customs Service participated in its development.
