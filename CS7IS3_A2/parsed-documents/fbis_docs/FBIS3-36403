In his speech Yuriy Kostenko especially drew the attention of the representatives from CSCE member states to Ukraine's deep concern that a tendency has recently been discerned in Russia's policy toward increasing the toughness of its foreign policy course, in particular toward the independent states created after the break-up of the USSR. Notwithstanding the statements on the main new threat to international peace and security, which Russia describes as aggressive nationalism, the Ukrainian representative continued, whether it wants to or not Russia is provoking the exacerbation of this issue and thus is inciting the citizens of Russian descent in other states to expressions of national intolerance. The speech by the head of Ukraine's delegation was positively evaluated by the delegation from the United States, which interpreted it as an attempt at an early stage to facilitate the prevention of conflicts emerging on an interethnic basis, in particular in the Crimea.
