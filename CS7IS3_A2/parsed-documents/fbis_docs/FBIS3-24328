A party program and charter and several resolutions were adopted at the congress. Janis Jurkans was installed as party chairman. The founders of the PNS will continue to work in the Accord for Latvia faction in the Saeima. The party constituent congress was attended by Saeima deputies Andris Ameriks and Igors Bukovskis, and the party declaration was also signed by Lyudmila Kupriyanova. The PNS was founded on the basis of the Latvian Support Fund. Some of the Accord for Latvia deputies who were not involved in the establishment of the PNS--Edvins Kide, Juris Janeks, Yevgeniy Zashcherinskiy, Vilnis Edvins Bresis, and Janis Lucans--will form their own party at the end of March and join the National Economy and Prosperity bloc. The programs of the two groups will continue to agree with the platform of the Accord for Latvia and Recovery for the National Economy bloc. When Saeima Deputy Igors Bukovskis addressed the congress, he said there was no split in the faction. It was simply that the bolder members were quicker to form their own party. He expressed the hope that the other deputies in the faction would join the PNS soon. Forty people voted in favor of the creation of the PNS at a general meeting, including Mavriks Vulfsons, Nikolajs Nejlands, Juris Rozenvalds, Ilze Jurkane, Ivars Kezbers, Vladlens Dozorcevs, and Janis Aboltins. One of the authors of the party program, Juris Rozenvalds, remarked at the congress that the PNS would take a centrist stance, would support the market economy and the development of entrepreneurial activity, and would defend the active voting rights of residents in local elections. In his opinion, the PNS's closest neighbors in the spectrum of political parties are the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party of Labor, and the Latvian Social Democratic Workers Party. The PNS program advocates the election of the president of the state by all of the people, calls for the unity of the Latvian public, and requests the Saeima to pass a declaration on ethnic and social reconciliation. The PNS believes that people who have lived in Latvia for the last 10 years and have a conversational knowledge of the Latvian language are entitled to citizenship, but preference in the granting of citizenship should be given to permanent residents who were born in Latvia (with the exception of foreign servicemen on active duty and their descendants) and the family members of citizens of the Latvian Republic. The PNS recommends that the naturalization of non-citizens start as soon as possible. The PNS sees Latvia's main foreign policy objective as the normalization of relations with Russia and other CIS countries. The economic section of the PNS program expresses support for the market economy, as well as for the state as the largest owner of capital and the coexistence of various forms of entrepreneurial activity.
