SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 8, 1993, complainants Nordstrom and MF&C filed a complaint with the Commission alleging violations of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 in the importation and sale of certain plastic ball valves and components thereof which are allegedly covered by four claims of U.S. Letters Patent 4,047,275, which is owned by MF&C and licensed to Nordstrom. The Commission instituted an investigation of the complaint on December 16, 1993. 58 F.R. 65731. On January 28, 1994, complainants and respondents NGPC and Friatec filed a joint motion to terminate the investigation based on a settlement agreement. On the same date, complainants filed a motion to withdraw the complaint as to the final respondents, MTD and P&P. Both motions were supported by the Commission investigative attorney. On April 4, 1994, the ALJ issued an ID granting both motions. No petitions for review, or agency or public comments were received. This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337) and section 210.53 of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 210.53).
