FR940328-1-00023 FR940328-1-00009 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931100&hyph;4043; I.D. 032194G] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Apportionment of reserve; request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS proposes to apportion reserve to certain target species in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to allow for ongoing harvest and account for previous harvest of the total allowable catch (TAC). It is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. DATES: Comments must be received at the following address no later than 4:30 p.m., Alaska local time, April 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be sent to Ronald J. Berg, Chief, Fisheries Management Division, Alaska Region, NMFS, 709 W. 9th, Room 453, Juneau, AK 99801 or P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802, Attention: Lori Gravel. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Martin Loefflad, Resource Management Specialist, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS, (907) 586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI area of the U.S. exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP), prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the initial TACs specified for pollock and Greenland turbot in the Bering Sea, for Pacific ocean perch, Greenland turbot, and pollock in the Aleutian Islands, for Atka mackerel in the combined Eastern Aleutian District and Bering Sea subarea, and for Pacific cod in the BSAI, need to be supplemented from the non-specific reserve in order to continue operations and account for prior harvest. Therefore, in accordance with ยง675.20(b), NMFS proposes to apportion from the reserve to TACs for the following species: (1) For the Bering Sea area_99,750 metric tons (mt) to pollock and 700 mt to Greenland turbot; (2) for the Aleutian Islands area_1,635 mt to Pacific ocean perch, 350 mt to Greenland turbot, and 4,245 mt to pollock; (3) for the combined Eastern Aleutian District and Bering Sea subarea_2,021 mt to Atka mackerel; and (4) for the BSAI management area_28,650 mt to Pacific cod. These proposed apportionments are consistent with ยง675.20(a)(2)(i) and do not result in overfishing of a target species or the ``other species'' category, because the revised TACs are equal to or less than specifications of acceptable biological catch. Pursuant to ยง675.20(a)(3)(i), the proposed apportionments of pollock are allocated between the inshore and offshore components: (1) For the Bering Sea_34,913 mt to vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component and 64,837 mt to vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component; and (2) for the Aleutian Islands_1,486 mt to vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component and 2,759 mt to vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component. Pursuant to ยง675.20(a)(3)(iv), the proposed apportionment of the BSAI Pacific cod TAC is allocated 573 mt to vessels using jig gear, 12,606 mt to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear, and 15,471 mt to vessels using trawl gear. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 675.20 and 675.24. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 675 Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq .
