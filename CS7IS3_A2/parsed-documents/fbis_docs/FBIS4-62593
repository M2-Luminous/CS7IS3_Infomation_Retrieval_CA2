FBIS4-62593 "drsov095_f_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-095 Daily Report 13 May 1994 National Affairs Radio Phone-In With President Kravchuk Radio Phone-In With President Kravchuk LD1405135294 Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in Ukrainian 1900 GMT 13 May 94 LD1405135294 Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service Ukrainian BFN [Phone-in interview with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk by moderator Volodymyr Bodenchuk, chief editor of the MOLOD UKRAYINY newspaper; phone-in takes place at the newspaper's office in Kiev on 13 May -- recorded] [Summary from poor reception] [Bodenchuk] Leonid Kravchuk has taken part in a similar phone-in at the newspaper's office before, about a year ago, and this is a continuation of those conversations. [Caller] Is a monument to Mykhaylo Hrushevskyy, president of the Ukrainian People's Republic, going to be erected in Kiev, and if so when and where. [Kravchuk] Such a monument will be erected and the plan for this has been elaborated. Its location has not yet been decided, but it is expected to be erected by 1995. [Caller] Three or four years ago, when Ryzhkov was still in the former Union, bonds were distributed. In 1993, we should have received the goods from them, let us put it like that -- cars, refrigerators, and so on. How is this issue being resolved, and will it be resolved or not? [Kravchuk] Well, this issue is extremely complicated for us, from the aspect that considerable funds are needed for this. But the fact remains that it should be resolved -- you remember that this issue has been raised two or three times at Supreme Council sittings. At the last Supreme Council sitting an instruction was issued to the executive power -- in particular to the Cabinet of Ministers -- to find a mechanism to compensate in full the debts from indexation of deposits and everything connected with the paying back of debts to the people. There are two main proposals now: The first is to include, for instance, savings, property subject to privatization. There are other proposals too. We are currently elaborating all of those versions that are possible, so that they are realistic, so as not to simply promise something to people, as before, and then not to hand it over. Because, if I know today that I have no funds in the budget, but I tell you that I will pay back to you, well this will be just hot air, and there is no need to engage in this. We are studying the versions. But the fact that it should be paid back to people, and that it will be returned -- there can be no other talk, as they say. The talk can only be about how to do this most efficiently and realistically -- so as not to promise, but to resolve. [Caller, in Russian] I am an engineer and mother of two from Kherson. My family is facing problems due to low earnings and food shortages. I had to take an extra job to make ends meet. How long can I hold out like this? [Kravchuk, in Russian] Today no one is the enemy of his own people and the state and all people should support one another in these hard times. Today one should not engage in populism and make hollow promises, thus deceiving the people, because people will finally lose their faith in the authorities. All these elections will be rendered meaningless. I appreciate her efforts to cope with the difficulties independently and promise that the state will do everything possible to support the people who find themselves in such difficulties. [Bodenchuk] There was a letter from Ivan Piven who works at an agricultural firm in Lvov who calls on the president of Ukraine to exercise all his powers to stop the political orgy connected with the plot of the procommunist councils. Everyone understands that the early election of the president and the election of the local bodies of power are disastrous for the state, which is just beginning to feel the first signs of stabilization. [Kravchuk] One can agree with the second part of this proposal, this letter, that it is necessary to prepare a legal basis at first and then to hold elections. This is the right of the people and the right, after all, of the Supreme Council too, and the right of all to determine what system our state will be based upon. Whether it will be a unitarian state, or a federative one, as some people propose. All this is the right of the people, I repeat this, and not only a concrete person. This is a very, well, large-scale problem dealing with, probably, every man -- even the one who has not yet been born. What kind of a state will we have? We cannot solve this problem quickly and spontaneously. This is why I say that it is necessary to create a legal basis -- to determine plenary powers, to determine the status. Some leaders at oblast level are unaware of the nature of their relations with the central bodies of power and have no plan of action. If this move is not backed up with a legal basis, this can be disastrous for the state, and I agree with this. By the way, we also have Crimea's experience. I was talking with journalists today. Autonomy was granted to Crimea in 1990. Only two years later the law on the delimitation of plenary powers was adopted and over these two years Crimea has covered the distance that should now be backed up with a legal basis, but it is much more difficult to go back than to do what should be done from the very beginning. As for stopping them, for example, only by the powers granted by the people, there are nuances here. It is necessary to act in compliance with the law. If every one of us starts to violate the law and act only by the force of authority...[pauses]. The authority is strong only when it is legitimate. If it is illegitimate, it can be strong but then it is not a democratic but a totalitarian authority. If I make this step, say, toward totalitarianism and act proceeding not from law but from the position of strength and fear, or compulsion or pressure, then this will be a return to what we already learned and what we had already lived through. I cannot fully agree with the first point, but I agree with the second part 100 percent. [Caller] Does the president, as a presidential candidate in the forthcoming presidential election, have an anticrisis program. [Kravchuk] The following should be said here: Ukraine and its president do have an anticrisis program. What is more, it, in principle, was also adopted by the Supreme Council. It consists of three parts. Part one is the anti-inflation program that was approved. Second, there is the program of concrete steps, and third the program that was included in the socioeconomic development plan and the budget. That is to say, all those documents represent this program. What is the problem then? The problem is not the absence of a program but the mechanisms of its' implementation, and this is where we continuously stumble. We have not yet worked out the mechanisms that would allow us, let us say, to work effectively. For example -- here is an example to make it clearer -- the anti-inflation program that we approved, for instance, is oriented toward market mechanisms, such as privatization and demonopolization, i.e. toward the processes that again are in the program. But if privatization and demonopolization progress today is poor for various reasons -- which I will not speak about now -- such as issues of communal and state ownership, and the laws that have been produced, which is a whole, great topic for a conversation and I do not want to approach it now -- if there is no privatization and demonopolization yet, (there can be no) anti-inflation program. In other words, the program is ahead of time and is more our wish than our possibilities. It is not only the programs that are wrong. He who thinks that we lack a program is mistaken. We have enough programs but we have not got enough people capable of carrying out a program, and we are again short of fully developed mechanisms because of a lack of certain experience in carrying them out at banks, financial and commercial structures. Yesterday, for instance, I signed a directive on Ukraine's holding companies. There is no law determining the principles that a holding company is based on. After its' finalization in all structures, we have, for one and a half months, been working with specialists in order to settle this issue of principle. After all, holding should become a form of joint stock organization [aktsionuvannya] and a form of corporatization, which is the shortest way to market mechanisms and market structures. So, however one looks at it, it should be started from scratch. But even that is not a problem. The problem is that everyone should want to start, and make quick progress, which, unfortunately, is what is lacking. The program, however, is there. [Caller] [question indistinct] [Kravchuk] So, tell me what you would have done if you were me? Well, just what would you have done immediately had you been elected president tomorrow? What would your first steps in relation to Russia have been? [Caller] I would have considered the example of other states. I would have considered the conduct of Estonia, for instance, where the president is a brave man protecting his land. He is not afraid of this (giant) that Russia is. [Kravchuk] In this case, one cannot but be afraid -- one should fear no one. [sentence as heard] One should, however, act so that tomorrow our children will not go to war. Your point of view, you see, is this. Apart from Kiev, for example, there is also -- (I will generalize), the (eastern) part of Ukraine. All in all, around 9 million Russians live somewhere there, in the east. So, suppose we should declare today, all of a sudden, that we want to have nothing in common with Russia because it is so and so, turn our backs on Russia, if that part of our body could be described by that word, and go some other way. First, what would start in Ukraine itself, is the expression of various points of view on this. There would then be no need for anyone to make peace among us as we would fall out among ourselves, the east with the west, the center, the east, and the south. So what one should do is to maintain peace. No one is afraid of Russia, no one wants to be under Russia, and my position is clear: With Russia, but not under Russia! [Caller] Yet, it is time now for us to show that we do not just grovel to someone. [Kravchuk] This is exactly what we show. But why, for example, have we now found ourselves in the situation where we have not got energy carriers or this or that? We have to compromise and have a flexible policy in order not to lose our statehood. We would always lose statehood when we would not compromise, when we would fall out and when we would not take account of real forces. It was then that we would lose our state. We need patience. We have to compromise today in order to become stronger. Once we are stronger and more powerful, our voice will grow stronger. Now, however, screaming and having nothing to support us is somewhat reminiscent, you know, of screaming by someone who is very weak but saying: I will get you, I will get you, I will get you! -- yet running the other way. Joking aside, the truth is that we cannot take the risk. We cannot risk our people. We cannot risk our state. We have to act wisely, calmly and considerately. I can understand you, caller. I absolutely understand you. You want our Ukraine to be strong, for its voice to be heard worldwide. Do I not want this or does anyone else not want this? You want Ukraine to have prestige. Do I not want this? Maybe, I want it more than anything else in the world, but, trust me, I do know the distribution of forces and the situation, and I do so better than you -- no hard feelings. I do know that if I take a wrong step today, we will lose everything tomorrow. [Caller] Well, what about Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev behaving as he pleases in our (Crimea)? Kravchuk: Never mind. The main thing for us is to hold the fort and then we will tell him how to behave himself. [Caller] The people are losing hope. Hopelessness is what is (frightening). [Kravchuk] The people should understand -- and you must say this as well -- that nihilism should not be sown now. (You must tell them) that every time one is starting to build something, one should build it and then be independent. But in the situation where we have not yet built our state and are still building it, facing everyone at once and, shall we say, showing force, requires that force to be there. In general, I am against any force. I am for living in peace. You can see what the show of force has led to for those who practiced it. They, up till now, have not been able to make both ends meet. Take Yugoslavia: Two million of its people are now living outside that country, have become refugees or are wandering worldwide. I have recently spoken to Azerbaijani President Aliyev: 200,000 people are living in tents at that end of the country, in Iran, Iraq, and so on. We have so far restrained ourselves. We are not destroying anything. We are in the process of building. We need patience and flexibility and we need to compromise -- although you are saying that this should be ended and so on -- in order to build it. Once we have built it, then the attitude toward us will change accordingly. Once we have had enough wisdom to build it, we will be respected. Trust me, I have as great a desire as you do. One cannot, however, have a desire alone if it is not backed by any real possibilities. [Caller] I am a correspondent from Radio Liberty's Moscow bureau. Our first question is on the possibility of the presidential election now indeed being cancelled by the current Supreme Council... [Kravchuk, interrupts in Russian] Well, it is difficult for me to tell you whether it will or will not be. I have presented to the Supreme Council a message where, in what seemed to me to be a well-founded manner, I tried to explain why the election today -- ahead of settling all legal and other issues at constitutional level -- would not only be, as it were, undesirable for Ukraine, but might also become a danger. What the parliament will decide, I cannot say. The only thing I do know is that 120 deputies, approximately two weeks ago, backed this proposal. It is supported by local councils, enterprises' work-forces, scientists, people. In other words, this question is such that it should be addressed at parliamentary level and such a document has been sent to parliament. [Caller, in Russian] My second question is this: (You know that) an economic agreement may be signed between Russia and Crimea. How do you feel about these bilateral ties between Russia and Crimea? [Kravchuk, in Russian] Well, as for a trade and economic agreement, we can say that Ukraine, for example, has its own trade and economic relations with Tatarstan. We have also signed an appropriate agreement. That is why I cannot see any problems if the Crimean autonomous republic were to sign trade or other relations of an economic nature with other entities. I hope you understand that it is trade and economic ties that we are talking about, provision for which was, on the whole, made in our documents and decisions, as it were. We are not talking about the conclusion of any political treaties as an entity of international law. That Crimea might act as an entity in international law is not provided for and, let us say, is today excluded. [Caller] Here is my question. Since the Supreme Council of Crimea and its current leadership tend to operate a pro-Moscow policy rather than a pro-Kiev one, do you think the transition of Crimea to Russia is a possibility? How does the Russian leadership feel about this with regard to the international situation? [Kravchuk] I will answer your question. The leadership of Russia is a broad notion, to a certain extent. There are executive authorities within the leadership of Russia. [Caller] Yes, I have in mind the top leadership. [Kravchuk] For example, the president. For example, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, President Yeltsin, and others. As official statements read, they support Ukraine's integrity and this is stipulated in our treaties and the trilateral agreement. The inviolability of borders, the integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine are supported by both the executive authorities in Russia and other states: The United States of America, France, Great Britain, and Germany. That is to say, we enjoy full international support as far as this issue is concerned. This is the first thing. Second, it is Russia's representative structures that are conducting a crafty policy today. I have in mind the Russian Duma. Well, the Duma's deputies and others arrive and allow themselves to declare that Crimea is the territory of Russia, that it was and will belong to Russia, that the fleet belongs to Russia. The local authorities in Crimea also support such statements by these people but these are their wishes only. No international agreements, no other documents or agreements between Ukraine and Russia envisage -- on the contrary they stipulate that Ukraine, as a state, is integral and inviolable. We will conduct this very policy. However, there is no doubt that, well, such a trend, such a stand, such a desire on the part of the people in Crimea does exist. To prevent this we must do everything possible so that life becomes better both in Ukraine and in Crimea. Believe me, when it becomes better, these issues will be relegated to the background. [Caller] [passage indistinct] [Kravchuk] Well, it may well be that this, let us say openly, is propaganda, because Russia cannot be assessed by what Moscow and St. Petersburg are like. Let them go deep into Russia and see for themselves what there is.... [Caller, interrupts] Why take three Russian cities and say that Russia is better-off. [Caller] Leonid Makarovych, this is [name indistinct] calling you. I am an engineer and work as deputy department head [words indistinct] Statistics Ministry. I do not think that privatization in Ukraine fully takes account of the interests of the Ukrainians proper. The impression is that there are no rich businessmen and entrepreneurs of Ukrainian nationality. The state does not take proper care with the participation of Ukrainians in business. So the question of how many Ukrainians of Ukrainian origin have businesses is very important. Leonid Kravchuk mentioned the United States of America as an example of a country where business circles are represented by the people of various nationalities. If we approach business proceeding from ethnic belonging, we will not last long, believe me, he added. The caller then referred to American Indians who, in his opinion, achieved more in the United States than Ukrainians in Ukraine. He said they concluded a treaty with the occupants, as he put it, in compliance with which they receive compensation for the use of their land to the value of $400. He then said that privatization in Ukraine, if carried out by all kind of swindlers, may affect the interests of the Ukrainian population. [Kravchuk] I will take your remarks into account. But I would like to repeat that one should act in this case proceeding from the following criterion: If a person is doing something good to Ukraine, proper conditions should be created for this person. Because, excuse me for saying this, but there are such Ukrainians with whom I would not like to communicate and there are such Russians and Jews with whom I would like to sit and have a cup of tea. This is a normal phenomenon. [Koltsov, in Russian] Good afternoon. I am Vladimir Koltsov of the Moscow-based radio station Yunost [youth] of the Ostankino Company. Leonid Makarovich, I have this question: The thing is that yesterday the Supreme Council did not put the issue on postponing the early election of the president on the agenda. What do you intend to do next in this situation? [Kravchuk] No, it seems that you are not quite precise. Yesterday the Supreme Council made up the agenda for three days only. That is to say, it put only organizational issues on the agenda. Namely, the election of the presidium, then the formation of the working bodies of the Supreme Council, that is the election of the chairman, deputy chairmen, and the formation of the committees. Today they are tackling issues connected with the setting up of groups and groupings, the time limit, and so on. That is to say, the Supreme Council did not put on the agenda the issues other than those dealing with the organization of the work of the Supreme Council itself. However, it did enter the issue on postponing the election in the list of issues to be discussed by the Supreme Council after the organizational issues are solved. [Koltsov] But Leonid Makarovich, what do you think, in your view, will the deputies agree to postponing the presidential election, as very little time now remains until that date. [Kravchuk] Well, you see, the issue here, whether little or much time remains, for instance, the deputies have now divided into two sections. Some of them are in favor of postponing the elections of both the president and of local bodies. The others, say, are in favor of only postponing the presidential election, but to hold elections, say, to the local bodies. Whether they agree or not, I understand it thus, that any issue, no matter whether it is resolved late or early, even if it is not ready, it must be resolved correctly. The problem is not the time period. The problem is the rightness and necessity of the issue. Because, for instance, if one is faced with such a dilemma -- today something bad has to be done, it is planned to do something bad, little time remains to stop this bad thing, and we consciously agree to a bad step, for instance, being guided only by the idea that there is little time left. This does not happen. There is political advisability, need, necessity, importance, and, as one says, political consequences. That is the main thing. So, I have presented, one can say, all of the arguments to the Supreme Council. Their job is to decide, to decide finally, that is to decide. And all those, who should go to the elections, will decide. [Koltsov] Leonid Makarovich, tell me, how do you evaluate the future of the further, let us say, dispute between Russia and Ukraine on the matter of the Black Sea Fleet. [Kravchuk] We should resolve this issue, as, incidentally, the day before yesterday or thereabouts, I dispatched a letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, about us, well, on the whole, embarking on a continuation of these talks at a higher, if one can express it thus, level of representation, about us instructing our governments, or at the level of deputy prime ministers or prime ministers, to sit down and make specific proposals, and sign them, not passing them over to other authorities. Because when we assemble there, for instance, with the president, with the government, we resolve issues. Then we hand them over to authorities, ministries, departments. They begin to go the rounds and to wreck, as one says, these issues right there. Therefore, they should be resolved at a substantial level and submitted for signature, fundamentally--it seems to me--elaborated and coordinated. Now the goodwill and understanding of the interests of both Ukraine and Russia are needed. [Unidentified caller] Tell me please, might one call your decision to stand in the presidential election on 26 June a final one? [Kravchuk] Well, you see, I want the Supreme Council to examine my appeal and to decide on it. If the Supreme Council postpones the election, then naturally I will withdraw my candidacy from the voting. If the Supreme Council leaves the decision of the old Supreme Council in force, that is, it does not postpone or stop the election, that means that I will take part in the election like all the others. [Caller] If the election nevertheless, takes place, who of the other contenders for the post of president do you consider to be your main competitor? [Kravchuk] Well, it is difficult to say now. You see, the situation is changing. Clearly the main ones, I think, the most credible contenders, who have already made themselves known, whom Ukraine knows about and who have the right image, are Ivan Plyushch and Leonid Kuchma. For instance, I know that certain circles, certain structures and certain people have a favorable attitude to the young contenders too, in particular to Valeriy Babych and Volodymyr Lanovyy. I think that Oleksandr Moroz too, has some possibilities for taking an active part in the election, and so do others, that is Petro Talanchuk. That is, I would not want to belittle anyone now or to single anyone out. Everyone has a chance. But the voting will show who has made use of it. [Prytula] Leonid Makarovych, this is Volodymyr Prytula, a journalist from the Crimea. Leonid Makarovych, at a news conference today Serhiy Tsekov, chairman of Crimea's Supreme Council, spoke in favor of Crimea forming its own National Guard. What is your attitude to this, and in general what measures will you take regarding this? [Kravchuk] The Crimea is not a state; the Crimea is an autonomous republic, and according to Ukraine's legislation, the formation of its own armed forces or a guard or something else is not envisaged by the Crimea. [Prytula] [passage indistinct] [Kravchuk] No one in the Crimea will accept it, because it is not a subject of international law. [Starozhytska] This is Mariya Starozhytska from the television news agency "Vikna" [Windows]. Yevgeniy Saburov and Aleksandr Shokhin are to sign an accord in the Crimea tomorrow [14 May] on cooperation between the Crimea and Russia. What is your attitude to this as president of Ukraine? [Kravchuk] Well, this needs to be formulated more precisely. They are to sign an agreement on trade and economic cooperation. We have also signed, Ukraine has signed corresponding agreements on economic and trade cooperation between, for instance, Ukraine and Tatarstan. And, let us say, Russia did not become warm nor cold because of this, and we could work normally with Tatarstan. We also sign corresponding trade and economic agreements with other regions of Russia. And there is no problem, for instance, when precisely a trade and economic agreement between the Crimea and Russia is concluded, but this is not, as you say, on cooperation, partnership, or something else. This is not a political--not a document with the nature of a treaty--this an agreement on trade, on economic relations. This is envisaged. There is no problem with this. But if, for instance, it had been about a treaty between two states, if, for instance, Russia had signed some kind of interstate document with the Crimea, or military-political, or some other kind of document--this is impossible now, because the Crimea is not a subject of international law. The Crimea is an autonomy within the composition of Ukraine. But it can have economic relations with any state. [Bodenchuk] Here is a question sent in by representatives of the U.S. magazine EASTERN ECONOMIST: The United States and other Western states conditioned the allocation of a certain financial aid to Ukraine by the implementation of economic reform. New economic programs should be drafted and submitted toward that end. If they are being drafted, who is engaged in this process? When and how can one expect that the implementation of this reform will get under way? Answering this question Leonid Kravchuk said that such programs, although they are not perfect, do exist. He also said that an expert group of the International Monetary Fund is expected to arrive in Ukraine soon to complete the elaboration of Ukraine's program that may be backed up financially. The problem of setting up a stabilization fund may also be solved. [Kravchuk] That is to say, after this visit we will be able to say definitely to what extent this program complies with the norms adopted by these international financial structures, if it is approved and adopted. This will mean that the green light will be given to investments, [word indistinct], Western economic aid, including [words indistinct]. However, at this point one should know the difference: These $700 million earmarked by the United States for Ukraine--$350 million for military and nuclear issues and $350 million in economic aid--are not directly linked with economic reform. Nobody means to say that this money will not be allocated if economic reform makes no progress. This is an absolutely different thing. The talk is about the large-scale, let us say, movement of capitals both along state lines, along commercial lines, along lines of private investments, and so on. True, this movement of capitals is directly linked with the progress of economic reform. Well, it is worthwhile mentioning that, although with difficulty, but one can say definitely that this movement, as they say, is already carried out. Both the privatization program...[pauses] You, probably, write and read and see this yourself. They already mention specific numbers of enterprises that are being privatized. Preparations are under way for the introduction of our own currency unit the hryvna. Serious restructuring processes are taking place in the banking, credit, and financial structure. There is some stabilization today. We have sharply reduced inflation rate. They say this is so because money is not available. But one should not just receive money, one should earn it. That is to say, the statements to the effect that the reform in Ukraine is at a standstill, although they have already been driven into people's heads, they do not correspond to reality in full measure. The reform is moving forward today. True, it is moving forward with difficulty. True, it is moving forward in a complicated manner. It is moving forward slowly, this is also true. But one should take into account our specific features. [Bodenchuk, in Russian] Here is a telegram from Volonovakha, Donetsk Oblast: In order to coordinate further work for your support, please inform us urgently of a time for an appointment in Kiev so that we can leave immediately--the independent youth of the rural areas. [Kravchuk] That is interesting, Ukraine's youth for the president. That is interesting. We should invite someone from the group to contact us. Well, why should they all have to come to Kiev. Perhaps I could go to them. [Bodenchuk] Here is a telegram from Kobelyaki in Poltava Oblast: There is nowhere to retreat to. More political will is needed. We wish you success most sincerely. Ukraine is with you. Mykola Androfiv, Kobelyaki. [Kravchuk] Great. Thank you Mykola Androfiv from Kobelyaki-- that is in Poltava Oblast is it not? Truly for us to retreat, it is not so much that there is nowhere to which to retreat, but it is impossible. Even if there were somewhere to retreat to, it would be impossible, because I tell everyone, and I have to say it here, you know, this is a chance that history has given to us to survive. And I say that there all possibilities for doing this, all possibilities. There was a time, in November-December of last year for instance, when inflation reached 80 percent each month, incidentally this is what the previous government did, we had these consequences. I really thought that the economy would collapse if we did not get any help, there was this nuclear pressure, all channels were closed, we were being deprived, one by one they were reporting that credits were being suspended, and so on. This was terribly difficult, terribly difficult. But, now that we have gone down this road, the attitude toward us has changed. We have acquired some sort of experience. Well, we were the first of the CIS countries, if we are to take the sea as an example, to feel the sand at the bottom of the sea. We were the first. We were the first to touch the sand because we were the first to endure the blow of prices for energy-carriers. We were the first to have, say, the fiercest economic sanctions applied against us, perhaps not sanctions, but economic levers, let us say. We have endured this. These prices increased by tens of thousands of times. There was nowhere to turn. We were at the bottom. This was sand. To go lower would just mean to dig ourselves into the sand, or possibly submerge ourselves in it. This means, that we can now go, and we are beginning to go along the sand, for now very slowly, but not downward now. Perhaps we are even going up. For instance, [words indistinct] has increased by 12 percent compared to the corresponding period. There is the expectation and hope now that we can survive economically. If we can survive economically, then we will survive from the state, political, and spiritual aspect without fail. Those countries, who have not reached the sand, are currently experiencing greater blows. I am thinking of the Central Statistics Directorate, the press, contacts, for instance, with the Asian republics. They are still sinking for the moment. Therefore, there is a chance--not just for us, but for everyone. If we are going to talk to one another about helping each other within the CIS framework, and not set some kind of ambitions or political aims, then we can survive and live in friendship and partnership with all countries and peoples. Naturally the will is needed, the strength is needed, support is needed. People have also understood much over this time. When some part, say, of the political forces and their leaders, are widely shouting that again Ukraine will not survive, that it can survive only under Russia. Some say with Russia, but in fact it means only under Russia, because you know if we do not have our own banks, our own armed forces, our own currency, what kind of equality is this? We should just put this out of our mind and have done with it, because why deceive the people. They should say that we cannot live otherwise--we need someone above us--and they could just go their own way. Whoever wants to can go in that direction, whoever does not want to- well, that is the way it is. Naturally, each person will work it out. But there is no need to deceive the people because independence is independence. It cannot be that there is independence in just one thing--for instance, independence to go out onto the street in the evening. [passage indistinct] We can and will go out. But I would like everyone to understand this. I wish you all the best.
