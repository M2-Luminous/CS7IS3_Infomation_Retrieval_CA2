Major General of the Interior Service Valeriy Orlov, first deputy chief of the Russian Interior Ministry's Main Directorate for Enforcing Sentences, said this in conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent yesterday. He noted that, formally speaking, the amnesty covers a far greater number of people and this has given rise to various conjectures and rumor. However, the present amnesty will not be anything like the general release of recidivists well known from the movie "The cold summer of 1953." In the main the people to be released will be the very old, whom it is simply inhuman to keep in places of deprivation of liberty, invalids, and minors, as well as first-time offenders guilty of a crime of negligence or of a crime which does not pose an exaggerated danger to society. In particular, those who took part in combat actions in defense of the motherland will be freed from punishment.
