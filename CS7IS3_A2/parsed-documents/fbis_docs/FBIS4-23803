NEF labour convenor Jayendra Naidoo told a media briefing a final report on the co-operative business, government and labour body would be made next month. However, he said key conclusions of the report suggested the NEF become a statutory body funded with public money. The report, by a task force formed in February, also urged the merging of the NEF with the National Manpower Commission to enhance the tripartite role of the current forum in economic matters. "Tripartism has a role to play in formulating and implementing economic policy," Mr Naidoo said, "it has proved to be very useful." NEF government convenor Japie Jacobs, also special advisor to the finance minister, said the NEF would have to be re-focussed but was still a vital body. "I can't see us governing the country economically without a body like the nef," he told reporters. NEF business convenor Bobby Godsell also expressed his support for the body's role, saying it was "an instrument for government to govern with civil society".
