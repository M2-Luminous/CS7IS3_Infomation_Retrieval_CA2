The two held cordial and friendly talks. The seven-member Henan provincial delegation headed by Li Changchun will make an eight-day friendly observation tour in Singapore at the invitation of Minister of Information and the Arts Yeo Yong Boon. Nineteen economic and trade officials and entrepreneurs from Henan Province have come with the delegation. During their talks, Li Changchun briefed Lee Kuan Yew on Henan's ancient culture and history, communications and transportation facilities, tourism environment, mineral resources, and the current economic foundation and development plans of the province. He invited Lee Kuan Yew to visit Henan and hoped people from industrial and business circles in Singapore would invest in Henan. Lee Kuan Yew happily accepted the invitation and said he might visit Henan this autumn. Lee Kuan Yew suggested that to develop the economy and strengthen contacts with the outside world, Henan should first improve its railroad, highway and air transporation, and communications facilities. After the improvement of transporation and communications facilities, Henan will be closer to the outside world. With more people visiting Henan, the province will have more opportunities for economic and trade cooperation. During the visit, the Henan provincial delegation will also call on other Singapore Government officials and visit Singapore's Yulang Town Industrial Administration, Civil Aviation Bureau, Trade and Development Bureau and other organizations. Li Changchun will hold a lecture meeting on "opportunities for investment in and trade with Henan."
