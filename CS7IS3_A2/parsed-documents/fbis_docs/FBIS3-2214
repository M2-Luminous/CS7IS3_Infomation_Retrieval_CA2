Experts said that the Santana, built by the Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive Company Ltd, has become the only Chinese-made car of a foreign-designed model, for the proportion of China-made parts now exceeds 80 percent. The customs department has decreased tariffs by a big margin on the car's small amount of imported parts, in order to encourage its mass production. To double the annual capacity from 100,000 sedans to 200,000, Shanghai is to inject 2.4 billion yuan into the second-phase project which aims to improve its production facilities. The city has also speeded up the development of the car's new models. A new-look Santana is expected to make its debut this autumn. So far, nearly 200 factories and enterprises have produced parts for the cars.
