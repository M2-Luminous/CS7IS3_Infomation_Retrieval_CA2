[passage omitted] Velayati: If you mean the establishment of official diplomatic ties, this was not discussed during the meeting, which lasted one whole hour. However, what was discussed during the meeting was everything that has to do with joint cooperation between the two countries in international forums. In addition, we discussed all the international issues of interest to the two countries, such as Palestine, the war in Yemen, and the future of the Nonaligned Movement and the Islamic Conference Organization. [passage omitted] AL-SHA'B: Now we come to the most thorny issue, the long- standing accusation that the Islamic Republic of Iran is exporting terrorism to the Islamic World, and even around the world. What do you have to say about this accusation? Velayati: This is not new; Iran is not the first country to be accused of such things. During the 'Abd-al-Nasir era, Egypt itself was subjected to such accusations. This is an old weapon the West uses to put pressure on countries, especially those who refuse to submit to the control of the Western powers. None of those who have leveled this accusation can actually prove it. It is no more than dangling the sword of Damocles over the heads of those who go against Western and Zionist views. [passage omitted] AL-SHA'B: You have good ties with Syria, so what would you do if Syria concluded a peace agreement with Israel? Would this affect your relations? Velayati: We are against any agreement with Israel by any party. This does not mean that we are not aware of the kind of pressure to which Syria is being subjected by all sides. Suffice it to mention here the numerous campaigns directed against Lebanon, Syria's closest neighbor. If such agreements were signed, naturally it would affect our bilateral relations. We still consider Syria the only major country left to confront Israeli domination. [passage omitted] AL-SHA'B: Undoubtedly, you have made contributions on the Bosnia issue. But the Islamic world expected you in particular to take a more effective and influential stand than you have taken so far. Why have you taken such a stand? Velayati: I was in Sarajevo last month. I do not wish to tell you what we did there, but I will quote public statements by President Alija Izetbegovic to correspondents: All aspects of the Iranian role in Bosnia will go down in history. Had it not been for Iran, Bosnia would not be in the condition we see it in today. Iran has so far provided many forms of aid. It has also made a proposal to give military aid. Velayati then added: A few days ago, THE WASHINGTON POST published an article in which it confirmed that Iranian planes had transported shipments of arms to Bosnia. Irrespective of the truth of this report, we do is not rule out this kind of undertaking in dealing with Bosnia, where we have seen forms of ugliness unknown to us before. AL-SHA'B: Before we end this dialogue, we wish to learn about your stand on what you call the state of the "great Satan?" Velayati: [passage missing] It is the same old stand. There is nothing new in it. We have no objections to establishing cordial relations with any party on condition that that party respects our causes and does not support our enemies.
