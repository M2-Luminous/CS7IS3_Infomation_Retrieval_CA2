Alliance Chairman Rowan Cronje said in Pretoria, after a meeting of the executive of the alliance, that the concession on the double ballot was welcome. However, there was still no autonomy for regions to impose taxes, and no guarantee of a volkstaat [homeland]. Concessions on the entrenchment of provincial powers were also insufficient.
