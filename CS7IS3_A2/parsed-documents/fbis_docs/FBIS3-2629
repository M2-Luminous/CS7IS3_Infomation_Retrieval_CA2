The areas to be covered by general surveys, the times when such surveys are to be conducted, and the organization of and funding for such surveys will all be codified into laws or regulations. According to the State Statistical Bureau, general surveys are comprehensive statistical surveys specifically organized by the state. Because of their extensive scope and the employment of multiple indicators, such surveys can yield detailed statistical data that can be grouped into different categories based on different indicators. Besides providing major and basic statistical data on national conditions and national power, such surveys will furnish a sample framework for conducting all kinds of spot checks. Although our country has successfully conducted some general surveys since it founding, a periodic system has yet to take shape for general surveys other than census-taking. The State Statistical Bureau has decided: From now on, a sound periodic system has to be instituted gradually for all general surveys on national conditions and national power. The main items of general surveys will include population, industry, agriculture, tertiary industry, and other basic statistical units [ji ben tong ji dan wei 1015 2609 4827 6060 0830 0143]. Censuses and general surveys on tertiary industry, industry, and agriculture will be carried out every 10 years, with the first at the end of each decade and the remainder in the third, fifth, and seventh years of each decade, respectively. General surveys on basic statistical units will be carried out every five years, in the first and sixth years of each decade. Some surveys of relatively small scale or regional surveys will be scheduled for other years. It has been disclosed that the State Council has approved the nationwide general survey on agriculture scheduled for 1997. The State Statistical Bureau and relevant ministries and commissions will make specific plans this year.
