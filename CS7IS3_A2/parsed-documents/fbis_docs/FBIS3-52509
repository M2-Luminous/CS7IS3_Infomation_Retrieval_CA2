Dhar [Text] New Delhi, 27 Dec. Having suffered several diplomatic reverses in the current year, the Government of India is planning new initiatives in the new year to neutralise the negative impact abroad of many internal political developments that have put the country on the defensive. Since the Prime Minister has been discharging the duties of the Foreign Minister also on account of Mr. Dinesh Singh's indisposition, indications are that a change is in the offing in the stewardship of the External Affairs Ministry. Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao now realised that Mr. Dinesh Singh's indisposition has affected his mobility at a time when India is under severe pressure internationally on the minorities issue, human rights, non- proliferation etc. and needs to respond vigorously at all international forums. Foreign policy reverses culminated in the cancellation of the G-15 summit, about whose objectives the External Affairs Ministry's top brass was not at all clear. Apart from the protocol arrangements, not much thought was given to making the gathering purposeful nor were any new approaches to the problems of developing countries sought to be defined in an era of new economic groupings. The draft declaration approved by the G-15 Foreign Ministers makes dismal reading and strikes no new path. The three heads of Government of Indonesia, Zimbabwe, and Malaysia saw the inadequacy of the document and deferred its consideration. With senior officials of the External Affairs Ministry having realised how irrelevant the G-15 had become, nothing could be done to bring the foreign dignitaries to New Delhi. The traumatic religio-ethnic experience through which the country has been passing for over a year, leading to upsurge, communal violence, bomb blasts of unprecedented severity, escalated terrorist violence in Kashmir leading to retaliatory action by the security forces, have had a negative impact on external relations. The Government has not been able to derive full advantage from the economic reforms because of political uncertainty at home, the securities scam which has brought about the Finance Minister's resignation, the question mark till recently on the Congress Party's performance in the elections to the five State Assemblies, escalated extremist violence and growth of fissiparous tendencies. Pakistan has taken full advantage of the ethnic situation and developments in Kashmir and together with other members of the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) forced India into a defensive position at all international gatherings, including the United Nations. The change of administration in the United States has increased pressure as regards human rights, non-proliferation, technology transfer, environment and Kashmir, Indo-U.S. relations received a severe jolt, though both sides are now playing it cool. However, External Affairs Ministry sources insist that the Government, while adjusting its foreign policy to the realities of the new international situation, has succeeded in protecting India's economic, political and territorial interests despite adverse circumstances. Even with regard to technology transfer, the country's had been safeguarded despite embargos. "With no country is it possible to have a totally smooth relationship because we do not toe anybody's line. We have a structured and calibrated equation with each country. Relations with others cannot always be smooth because India is a large and complex country." It is also argued that the Ministry did not get the political leadership it deserved in such crucial times when the whole international scenario has changed and old equations are no longer relevant. It is admitted that the Prime Minister's personal initiatives helped the country to further stabilise relations with China, Iran, Israel and South Africa the last two were only recently accorded diplomatic recognition. A whole gamut of possibilities has opened up with the Central Asian republics, though relations with Russia are again passing through an uncertain phase after the cancellation of the cryogenic rocket-engine deal. In the new year, priority will be accorded to normalising relations with Pakistan and addressing the Kashmir question and the exercise will begin with the meeting of the foreign secretaries of the two countries. The United States has created enough confusion over Kashmir and even Pakistan is now cool to suggestions from Washington regarding possible solutions to the Kashmir issue. It will be India's endeavour to keep the dialogue with Pakistan going on substantive issues while hoping that external sponsorship of terrorism in Kashmir will cease. The reverses suffered by the Bharatiya Janata Party in the recent Assembly elections have sent out the message that India will not abandon its secular principles and that a solution of the Babri mosque controversy will be evolved soon. The second priority will be to expand relations with the European Union (EU) with which a political dialogue is to be had to give additional weightage to the agreement on an upgraded relationship with it. Most EU members are to be reassured of political stability in India and also the determination to pursue market reforms with vigour to attract more investment and joint ventures which are still at a very low level. High technology flow also needs to be accelerated. Relations with neighbours, except Pakistan, are good and will be further developed. Attention is being given to resolving the Ganga waters issue with Bangladesh and a meeting between Begum Khaleda Zia and Mr. Narasimha Rao is expected to materialise next year, which may help ease the tension on this score. Relations with Tehran which is supportive of India's case on Kashmir, are to develop further and a land link established between India and the Central Asian republics through Iran for free flow of trade and commerce. The pressure on India to sign the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] and subscribe to the MTCR [Missile Technology Control Regime] which have somewhat abated may again grow. India is expected to stand firm by its commitment to universal non-proliferation, as opposed to the discriminatory regime, and press for a major review of the NPT in 1995. India is also to make it clear that it will not roll back its missile development plan in the face of China's missile, including ICBM capability and Pakistan's IRBM programme, which is backed by China's technical expertise. Concern over China's arms export policy is heightened by the fact that weapons flows to Pakistan (which is soon to be taken off the Pressler book) will increase Islamabad's belligerence. In view of its desire to expand economic cooperation with the Asia-Pacific region, India will seek closer relations with ASEAN countries or terms of greater liberalisation of it economy. Most ASEAN countries appear keen to be business with India and strengthen its economy lest China becomes an economic giant and in future, constitutes a military threat to the region as a whole.
