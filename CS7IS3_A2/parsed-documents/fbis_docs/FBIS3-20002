Security forces on an operation around the mountain in eastern Turkey found a hide-out. Two SAM's were found at the hide-out at the 13,000-foot (4,000 m) level. Specialists say that the missiles were being used against aerial targets. The same hide-out contained an RPG-type missile launcher, 27 missiles, 43 rounds, 21 explosion moulds, a machine gun and a great number of Kalashnikov bullets, medicine and documents. In an exclusive interview, Interior Minister Nahit Mentese confirmed the operation and said that security forces have been carrying out intensive operations since March 4 in Kars, Igdir and Agri. `The importance of these operations are quite clear when you consider the damage which could have been done by the SAM's,' Mentese said. Mentese also called on the terrorists to surrender. `Let them surrender,' he said. `They have epidemics and instead of dying on the mountains let them surrender to the Turkish justice and benefit of the penitence law,' he said. The SAM's have a 2-mile (3.6-km) range. The 20-pound (9-kg) missiles are manufactured by Russia and China.
