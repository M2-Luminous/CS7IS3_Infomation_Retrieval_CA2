The mayors from these cities expressed their opinions on price rises in their cities. Mayor of Hainan [as received], Mr. Zeng Harorong, said that Haikou, capital of Hainan Province, saw a 25.8 percent rise in retail prices last year while the price index for residential consumer goods increased by 30 percent last January, ranking the city first in terms of price rises among on the 35 medium- and large-sized cities in the country. According to Mr. Zeng, the overall opening of grain prices and the rising adjustment of fares and charges for energy and transportation last year resulted in the prices of fine and coarse food grain increasing by 37 percent and 44 percent respectively and the prices of pork, eggs and chicken which were related to the grain prices increasing by 29 percent, 40 percent and 44 percent respectively. Residents' wages income was, however, also raised by an average 30 percent last year and its suburbs' farmers' income from their production by 40 percent. NPC [National People's Congress] deputies from Guangdong criticized the province in its talking about agriculture while not carrying their talk into practice, resulting in a reduction of grain output in three consecutive years. Guangzhou, as the capital of the province, saw retail prices and prices for people's daily expenses respectively rising to the second highest and the fourth highest in the country. Mayor of the city, Mr. Li Ziliu, said in his explanation of this problem that the rapid price growth in some commodities such as steel products could not be kept under control by localities. Nanning, capital of Guangxi, suffered 25.1 percent increase of prices for residents' daily expenses and 24.1 percent growth in retail prices last year, respectively ranking the city second and third in the country. According to analysis by the mayor of the city, Mr. Xie Ruxuan, there were three reasons for the price rise. First, the absolute value of prices in the city had been low for a long time in the past since the city was listed as a coastal opening city until the year before last year because of military reasons; second, the economy in the city started its rapid development last year with investment in fixed assets reaching RMB 1.9 billion, 90 percent up over the previous year; and third, residents' daily expenses in the city last year increased by 47 percent.
