FR940617-1-00025 FR940617-1-00009 7. We propose that for all 931 MHz paging applications, applicants must specify the frequency for which they seek authorization. The frequency requested must be available at the time the application is filed. Applications that are acceptable for filing will be placed on public notice. Mutually exclusive applications received within 30 days after the public notice will be considered one processing group. Mutually exclusive applicants for specific frequencies that are accepted for filing after July 26, 1993 would be subject to the competitive bidding process. We also propose that applicants for 931 MHz paging frequencies with applications pending when final rules become effective be given 60 days from the effective date of a final order in this proceeding to amend their applications to specify frequencies for which they seek authorization. Failure to amend a pending application to specify a frequency will result in dismissal of that application. All pending amended applications and newly filed applications that are mutually exclusive and received within 60 days of the effective date of this Order will be considered together as a processing group this one time only. We propose that the amended applications be subject to the competitive bidding process. However, we seek comment on whether we should instead use lotteries for these applications. 8. We propose to consider the following to be an initial 931 MHz paging application: (1) an application anywhere on a new frequency and (2) a proposal to locate a new facility more than two kilometers (1.6 miles) from any existing facility operating on the same frequency. A 931 MHz paging application would be considered a modification of an existing system only if: (1) It proposes a new location two kilometers or less from a previously authorized and fully operational base station licensed to the same licensee operating on the same frequency; or (2) the application is for a change of location within two kilometers of an existing station licensed to the same licensee; or (3) the application proposes a technical change that would not increase the service contour. We tentatively conclude that we will use first come, first served procedures to process 931 MHz paging modification licenses in cases in which we conclude, as a result of our examination of the issue in this rulemaking proceeding, that the use of competitive bidding procedures would not be legally permissible or otherwise appropriate. Under the first come, first served procedure, only manually exclusive modification applications received on the same day would, consistent with the Budget Act, be designated for comparative hearing to determine which modification application should be granted. 9. We welcome comment on any and all of the proposed further revisions to 47 CFR part 22. We also invite suggestions for any other proposals or refinements to the proposals that we have made in this proceeding. 10. This is a non-restricted notice and comment rulemaking proceeding. Ex parte presentations are permitted except during the Sunshine Agenda period, provided they are disclosed as provided in Commission rules. See generally 47 CFR 1.1202, 1.1203 and 1.1206(a). 11.

All relevant and timely comments will be considered by the Commission before final action is taken in this proceeding.
