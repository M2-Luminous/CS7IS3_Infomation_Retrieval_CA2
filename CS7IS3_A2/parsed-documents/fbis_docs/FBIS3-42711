Third Call"] [Text] Moscow--Disturbing news: The oil workers of the Republic of Komi are once again threatening to shut off the valves. They really do have more than enough reason to strike: wages in Usinsk, Ukhta, and the majority of other administrations of the Komineft Stock Company have not been paid since last November. Today the situation is exacerbated in the extreme: the Presidium of the Russian Council of the Union of Workers of the Oil and Gas Sectors of Industry and Construction (Neftegazstroyprofsoyuz) has sent an appeal to all oil-producing associations for support for the "ultimatum" of the oil workers of Usinsk. It is demanded that the Governments of the Russian Federation and Komi make good the wage arrears before 1 February and settle accounts in full for the oil that has been supplied to the consumers. As Valeriy Bendyuzhik, deputy chairman of the Komi Republic Neftegazstroyprofsoyuz Committee, announced, in the event of this warning going unheeded by the authorities, the union will be forced to adopt, in accordance with the law, a decision on the date of commencement of a strike.
