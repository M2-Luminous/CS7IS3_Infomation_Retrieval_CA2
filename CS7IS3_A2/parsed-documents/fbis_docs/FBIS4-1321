Rees] [Text] Bloemfontein April 26 SAPA -- Voting in prisons proceeded smoothly on Tuesday [26 April] as special polling stations were set up for as many as 100,000 prisoners, a Correctional Services spokesman said. No incidents were reported and the atmosphere in prisons was calm, he said. Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] officials set up the stations behind bars and guards took eligible prisoners to cast their votes. There was no adverse reaction from murderers, rapists and other prisoners denied the vote by a last-minute cabinet decision on Tuesday, the spokesman said. Prisons Commissioner Gen Henk Bruyn this week barred the media from prisons in order to "keep the atmosphere as calm as possible". Officials on Tuesday had no clear idea of how many of the country's 115,000 prisoners would vote, but estimated the figure could come close to 100,000. In the Orange Free State and Northern Cape seven prisons had completed voting by noon on Tuesday, a spokesman said.
