The article is a rare, valuable work. It is said that the corpse in the Mao Zedong Memorial Hall has begun to rot. Which one is it, the real or the fake? In those days, an exact dummy of the corpse was made to meet the needs of "war preparation." The corpse on display may be the dummy. As artificial materials may be confused with a real human corpse, it is hard to tell which Mao Zedong it is. This is somewhat ironic because throughout his lifetime Mao Zedong was at home in playing tricks of real and fake. His tricks were so clever that every Chinese was infatuated. At that time, despite their suffering from starvation and the withering of their will under mental oppression, the people around the country believed that they were creating a new beautiful world! Some 20 years ago, those who ate human flesh in Guangxi must have had the belief that what they were doing was a revolutionary act. Apart from the utilitarian reason that eating human livers gives one a healthy liver and eating human hearts makes one intelligent, the valiant and proud "sentiments and aspirations" generated from the above belief must have played a role when they were trying to overcome the psychological obstacle that human nature posed against their cannibalist act. Among Mao Zedong's many "magnificent contributions and great deeds," a significant one was that he succeeded in mentally enslaving the Chinese people and pushing them a big step ahead toward the goal of eliminating human nature.. I once used three words in describing the acts of the Chinese Communist Party (here I mean the entity of that party rather than the overwhelming majority of its members) or, more precisely, the characteristics of its behavior in terms of morality: cruel, hypocritical, and despicable. These characteristics were also possessed by Mao Zedong. He successfully transformed the Chinese Communist Party "according to his own image" and remolded the Chinese people's souls after the party's model. All this was done in the guise of morality. Why were the Chinese people so obedient to Mao Zedong that no rebellion occurred even when the unprecedented famine he created had taken away the lives of more than 40 million people? It would be oversimplified if we use "violence" and "deception" to explain this. When the People's Liberation Army [PLA] marched into Beijing, the first thing it did was to close all brothels. This move alone conquered the people's minds from the standpoint of morality. There were many other reasons: The strict discipline of the army, the plain lifestyle of cadres who worked even without salary, and the measures taken to stabilize commodity prices, eliminate robbers and bandits, crack down on local tyrants, and enable everyone to earn a living. All these satisfied the Chinese people's moral requirement for "equality." All these were not only "correct," but were "great." Mao Zedong's "morality incarnate" image established by himself in the early 1950's lasted until the early 1970's, when Lin Biao's coup failed (and when many of the party's scandals were exposed through the Cultural Revolution and through the events fomented in the early stage of the Cultural Revolution). But his status as a symbol of morality has not completely faded out even today. During the period 1958-62, the destructive "Great Leap Forward" and the "People's Communes" movements brought about a catastrophic famine. Mao Zedong once again took advantage of the Chinese people's moral sense. This way he not only reestablished his prestige, but made hundreds of millions of people climax their blind faith in him. The publicity given to Lei Feng and many other PLA heroes, the accompanying nationwide emulation campaigns, and the propaganda on cadre Jiao Yulu all successfully drew the people's attention to the need for self-purification. They no longer bothered to observe and think what was going on in China's society and what faults Mao Zedong had committed. The main theme of the report on Jiao Yulu was quite clear: Two factors accounted for Lankao County's dire poverty -- inclement natural conditions and lack of hard-struggling spirit on the part of cadres and masses. It was impossible that Jiao Yulu did not think over the numerous mistakes committed by Mao Zedong after the Agrarian Reform and the grave consequences of those mistakes. But the report -- which was not so moving -- said nothing about this at all. As a matter of fact, after comparing himself or herself with Lei Feng, everyone felt morally guilty and deemed it imperative to devote hard efforts to self-cultivation and self-improvement. Now, with Jiao Yulu as a mirror, they were all the more imbued with a sense of inferiority, feeling that they must be remolded. Both "models" told them that they must follow Mao Zedong closely without the slightest vacillation. Successfully Made Hundreds of Millions of People Abandon Their Own "Selves" Neither the Soviet Union nor any East European country could match China in holding frequent political campaigns. In China, every year saw some political campaigns. On some occasions, several campaigns were held at the same time. Let us say that China's political campaigns began with the Agrarian Reform. Mao Zedong was opposed to a "Peaceful Agrarian Reform" and the "idea of bestowing land as a favor." He insisted that the peasants should do this with political consciousness and on their own initiative. This required a lot of efforts. Work teams must "visit the poor and inquire about their sufferings." They must "take root in the countryside, keep in contact with the peasants" and "mobilize" every household and individual. Where there was no suffering, the work team must dig out something as "suffering." Where there was no "hatred," the work team had to do something to foster it. The widespread campaign of physical torment imposed on landlords and rich peasants, the drive to sweep them out of the doors, and even the destruction of their lives were mostly the results of the stratagems applied by the work teams. Mao Zedong was a successful psychologist without learning. Suppose, on a certain occasion, you mounted the stage to accuse a landlord of oppressing you and beat him up. Once you had such a "practice," even though you had done this not of your own accord or only half-heartedly or pretentiously, and even though you had not experienced the retaliation by the "home-going" legion, you would naturally stand on Mao Zedong's side. In a campaign, suppose you were egged on or forced to do something by the "party leadership." After you had done it over and over again, you would unwittingly become the protagonist. So it would appear as if the campaign had been really initiated by the masses themselves. In urban areas, there was even better soil for sham things to grow into real ones. After underground party organizations and the army entered cities, they absorbed many young intellectuals, most with sincerity to devote themselves to the revolution. Newly liberated areas needed large numbers of cadres to replace the Kuomintang government functionaries, giving young intellectuals many opportunities both to "devote themselves to the revolution" and to "become officials and overlords." Whether their goal was to grasp the opportunity to better serve the people or to obtain official positions, they had to perform well--they must obey the party's instructions and actively plunge into various campaigns so as to become party members as early as possible. If they discovered that they were unwilling to do something--even if their unwillingness was a slight hesitation--honest and thoughtful people would blame themselves for entertaining an "individualist idea." They would quickly examine themselves so as to avoid being criticized. Mao Zedong never advocated that a man should reflect on his mistakes in private. Ideological remolding was always a process by which the majority forced the minority to give in. Though this process, which transformed others as well as oneself, was "entirely arranged by the party," it made people feel that "I am doing this conscientiously and willingly" and, therefore, think that they were the initiators of the process. In each campaign, they had to unjustly attack a number of people, do something against their will, and say something against their conscience. Sometimes, they could not avoid acting immorally or unlawfully, such as conducting secret investigations, informing against someone, and making false testimonies. All these, they thought, were "demanded by the party" and "needed by the revolution," or the "common things" they had to do in order to protect themselves. With this thinking and seeing that everyone was doing the same, they could be relieved of guilty conscience. In each campaign, the victims were invariably the "small handful." More than 1 million people were accused as rightists, but compared with the nation's total population or the total number of personnel of a work unit, those accused were still a "small handful." This made people feel relieved--even though the accused were wronged, there was no need to rehabilitate them. In fact, the "small handful" could serve a big purpose. Mao Zedong was more clever than Stalin. Why was it necessary to kill so many people? Mao Zedong did not want to frighten people with slaughter. He wanted people to fear that "they might make mistakes, and if they did make mistakes, they would not only ruin themselves but bring a disaster to their families." Therefore, some of the more than 1 million rightists were not arrested, and only very few were killed. Most of them were still alive and were allowed to show up everyday. Seeing them, people could not help but constantly alert themselves. At the same time, they felt happy that they themselves had not been accused. What a clever scheme this was! One of Mao Zedong's inventions was the "label." Among the "rightists," "bad elements," and "historical counterrevolutionaries," who would not like to have their labels removed as early as possible? The "rightists" were further divided into six categories. The "ultra-rightists" were deprived of everything but their lives. Those belonging to the sixth category were only deprived of political rights--even their wages were not affected. This saved the party a lot of trouble because the rightists could check and criticize each other and vie to show loyalty to the party so as to cast off their labels at an early date. What was wonderful was that these people did not even know the deceptive or unjust nature of so-called self-transformation. More often than not, they conducted self-transformation out of their faith in the revolution. There was no distinction between right and wrong, truth and falsehood. When this situation lasted for several decades, people's instinct, righteousness, and personal dignity were practically nonexistent. Mao Zedong succeeded in making hundreds of millions of people abandon their own "selves." All personal desires, benefits, and interest not contradictory but even conducive to the development of the whole nation were attacked and suppressed. An individual's concern, thinking, and demand for participation in social transformation were either manipulated by the leader or the party or viewed as dangerous and hostile, and therefore strangled. There was one thing that no ruling party or political leader in the world dare to do but Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party did successfully, and that was to openly ask the people to serve as "tools" of Mao and society--and the "tools" were "docile tools." Unconditional negation of individuality became the basic norm for ideology, systems, and policies and was accepted widely as a general practice. On the other hand, people had no right to withdraw from society or become inactive members of society. They must constantly dedicate themselves to society in line with the party's will. Only in this way could they be really "docile." Making the People as Poor as Animals Is Kind of Knife "Poverty stifles ambition." Desire for survival outweighs everything else. At that time, people were satisfied as long as they remained alive. They were in a state of lasting hopelessness, and no one could change their fate. Diligence and initiative were of no use at all. When you had to beg the party branch secretary every year for "relief grain" or "resold grain," or when you had to present your wife or daughter to him in exchange for his favor, could you still have personal dignity? At that time, of course, the people would most easily accept the despotic rule. In 1956, Mao Zedong hastily put into force the agricultural collectivization policy. The reason was no other than that he feared that once the peasants became well-to-do, they would not obey his instructions. The long period of poverty in China since the late 1950's was a result of cruel oppression and enslavement of the Chinese people by Mao Zedong's personal ambition and his anti-humanist ideology. Poverty, political deprivation, and mental enslavement were three leading reasons for the unprecedented destruction of the Chinese humanist spirit and morality. Mao Zedong praised "poverty and blankness" because only on a blank China could he "draw the most beautiful picture" according to his own will. He held that poverty could make people's hearts purer. In fact, it made the people more like animals, and it forced them to suffer much more than real animals. Despite their year-round toiling, the people could hardly eke out a living and even had to incur heavy debts. Through years, such a life benumbed the people's normal feeling and even caused them to give themselves up as hopeless. After all, however, human beings were human beings. In society, poverty always existed along with unfairness, oppression, and bullying. The Chinese people had neither property nor power, and were unable to change their predicament. They felt hopeless about their future and were ignorant of the world (and even of China's real situation over the past four decades). Because of these problems, in 1976 when Mao Zedong died, the Chinese people's minds were by no means a blank. Still less were they in a state of lovely purity. By that time, the peasants' go-slow movement which began in 1958 nationwide had lasted for nearly 20 years. Theft of public property by the masses, which started at the same time, was a form of the peasants' retaliation against exploitation and oppression. Slow work and privately seizing public property were quite common in state-owned enterprises. When these activities appeared over and over again, the people's hatred for the ruling political power became increasingly intensive, and their hearts drifted farther and farther from society. In the early 1970's, peasants along railways and highways began to seize state materials being transported. Shortly afterward, an appalling incident occurred in Shanghai where several hooligans took turn to rape a young woman in a downtown area. There were lots and lots of onlookers, but no one bothered to stop the scene. In 1971, the Lin Biao incident broke out. The second economic crisis and the nationwide political persecution caused by the Cultural Revolution finally collapsed Mao Zedong's authority and his ideological system. China was in a state of great disillusionment. The clock began to run back and the ideological pendulum in China's society began to swing toward the side opposite to the one advocated by Mao Zedong and hotly pursued by the Chinese people in previous years. Though the Clock Has Run Back, the People Are Still Going Toward Inhumanity It was a quiet collapse triggered by a soundless explosion. On their own initiative and without mutual consultation, people quietly discarded their blind faith in Mao Zedong and moved to the opposite. What Mao Zedong described as correct now became erroneous. And what was bad according to his teaching was now considered to be good. In a certain sense, there was no doubt an ideological emancipation movement. People began to be freed from the cage built by themselves and the shackles they forged for their own bondage. Nonetheless, the emancipation was tragic in nature and destructive in terms of its ethical consequence. There was an instance which might be exceptional but was indeed representative. Some educated youths who had plunged into the Great Cultural Revolution and later gone to work in the countryside and mountain areas in response to the great leader's call suddenly felt hopeless and dispirited after a long period of ascetic life where the revolution outweighed everything. In some villages, young men and women cohabitated as a way of pleasure-seeking. When Mao Zedong was building the revolutionary edifice and using his illusive goal and humanism to unify the people, he broke down individual entities, eliminated freedom, and exercised physical and mental enslavement, pushing the Chinese people toward inhumanity. Now, the collapse of Mao Zedong's edifice is just a reversed process: Awakened individuals have divorced themselves from the whole. In doing so, they have discarded the sham part of Maoism (revolution and morality) while still holding on to its true essence (cruelty, hypocrisy, and despicableness). This process, too, is leading to inhumanity. This was not a sudden explosion. The dark side of the party and related historical facts were first exposed during the Cultural Revolution to meet the needs of struggle. Then, Mao Zedong put at the highest place the fallacies he had designed since the 1950's and dealt blows at hundreds of millions of people. All these have gradually awakened the people. Finally, the self-awareness of the Chinese people has been aroused to an extent unprecedented in the past several thousand years. With such awakening and emancipation, they have naturally taken the renouncement of Maoism as their glorious goal. On the other hand, those who can speak the people's sufferings, as a matter of course, have come up to fill the void in the people's hearts. Now, the people have begun to regain their own "selves." But you will find one thing: After trampling human nature underfoot for decades, what a fertile field Mao Zedong has prepared for the growth of the vicious part of human nature. The Legacy of Spiritual Ruin Is Evil Running Wild Out of revenge for nearly three decades' exploitation and oppression, everyone now feels that he or she has a right to ask anything from society. All of a sudden, the self, which has long been belittled, can go its own way as magnificently and freely as a heavenly steed soaring across the skies. Unfortunately, however, the freedom obtained in the Deng Xiaoping era is neither used for creation and discovery nor for participation in social transformation (in 1978-80 even an ordinary worker in China longed for an opportunity to do so). That road is overgrown with brambles and full of potential dangers. In contrast, the road to satisfying selfish desire is unimpeded. Mao Zedong used "socialism" to do away with China's traditional society and put the party and the political power in a position to face every Chinese directly. The party's feeler went deep into every aspect of the people's life. Everyone's subsistence, honor and disgrace, and ups and downs were dictated by the will of the party (from the great leader to the village party branch secretary), and every good deed appearing on the 9.6 million square kilometer land was credited to the party's leadership. The only conclusion that can be drawn from this is: The Chinese can be irresponsible for their nation, society, and even themselves. If all achievements are creditable to the party, then any malpractice should be attributed to the party as well. So, in the course of time, a peculiar consciousness or subconsciousness has come into being: Damn! This country belongs to the Communist Party. It has nothing to do with me. The old moral code is practically nonexistent, while new morality is ridiculed. Education is renounced by society. Law has little or no binding effect. Religion is considered unlawful or only semi-lawful unless it voluntarily serves as a tool of the party. Thus, there is virtually no force that can restrain people from within and without. This has been the case since the "virtue" concept was eliminated by man-made class struggle, and evil activities "for the sake of revolution" were held in esteem. Now, Deng Xiaoping's time has begun, and a new problem has arisen: The party's corruption is spurring the decay of the entire society. The spiritual ruin created by Mao Zedong has become an ideal venue for evils to run amok. This article is not intended to make a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of the reality in present-day China. The economic boom resulting from the people's might unleashed by the economic reform and the greater freedom enjoyed by the Chinese today are undeniable facts. But didn't we pay too high a price for these? It is not necessary to turn the obedient people into an "unbridled people" or "violent people." China need not repeat the course of Europe in the initial period of capitalism when darkness and crimes prevailed. And the creative force of the revived people should not necessarily be translated into a destructive force. The only question is whether the Deng Xiaoping clique is willing to carry China's de-Maoization drive through to the end. Recently, when the news came that China failed in its bid for hosting the 2000 Olympic Games, a female Chinese reporter said indignantly before the public: "If this had been known earlier, Wei Jingshen would not have had to be freed from jail!" Was this a comeback of the departed spirit of Mao Zedong? On the day when I learned that Wei Jingshen was released from jail, I thought of a question: In the face of Wei Jingshen, has any Chinese intellectual asked his or her own conscience: During Wei Jingshen's 14 hard years behind bars, what was I doing for the Chinese people? I believe there are such people, but perhaps they are not many. Everyone can find some reason to have a clear conscience. Mao Zedong has taught many people how to ease their conscience. No doubt, this will be conducive to their longevity.
