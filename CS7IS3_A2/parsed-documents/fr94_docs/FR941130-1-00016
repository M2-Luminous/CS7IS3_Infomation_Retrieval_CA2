FR941130-1-00016 FR941130-1-00002 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Part 2 RIN 3150&hyph;AF24 NRC Size Standards; Proposed Revision AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend the NRC's size standards used to qualify an NRC licensee as a ``small entity'' under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The amendments would: establish a separate standard to be used to determine whether a licensee who is a manufacturer would qualify as a small entity; and adjust the receipts-based standard to account for the effects of inflation since 1985. DATES: Comment period expires December 30, 1994. Comments received after this date will be considered if it is practical to do so, but the Commission is able to assure consideration only for comments received on or before this date. ADDRESSES: Mail written comments to: Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Attn: Docketing and Service Branch. Deliver comments to: 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, between 7:45 am and 4:15 pm Federal workdays. Copies of any comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW. (lower level), Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sarah N. Wigginton, Acting Chief, Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, telephone (301) 415&hyph;7158. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In 1983, the NRC surveyed its materials licensees to create an economic profile sufficient to consider regulatory alternatives tailored to the size of the licensee. After analyzing the data and consulting with the Small Business Administration (SBA), the NRC developed a proposed size standard that would be appropriate to use in determining which of its licensees would qualify as small entities for the purposes of compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The NRC published its proposed size standard for notice and comment in the Federal Register of May 21, 1985 (50 FR 20913). After considering the comments received, the NRC adopted its final size standards as noted in the Federal Register of December 9, 1985 (50 FR 50241). In the Federal Register of November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56671), the NRC restated the size standards to include the Regulatory Flexibility Act's definition of small governmental jurisdiction. To further improve clarity, the NRC changed the presentation of the size standards to conform to the listing of definitions of small entities in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The size standards developed by the NRC were used in the NRC's final rule implementing Public Law 101&hyph;508 to provide for a reduced annual fee for those NRC licensees who qualified as small entities under these standards (56 FR 31472; July 10, 1991 and subsequent years). In response to these rules, the NRC has received a number of comments concerning its size standards and the failure of the NRC to promulgate a size standard that differentiates between manufacturing entities and service providers. These commenters indicated that applying a gross receipts standard to a manufacturing concern resulted in an adverse impact on a manufacturer. The gross receipts of a service provider reflect the value added by the service provider, which is essentially the value of the service itself. However, the gross receipts of a manufacturer that are equal to those of a service provider reflect a smaller percentage of the value added by the manufacturer. A manufacturer's gross receipts include the costs of the raw materials or components that, when added to the cost of manufacture, quickly send a manufacturer's gross receipts into fairly sizeable sums. The SBA size standards for manufacturers are prescribed in terms of a maximum number of employees rather than in terms of gross receipts.
