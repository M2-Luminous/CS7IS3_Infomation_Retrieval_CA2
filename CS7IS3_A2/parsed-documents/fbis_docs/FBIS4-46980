The questions covered the entire gamut of problems in Ukraine: politics, economics, state-building, industry, agriculture, energy, market finances, banking, taxes, mafia, and corruption. Obviously, the upcoming presidential elections were also addressed. ZELENYY SVIT, however, concentrated on Plyusch's response to the following question: The previous session of the parliament--under your leadership--declared a moratorium on the construction of new nuclear power reactors and passed a resolution advocating the closing of the Chernobyl AES (CAES). A year later, still under your leadership, the moratorium was lifted, the resolution rescinded, and ongoing operation of CAES was allowed. The "Greens" feel that this reversal was in response to pressure from the nuclear lobby. How do you really feel about this painful problem in view of the worldwide trend to curtail expansion of nuclear power? I would like to be better understood on this point and will go somewhat back in history. In 1975 I had just started working in the Kiev Obkom as deputy of the Agricultural Department and was sent to Chernobyl to attend a rayon party conference. Prypyat did not yet exist. However, graphite components were already being installed at the first reactor. By a circuitous route--since I was not on the `approved' list--I managed to get inside and view the huge constructions taking place. Later I met Anatoliy Petrovych Aleksandrov when he assumed presidency of the USSR Academy of Sciences. I was charged with escorting him by the first secretary when he visited Tarashcha and Fastiv--the sites of his youth. He attempted to convince me that other fuels will soon be obsolete and science will provide us with such small reactors that you could use them for home heating. Ten years later, ironically enough, ovens in villages contaminated by radiation were called reactors. At that time the Kharkiv and Odesa ATETs were in the planning stages: these were to be nuclear thermoelectric centers from which hot water would be pumped directly to heat homes. What could be more efficient? And then the CAES accident! I was there on the first day and rode in the same car with academician Valeriy Legasov, now deceased, Mykola Shcherbyna, head of the Government Commission, and Mykola Nikolayev, deputy chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers. We arrived in Chernobyl at five and the commission met at seven. Legasov was one of the few nuclear experts who even at that time--April 26--clearly said "I don't know how the ruined reactor will behave tomorrow. Water is being discharged. Where does it flow? I recommend immediate evacuation..." Whatever you may hear, believe only this: evacuation was to be implemented not to protect people from contamination with radionuclides, but from the possibility of something far worse, a nuclear explosion! But who would approve an evacuation? It was Saturday and the highest government official that Shcherbyna managed to reach was Dolgikh. Gorbachev called back after ten from his car on his way home from a theater. We left the room and Shcherbyna talked with him one-on-one... The Ukrainian government and Central Committee--objects of so much vituperation--had by this time sent 1200 buses to Chernobyl, even though permission to evacuate had not been granted. At eleven at night Shcherbyna informed us that a decision would be made tomorrow at ten in the morning, April 27. The commission was to meet at ten. I, as head of the Kiev Executive Committee, met with the local officials at nine. Shcherbyna learned that we discussed evacuation, ordered me to appear before him and said: "Ivan, I alone am the head of the commission and the rest of you are mere members." I had a lot of explaining to do. It was then that I began to understand the atom. In Niagara Falls there is a gallery of the painter Vasyl Kurylyk, a Canadian of Ukrainian descent. He was born to a farm family who emigrated to Canada long before the Soviet revolution and had nothing to do with bourgeois Ukrainian nationalism which has been used to frighten us for such a long time. It took him a long time to become an artist and the road was difficult. After a serious illness he had a vision and began to create paintings on religious themes and works on saving the earth from a nuclear catastrophe. As a villager I was struck by one of his paintings of a cabbage patch in which the heads did not have a solitary leaf. They looked like human skulls. In the distance on the left you could discern the dome of a church, and on the right a rising dome of a nuclear explosion. When I asked the tour guide when it was painted I was shocked by the answer: 1971. That's when construction of CAES began! Thinking about this painting convinced me that nuclear energy is a satanic force and humanity would be much better off without it. But it is here ... it happened ... Now we must deal with nuclear safety and energy needs. Many economists hold that every country possesses enough energy resources its needs. However, Ukrainian gas and oil were very quickly expended on supplying the rest of the huge USSR. For example, the Dashavskyy gas fields heated all of Leningrad. The same happened with our oil which was wasted, although it could have been used for production of goods much more valuable than fuel. The operating philosophy was: Let's use up what you have and then everyone for himself! Ukraine still has large reserves of nuclear fuel and this, unfortunately, provides a strong temptation to build more nuclear reactors. Besides nuclear, Ukraine still has enough other energy resources to meet fifty percent of its energy needs. There are countries that can only meet four percent of their needs from their own energy resources, but they haven't gone nuclear. Many energy experts don't seem to understand that nuclear power is not cost effective, contrary to popular assertions. One of the few that understood this reality was Vitaliy Sklyarov, the former--regrettably--Ukrainian Minister of Energy. While not in charge of CAES, he spent many of the most dangerous days there and wrote "Chernobyl Tomorrow", an excellent book. His economic analysis should cool off the fervent advocates of the plutonium industry and nuclear weapons. He did not emigrate nor acquire millions as his detractors asserted to undermine his credibility. If we want to put our nuclear house in order we must immediately reinstate Sklyarov as Minister of Energy. He has an extraordinary grasp of energy problems. If, on the contrary, we create a closed loop of nuclear reactors Ukraine will be faced with a tremendous economic burden. We have to proceed on a parallel course: use nuclear energy for the time being and develop alternative energy sources. What is my attitude to the CAES? I spent 78 days there when we needed to close it down and then restart it. I know many of the staff and understand their collective psychology. CAES must be closed down, but in a sensible manner that takes our current energy situation into account. CAES has to be shut down in cooperation with the European community and all governmental bureaus have to be involved, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We have to turn to our neighbors for help. Chernobyl is a global catastrophe that has to be managed jointly. I addressed this issue at the UN conference on the environment in Rio-de-Janeiro in 1992. The conference was attended by representatives of 118 countries including such figures as Bush, Mitterand, and Majors ... the best presentation was given by Castro. Only Cuba, itself in dire straits, rendered assistance in the health care of our children. No wonder we have a saying "The poorer, the kinder!" The European community forgot about Chernobyl very quickly. But, as I told Mr. Marshall [sic], an English parliamentarian--he is in charge of Chernobyl and had visited there--you don't seem to realize that, as Sklyarov wrote, Chernobyl "is and will be tomorrow's problem." Mr. Marshall has recently become active in trying to interest the world community in our common problems. I would prefer to avoid recriminations, but it needs to be said that the attitude of MAGATE to Chernobyl and its consequences lacks objectivity. They attempt to convince the world that nothing very terrible happened at Chernobyl. At the meeting in Strassbourg when the "Children of Chernobyl" program was being reviewed, the MAGATE representative tried to convince everyone that there is no medical evidence that it is dangerous for children to live in Kiev. When I rose and said "There are 70 of you here. Who of you would like to live in Kiev with your grandchildren?" everyone laughed but not a single hand went up. Chernobyl, along with Donbas and Kryvbas, are like a yoke around our neck and take up forty percent of the Ukrainian budget. Even a rich country could not manage that, and yet we are alone with our burden. ZELENYY SVIT and I share many views, including the need to shut down Chernobyl. But we must hurry at a rational, deliberate pace and enlist international cooperation. Some of the so-called Chernobyl social organizations--by their irresponsible actions--have compromised the very idea of helping the victims of the greatest nuclear disaster ever. Chernobyl and pollution in Ukraine have moral and spiritual connotations in addition to ecological ramifications. To the extent that we are pure, healthy and strong in our national spirit, the sooner we will overcome our trials.
