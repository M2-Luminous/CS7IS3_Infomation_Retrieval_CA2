Wen Xuande, provincial party committee standing committee member and propaganda department director, briefed the participants on the agenda and main spirit of the recently concluded national propaganda and ideological work conference. Provincial party committee Secretary Wang Maolin delivered a keynote speech, which was divided into the following three parts: 1. Further unify understanding of the extreme importance of propaganda and ideological work in light of the overall national interests during the crucial period. 2. Chart a clear-cut orientation for the province's propaganda and ideological work in accordance with the basic principles and major tasks spelt out by the central authorities. 3. Enable the party organizations at all levels to practically strengthen leadership over and constantly improve and refine propaganda and ideological work. In his speech, Secretary Wang Maolin stated: The propaganda and ideological front has been one of the important fronts for building socialist modernization. The CPC has always attached great importance to propaganda and ideological work. Ever since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly called for attaching great importance to ideological and political work and carrying it out practically and conscientiously rather than slackening on it. Secretary Wang Maolin said: At the recently concluded national propaganda and ideological work conference, Comrade Jiang Zemin expounded on the extreme importance of propaganda and ideological work in the new period in light of the overall national interests in the course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; laid stress on six work aspects; and urged the party committees at all levels to strengthen leadership over propaganda and ideological work. This year, China's economic structural reform is to make bigger strides toward building a socialist market economic structure on the basis of a host of successful experiences over the past 15 years and will, thereby, enter a crucial stage of comprehensive development. At present, the whole party must work hard, grasp each and every opportunity; deepen reform; expand opening up, promote development, and maintain stability, this being tasks facing Hunan's propaganda and ideological work also. Whether it is possible or not to raise propaganda and ideological work to a new level is bound to affect to a great extent the overall work of the central authorities and also the entire party cause. Speaking of charting a clear-cut orientation for the province's propaganda and ideological work, Secretary Wang Maolin noted: At the recent national conference, the CPC Central Committee explicitly spelt out a series of principles and tasks for propaganda and ideological work and called on the whole party to take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the most basic principle; arm the masses with scientific theories; guide the masses with correct public opinion; indoctrinate the masses with a lofty spirit; and encourage the masses with outstanding literary and artistic works, these being the general and strategic tasks aimed at intensifying propaganda and ideological work in the course of building a socialist market economic structure. The CPC Central Committee also put forward a 12-point principle, summing up both the historical and realistic experiences in the party's propaganda and ideological work during the socialist construction period and targeting a series of major propaganda and ideological issues that have a sizable impact on the country's overall interests. In order to implement this principle and attain the abovementioned goals, we should carry out work in a creative manner and in light of the province's actual conditions. Hunan's propaganda and ideological work should be primarily aimed at arming the broad masses of the party members, cadres, and people with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; building a socialist market economic structure; and training, in the long run, a new generation of socialist people with lofty ideals, moral integrity, a sense of discipline, and cultural accomplishments. Secretary Wang Maolin maintained: Comrade Jiang Zemin solemnly stated at the recent national conference: The local party organizations at all levels should assume greater responsibility for propaganda and ideological work as well as spiritual civilization building. To implement the spirit of Comrade Jiang Zemin's instruction to the letter we should, first and foremost, firmly adhere to a system under which party committee secretaries at all levels constantly take personal charge of and provide guidance to propaganda and ideological workers; second, the party committees at all levels should strive to establish a system under which propaganda and ideological work is to be reviewed and appraised at regular intervals; third, we should actively implement a system whereby all party leaders are required to accomplish a number of two civilizations building tasks during their tenure of office; fourth, we should build an effective leadership system and a sound management system for each and every propaganda and ideological department; fifth, we should gradually increase input in propaganda and cultural undertakings; and sixth, we should work hard to create a sound environment under which qualified personnel are able to develop their talents and skills with ease and comfort. Yang Zhengwu, provincial party committee deputy secretary, also delivered a speech at the conference.
