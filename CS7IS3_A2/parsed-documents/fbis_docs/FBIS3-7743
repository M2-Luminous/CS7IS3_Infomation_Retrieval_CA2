I have had a telephone conversation with Jozef Stank, the Slovak charge d'affaires, about some areas that were discussed today. [Begin recording] [Stank] During the meeting with Minister Nemec, who is, among other things, in charge of the council for minorities as well as the council for scientific and technological development, we discussed above all the document whose concept had been approved recently by the Czech Government and that deals with the problem of national minorities. What is interesting for us in this document is, above all, the premise stating that a member of any national minority is above all a citizen of the Czech Republic [CR], and he is perceived as such from this civic principle. The best protection of the rights of members of national minorities is a democratic and legal system that guarantees the protection of the rights of all citizens. [Ondas] I would like to ask: Did you find a common language in the key questions with your Czech partners? [Stank] Let us say it frankly. This civic principle used in relation to national minorities is to a certain extent very interesting for us, and I think it could provide a certain alternative or certain understanding, certain approach also for us in this area.
