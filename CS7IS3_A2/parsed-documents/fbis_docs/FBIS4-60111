But this leadership -- no matter how powerful materially -- cannot change the Palestinian people's beliefs, the foundations of their faith, and their absolute belief in their legitimate rights. We are reemphasizing these constants because of the clamor provoked by the Yitzhaq Rabin government over a speech Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat delivered during a meeting with South African Muslims in a Johannesburg mosque. In the speech he demanded the Muslims' jihad for the sake of liberating Jerusalem and restoring it as a capital for the Islamic nation as a whole. Maybe the Palestinian president was forced -- under Israeli and U.S. pressures -- to offer clarifications which include justifications, not backtrackings. But what applies to him as a politician engaging in a difficult and complicated peace process whose balances are not equal does not necessarily apply to the Palestinian Arab people's sons, who are actually exercising jihad in the occupied territories daily. When they confront settlers in Hebron and take revenge for their victims within hours in heroic fedayeen operations, it is the highest kind of jihad. When they cling to the land, refuse to bargain over it, and prefer to stay in detention centers rather than pledge to abandon their right to resist, it means that numerous troubles are ahead of Israel if it insists on its repressive policies, refuses to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories, and continues its settlement policies. The jihad remains a duty for every Arab and Muslim as long as the holy land is occupied and as long as al-Aqsa Mosque is shackled. And if the United States succeeded in omitting the "jihad" from the resolutions adopted by the Dakar Islamic summit, it will not succeed in imposing this ban on the peoples after the rulers. So the Israeli clamor in question reveals the Rabin government's bad intentions with regard to Jerusalem and its future -- the fundamental issue which has been deferred to the negotiations of the final phase, which are supposed to begin in three years at the latest. The Palestinian president was right when he appealed to all Muslims throughout the world to perform their duty to liberate Jerusalem. Suffice it to say that this people have continued the jihad for 70 years to safeguard the Arab Islamic identity of this old city. They fiercely resisted all temptations to emigration and naturalization and as a result they have lost thousands of martyrs. All the propaganda festivals held for Jerusalem here and there do not have a fraction of the effect caused by an Iraqi missile fired on Israel. Jerusalem does not need prayers and speeches, but, rather, actions and sacrifices. It is shameful and suspicious at the same time for us not to hear a single call for jihad for the sake of Jerusalem. And if this call is announced, it tends to emanate from a besieged, suffocated, starved state. As for the Arab and Islamic states that are overstuffed with money, missiles, aircraft, and all types of weapons, they pretend to forget Jerusalem and the people of Jerusalem. They do not want to do anything about it. And if they do, their actions are not in the Palestinian people's interests and do not help to recover their rights in the framework of the simplest possible forms of sympathy and solidarity.
