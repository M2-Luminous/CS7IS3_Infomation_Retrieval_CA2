In a televised appearance Sunday night [22 May], Pena Gomez also warned that the vote-by-vote count by the Central Electoral Board (JCE), which is scheduled to begin Wednesday, will be meaningless unless it is determined beforehand how many citizens were unable to vote. He also appealed for prayer meetings to be held Wednesday in churches nationwide and asked supporters to avoid confrontations with the Army and police. A week after the elections, which the PRD called fraudulent, the JCE still has not proclaimed a winner. Pena Gomez, a 57-year-old black leader, and veteran President Joaquin Balaguer, 87, who is seeking reelection to a seventh term in four decades, were the favorites in the presidential election. According to Pena Gomez, the vote-counting center of the JCE, in collusion with two of the JCE magistrates, staged a "colossal fraud" by altering the lists of voters, preventing approximately 200,000 people from voting. For his part, Fernando Alvarez, vice presidential candidate of the PRD, opposed to the ruling party, said "five types of fraud" were detected in favor of Balaguer. Alvarez declared: "This crime cannot go unpunished. Whether it is with new elections or complementary elections in those places where irregularities were detected, Dr. Pena Gomez will be president of the Dominican people as of 16 August," the date established by law for the new government to take office. In light of the charges of fraud, Balaguer's government, through the Nationalist Union comprising businessmen and intellectuals, launched an intense campaign, starting the middle of last week, alleging that the United States and France are seeking to merge the Dominican Republic and Haiti soon to quell the crisis in Haiti. According to the Nationalist Union, the post-electoral crisis is being used by Western powers to destabilize the country and eventually justify military intervention, after which the "merger" would follow. The campaign has caused alarm in some sectors of the population, above all, among those less politically cultured, who speak openly in the streets of the danger of "integration" with Haiti. With a predominantly mulatto population of 7 million, Dominicans do not view their neighboring Haitians, mostly blacks who are illiterate and live in a state of poverty, in a good light. Pena Gomez urged that whenever power outages occur, as took place frequently during the elections, the people go out and light candles on the sidewalks. "We must cover the sidewalks with burning candles," Pena told his supporters, urging them not to respond violently to "enemy provocations." "In the face of fraud, we are not going to stand by," the PRD candidate stated. Equally as bad as interventionism -- promoted by the ruling party -- is continuing with the status quo, which he said has been the cause of all revolutions that have shaken humanity and the Dominicans in general. On Monday, the city of Santo Domingo with 2.5 million inhabitants appeared calm and business activities appeared to have regained normalcy, but citizens remained gripped by tension and uncertainty.
