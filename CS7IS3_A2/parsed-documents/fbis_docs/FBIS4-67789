Addressing the United Nations Disarmament Commission, he also called for the establishment of a forum in which concerns and suggestions of Persian Gulf states in the area of security and armaments could be aired and debated. He also called for the inclusion of new items on illicit arms trade on the agenda of the commission. He added, ``This issue, which has very direct and close links to international drug trafficking as well as terrorism, has had serious consequences for the security of a number of states across the globe. Like terrorism and drug menace, illicit arms trade is an international problem, requiring international cooperation, and a common approach. The commission can thus play a very constructive role by establishing guidelines and pointing areas of mutual effort and cooperation.'' Stressing nuclear disarmament and destruction of existing nuclear weapons, he said, ``It is also self evident that the most effective guarantee against the use of nuclear weapons is nuclear disarmament, including destruction of all existing nuclear arsenals. Furthermore, the obvious fact that no nonproliferation scheme will succeed so long as nuclear disarmament is not clearly in perspective should not be overlooked.'' Referring to the collapse of the bipolar world order, he said, ``States that hold massive stockpiles of nuclear weapons have, at least, a moral obligation to explain to the international community as to what remains as the logic behind maintaining nuclear weapons. The world has the right to know who these weapons are intended for and who they are to deter any more.'' ``It is quite shocking that no major country possessing nuclear weapons really came forward in this regard. At the same time, they seek unlimited extension of the Nonproliferation Treaty, making it absolutely clear that even the ultimate goal remains nonproliferation rather than eradication of nuclear weapons which is indeed the stated objective of the treaty,'' Zarif said. Referring to the discriminations inherent in the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), he said, ``Probably the most important and fundamental flaw in the international nonproliferation regime is the application of double standards which has led to selective proliferation of nuclear weapons.'' This has not only gravely undermined the authority and relevance of the NPT, but also had serious ramifications for international and regional peace and security, and retarded regional initiatives, he added. On Israel's negative role in the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, Zarif said, ``In our region, the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Israel has foiled all efforts for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, despite the General Assembly's unanimous and continuous endorsement for the past two decades of the idea put forward originally by Iran in 1974.'' Elsewhere on the NPT Zarif said, ``The states which are renouncing the nuclear option through the NPT must be granted full access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.'' On the chemical weapons, Zarif said that the arbitrary limitations on transfer of material and technology has already had its negative effects on discussions to formulate verification mechanisms related to the convention on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons and their destruction. The enthusiasm of many countries to sign the convention will give way to reluctance and indifference when the time for ratification and implementation arrives, he said. An intrusive verification system may hamper development in the field of peaceful use in another very significant area, he said, adding that real guarantees and commitments for removal of all restrictions as well as transfer of material and related technology by the producing countries before considering new verification system is necessary.
