The disparity in the parties' North Korean policies is likely to become a sensitive issue for the coalition government. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is calling for following the international community if the UN Security Council [UNSC] decides on sanctions against North Korea. But some quarters in the coalition government are demonstrating a negative attitude toward "sanctions." In addition to the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which has long taken a pro-DPRK stand, some conservative coalition leaders such as Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and hajime Ishii of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], chairman of the lower house Special Committee on Political Reform, are prudent on this issue because they have been leading efforts to normalize Japan-DPRK relations. In a 22 March news conference, SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama expressed a prudent attitude toward a hardline policy against North Korea in stressing the need for a settlement of the nuclear issue through peaceful talks. He said: "The issue must be settled between the United States and North Korea, for as long as this is a possibility. I think we should do everything we can to reach a settlement through consultations, rather than through immediate sanctions." In contrast, Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa said on 22 March: "In line with the concept of the Constitution, Japan must secure its own peace, security, and presence under the global peace realized by the UN centrism. If we do not take actions according to this principle, the international community will not trust Japan." Thus, Ozawa noted his policy of following the UN decision even if it is an embargo. Senior Shinseito officials are expressing concern about the internal discord in the coalition, saying, "We are not sure if the coalition can reach an accord when economic sanctions against North Korea become inevitable." However, a senior Komeito official is optimistic about this and says that the coalition parties will eventually get together on this issue. He noted, "Some SDPJ members will actually oppose sanctions against North Korea, but the party cannot withdraw from the coalition over this particular issue." The coalition parties, however, have not had thorough internal discussions on their courses of action on the policy toward the DPRK. They will face difficult choices when "sanctions" become a reality.
