With the approval of the Supreme People's Court, Liu Qishan, Fan Zhanwu, and Liu Ning, who were charged with smuggling, and accepting and offering bribes in the smuggling case of the Rushan Commerce Bureau, and Yang Mingji, who was charged with smuggling in Zhuhai's cigarette smuggling case, were executed by shooting in Weihai and Zhuhai, respectively, today. Zhu Mingshan, vice president of the Supreme People's Court, announced this result of the people's courts' verdicts at a news briefing on harshly punishing major smugglers today. It has been learned that the cigarette smuggling case in Rushan is a serious one in which smugglers and law enforcers colluded with each other, and the smuggling activity was covered up by armed personnel. In July 1993, Fan Zhanwu, political commissar of the frontier security subbureau under the Weihai Public Security Bureau, and Liu Ning, deputy director of the operation department, worked out an "emergency circular on the issues concerning smuggling units' surrendering themselves to the police according to stipulations," which provided that smuggling units that "turn themselves in" to the Weihai Frontier Security Subbureau will be "fined" on the principle that they still "keep their capital." To keep their previous promises, Fan and Liu separately released this information to Liu Qishan, director of the Rushan City Commerce Bureau, who had bribed them many times, and implied that he may take this chance to engage in smuggling. No sooner had Liu Qishan and others got the hint than they contacted smugglers in South China to smuggle cigarettes. On 16 July, when Liu Qishan was informed that the boat loaded with smuggled cigarettes was on the high seas, he immediately dispatched Jiang Hai, an employee of the commerce bureau, to go through the procedures of "turning oneself in" at the frontier security subbureau, whereas Fan Zhanwu dispatched Deputy Chief of Staff Wang Weidong to bring three persons, carrying four submachine guns, to greet the boat off Rushan City. Before Wang Weidong and his men embarked, Liu Qishan gave them 5,000 yuan as "labor money" and demanded that they underreport the quantity of smuggled cigarettes. On the afternoon of 19 July, Wang Weidong and the other three armed persons escorted the boat loaded with over 9,900 cases of smuggled cigarettes to the wharf of Rushan Port, and Sun Xiping and Wang Xuefeng, persons in charge of the Rushan Public Security Bureau, brought some 20 policemen and three police cars to the wharf to "maintain order" at the request of Liu Qishan. On the same afternoon, customs officers had twice rushed to the wharf of Rushan Port to seize the smuggled goods and halt the unloading, but were stopped by Fan Zhanwu on both occasions. To avoid armed conflicts, the customs officers withdrew after reaching an agreement with Fan Zhanwu and others that the cigarettes should not be unloaded, the boat should not leave the wharf, and that someone be assigned to keep watch on the boat. After the customs officers left, Wang Xuefeng, who was in charge of the lookout for the boat, called Liu Qishan, who immediately organized the unloading and sale of the smuggled cigarettes. The smuggled cigarettes were able to be unloaded and sold because Yan Shili, director of the operation department under the frontier security subbureau, had ignored the higher authorities' ban on unloading the cigarettes during the unloading. After that, only 3,000 cases of smuggled cigarettes were sealed up, as Liu Qishan planned, to cope with the investigation of relevant departments. The whole smuggling activity was covered up. After the case was reported, Wang Jianzhi, secretary of the Rushan City party committee, heard an overall briefing by Liu Qishan and helped Liu Qishan and others avoid legal punishment by repeatedly inciting Liu Qishan, Fan Zhanwu, and others to come up with measures for self-protection and synchronize their story to conceal the facts. In addition, Liu Qishan, Fan Zhanwu, Liu Ning, Wang Jianzhi, and others had, on many occasions, extorted or accepted large sums of bribes from others. Among which, Liu Qishan received over 62,000 Renminbi in bribes; Fan Zhanwu, over 154,000 yuan; Liu Ning, over 258,000 yuan; and Wang Jianzhi, over 221,000 yuan. After the public trial, in accordance with the law, the intermediate people's court of Weihai City reached a verdict of the first instance on the 11 defendants involved in the Rushan smuggling case, sentencing Liu Qishan, Fan Zhanwu, and Liu Ning to death; sentencing Wang Jianzhi, defendant of the same case, to death with a two-year reprieve; sentencing Sun Xiping to life imprisonment, Wang Xuefeng and Yan Shili to a fixed-term imprisonment of 20 years, Wang Weidong and Qiu Guojian to a fixed-term imprisonment of five years, and Jiang Hai to a fixed-term imprisonment of three years with a three-year reprieve. At the same time, the court also fined the Rushan City Bureau of Commerce, which was guilty of smuggling, 100,000 yuan. After the court reached the verdict of the first instance, Liu Qishan, Fan Zhanwu, Liu Ning, Wang Jianzhi, and others disagreed with the verdict and filed an appeal. After rejecting the appeal, the Higher People's Court of Shandong decided on 11 May 1994 to maintain the original verdict. The Supreme People's Court approved the death sentence for Liu Qishan, Fan Zhanwu, and Liu Ning on 23 May. In February 1993, Yang Mingji, former head of Sanzao Border Brigade, concurrently head of its antismuggling group, under the border branch of the Zhuhai City Public Security Bureau of Guangdong Province, colluded with smugglers in smuggling cigarettes from Macao to be sold in Zhuhai. According to the agreement, Yang Mingji was to provide armed cover for the smugglers, for which he received cover fees. From 8 to 28 March, on four occasions, uniformed police carrying arms, including Lin Shouru, under Yang Mingji's leadership or dispatched by him, drove a speedboat to sea to provide armed cover to freighters engaged in smuggling cigarettes and escorted them to the Sanzao Dock. They also helped the smugglers sell cigarettes. A total of 2,300 boxes of cigarettes were smuggled, worth 5.17 million yuan. Yang Mingji and others received 172,000 yuan protection fees, and Yang himself got 48,000 yuan. The intermediate court of Zhuhai City reached a verdict of the instance, sentencing Yang Mingji and Lin Shouru to death. Yang and Lin disagreed the verdict and filed an appeal. The Higher People's Court of Guangdong Province rejected the appeal, kept the original verdict, and reported, according to law, to the Supreme People's Court for approval. At the news briefing, Zhu Mingshan said: The antismuggling struggle is a long-term and arduous task. Relevant departments should coordinate closely, resolutely combat local protectionism and departmental protectionism, work hard to enforce law strictly, and spare no effort to punish smugglers and criminals. At the same time, it is imperative to apply party disciplinary rules and state laws to strictly deal with those who intercede for law-breakers through bribery, who interfere with the handling of cases, and who protect and wink at smugglers, in order to ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening to the outside world, and economic construction.
