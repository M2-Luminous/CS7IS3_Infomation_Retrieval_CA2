The meeting was held in a very lively atmosphere. Both mainland and Hong Kong members unanimously praised Hong Kong civil servants' contributions to society. However, with the approach of 1 July 1997, the stability and morale of the ranks of Hong Kong civil servants have become an issue of general concern. At the meeting, PWC members answered one by one the questions Hong Kong civil servants are concerned and worried about, from ruling out the possibility of "a complete turnover" and the possibility of "squaring accounts" with Hong Kong civil servants after 1997, to guaranteeing that the pay, allowances, fringe benefits, and service conditions of civil servants after 1997 will not be lower than the original standards. Based on the law, their every sentence is fair and reasonable. For this reason, I am sure that, after reading the written replies of the political affairs sub-group of the PWC, the civil servants, who have various misgivings due to a lack of understanding of Chinese Government policy toward Hong Kong civil servants and the relevant provisions of the Basic Law, will remove their doubts and strengthen their resolve to stay in Hong Kong to serve the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] Government and the people of Hong Kong beyond 1997. As far as I know, the Chinese Government has always attached importance to the stability of the ranks of Hong Kong civil servants and regards this as an important aspect of ensuring a stable transition for Hong Kong. Take as an example the retention of expatriate civil servants. Taking into account the characteristics of Hong Kong as an international metropolis and the present composition of civil servants, not only will the Chinese Government not reject expatriate civil servants but, on the contrary, adopt an attitude of enthusiastic welcome. According to the relevant provisions of the Basic Law, all expatriate civil servants who formerly worked in various departments of the Hong Kong Government will be retained after 1997 and, with the exception of a small number of posts equivalent to those held by directorate-level officials, posts can be taken up by people of foreign nationalities. British and other foreign citizens can also be employed as advisers to various government departments. This represents a striking contrast to the British policy of discriminating against local Chinese during its colonial rule in Hong Kong over the past 100 years and more. As another example, some years ago, for fear that they would not be able to get full pension after 1997, some civil servants called for setting up a pension fund. The Basic Law has provided a legal guarantee for Hong Kong civil servants to receive a pension after 1997, stipulating that the Hong Kong SAR shall pay the pension, remuneration, allowances, and fringe benefits to them or their family members at a level not lower than the original standard and, judging from the current financial situation and economic prospects in Hong Kong, there should not be any problems in paying the civil servants' pension. However, the Chinese Government still has expressed understanding of and support for the civil servants' call to set up a pension fund. It has urged the British side through the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group to adopt positive and effective measures to this end. This is truly a case of "thinking and sharing the concerns of civil servants." You may have heard about the "Beijing course" held at Qinghua University for Hong Kong civil servants. Set up last July at the request of the Hong Kong Government, the course has been successfully run twice, each time attended by about 20 people. Many more classes will reportedly be held this year. The civil servants attending the course not only made considerable progress in their practical capability to speak Mandarin and write Chinese but, through on-the-spot inspection in different provinces and cities, also had a better understanding of the institutional setup, operations, and relevant systems of the Chinese Government, China's national conditions, the life of the people on the mainland, and even the conditions and customs in various localities. The course has been run with the firm support and assistance of the relevant departments of the Chinese Government. Public media in Hong Kong praises the Chinese Government for doing a good, practical thing for the steady transition of Hong Kong civil servants in 1997 and for increasing their confidence. Conversely, what sincerity has the British side shown and what has it done to maintain the stability of the ranks of Hong Kong civil servants and to make a stable transition? Almost simultaneously with the PWC political affairs sub-group discussion in Beijing on the question of civil servants, senior Hong Kong Government officials let on that the British Hong Kong Government had worked out a list of principal officials that would work beyond 1997 and hoped to consult with the Chinese side. The true intention of this move is quite obvious. According to the provisions of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, the principal officials of the Hong Kong SAR Government are to be nominated by the chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR and submitted to the central people's government for appointments. How can the British Hong Kong Government make arrangements for a group of people and then bargain with the Chinese side for them? However, I believe that the great majority of civil servants in Hong Kong will work contentedly at their posts and attend to their own duties after 1997 as they do today. The overall image of high quality and efficiency that so distinguishes Hong Kong civil servants is sure to be continuously preserved. Yours, [Signed] Bao Xin [Dated] April 1994
