Speaking on Thursday [3 March] after a meeting with Organisation of African Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim in Umtata in Transkei, Mr Mandela said a Zulu homeland was a point raised during his meeting with Inkatha Freedom Party President Mangosuthu Buthelezi earlier this week. "I indicated to Mr Buthelezi this was a matter we were prepared to discuss directly with the king and we requested Mr Buthelezi to arrange a meeting. We are awaiting a response," Mr Mandela said. The ANC had decided in principle to accept international mediation, but it had not yet discussed the structure through which this would take place. "But the principle has been formally accepted and we have conveyed this fact to Mr Buthelezi," he said. Mr Mandela said he had briefed Mr Salim on the latest political developments during their hour-long meeting in the offices of the Transkei Military Council in Umtata. Mr Salim said he had been encouraged by the discussions he had had with Mr Mandela, Mr Buthelezi, State President F W de Klerk, the Pan Africanist Congress leadership and the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front]. "What has encouraged me more is the meeting the president of the ANC had with Mr Buthelezi. From all indications, it was very constructive. I believe and I'm hopeful that arising from the serious discussions and understandings arrived at there, the prospects for the country are certainly brightened," Mr Salim said. The OAU looked forward to a peaceful election. A successful outcome was vital not only to the people of South Africa, but to the continent as a whole. The attention of the international community was focused on this country, he said. "We want to see an emergent, stable South Africa which can play a central role in Africa and can be an important factor of stability for our continent," Mr Salim said.
