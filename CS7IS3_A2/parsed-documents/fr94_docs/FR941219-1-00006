To prevent uncontained fractures of 9th through 12th stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disks and engine failure, accomplish the following: (a) Initially inspect 9th through 12th stage HPC disks at the tierod holes in accordance with PW ASB No. 4273, Revision 12, dated March 8, 1990. (b) Thereafter, inspect 9th through 12th stage HPC disks at the tierod holes in accordance with Tables I through V and Table VIII of PW ASB No. 4723, Revision 12, dated March 8, 1990. Disks initially inspected prior to the first inspection limit must be reinspected before reaching the specified reinspection interval, or before reaching the first inspection limit, whichever is later. In no case shall the established life limits of the disks be exceeded. (c) Remove cracked disks from service prior to further flight, and replace with a serviceable part. Disks may be returned to service if repaired in accordance with Paragraph 7 of PW ASB No. 4723, Revision 12, dated March 8, 1990. (d) For 10th stage HPC disks that were last inspected in accordance with the on-wing ultrasonic inspection procedure specified in AD 81&hyph;08&hyph;02 R2 prior to the effective date of this AD, inspect as follows: (1) Perform a magnetic particle inspection or eddy current inspection in accordance with the procedure defined in Paragraph 6 and Appendix B of PW ASB No. 4723, Revision 12, dated March 8, 1990, no later than 750 cycles in service (CIS) since the last on-wing inspection. (2) Accomplish all subsequent inspections in accordance with the methods and intervals specified in PW ASB No. 4723, Revision 12, dated March 8, 1990. (e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Engine Certification Office. The request should be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Engine Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this airworthiness directive, if any, may be obtained from the Engine Certification Office. (f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the aircraft to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.
