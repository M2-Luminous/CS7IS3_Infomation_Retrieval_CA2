To this end, Martinez calls on the government "to act immediately to guarantee that more than 600-million cordobas paid out as bonds to former property owners retain their value." He suggests that the use of compensation bonds be expanded to include transactions taking place at state-owned banks, the customs office, and the income tax directorate. Bonds should also be used to complete the acquisition of shares for properties privatized by the National Corporation of the Public Sector begun in 1990. Martinez says that the government "should not delay taking action to guarantee the value of the compensation bonds."
