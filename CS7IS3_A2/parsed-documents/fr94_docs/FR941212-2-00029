As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed.

See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines, 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay on environmental concerns is encouraged to file its request as soon as possible in order to permit the Commission to review and act on the request before the effective date of this exemption. 2 See Exempt. of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan.
