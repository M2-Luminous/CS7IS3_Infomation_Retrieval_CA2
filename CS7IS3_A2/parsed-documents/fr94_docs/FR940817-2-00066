FR940817-2-00066 FR940817-2-00043 Toyota also submitted data on a single vehicle which was operated for 30,000 miles on MMT-containing fuel after which the oxygen sensor and catalyst were replaced with new components and then driven on fuel not containing MMT for 30,000 miles. Toyota also used a driving cycle with an average speed (41.7 mph) higher than that used by Ethyl for mileage accumulation and used fuel with what Toyota believed was a relatively high trace level of lead than that usually found in unleaded gasoline (0.0045 gpg lead) and oil with a relatively high phosphorus level (0.13 weight percent). Toyota referred to this test procedure as the ``Toyota 9-Laps'' and presented evidence which it said suggested that the catalyst degradation seen by vehicles using the Toyota 9-Lap test was very similar to in-use catalysts tested by Toyota. Hence, Toyota suggested, these ``adjustments'' made in creating the Toyota 9-Lap make the testing of a vehicle more consistent with what would happen in actual in-use driving. Toyota's data indicated an HC level after the first 30,000 miles of vehicle use (on MMT fuel) about 0.1 gpm higher than the same vehicle after the vehicle was driven for a second 30,000 mile interval with a new catalyst and oxygen sensor. Toyota also submitted data indicating that the efficiency at which the catalyst was operating for the MMT-exposed components was less than that for the non-MMT exposed components. Some time after EPA's January 8, 1992 denial decision, EPA and Ethyl entered into discussions concerning a possible settlement of the court case which Ethyl had filed. In the context of these discussions, Ethyl submitted to the Agency new data it had developed since the denial decision. Ethyl tested six 1991 Escorts, using both the relatively high-speed driving pattern similar to that utilized by Ford in its testing of 1991 Escorts (the Ford cycle) and, also, after changing emissions system components (catalyst and oxygen sensor), the driving cycle used by Ethyl in the original test program (EPA's durability certification cycle also known as the AMA). Half of the vehicles utilized MMT-containing fuel and half were run on clear fuel (fuel not containing MMT). Ethyl also performed some catalyst efficiency tests on these vehicles utilizing a ``slave engine.'' Ethyl also tested six 1988 Escorts which were used in its original test program driven on the AMA cycle. In the new program, after replacing the catalyst and oxygen sensor, Ethyl continued mileage accumulation, from 75,000 to 100,000 miles, utilizing the Ford cycle. Likewise, Ethyl tested six 1988 Buicks from its original fleet accumulating mileage (100,000 to 115,000 miles) using the Ford cycle but without replacing any components. Ethyl also accumulated mileage on seven pairs of 1992 vehicles (four Crown Victorias, Six Buick Regals and four Ford Mustangs) in test programs covering from 45,000 to 100,000 miles beyond break-in with and without MMT, using the Ford cycle. Based on its inspection and analysis of the new Ethyl data, the Agency ultimately concluded that Ethyl's program had demonstrated driving cycle does not contribute significantly to MMT-induced increases in hydrocarbon emissions. However, in addition to addressing the issue of driving cycle, the Ethyl data appeared to confirm the finding by Ford that 1991 Escorts experienced a much higher MMT-induced HC increase than that observed in other models tested (either in Ethyl's 1992 fleet or in the original 1988 Ethyl fleet). The Agency was concerned that these data could indicate that certain engine and emissions control system configurations were more vulnerable to an MMT-induced emissions increase irrespective of driving cycle. To further assist the Agency in developing a test program, EPA held a workshop in October of 1992 and presented a proposed test program which could address in a timely manner specific unresolved issues concerning the effect of MMT on emissions: (1) Whether other vehicles utilizing fuels containing MMT are likely to experience increases in hydrocarbon emissions similar to those observed in 1991 Ford Escorts; and (2) whether fuels containing MMT have significant adverse effects on emissions from vehicles utilizing the technologies most likely to be employed to meet future standards. Ultimately the court case was not settled; however, the test program presented by the Agency at the workshop was largely adopted by Ethyl and is the basis of its most recent test program involving the 1993 fleet. These vehicles (with the previously mentioned 1992 vehicles) comprise Ethyl's most recent dataset. 34 34 On May 25, 1993, and on subsequent dates, Ethyl provided summaries of the 1992/93 test data to EPA staff and these have been placed in public docket A&hyph;93&hyph;26. Ethyl accumulated mileage on three 1992 model year vehicles (four Crown Victorias to 100,000 test miles, 35 six Buick Regals to 65,000 test miles and four Ford Mustangs to 45,000 test miles) and six 1993 model year vehicles (six Toyota Camrys to 85,000 test miles, six Oldsmobile Achievas to 65,000 test miles, six Dodge Shadows to 55,000 test miles, six TLEV Ford Escorts to 85,000 test miles, six Honda Civics to 80,000 test miles and four 49-state Ford Escorts to 30,000 test miles) with and without MMT. The driving cycles used for these vehicles were an intermediate driving cycle of 45 mph on average for the 1993 model year vehicles, an average 55 mph driving cycle (i.e., the Ford Cycle) for all mileage accumulation on the 1992 Ford Mustangs and for the initial 45,000 miles of operation on the 1992 Crown Victorias and Buick Regals and an average driving cycle of 45 mph was utilized for these two models thereafter. 35 As referred to here, ``test miles'' indicates mileage accumulated after break-in (break-in mileages vary among these models) and during which some vehicles were run on fuel containing MMT while control vehicles were run on clear fuel.
