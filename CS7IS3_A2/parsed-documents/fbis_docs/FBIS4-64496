[Bossi] No, and I do not even know whether there will be one. The summit went off very well. We have got down to business. [Gentili] On what? [Bossi] On the program. We started with the general outline, and the choice of ministers will emerge from that. [Gentili] No names? How come? [Bossi] Well, we surveyed the scene in general terms. We shall show our hands next week. For the time being, not even Berlusconi has the names. But there will undoubtedly be some cancellations. [Gentili] Who? [Bossi] Those probable or potential ministers who are well known to take a stance that differs widely from the government interest. [Gentili] Do you mean Pannella? [Bossi] Yes. [Gentili] And Dini as well? [Bossi] Who? That guy that some people want to send to the Treasury? Well, as far as he is concerned, what we have already said holds good: This is a ministry that cannot be given to someone who has close ties with circles that have already received a great deal from the privatizations. The Treasury must have a free market mentality, not work within a monopoly mindset. [Gentili] Did the League repeat its usual requests? Treasury, Industry, and the Viminale [Interior Ministry]? [Bossi] Yes, although I realize we cannot have them all. [Gentili] Do you mean you might give way on the Viminale? [Bossi] I hardly think so. [Gentili] Not even if [Judge] Di Pietro were minister? [Bossi] He is an examining magistrate; how can he be interior minister? What is more, Di Pietro may well be a point of reference for public opinion, but he certainly cannot expect the League to help him. [Gentili] Can he expect the League to veto him? [Bossi] No, we shall not exercise vetoes. [Gentili] [National Alliance leader] Fini maintains that you are ill-advised to lay claim to ministries. "The League's electorate attaches no sentimental value to the Cencelli manual [power-sharing system]," he says. [Bossi] He is joking. I have no fondness for it either. We are talking about ministers because the government cannot be formed with technicians; it needs politicians who meet the requirements of a political project. If we were to go back to the era of technicians, it would create a dangerous situation. [Gentili] What situation? [Bossi] The technicians would be answerable directly to Berlusconi, and that would give him enormous power. Anyway, the issue still remains the same: The League is asking for a number of key ministries because the League has taken it upon itself to act as umpire and to ensure that the game is played according to the rules. [Gentili] What if Berlusconi were to turn your requests down? [Bossi] He will grant them, you will see. He can hardly form a government all on his own. [Gentili] What do you mean by that? [Bossi] That the government will definitely be formed, but that the League does not necessarily have to be in it. Either we get the means, by which I mean the ministries, to perform our umpiring role, or we forget it. However, I think Berlusconi is willing to negotiate. He, too, knows that the common good, as of now, is governability, and that failure to form an executive might even jeopardize the democratic framework. This is why the League will give the country a government, but the other values will rise to the surface again immediately after. [Gentili] Federalism? [Bossi] Sure. We shall bring the issue up as soon as the government has been formed. [Gentili] But Berlusconi is lukewarm, not to say cool.... [Bossi] He is playing his hand, and I am playing mine. But the federalist change will come about. You can bet on that.
