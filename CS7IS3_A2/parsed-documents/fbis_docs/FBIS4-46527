Arms Producers Confer With State Company Rosvooruzheniye Leadership"] [Text] May's government Resolution 479 granted manufacturers the right independently to export arms. It would be quite natural to interpret the liberation of "military-technical cooperation" as a victory by the military industrial complex. Those "liberated," however, seem to be of a different opinion. Yesterday a conference was held in Moscow between main arms and military equipment producers and the leadership of the state company Rosvooruzheniye on "prospects of military-technical cooperation" under new conditions. Rosvooruzheniye representatives (Marshal Shaposhnikov, Viktor Samoylov, and department chiefs) called for unity and partnership in the common struggle for survival by Russia's defense industry and its army. The manufacturers related amazingly well to this appeal. As of now, arms producers may choose their own intermediaries but virtually all "liberated" plant directors and general designers have spoken in favor of continuing cooperation with Rosvooruzheniye. Moreover, manufacturers consider Resolution 479 harmful or at best senseless. The fact is that in the past two years many arms producers have managed to secure a whole number of individual "preferential" government resolutions and edicts. Now these firms and research and production associations will again have to undergo the protracted process of bureaucratic licensing to obtain the rights they enjoyed in the past. Besides, on their own, the producers did not sell very many weapons. Vladimir Kuzmin, general director of the Dementyev MAPO [possibly Moscow Aviation Production Association] (MiG aircraft), said that in the past two years MAPO spent $3 million for advertising and promotion (air shows, and so forth) of MiG fighter aircraft abroad. Yet in spite of dozens of business contracts, "not a single serious hard currency contract has so far been concluded." (The Malaysian contract has been prepared with the participation of Rosvooruzheniye). MAPO's general director called on all manufacturers to cooperate with Rosvooruzheniye, which not only has representative offices and old business links in many countries but also available resources for easy credits against contracts signed. The producers themselves have funds neither for marketing nor making prepayments to component manufacturers in order to meet contract terms. Military industrial complex directors are not content with the conditions set by commercial banks. What conference participants saw as an artificially inflated rate of the ruble to the dollar and also rapidly increasing overheads cripple the effectiveness of arms exports. Export production of ammunition and spare parts is currently losing money in all cases, while deductions and taxes imposed by the Finance Ministry have made arms export -- for instance, to India, which pays in "clearing" dollars or rupees -- unattractive, and therefore the contracts concluded are not being honored. In any event, all military industrial complex "generals" are at one in that their chief enemy is not Rosvooruzheniye but state bureaucracy, which hinders the expeditious exporting of new weapons. The conference criticized most the Finance Ministry and the Defense Ministry's Export Control Committee.
