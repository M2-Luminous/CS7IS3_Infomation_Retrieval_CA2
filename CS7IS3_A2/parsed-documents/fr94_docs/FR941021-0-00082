FR941021-0-00082 FR941021-0-00013 Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 16. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, the Commission's final analysis with respect to the Fourth Order on Reconsideration is as follows: 17. Need and purpose of this action. The Commission, in compliance with Section 3 of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, 47 U.S.C. 543 (1992) pertaining to rate regulation, adopts revised rules and procedures intended to ensure cable subscribers of reasonable rates for cable services with minimum regulatory and administrative burden on cable entities. 18. Summary of issues raised by the public in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. There were no comments submitted in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the United States Small Business Administration (SBA) filed comments in the original rulemaking order. The Commission addressed the concerns raised by the Office of Advocacy in the Rate Order. 19. Significant alternatives considered and rejected. Petitioners representing cable interests and franchising authorities submitted several alternatives aimed at minimizing administrative burdens. The Commission responded to these comments in previous Orders in this docket. Although the Commission is issuing this Order on its own motion, the Commission has attempted to accommodate commenters' concerns and to reduce administrative burdens by providing an expedited method to pass through franchise fees and Commission regulatory fees. IV. Ordering Clauses 20. Accordingly, it is ordered That, pursuant to Sections 4(i), 303(r), and 623 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 303(r), and 543, that, §§76.922, 76.924, and 76.933 of the Commission's rules, 47 CFR 76.922, 76.924, and 76.933 are amended as set forth below. 21.
