The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 5 an 1,400-word article by An Hui-chang entitled: "Experts' View on North Korea's Recent Moves." Describing North Korea's recent military moves -- including the approach of planes to the Military Demarcation Line -- as "unprecedented," the article notes that ROK experts on the North Korean issue generally agree that the moves are aimed at "weakening the system of the Armistice Agreement, while telling the United States that the issue of signing a peace treaty will be raised in the upcoming third round of high-level official talks." Summing up various experts' opinions, the paper notes North Korea's military moves are "to clarify its present stance to the United States by intentionally creating a situation in which the Armistice Agreement itself is still maintained, while undertaking a series of military moves violating such an agreement," and "to make the U.S. military forces withdraw from the ROK." Noting the timing of North Korea's proposal on replacing the Armistice Agreement, the experts analyzed that such a proposal is apparently aimed at "distracting attention away from the nuclear issue facing North Korea," "sitting down with only U.S. officials while excluding the South Koreans," and "showing its peaceful face to the international community to recover its image which suffered from the remark on 'turning Seoul into a sea of fire'." The article concludes by calling on the ROK Government to map out "long-term measures" to counter North Korea's "strange actions." The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 2 a 700-word article by Song Tae-kyu on the reaction of the ROK Defense Ministry and the UN Command, UNC, to North Korea's decision to withdraw from the MAC. The article notes that their first reaction was "indifferent" since this is not the first time North Korea demonstrated peculiar actions and North Korea has not officially informed the MAC of its decision. The paper reports that the Defense Ministry and UNC accused North Korea of trying "to neutralize the MAC and divert the international community's attention away from their nuclear suspicion" and interprets this move as a "tactic to replace the existing Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty favorable to them and also to have talks on its nuclear and other issues with the United States only, excluding South Korea." Reporting on the North's pledge to maintain the telephone hotlines between the South and North military authorities, the paper analyzed this as the North's plot to gain a favorable position in the coming negotiations over its nuclear development. The article concludes that the Defense Ministry and the UNC, charging the move as an apparent violation of the Armistice Agreement, have mapped out a plan to take appropriate measures against the North after consulting with the countries concerned. The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 800- editorial noting that such moves by North Korea shows its unwillingness to discuss any issue with the ROK delegates and that "such an unprecedented attitude of North Korea will all the more heighten tension on the Korean peninsula" and questions "the true intention of North Korea," which is "contradictory -- calling for great national unity, but only attempting to open dialogue with the United States, excluding South Korea." The editorial calls on the government to provide the people with precise and honest information about the current situation and cautions against exaggerating the situation for political purposes, as the past authoritarian regimes frequently did. The moderate HANGUK ILBO and KYONGHYANG SINMUN both publish on page 3 800-word editorials regarding North Korea's decision to withdraw from the MAC. The editorials note that the North Korean proposal is nothing but the reiteration of a long-standing demand to replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty. The editorials, however, interpret that the motivation for the recent proposal is to achieve an equal footing with the United States and to eliminate the ROK's role in the Korean security setup. The editorials call on the ROK Government to beef up the ROK-U.S. cooperation system and assume a stern stance toward North Korea's possible provocative acts.
