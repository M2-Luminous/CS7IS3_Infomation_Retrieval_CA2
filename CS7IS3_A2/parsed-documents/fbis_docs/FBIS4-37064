Can you brief us on the efforts currently being made in preparation for starting the work of the Palestinian National Authority? [Frayj] In fact, the economic situation in Jericho, Gaza, and the occupied West bank is very bad. The economic structure is largely crippled. Unemployment is high and exceeds 40 percent. The volume of monetary liquidity is limited. Despite this, we are making the necessary preparations to establish Palestinian Authority and offer the necessary services to all sons of our people. The people are looking forward eagerly to brother president 'Arafat's arrival in Palestine. As members of the Palestinian National Authority we will take the oath of loyalty to Palestine and to do our national duty. [Al-Jundi] What is the proposed date for taking the oath and for president 'Arafat's arrival in the self-rule area? [Frayj] We expect president 'Arafat to arrive before the end of June. We are awaiting his arrival impatiently. Naturally, after his arrival the oath of loyalty will be taken. [Al-Jundi] Several statements were made in Israel recently on the issues of Jerusalem and the possibility of president 'Arafat visiting East Jerusalem. Obviously, there is Israeli opposition to this visit. [Frayj] Israel consistently declares on all the media that it ensures freedom of worship and of visiting the holy places for prayer. This applies to Jerusalem and to the Christian and Islamic holy places there. Brother president Yasir 'Arafat has a right to say prayer in al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and to visit Christian holy places in Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Israel declares that it ensures freedom of worship, so this should apply to all believers in the three holy religions. Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] is a Palestinian Arab and a Muslim believer. [Al-Jundi] Regarding the Palestinian establishments in Jerusalem, they will continue their activities in the coming phase. However, the Palestinian Authority clearly intends to establish others in Jerusalem operating in coordination with the Palestinian Authority in the self-rule areas. Can you brief us on the situation? [Frayj] The Palestinian Arab establishments operating in occupied Arab Jerusalem will continue their duties and offer services normally. Israel has warned against setting up political establishments in East Jerusalem. The Arab establishments in Jerusalem deal with services and studies and draw up plans to serve the citizens. [Al-Jundi] Will the establishments in Jerusalem be annexed to the Palestinian National Authority? [Frayj] I believe that these establishments should continue their work. When we assume our duties as Palestinian National Authority contacts will continue between us and the Palestinian establishments wherever they may be, inside or outside the West bank. [Al-Jundi] After the meeting held in Paris recently by the international committee that is coordinating aid to the Palestinians, approximately $42 million will be granted to the Palestinian National Authority to begin its work. Do you believe this sum is sufficient for a start, or have you received specific promises for additional funds? [Frayj] First, we thank all countries that offered aid, particularly Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait. The $42 million has been earmarked to be paid as salaries and costs for police and employees in Gaza and Jericho, who number over 12,000. Another meeting will be held in July to reconsider the aid. We hope that this meeting will result in funding of more than $100 million. We are in dire need of financial support to begin our work as the Palestinian National Authority. [Al-Jundi] Has the Palestinian National Authority specified the sums needed in the coming phase within the framework of an overall plan for reconstruction and development in Gaza and Jericho? [Frayj] We have plans and assessments that we submitted to the World Bank, the European Common Market, Japan, and other donor nations. We need considerable financial support to establish an effective National Authority and create jobs for the unemployed and improve medical, educational, and municipal services. [Al-Jundi] We thank you and welcome you over the waves of the Voice of the Arabs Radio. [Frayj] Thank you.
