Speaking at the opening of a party congress in Moscow on Saturday, he called the current official Russian policy "economic terror" and stressed that there currently was "an unpopular police regime" in power. In Rutskoy's view, the December 12, 1993 elections showed the collapse of the centrism concept. "There can be no center between the robbers and robbed", he noted. In his words, time has come to decide whether to agree with "the police regime" or form an opposition to it. He believes the party should initiate the merger of opposition forces "in a mighty social-patriotic movement, capable of leading the people and winning elections." The goals of this movement, he said, will be national, cultural, and spiritual rebirth of the country, "restoration of Russia as a great power within the USSR boundaries:, fight against crime, and creation of a prosperous socially-oriented economy. At the same time, Rutskoy admitted that adapters continued to work in the party along with those planted to destroy it. "I cannot extend a hand to those who at the most critical moment waited to see who would prevail", Rutskoi remarked and added "time has come to get rid of the junk." However, he recognized as justified the criticism addressed to him that he had paid neglected internal party activity and had quite often failed to consult party officials bodies in decision-making.
