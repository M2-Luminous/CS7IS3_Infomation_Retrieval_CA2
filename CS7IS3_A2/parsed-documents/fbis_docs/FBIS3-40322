The article cites Mirosinka Dinkic, an employee of the Belgrade Economic Institute who participated in the drafting of the social program, who states that the problem of surplus workers has to be resolved as soon as the program goes into effect because "the economy cannot function efficiently if the current number of employees remains. This means that in the entire economic sector -- excepting private firms -- out of a total of 1,780,000 employees, there is a surplus of 1 million workers." Thus, virtually every firm will be faced with downsizing in order to improve its business operations. According to the program's assessment, 200,000 people currently employed in firms all over Yugoslavia own land, and such people will inevitably have to return to their land and be without work permits. It is up to the firms to decide when and how this will be done but if they want to succeed, they will have to do it as soon as possible, Dinkic says. Dinkic points out, in addition, that it has been assessed that about 100,000 workers in public enterprisesalso own private firms which, in the future, should become their only businesses. About 500,000 of the workers who will lose their jobs will receive 50 percent of their salaries as unemployment compensation from the state budget for a period of one year.
