The Krajina Serbs have for the past two weeks held up convoys destined for the south of the Bihac pocket, which is controlled by the mainly-Moslem Bosnian government army. On Tuesday they extended the ban to convoys going to Velika Kladusa, headquarters of the maverick Moslem leader Fikret Abdic whose forces are fighting the Bosnian army. Until the latest move, convoys for Velika Kladusa could leave Krajina without authorisation. "The Serbs now want us to provide authorisation for every convoy, one week in advance, from Knin," the headquarters of the Krajina Serbs, Kessler said. An estimated 230,000 people living in Bihac, surrounded by Krajina and Bosnian Serbs, depend on the UN delivering around 2,900 tonnes of food per month.
