FR940118-1-00051 FR940118-1-00008 In addition, the Coast Guard is proposing to increase the total required buoyancy when inflated for Type I recreational hybrids for adults. The total buoyancy will be increased to 130 N (30 lb), in lieu of the 100 N (22 lb) inflated buoyancy requirement for adult Type II, III, or V hybrids. This proposal is based on the Coast Guard's determination that this buoyancy is the minimum amount necessary to provide performance as required by SOLAS 74/83. Depending on the PFD's design buoyancy distribution, more buoyancy may be required. Although recreational devices are not required to meet the requirements of SOLAS 74/83, the greater performance is consistent with the Type I classification and can be obtained at nominal cost. Section 160.077&hyph;17␣Construction and Performance_Commercial Hybrid PFD (b)(10) In lieu of the Type V requirement, the Coast Guard proposes to increase the minimum inherent and minimum total buoyancies for adult Type I commercial hybrids. This proposed paragraph revision requires the minimum inherent buoyancy for adult Type I commercial hybrids to be 70 N (15.5 lb), increased from 45 N (10 lb). The Coast Guard proposes to increase the amount of total buoyancy for commercial Type I hybrids to 130 N (30 lb) in lieu of the 100 N (22 lb) total buoyancy requirement for Type V hybrids. In addition the Coast Guard proposes to increase the required inherent buoyancy in adult type V commercial hybrid inflatable PFD's. To compensate for the loss of an extra inflation chamber, as discussed under `` Changes to make use of hybrids more attractive '' §160.077&hyph;17(b)(4), the minimum inherent buoyancy requirement for adult type V commercial hybrid inflatable PFD's will be increased from 45 N (10 lb) to 60 N (13 lb). Section 160.077&hyph;19␣Buoyancy, Buoyancy Distribution, and Inflation Medium Retention Test (b)(6) As discussed under the Scope in §160.077&hyph;1(b), in `` Changes to make hybrids more attractive '' it is proposed that the ``Required To Be Worn'' statement be removed from Type I, II, or III hybrid PFD's. To compensate for removing the REQUIRED TO BE WORN condition, additional inherent buoyancy is proposed to be added as discussed in §160.077&hyph;15(b)(14) which will be required to be tested for by this paragraph. Section 160.077&hyph;21␣Buoyancy and Inflation Medium Retention Test (c)(3) In §160.077&hyph;17 above, the Coast Guard is proposing minimum buoyancies for hybrid PFD's. This paragraph will be revised to require commercial hybrid's to be tested for and meet the minimum buoyancies specified in §160.077&hyph;17(b)(10). Section 160.077&hyph;21␣Flotation Stability Criteria (d)(3) (i) and (ii) These paragraphs are added to ensure commercial hybrid PFD's provide adequate freeboard commensurate with other commercial PFD's. Commercial Type I hybrids must provide at least 100 mm (4 inches) of freeboard and SOLAS lifejackets must provide at least 120 mm (4.75 inches) of freeboard. Changes Made for Clarification Section 160.077&hyph;1␣Scope (c) This paragraph will be revised to clarify that hybrid PFD's approved as Type I SOLAS 74/83 Life Jackets meet the requirements for carriage on all inspected commercial vessels. Section 160.077&hyph;3␣Definitions (l) This section will be redesignated §160.077&hyph;2 and a definition will be added to clarify that a PFD marked as a SOLAS lifejacket meets the requirements for lifejackets in the 1983 Amendments to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS 74/83). Section 160.077&hyph;7␣Type (c) This section will be redesignated §160.077&hyph;4 and this paragraph will be added to indicate that hybrid PFDs may be approved for use on recreational boats, commercial vessels or both if the applicable requirements are met. Section 160.077&hyph;15␣Performance (a)(2)(ii) PFD's approved as Type I or II must not require second stage donning to achieve that performance. The interim final rule addresses only Type II performance. This paragraph will be revised to make it clear that PFD's marked Type I or II, or as Type V providing Type I or II performance must not require second stage donning to achieve that performance. Section 160.077&hyph;15␣Construction; General (b)(3) This paragraph will be amended to reflect that devices approved as Type I, as well as Type II, are to be provided with at least one automatic inflation mechanism that inflates at least one chamber. Section 160.077&hyph;15␣Inflation Mechanism (c)(2)(ii) This paragraph will be changed to clarify that dust caps, if provided, cannot be locked.
