UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] rebels have scaled down their shelling and attacks against the martyred city. Right now, sporadic shelling is in progress. Snipers continue to shoot at everything. Reliable military sources with the Bie Provincial Operational Command said this morning's relative calm was due to rebel forces making arrangements for a new attack on the city of Kuito over the next few hours. Meanwhile, famine is beginning to reach alarming proportions. The World Food Program, Caritas [International Conference of Catholic Organizations for Charitable and Social Action], and the International Red Cross have already distributed their food stocks to the residents. Although snipers control Kuito's streets, the residents have left their hideouts in search of food. In Malanje, government forces have extended their defensive areas. Units of the Angolan Armed Forces, National Police, and Civil Defense are heading to the west of Cambondo, 19 km from the city of Malanje. UNITA soldiers have suffered heavy losses. In a press release issued today, the Northeastern Front Command says combined government forces this morning repelled a group of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola intending to attack (Tocamba) locality. In their hasty retreat, UNITA rebels abandoned four AKM clips, 209 rounds of ammunition, seven M-69 hand grenades, and one knapsack. UNITA used long-range weapons in its attack, though no losses were reported.
