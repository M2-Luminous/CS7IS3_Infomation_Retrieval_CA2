Security Council [UNSC] president's statement on North Korea Tuesday with a warning to Pyongyang that it is headed toward confrontation with the entire international community. "The government of the Republic of Korea wholeheartedly supports (the statement) as an appropriate action," Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said in a statement. The 15-member Security Council issued a presidential statement urging North Korea to comply with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) requirements in discharging fuel rods from its nuclear reactor. "The adoption of this Security Council presidential statement is a declaration of the firm and unified will of the international community on the North Korean nuclear problem," the spokesman said. "We warn that North Korea must realize the unfortunate reality that it is inviting confrontation with the entire international community and that it not turn the matter into a more serious situation by immediately accepting the demands of the international community." The government is once again pressing North Korea to halt the rod unloading process and accept the required IAEA safeguards, the spokesman said.
