FR940304-0-00127 FR940304-0-00021 EPA provided a regulatory exemption from the used oil burning standards for generators who burn used oil in on-site space heaters (in accordance with §279.23) because the Agency believes that burning of small amounts of used oil in space heaters poses insignificant risks due to the small volume of used oil burned (see 50 FR 49194, Nov. 29, 1985). The Agency believes that, because of the small volumes of used oil involved, filtering, separating, or otherwise reconditioning used oil that is generated on-site prior to burning it in a space heater would also not pose significant risk. Therefore, although the purpose of the filtering activity in this case is to make the used oil more amenable for burning, because of the small amounts of used oil being filtered for this purpose, the Agency does not believe that imposition of the used oil processor standards is warranted. EPA is therefore adding a regulatory clarification (§279.20(b)(2)(ii)(F)) that the used oil processor standards do not apply to filtering of used oil prior to burning it in a space heater, provided that the used oil is generated on-site or obtained from households or ``do-it-yourself'' oil changes. F. Section 279.41_Restrictions on transporters who are not also processors or re-refiners and changes to the definition of transfer facility. Today's rule amends §279.41 to provide that transporters of used oil that is removed from oil-bearing transformers and turbines and filtered by a transporter or at a transfer facility before being returned to its original use are not subject to the used oil processor and re-refiner requirements. As previously discussed, during routine maintenance of oil-bearing transformers and turbines (or similar equipment), the oil in the electrical equipment is removed so that repairs/ maintenance can be performed. In some cases, the used oil is removed from the transformers or turbines in the field and then transported separately in a tanker truck (subject to the used oil transporter standards) to a central location where it is filtered and put back into electrical equipment. As discussed above, under today's rule the filtering of the used oil would not be considered used oil processing provided that the filtered oil is reused in the same or similar manner. And, in these cases (i.e., where the used oil is removed from the equipment and transported to a separate location for filtering), the location at which the oil is filtered would be considered a transfer facility provided that the used oil is stored for more than 24 hours and less than 35 days. If, as sometimes occurs, the used oil is filtered within 24 hours of being stored at the central location (i.e., during transport) the only applicable standards would be the part 279 standards for used oil transporters (i.e., the §279.45 requirements for used oil storage at transfer facilities would not apply). Section 279.41(c) of today's rule provides conforming changes to the used oil transportation standards to allow transporters or transfer facilities to filter the used oil without being subject to the used oil processor standards. It should be clearly noted, however, that if the used oil is stored at a site for more than 35 days, greater environmental concerns may be present, so the site would no longer be considered a transfer facility and the processor standards would apply. In addition, this rule expands the definition of transfer facility to allow used oil to be held at a location (i.e., a transfer facility) temporarily prior to activities that are exempt from or performed pursuant to the part 279 standards as a result of today's rulemaking. Under today's revised definition, used oil can be held at a transfer facility for more than 24 hours but less than 35 days prior to an activity and performed pursuant to §279.20(b)(2). As a result of this change, a site where used oil that has been drained from oil-bearing transformers and turbines is held for more than 24 hours and less than 35 days prior to being filtered for reuse would be considered a transfer facility. G. Section 279.46_Tracking Today's rule revises the §279.46 tracking requirements as they apply to rail transporters. Under amended §279.46, a signature is not required on records of acceptance or records of delivery of used oil shipments that are exchanged between rail transporters. The Agency is making this change in response to comments submitted by the railroad industry regarding the impracticability of requiring signed receipts when used oil is transferred from one rail transporter to another. EPA is aware that rail cars are typically transferred from one railroad company to another without the face-to-face contact that occurs in, for example, the motor carrier industry. The Agency also recognizes that, unlike non-rail transporters, railroads rely on sophisticated electronic tracking and information systems for recording rail-to-rail transfer of cargo. Given these unique circumstances, and in light of the fact that 40 CFR 263.20(f) regulations for hazardous waste transporters do not include signature requirements for intermediate rail carriers, EPA agrees that the signature requirements are unduly burdensome and unnecessary when applied to intermediate used oil rail transporters. EPA is therefore revising the used oil regulations to eliminate the §279.46 signature requirements between intermediate rail carriers.
