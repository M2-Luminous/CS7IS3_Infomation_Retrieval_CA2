The deployment, which began on January 14 but only revealed Thursday by the United Nations, was "improper" and a contravention of last July's Cotonou agreement and UN resolutions, the government said. Under the Cotonou accords, the UN Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) is to supervise the disarming of the warring factions by the Nigerian-led ECOMOG [ECOWAS Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] force. The accords were signed by Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia, which began a bloody insurrection in December 1989, the interim government, the remnants of assassinated president Samuel Doe's army and the rival United Liberation Movement. Taylor's NPFL had refused to disarm to ECOMOG, as agreed last year, arguing that it did not trust the Nigerian-led force in its original form. Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe agreed to send some 2,550 troops to boost ECOMOG, which first began operations in Liberia in August, 1990, but only 900 have so far arrived. "The deployment of UN observers should be done in collaboration with ECOMOG which is responsible for the security of UNOMIL throughout the country," the government said.
