The media say the program of the meeting between the American head of state and President Boris Yeltsin has been agreed upon on all key matters. It will be a continuation of the summit that took place last April in Vancouver, Canada. According to the press service of the Russian president, the Moscow meeting will continue the search for ways of expanding partnership, in particular cooperation in the light of the strategy of reform carried out in Russia. The agenda also includes key international problems, such as the strengthening of security and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, peace-making operations in regional conflicts. The talks should cover the entire spectrum of questions of bilateral relations too. The Moscow summit should become a major international event, like the meeting in Vancouver and other top-level talks between the two great powers. This can be explained by the role that Russian- American relations play in the world community. Still, one can say that the coming summit talks will have their own identity. They are going to take place in conditions of the further advancement of reforms in Russia. The reforms were in the centre of attention during the parliamentary elections in Russia last month. The pros and cons of the reforms became evident then. The election results influenced the domestic political scene in Russia and to a certain extent international relations too. A somewhat new situation emerged and new questions appeared, some of which are linked to Russian-American relations. Vladislav Kozyakov comments on the distinctive features of the upcoming Moscow meeting. He writes: If you review the road between Vancouver and Moscow, that is between last April and January, you will notice quite a few achievements. Russia and the United States have come closer to each other. Much of what was agreed on in Vancouver has been done. Here one could name the decision of the United States Congress to earmark means for support to Russia and several concrete aid programs. What is more important, scores of agreements in economy have been concluded. Russia will take part in the construction of an international space station together with the United States, while America will be involved in the modernization of the Russian oil industry. These and other programs should benefit both nations. But now new tasks have come to the fore, primarily cooperation directed at encouraging democratic changes in Russia. The parliamentary elections in Russia clearly showed that the reforms, the way they were carried out so far, were too harsh for the broad masses. At a recent news conference President Yeltsin spoke of the need for additional social measures. The Russian reformers are determined to somewhat amend their own strategy and take steps to raise living standards. It is indicative that Western capitals arrived at a similar conclusion. Declarations were made there in support of broader efforts to back social programs in Russia. President Clinton even spoke for doubling the efforts of Western countries in this sphere. One can foresee that this aspect of Russian-American partnership is going to be discussed in detail at the Moscow summit. However, certain aspects of relations between Moscow and Washington should be altered in the current situation. The time that has passed since Vancouver has demonstrated the great potential of the establishment of fully normalized, equal relations in trade. However, even now, far from all the restrictions introduced by the United States during the cold war have gone down in history. Unfortunately, in some other spheres one can also notice that the West does not fully realize the true needs and lawful interests of Russian reformers, conducting democratic changes in such a mammoth country. Washington and other Western capitals, as well as international financial organizations, are trying to measure the progress of Russian reforms, their scale and speed, according to their own pattern and accordingly determine their attitudes to actual programmes of economic cooperation. Meanwhile, such an approach is absolutely unacceptable in relations with a great power. There are also some other areas in which the west should stop being didactical in its dialogue with Moscow, to use the expression of the Russian foreign minister, Andrey Kozyrev. Russia expects the coming summit in Moscow to be productive and be marked by new understanding, greater partnership in all spheres of cooperation.
