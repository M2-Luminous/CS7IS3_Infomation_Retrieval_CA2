Some police armoured vehicles were stationed along Ikorodu Road, a main thoroughfare that crosses the city, and in the residential Oshodi district, as well as along Western Avenue, a major artery into the commercial nerve-centre of the city, they said. The move came after Abiola was picked up from his residence Thursday by policemen after addressing a public rally in Lagos attended by about 2,000 people. Abiola was arrested after vowing on June 11 to set up an alternative government, ahead of the anniversary of presidential elections of June 12, 1993 which were annulled by the military government. Officials said that the extra security might be connected to a visit by Nigerian leader General Sani Abacha to military officers and men at the Ikeja military cantonment, as part of his efforts to rally military support to his government. But groups of policemen, armed with guns, teargas canisters and batons were also seen Friday morning -- stationed about 100 metres (yards) apart -- on some other major Lagos streets, particularly in trouble-prone areas of northern Lagos, residents said. They also noticed a sudden increase in numbers of armed soldiers usually deployed to protect government agencies such as the central bank, the national radio and television stations, and the national telephone and electricity companies. Newspapers here Friday published the photograph of Kudiratu, a wife of Chief Abiola, leading a group of peaceful protesters on Thursday in some streets around the Lagos residence of the politician in Ikeja. The GUARDIAN reported that hundreds of people in Ibadan, capital of western Oyo State, on Thursday booed and jeered General Abacha. The head of state, accompanied by his service chiefs, has been paying visits to other major military formations in various parts of the country since Wednesday.
