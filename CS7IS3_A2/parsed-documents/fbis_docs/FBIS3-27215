Accompanied by Ling Botang, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress and Liang Guangda and other Zhuhai leaders, Tian Jiyun, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, visited the families of these two peasants and had cordial discussions with them. It was raining that afternoon. NPC Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun first came to Luo Taoan's house. After listening to an introduction, he said: Over the past few years, whenever I have come to the coastal regions, I have had to go and have a look at the rural areas. I am very delighted in my heart to see that the peasants are leading a better and better life every day. This shows that the path of reform and opening up designed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping is completely correct. It is impossible to have a prosperous and strong country without developing the economy. Facts show that reform and opening up must not be shaken. There is no way out other than reform. After this, NPC Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun visited the family of Lin Gen, who is a fruit grower by occupation.
