The Ministry of State Security had originally suggested that Xi's sentence be limited to a maximum of two years. Jiang overruled the proposal last month. The main reason for this, according to analysts in Beijing, was to maintain the current policy of tightening control over Hong Kong and foreign journalists in China. Senior Chinese officials in Hong Kong and Beijing had expressed resentment over the relatively lenient treatment given to Leung Wai-man, the Hong Kong Express reporter who publicised a leaked advance copy of a speech by Jiang in 1992. Yesterday, Hong Kong reporters announced they would selectively boycott Chinese press events launched or funded by the Beijing government until the end of next month. Xi was convicted at a secret trial last month of stealing "state secrets" about internal policies on interest rates and gold. His appeal was rejected last Friday. Eastern Express can reveal the series of twists and turns Xi's case took since his detention last September. Yu Pun-hoi, the chairman of the Ming Pao Group, explored a variety of channels to secure Xi's release. These included meetings with a senior Chinese leader, Bo Yibo, and the State Security Minister, Jia Chunwang. In early October, a deputy head of Beijing's Municipal State Security Bureau told Ming Pao that Xi had made "mistakes" in covering news. There was no indication that he had committed a criminal offence at the time. The official suggested MING PAO should do three things: Keep a low profile; reject any assistance from the British-Hong Kong Government, foreign countries, local political groups or media groups; and make an open apology to the Chinese Government. Louis Cha, the former chairman of Ming Pao, was receiving similar advice at the same time from Zhou Nan, the director of the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY (XINHUA) in Hong Kong. Yu, the chairman, made a public apology over the case on October 10, 1993. Yu also sought assistance from Bo Yibo, the former vice-chairman of the Central Advisory Commission, through his personal connection with his son, Bo Xicheng. The Beijing Municipal State Security Bureau, after its investigation, completed its initial report on Xi's case at the end of November. It concluded that Xi had made mistakes but also said that Xi was not connected to any "economic and political crime." That report led to a heated debate within the Ministry of State Security. One faction argued that Xi should be judged "in accordance with the law". In the wake of Leung Waiman's case, this faction argued that Hong Kong journalists should not be granted any leniency and insisted that Xi undergo full legal proceedings so that "justice should be seen to be done." The State Security Ministry, faced with internal divisions and requests for leniency from several senior Chinese officials, came up with three proposals for settling the Xi case. One was to give a strong warning to Xi and send him back to Hong Kong. The second was to take Leung's case as a precedent and ban Xi from entering the mainland for three years. Leung was released and allowed to return to Hong Kong in 1992. The third proposal was to hand Xi over to the judicial organs with the instruction that he be sentenced to two years in prison with eligibility for parole. In December, the ministry submitted its report on the Xi investigation to Jiang Zemin. In the meantime, the message that Xi would be treated leniently had already been relayed to Ming Pao through XINHUA, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and the Ministry of State Security. But Jiang, after apparently sitting on the Xi file for three months, suddenly handed down an instruction last month that Xi's case should be treated severely.
