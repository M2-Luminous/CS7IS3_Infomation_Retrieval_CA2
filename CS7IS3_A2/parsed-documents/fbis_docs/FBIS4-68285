Now an entire airborne regiment has entered the city. It is basically made up of officers and warrant officers of an airborne training center transferred to the Lvov area. Following the breakup of the armed forces of the USSR, they decided they wanted to serve in Russia. The Airborne Troops arrived in the Volga region practically with only their suitcases. And a desire to establish the same kind of training center there. They wrote a letter to that effect to the minister of defense and the commander of the Airborne Troops. Their voices were heard. The date 16 October 1992 can be considered to be the birth date of a new training center for Russia's Airborne Troops. They did not have to begin from scratch. In the first place, the backbone of the regiment--the battalion and company commanders and administrative personnel--remained the same. In the second place, the city, rayon and oblast leadership immediately established business contacts. The matters of deploying the regiment, allocating land plots, the construction of the materials and equipment base, and so forth, were resolved without a hitch. The military post is gradually acquiring its regular shape. It is still necessary, however, to build and equip a training ground 40 kilometers from the post and to restore the former basis for the reclamation battalion, which has become practically unusable. According to the most modest estimates, this will require more than a billion rubles. There is the same kind of problem with housing. For now the officers' families are scattered throughout the city. It is not such a problem to rent an apartment at acceptable rent in the rayon center, to be sure. At the end of last year many of them celebrated housewarmings in the first, 100-apartment building built for the Airborne Troops. And construction rates should not decrease this year. According to Colonel Valeriy Shevchuk, the unit commander, the command element of the Volga Military District is providing considerable assistance along with the city authorities. And what about the regiment's main purpose, the training of specialists for the Airborne Troops? Right now only the permanent staff is engaging in planned combat training. The proper equipment and materials base is lacking for training cadets. The most immediate prospect is for the end of 1994. The Airborne Troops plan by that time to establish the essential conditions for deploying one of the training battalions, conducting the first recruitment and setting about the planned training of specialists. If there are no problems with the financing, this mission should be fulfilled. The regiment is trying not lose its professional skills. The officers, warrant officers and contract specialists (most of whom are local residents) have completed the annual program of parachute drops. And so, the light-blue Airborne beret has apparently been firmly established in the interior of this small city near the Volga.
