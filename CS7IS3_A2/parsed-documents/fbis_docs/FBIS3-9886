For the first time, the plan that was worked out by a group of parliamentarians with the support of the State Department was delivered to President Aristide in a sealed envelope by the former president of the lower chamber, Antoine Joseph, who asserted that he hopes for an answer from the head of state. President Aristide, who was speaking [on that occasion], stated that everyone knows why no government can function in Haiti and why it is impossible [for him] to appoint a new prime minister. He nevertheless asked the parliamentarians to forget about their political affiliations and work toward unity among all Haitians. With this unity in mind, some of the parliamentarians have decided to extend their stay in Washington so they can continue the dialogue to find a solution to the crisis. The president has promised to remain in contact with them during his trip. Port-au-Prince Mayor and National Front for Change and Democracy spokesman Evans Paul, who attended the reception, asked all factions represented in Washington to fuse their various plans into a final plan. We are all asking for a return to democratic order; so, let us all together try to speak with only one voice, Paul added. President Aristide was to leave Washington on 24 February for New Hampshire, where he will depart for Paris.
