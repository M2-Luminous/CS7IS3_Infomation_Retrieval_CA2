FR940302-2-00024 FR940302-2-00010 Applications for Duty-Free Entry of Scientific Instruments Pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials Importation Act of 1966 (Pub. L. 89&hyph;651; 80 Stat. 897; 15 CFR 301), we invite comments on the question of whether instruments of equivalent scientific value, for the purposes for which the instruments shown below are intended to be used, are being manufactured in the United States. Comments must comply with Subsections 301.5(a)(3) and (4) of the regulations and be filed within 20 days with the Statutory Import Programs Staff, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230. Applications may be examined between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. in room 4211, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. Docket Number: 94&hyph;010. Applicant: University of Utah, Department of Biology, Salt Lake City, UT 84112. Instrument: Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer, Model MAT 252. Manufacturer: Finnigan, MAT, Germany. Intended Use: The instrument will be used for studies of both plant and animal tissues which involve analyses of both whole tissues and individual subcellular components. In addition, there will be studies of atmospheric gases and soil water since they will affect the composition of the biological materials being analyzed. The instrument will also be used for educational purposes in biology courses. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: January 27, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;011. Applicant: Texas Children's Hospital, 6621 Fannin, Houston, TX 77030. Instrument: Electron Microscope, Model JEM-1210. Manufacturer: JEOL, Japan. Intended Use: The instrument will be used for studies focusing on demonstrating gene products from specific cells, identification of pathognomonic lesions in both human and animal tissues, and evaluation of structural integrity at the ultrastructural level of the nervous system in transgenic animal models which express neurologic disease entitites. In addition, the instrument will be used for training in technical use and application of the electron microscope in biomedical research of all users on an individual basis. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: February 2, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;012. Applicant: Texas A&M University, Department of Rangeland Ecology and Management, College Station, TX 77843&hyph;2126. Instrument: Gas Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer, Model Delta S. Manufacturer: Finnigan MAT, Germany. Intended Use: The instrument will be used to make high precision (0.2 U ) measurements of 15 N/ 14 N and 13 C/ 12 C ratios in natural organic and inorganic materials as a tool in the study of biogeochemistry. More specifically, this instrument will be used to describe and quantify pool sizes and flux rates of carbon and nitrogen in managed and unmanaged ecosystems. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: February 3, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;013. Applicant: South Dakota State University, Box 2207-A, Brookings, SD 57007. Instrument: GC - Dumas Ratio Mass Spectrometer, Model Europa 20&hyph;20. Manufacturer: Europa, United Kingdom. Intended Use: The instrument will be used to determine 13 C/ 12 C and 15 N/ 14 N ratios in plant, soil, gas and water samples. The instrument will also be used in graduate student training and special research topics for undergraduate students. The students will be trained in sample preparation, machine operation and trouble shooting. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: February 9, 1994.
