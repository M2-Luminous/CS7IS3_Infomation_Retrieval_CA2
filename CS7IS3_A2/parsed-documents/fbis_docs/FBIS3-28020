The sources said Hosokawa will make a commitment to continuing the process of change now that his administration has successfully tackled its top priority task, with the passage of political reform bills through the Diet. Hosokawa leaves for Washington on February 10 for talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton the following day. The sources said he will also call for a strengthening of the Japan-U.S. relationship, underlining the two countries' vital roles in the world economy and in ensuring peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Hosokawa will deliver a 15-minute speech in English just as he did last September at the U.N. General Assembly session, the sources said. As his audience will consist mainly of university students, Hosokawa will open the floor to questions after his speech. He will emphasize his efforts to achieve domestic political reform because it is a precondition for meeting the widespread expectations that Japan make greater international contributions. The prime minister will stress his intention to further promote deregulation, take into account the interests of consumers and establish a system whereby policy decision-making is more transparent. Hosokawa is also scheduled to make a television appearance, when he will have the opportunity to address the American public directly.
