In his words, 5,833 candidates were registered as of 2 March, a figure which cannot increase but only be reduced for a number of objective reasons. Yemets informed journalists that on the average across Ukraine, 13 individuals were registered per district, although there is one district in Kiev in which 31 candidates have been nominated, and there are three districts in all of Ukraine in which just two persons each have been nominated. Some 62.3 percent of all candidates were nominated by the voters, 26.7 percent--by labor collectives, and only 11 percent--by political parties. Among the parties that have nominated candidates, the Communists are in the lead with 6.7 percent. People's Rukh of Ukraine has 4.1 percent, the Socialists--3.1 percent, the Ukrainian Republicans--2.4 percent, the Liberals--1.4 percent, and the Democrats--1.3 percent. Ivan Yemets states that these data pertain to "pure" party candidates, while the actual number of party nominees is far greater, many candidates simply not desiring to link their names with unpopular parties. Representatives of 22 nationalities residing in Ukraine are registered as candidates for people's deputy of Ukraine. There are more Ukrainians than any other ethnic group--87 percent. Russians comprise 18.6 percent. Within the entire field of candidates, 24.6 percent are engineers or representatives of other technical specialties; 15.6 percent are employees of various backgrounds; 10.4 percent are lawyers; 8.5 percent--economists; 6.3 percent--physicians; 7 percent--agricultural workers; 3 percent--journalists; 2.2 percent--military servicemen. With respect to academic qualifications, 98.4 percent of the candidates have higher education, secondary, or secondary specialized education; 89.6 percent have attained the higher level of education. Of this number, 6.8 percent are academicians and corresponding members, and about 3 percent are doctors of science. According to the candidate applications, 43.2 percent of them have a command of foreign languages. The Central Electoral Commission chairman made special note of the increase in number of lawyers and economists among the candidates, who comprise only about 3 percent of the present parliament. Some 145 members of the present body of deputies are registered as candidates, Yemets stated. But this is not the final figure, since not all the official documents of district electoral commissions have yet been processed. The occupational composition of the candidates for people's deputy is interesting. Despairing of having to wait for official Kiev to adopt an intelligible policy of reforms, businessmen and representatives of commercial and entrepreneurial structures have aspired to the position of people's deputy. More of them are registered as candidates than any other group--13.2 percent. After them come state enterprise employees--10.3 percent, employees of state administrations--5.4 percent, chairmen and functionaries of councils at all levels--6.2 percent, directors of state enterprises--4.6 percent, and employees of law enforcement organs--5.7 percent. We can add to these figures the fact that Acting Prime Minister of Ukraine Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, four deputy prime ministers, and 37 ministers or deputy ministers of the current government have been registered as candidates for people's deputy. These data provide eloquent testimony to the intensity of the struggle for power that is under way between representatives of council structures and the structures of executive authority. Neither the "council" nor "presidential" side has abandoned hope of being victorious in the parliamentary election and winning power over to its side through legitimate means. Age-wise, the field of registered candidates includes most people from 41 to 50 years old--39 percent; candidates 31 to 40 years old comprise 27.2 percent, 51 to 60--24.3 percent, and over 60--4 percent. Yemets made special note of the fact that for the first time the election will take place with an age requirement: A candidate must be over 25 years old. All the same, more than 5 percent are young people from 25 to 30 years old. The new parliament of Ukraine promises to be predominantly male (just 7.4 percent of the candidates are women) and urban (just 14.5 percent of the candidates are from rural localities). Ivan Yemets refused to comment on the election programs of the candidates, and assured those present that his commission would act in strict compliance with the law. He noted, however: "I did have occasion to hear a television broadcast of candidate presentations and what they were telling people. Let me say quite frankly that I feel sorry for our voters." I. Yemets stated in conclusion that his commission would also conduct second rounds of voting and repeat elections in those districts where the election was null, as well as the June election of the president of Ukraine. Yemets called upon the citizens of Ukraine to turn out for the election on 27 March. In his words, the election, which has not yet even taken place, has already "eaten up" more than 1 trillion karbovantsy, money that could have been used to help the disabled and the needy. In this regard, Yemets stated that if a certain district failed twice to elect a people's deputy over the course of a year, no further elections would be held. As to how to escape the constitutional crisis that could arise if this occurs in the majority of districts, the chairman of the Central Electoral Commission provided no explanation, and only stated: "There is no need to create unforeseen situations."
