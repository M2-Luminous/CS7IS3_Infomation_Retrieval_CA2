Correspondent M. Sarbaa reports: Military pensioners in Estonia are a stumbling block at the Russian-Estonian talks it was stated today at a news conference held at the Estonian Republic Embassy in Moscow on the outcome of the 16th round of Russian-Estonian talks which ended yesterday. Estonian Ambassador Juriy Kahn said that the Russian side had promised to provide a schedule of its troop withdrawal from Estonian by this round. The problem of military pensioners could delay the final withdrawal of troops set for 31 August of this year. In point of fact, Estonia is demanding the deportation from the country of approximately 35,000 people, including family members of pensioners, to which, of course, Russia will never agree. Because of this, the issues of border demarcation, Estonia's debt and economic and trade cooperation remain unresolved. Work at the talks was carried out by six groups which discussed a wide range of problems between Estonia and Russia.
