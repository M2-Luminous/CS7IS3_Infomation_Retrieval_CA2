Ortega confirmed to Chontales Department congressmen his pledge to "respect the congress results even if they do not agree with the positions we are defending from the rank and file." Ortega regretted having to compete for the post of secretary general with Commander Henry Ruiz and considered that those who try to run down or alter the principles that have guided the FSLN are gaining from the conflict. The current FSLN secretary general recognized Commander Ruiz as the revolutionary leader who historically has maintained leftist positions and expressed surprise that those who lean toward social democracy have taken shelter under Ruiz' candidacy. Ortega said "any Sandinist can have this aspiration, but the grassroots, who demand unity around popular struggles, must be the ones to define the party we want." Peasant leader Celestino Garcia demanded it be noted clearly on the record that the launching of Commander Henry Ruiz' candidacy by Chontales Department Political Secretary Luis Enrique Figueroa was in Figueroa's capacity as a Sandinist follower. Benedicto Miranda, Sandinist Youth department coordinator, questioned the role of journalists, who have assumed the task of deepening the trends rather than highlighting the party's platform program.
