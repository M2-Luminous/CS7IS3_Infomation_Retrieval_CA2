In recent years the situation has deteriorated markedly. The state is no longer able to afford free housing for those on the waiting list. When it is a case of the cost of the housing going on sale, people blench. The so-called middle class has found itself in the worst position. Those with special entitlements have hopes, albeit slender ones, of obtaining free municipal housing. The middle classes are now being asked to buy apartments. Here the bank credit interest rates are such that they protect the banks themselves against inflation. The edicts of Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin signed on the eve of Independence Day finally create the necessary normative base for the legal activity of commercial structures which have been engaging "illicitly" in the issue of bonds guaranteeing that their owners will acquire housing in the foreseeable future. Conditions are being created for investments in the housing sphere and the foundation has also been laid for the development of a system of targeted credits, including mortgage loans. Finally, measures are being suggested for reviving the construction of the apartment blocks and residential regions "frozen" throughout the country. Russian Federation President's Edict no. 1180 on Housing Credits With a view to rendering assistance to citizens in constructing (reconstructing) and acquiring housing I decree: 1. That it be established that: Russian Federation citizens who according to the updated procedure have been deemed in need of improvement to their housing conditions shall receive free subsidies for the construction or acquisition of housing in accordance with the Russian Federation Government's 10 December 1993 decree no. 1278 "On the Approval of the Statute on Granting Russian Federation Citizens in Need of an Improvement to Their Housing Conditions Free Subsidies for the Construction or Acquisition of Housing;" Corporate bodies and citizens of the Russian Federation shall receive loans to construct (modernize) and acquire housing and also to develop land plots for housing construction on a commercial basis. 2. That the attached statute on housing credits be approved. That it be established that the operation of the statute on housing credits extends to credits obtained for the construction and acquisition of real estate on garden and dacha plots. 3. That the organs of executive power of the Russian Federation components activate work to provide or sell land plots for housing construction to Russian Federation citizens and corporate bodies involved in construction. 4. That the Russian Federation Government submit within three months to the Federal Assembly State Duma a draft law on altering the taxation of banks' profit obtained from granting credits for the construction (modernization) and acquisition of housing and for the development of land plots for housing construction. 5. That it be recommended to enterprises and organizations of various forms of ownership that within the procedure for rendering assistance to their workers in improving housing conditions they give banks guarantees that they will extinguish the credits received by the enterprises' workers for the construction (modernization) and acquisition of housing and for the development of land plots for housing construction and extinguish them in part or in full using their own funds. 6. This edict enters into force from the moment it is signed. [signed] Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin, Moscow, Kremlin, 10 June 1994.
