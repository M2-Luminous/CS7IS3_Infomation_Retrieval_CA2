FR940106-0-00178 FR940106-0-00022 5004‚ê£ Evaluation of Alternative State Provisions If the State law provisions do not conform to the ``suggested State law requirements'' set forth in sections 5001 and 5002, but the State law contains alternative provisions, the Manpower Administrator, in collaboration with the State agency, will study the actual or anticipated affect of the alternative provisions. If the Manpower Administrator concludes that the alternative provisions satisfy the requirements of the Federal law as construed by the Secretary (see section 5000 B) he will so notify the State agency. If he does not so conclude, he will submit the matter to the Secretary. If the Secretary concludes that the alternative provisions satisfy such requirements, the State agency will be so notified. If the Secretary concludes that there is a question as to whether the alternative provisions satisfy such requirements, the State agency will be advised that unless the State law provisions are appropriately revised, a notice of hearing will be issued as required by the Code of Federal Regulations, title 20, section 601.3.
