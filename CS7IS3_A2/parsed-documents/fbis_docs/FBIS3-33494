The agreement will be implemented in March and Brazilian entrepreneurs say problems will probably begin to get serious within three or four years. The entrepreneurs explained that the Mexicans will have to streamline their industries and improve their competitiveness in various areas. Nearly one fifth of Brazilian exports are sent to the United States. Spare-part manufacturers are studying possible associations with Mexican companies. Textile industries are investing in new technology. Orange juice and shoe producers are seeking new markets in other areas, among them the EC and Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. Claudio Vaz -- the president of the Vehicles Spare-Parts and Components Industry Union, Sindipecas -- said Brazilian companies may lose more than their markets, they might also lose investments if U.S. head offices spend the funds assigned for their Brazilian branches in Mexico. For this reason Vaz wants to close some industrial cooperation agreements with Mexican companies before March, as it was done in Argentina. Of the total exports of spare parts producers, 38 percent -- or $871 million worth -- go to the United States, the largest importer of Brazilian spare parts. Mexico, meanwhile, takes 11 percent, or $250 million worth. Vaz anticipates the industry will export at least 10 percent more this year, and total sales are estimated to reach $2.5 billion. According to news that leaked out last week, the Mangels company, a wheel manufacturer, is planning to invest nearly $15 million in the purchase of a U.S. company. Directors of the company believe the deal is the best way to increase its competitiveness when NAFTA starts operating. Orange juice exporters believe NAFTA is just one more reason for companies to seek new markets. Orange juice producers export nearly 30 percent of their total output to the United States. At the beginning of the 1980's, orange juice exports to the United States represented 50 percent of the industry total output but for some time now producers have increased their sales to European countries. Orange juice entrepreneurs believe the United States will always be an important Brazilian orange juice client. One Brazilian exporter said orange plantations in Mexico are not well developed and their processing methods need to improve. He added that the quality of the Brazilian product has been tested and approved by the U.S. market. Another factor favoring Brazil is low production cost. Brazil spends a lot less on labor, irrigation, and drainage. A box of orange costs nearly $1 in Brazil. In the United States the same box costs at least $2.20. Sebastiao Burbulhan, president,of the Sao Paulo State Shoe Industry Union, has said that shoe exporters will also invest more in new markets, such as the Mercosur market. The largest share of their exports -- 69.3 percent of the $2 billion exported annually -- go to the United States. Burbulhan said the industry is most concerned about U.S. threats of sanctions due to the problem of patents. "Sales enquiries are less frequent," Burbulhan said. The textile industry is also preparing to face competition from Mexican products. Luis Americo Medeiros, president of the Sao Paulo State Textile Industry Union, has said that last year companies invested $600 million in importing machinery and equipment.
