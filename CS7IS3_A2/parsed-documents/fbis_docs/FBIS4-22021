Terrorism came to the suburbs and drew an ugly trail of blood through the Danish routine when 30-year-old Imdat Yilmaz, a politically active Turkish-speaking Kurd, was gunned down outside the front door of his home in a housing complex at 21 Lundtoftegardsvej in Lyngby on 7 February. On his way home from the bakery at 0815 hours with some bread for breakfast, Yilmaz was hit twice in the stomach as well as in the chest and upper left arm by four shots fired from a 7.65mm pistol by a perpetrator waiting at the entrance. The victim, who came close to losing his life in the attempted murder, has said in a few statements to the police that he could not recognize the would-be assassin. A neighbor who walked out of the building's elevator happened to be present when two of the shots at Yilmaz were fired and called the police. The witness could provide only a sketchy description of a dark-skinned man, 30 to 40 years old, 180-185 cm tall and armed with a pistol, who at the time of the shooting was dressed in a black jogging suit with the hood tied. On orders from the leader of the investigation, Detective Inspector Gerhard Rohwer of the Lyngby Police, policemen from the Copenhagen Police Force's special unit, armed with submachine guns, moved out and arrested 20 Turkish Kurds who had gathered for a news conference about the attempted murder at the Kurdistan Committee premises in the Vesterbro district of Copenhagen. The police responded to a tip that the assault could be connected with an internal power struggle in the milieu, but apparently nothing incriminating was found during the search of the conference room and the arrested Kurds were released from custody in Valby the same evening after they had been identified. Motives According to the police, the motive for the attempted murder of the currently unemployed Yilmaz should be sought in his activity as leader of the Kurdistan Committee, the group in Denmark that speaks for the terrorist Kurdish separatist organization, PKK. Yilmaz has continually written letters to the newspapers (the most recent one appeared in WEEKENDAVISEN on 7 January) and made political statements defending both the PKK's war in Turkey and militant Kurdish activism aimed at Turkish interests in other countries. When two asylum-seeking Turks of Kurdish descent participated in an internationally coordinated PKK action involving attempted arson at Turkish Airlines and two Turkish national offices for tourism and trade in Copenhagen on 4 November last year, Yilmaz told JYLLANDS-POSTEN: "I am convinced that there will be more attacks." Immediately after the police searched the premises in Vesterbro, Yilmaz's political comrades in arms aimed their fire at the Turkish Embassy, which was accused of being behind the murder attempt. Spokesman Ali Celik stated that "the Turkish Embassy is behind this. They have the power for it and they carried it out." Kemal Koc also made a statement to DR-TV [Danish Television]. He has previously been affiliated with the urban guerilla group Dev Sol [expansion unknown], which specialized in the execution of policemen in Turkey. The 36-year-old Norrebro storekeeper is now one of the Kurdistan Committee's leading figures. He stated as a fact that "over 30 members of the Turkish intelligence service work at the Turkish Embassy under diplomatic immunity." Faruk Logoglu, Turkey's ambassador, responded by condemning criminal behavior and urging the Kurdistan Committee to go to the police with any evidence it has of the embassy's involvement. So far no evidence has been forthcoming and there is a similar lack of evidence on the international level that the PKK's adversaries in Turkey resort to liquidations outside the borders of their country. Right-wing extremist Alpaslan Turkes' terrorist organization, the Gray Wolves, has members in Germany and has the fanaticism to carry out assassinations. But the organization does not have a foothold in Denmark, where the majority of Turkish immigrants are of Kurdish descent. Another of the PKK's mortal enemies, the fundamentalist Hizbollah-contra, carries out liquidations in Turkey, but is not known to be active outside the country. On the other hand there are numerous examples showing that the PKK executes its dissidents and deserters both inside and outside Turkey. A rank-and-file dissident, Mustafa Tanguner, was liquidated by the PKK in Brondby in November 1985 and one of the PKK's powerful defectors, lawyer and European affairs spokesman Huseyin Yildirim, survived the PKK's attempt to liquidate him in the Netherlands in 1989 by the skin of his teeth. PKK chief Abdullah Ocalan's wife, Kesire, escaped her death sentence by going into underground exile in Sweden. After numerous examples of internationally coordinated assassination attempts and acts of violence, the PKK and scores of its subsidiary organizations were banned as terrorist groups in France and Germany in November 1993. Both countries have furnished the PKK with idealistic cannon fodder for years in the form of young second-generation immigrants who worked in Kurdish cultural societies, for example, and were then recruited to the organization's army, the ARGK [People's Liberation Army of Kurdistan]. The two countries' decision to ban the PKK was also based on evidence of the organization's extensive involvement in the smuggling and sale of drugs and the PKK's systematic extortion of money from business people and wage-earning Turkish immigrants in Europe. On 30 January of this year, for instance, four men with ties to the PKK were arrested in Marseilles and charged with extorting money from other immigrants. The chief of the criminal police in Bayern said a week ago that many Kurds are still being beaten or threatened with death if they do not pay up. After the attack on Yilmaz, Kurdistan Committee spokesman Zeynel Cevik told DR-TV that the committee's support of the PKK "does not include financial support." But in an interview with WEEKENDAVISEN on 9 November 1992 another committee spokesman, Ali Celik, made no secret of the fact that the PKK receives billions of kroner annually from Kurds in Europe. Presented with statements from Kurds living in Denmark who said they did not feel safe unless they paid up, he replied: "The tax people don't like it if you don't pay your taxes." The latest information WEEKENDAVISEN has gathered from sources in the Turkish immigrant community continues to give the impression that the donations are not entirely voluntary. On the contrary, the PKK is said to have stepped up its demands for money from Turkish Kurds in Denmark recently. The motive for the attempt on the life of the Kurdistan Committee's leader, Imdat Yilmaz, may lie in one or more of the above-mentioned circumstances. Smoke Screen The PKK milieu, which opposes the country's lawful authorities, is organized in a number of associations under names that include words like "Kurdish," "workers," "culture" and "society." And immediately after the assassination attempt, Kurdistan Committee spokesmen reacted against the police statement that Yilmaz is chairman of the committee. An attempt was made to tone down his political position with assertions that he merely has ties to one of the Kurdish community's cultural societies. But these statements do not tally with the fact that the telephone number at the Kurdistan Committee's new address at 1 Dannebrogsgade in the Vesterbro district in Copenhagen is listed with the Copenhagen Telephone Company (KTAS) in Yilmaz's name. Nor do they tally with the fact that Yilmaz publicly turned up to meet the PKK-friendly Kurdish members of the Turkish parliament, Leya Zana and Ali Yigit, when they visited the Danish Folketing on 14 January. Yilmaz's prominent position is further underlined by the fact that he has served as editor of the Kurdistan Committee's propaganda paper, KURDISTAN RAPPORT. The paper was originally called NYT FRA KURDISTAN and was the official organ of the PKK front organization ERNK (Eniya Rizgaria Netewa Kurdistan [National Liberation Front of Kurdistan]). Yilmaz comes from the village of Bulduk and thus, like other leading PKK stalwarts in Denmark, from the area around Cihanbeyli in Konya Province in central Anatolia. The authorities in Konya have never issued Imdat Yilmaz a passport. But he has a high status in Kurdish circles in Denmark, as could be seen in an internal election held in Copenhagen between 20 and 22 November 1992 when he was the official candidate for a seat in Kurdistan Ulusal Meclisi (KUM), Kurdistan's so-called National Assembly -- an illegal "parliament" that is the PKK's attempt to give its terrorist activities a legalistic gloss outside the area of southeastern Anatolia that they want to secede from Turkey. The PKK's branches in Europe have openly expressed solidarity with Northern Ireland's IRA, among others, and have been in contact in London with the drug-financed Peruvian guerilla army, the Shining Path. And in Denmark too they cooperate with pro-terrorist figures on the extreme left. Among other things, Yilmaz has been in close contact with Austrian Alfred Lang's sect of Autonome Revolutionaire, whose now closed store at 12 Blagardsgade in Norrebro was used for PKK propaganda meetings. As editor of KURDISTAN RAPPORT Yilmaz also worked with people linked to the militant "anti-imperialist" group, the Red Brigade, which applauds armed struggle and bank robberies, and in solidarity with the PKK committed acts of vandalism that caused over 300,000 kroner worth of damage to two Turkish national offices in Copenhagen on 2 April 1992. The PKK can mobilize many hundreds of sympathizers for demonstrations in Copenhagen. But out of approximately 18,000 Turks of Kurdish descent in Denmark only 2,155 voted in what the Kurdistan Committee regarded as the successful candidate selection for the "Kurdistan National Assembly" in November 1992, in which Kemal Koc was victorious. Thus despite claims to be identical with the "Kurds in Denmark" -- as the PKK wrote in a flyer following an act of vandalism against Turkish Airlines on 22 August 1992 -- the PKK's Danish front organization is far from being able to count on the support of all Denmark Turkish Kurds.
