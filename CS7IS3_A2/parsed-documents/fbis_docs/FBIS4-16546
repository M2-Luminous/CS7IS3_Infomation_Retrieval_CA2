"Two years ago, Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent a letter to NATO, offering partnership and close cooperation, and at present we are seeking for the best ways of promoting these ties", he said commenting on Russia's approach towards NATO's partnership for peace programme. We are ready to discuss whether a framework agreement should be signed first, which is to be followed by a broader one, or whether we should conclude a broader partnership pact, without signing a preliminary agreement, Kozyrev noted. "What is clear is that we want a more serious and substantive agreement adequate to relations that should exist between NATO and the superpower of Russia...especially an agreement which will exclude unilateral actions, particulary military ones, in areas where we have to closely cooperate", he said. The Russian Government has agreed in principle to join the NATO plan, which offers East European and former Soviet states cooperation but stops short of letting them join the alliance. Kozyrev has postponed his visit to Brussels on April 21 to sign the Partnership for Peace deal, apparantly angered by NATO's air strikes on Serb forces in Bosnia.
