National Australia Bank, through its National Irish subsidiary, is believed to have offered the government about IR100 million [Irish pounds] (97 million pounds) for the slightly larger TSB. The merger would give the new group about 10 percent of the Irish market with combined assets of IR2.3 billion. The deal, approved by the TSB's trustees, would spell the end of a government policy to establish a third banking force through the merger of the TSB and two small state-owned banks, the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the Industrial Credit Corporation. It has also prompted anger among other banks who are interested in the TSB. The main alternative bidder is Ulster Bank, the local subsidiary of National Westminster, which made an unsuccessful bid for the Dublin TSB three years ago. Ulster's chief executive, David Went, has said it would be extraordinary if other banks were not now allowed to bid. The TSB can be valued properly only if it is exposed to the market, he said. But the main obstacle is the opposition of the Labour Party, the junior partner in the coalition government. A third force to take on the two dominant Irish banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, is close to its heart. Several Labour backbenchers have condemned the proposed deal. Dick Spring, party leader and deputy prime minister, insisted yesterday that proposals would be considered only in the context of existing government policy. "We're not going to be rushed by any banker or any person directing his own banking interest," he said. The deal is more attractive to Fianna Fail, the main government party, especially if it can be presented as creating a new force in Irish banking. National Irish and the TSB say their merger would provide significant competition by targeting the small business and personal customers in whom AIB and Bank of Ireland are perceived to have little interest.
