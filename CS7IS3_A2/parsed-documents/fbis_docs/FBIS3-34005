Those sources added that the Palestinians sought to lease a 40 square km area parallel to Rafah region, south of the Gaza Strip, on which to build an airport. This land extends from Rafah's boundaries to the village of Zuwayd in al-'Arish. Palestinian experts estimate that at least 30 square km, 17 square km of which will be used as runways, are required for the construction of this airport. The Palestinian sources, who asked to remain anonymous, said that the reason the Palestinians approached Egypt and asked to lease this land was "because of lack of space in the Gaza Strip, which is suffering from an immense population density." Some 800,000 Palestinians live in the Gaza Strip, which is a 360 square km area, 80 square km of which have been confiscated by Israel for building settlements. According to these sources, negotiations over the Palestinian request have so far failed to yield any results.
