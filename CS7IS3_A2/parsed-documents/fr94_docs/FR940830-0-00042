FR940830-0-00042 FR940830-0-00009 When experience with the 1979 regulations showed that they created substantial compliance problems for a number of public facilities, which were amassing large deficits despite serving large numbers of indigent patients on a free or below cost basis, the regulations were amended. A compliance alternative for public facilities, which is codified at 42 CFR 124.513, was created. 51 FR 33208 (Sept. 18, 1986). The public facility compliance alternative provides that a publicly owned and operated facility or quasi-public facility may be certified if it provides health services to eligible persons under a program of discounted health services and either received for the past three fiscal years at least 10 percent of its total operating revenue from state and/or local sources to cover operating deficits attributable to the provision of discounted health services, or provided in those fiscal years uncompensated services or free or discounted health services in an amount equal to or greater than twice the facility's annual compliance level. The facility must comply with separate reporting and recordkeeping requirements and is required only to comply with the requirements relating to certified facilities. A facility may make up previously assessed deficits by showing that it met the conditions for certification in the deficit period; a Title VI facility may also make up a previously assessed deficit by remaining certified after its original period of obligation for a period equal to the deficit period, while a Title XVI facility that cannot show that it met the conditions of certification in the deficit period must make up any remaining deficit whenever its certification is withdrawn. A facility with an unassessed deficit may submit an independent certified audit to establish that no, or a lesser, deficit exists. In 1987, the Secretary again revised the 1979 regulations. 52 FR 46022 (Dec. 3, 1987). As pertinent here, an additional compliance alternative for facilities with annual obligations of $10,000 or less was created. See ยง124.514. This alternative was adopted to bring the administrative costs of compliance for such facilities more into line with the actual level of uncompensated services available, with the requirements applicable under ยง124.514 resembling those applicable under the public facility compliance alternative. Proposed Rules In the NPRM, the Secretary proposed an additional compliance alternative designed to address the compliance problems of another class of facilities whose operational characteristics have created intractable compliance problems, but which cannot qualify for the existing compliance alternatives. Many of these facilities provide substantial amounts of free or below cost services, generally because they were created to provide services at no or a nominal charge to all persons, or they serve an indigent population that is entirely covered by third-party programs such as Medicaid. These facilities, which are generally private, nonprofit organizations, include facilities such as sheltered workshops, crippled children rehabilitation facilities, cerebral palsy centers, chronic disease hospitals, Goodwill Centers, facilities for the blind, mental health centers, and Easter Seal Centers. Based on experience monitoring such facilities' compliance with the uncompensated services regulations since 1979, the Department determined that many such facilities have accumulated large uncompensated services deficits, typically because their policies of not charging or of serving populations covered under governmental indigent care programs preclude receiving credit under the uncompensated services regulations for the free and below cost care they in fact provide. The Department identified 180 private, nonprofit outpatient, rehabilitation, and community mental health center facilities with outstanding uncompensated services obligations which were likely to have provided a large volume of free or below cost care while receiving little or no uncompensated services credit. A survey of 28 of these confirmed that there are a number of facilities for which compliance with the uncompensated services requirements is difficult or impossible, given their charging policies, legal requirements applicable to their operations, characteristics of their patient populations, or some combination of these factors, but which clearly provide health services without regard to ability to pay. Accordingly, the Secretary proposed to adopt a compliance alternative for private, nonprofit facilities which provide a substantial amount of services without regard to ability to pay, but which find it difficult, if not impossible, to comply with the present uncompensated services requirements. The proposed compliance alternative was substantially similar to the public facility compliance alternative with respect to requirements for reporting, recordkeeping, and the make-up of deficits. However, the eligibility criteria differed somewhat. Under the proposed rule, a facility could qualify for the compliance alternative if it was a private, nonprofit entity falling into one of two categories: either (1) it received no monies directly from patients with incomes up to twice the poverty level (exclusive of certain deductible and coinsurance amounts and other required collections), or (2) it received for the three most recent fiscal years at least 10 percent of its non-Medicaid and non-Medicare operating revenue from philanthropic sources to cover operating deficits and either provided services under a ``program of discounted health services'' or provided all services to all persons at no or a nominal charge (exclusive of certain deductible and coinsurance amounts and other required collections). With respect to the first category, the NPRM stated that in the Department's view those facilities that collect no monies from patients with incomes up to twice the poverty level are meeting the statute's objectives. Similarly, with respect to the second category, the proposed percentage of private philanthropic support was considered to be a proxy for tax support in the public facility context, as such monies are generally contributed to fund services which are deemed essential or worthwhile, but which are not self-supporting. The ``program of discounted health services'' criterion is analogous to a similar criterion in the public facility compliance alternative, and reflects a recognition that many such facilities have in place a mechanism for determining eligibility for such services by screening for ability to pay. The rationale for the other criterion is self-evident: Clearly, facilities that provide all services at no or a nominal charge are adequately serving those in their patient population who are unable to pay. The NPRM also solicited comment on whether the compliance alternative should be expanded to cover public facilities that do not qualify for the public facility compliance alternative but whose operational characteristics are similar to the private, nonprofit entities the alternative would cover. Public Comment and the Department's Responses The Department received 23 comments on the proposed rules, principally from rehabilitation and other facilities and provider associations. While most of the comments received were in favor of the proposed compliance alternative in principle, many suggested specific changes to the proposed policies. The comments and the Department's responses thereto are summarized below. 1. Criteria for Certification. a. Inclusion of Public Facilities A number of commenters recommended that the criteria for certification be changed to permit the inclusion of public facilities that otherwise meet the criteria for certification. They argued that there is operationally no difference between such facilities and non-profit facilities that meet the criteria, and that it is unreasonable to penalize public facilities just because they are public. The Department agrees with these comments and has changed the rules accordingly, by eliminating proposed ยง124.516(b)(1), which would have restricted the compliance alternative to private, nonprofit facilities.
