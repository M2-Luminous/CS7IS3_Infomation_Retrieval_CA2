In his opinion, the government has the necessary legal arguments to help the treaty pass the juridical test, and it cannot sit back with its arms crossed while other countries are signing investment protection treaties. "The new Constitution is being tested, and if the treaty with the UK is not approved, Colombian will be left in a very complicated position." Santos defended the Foreign Investment Protection Agreement signed with the UK. He added, however, that the Shell Company cannot use the treaty to support its case in its conflict with the government over the termination of Shell's contract in Neiva. The oil company has already presented its legal case on the basis that an acquired right has been violated. The treaty cannot be applied to such a case. "Colombia did not yield when it signed the treaty with the UK. It only put the regulations currently in effect into one agreement to provide greater stability for investors," Santos added. Free Commerce As new ECLA [Economic Commission for Latin America] president in the 25th period of sessions, Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos will establish a hemispheric free trade zone, the inclusion of the social sector in the economic opening process, and the recovery of ECLA's leadership his priorities According to Santos, ECLA can become a vital force to promote social development in the region. He said: "The benefits derived from development programs must be distributed equitably. If they are not, the programs lose legitimacy." Approximately 200 million Latin Americans and Caribbeans (out of a total of 450 million) currently live in a state of absolute poverty. According to Santos, this indicates that although "the opening has been implemented and there are interaction agreements between 22 countries, the importance of the social sector has not been emphasized." Regarding the Latin American integration agreements, Santos asserted that they must converge in the establishment of a free trade zone at the continental level, a process in which ECLA could play an important role. "We must confirm the agreements so all countries are speaking the same language. We have to find a common denominator for rules on the origin of merchandise and antidumping [previous word in English] laws, among other topics," Santos stated. Regarding Colombia's entry into the NAFTA signed by Mexico, the United States, and Canada, Santos said they will leave everything ready for the new government to enter that group. "We have already agreed that Colombia is an ideal candidate to enter the treaty, and we want to be on the list of countries that will enter it first. The next administration, however, will set the date and the conditions for our entry," the minister stated. On the Group of Three problems, he reported that they will hold a meeting next week to reach an agreement on the two areas that have sparked differences: rules on origin of merchandise in the textile and chemical sectors.
