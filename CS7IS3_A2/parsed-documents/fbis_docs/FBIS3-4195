Li Ruihuan said: I am very pleased to meet you. The Panchen Lama and I were good friends. His death has deprived our country of a very prestigious religious leader, and our party has lost a good friend. The Panchen made outstanding contributions to Tibet's development and stability and to China's nationality and religious work. I hope there will be more nationality and religious figures like the Panchen, who was dedicated to safeguarding the unification of the motherland and to promoting national unity and economic development. This is the basic guarantee for stability, prosperity, and development in the nationality areas. [passage omitted] [Yaoxi Sulangzhuoma] said gratefully: I am 78 this year and very healthy.
