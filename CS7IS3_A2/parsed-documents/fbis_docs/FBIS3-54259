The prime minister was speaking in Jerusalem to a large group of rabbis from the United States. He said agreement had been reached with the Palestinians on some of the issues, but not on control of the crossing points. Jack Katzenell reports: [Begin recording] [Katzenell] Prime Minister Rabin said Israel and the Palestinians are near an agreement on some of the issues. For example, control of the roads to and from the Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip. But, there was still no agreement on the border crossing points. He said Israel must retain control of the Jordan bridges to check for arms or explosives and determine who is allowed to pass. [Rabin] We don't want that influx of Palestinian refugees, a quarter of a million, will cross the passes because it is written in the DOP [Declaration of Principles] that the question of the refugees, that it has to be negotiated once we'll reach negotiations on the permanent solution. It is excluded to be dealt with during the creation of the interim period. [Katzenell] More than 300,000 Palestinians and other Arabs visit the territories every summer, Rabin said. We welcome them, but we must know when they enter and whether they have left. Otherwise, we shall have a quarter of a million or half a million refugees returning in the interim period, and this is not sanctioned in the Declaration of Principles. Turning to the negotiations with Syria, Rabin said President al-Asad has not yet clarified what he means by peace; whether he means open borders, diplomatic relations, and encouragement by the two governments of normal relations between the peoples. We do not expect al-Asad to come to Jerusalem as President al-Sadat did, Rabin said, but he has to understand better the way the Israeli people think. [Rabin] Unfortunately, if you watch the last press conference in Geneva in which the two presidents, Clinton and al-Asad appeared -- in the press conference al-Asad didn't do 1 percent of what al-Sadat did in coming to Jerusalem. It was President Clinton that answered Wolf Blitzer, and not President al-Asad. [Katzenell] Rabin said he has invited al-Asad to Jerusalem 10 times or more. I am willing to meet him in Damascus, in Jerusalem, anywhere on the globe, the prime minister said, without preconditions, except what has already been agreed between us. [end recording]
