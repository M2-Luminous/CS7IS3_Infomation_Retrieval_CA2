This is combined with a good deal of politically correct propaganda, much of it originating from the state media, that we have broken with the problems of the past, and are all together marching towards peace and happiness. Unfortunately this is not all true. Whilst the Government of National Unity is a compromise wherein participants pledge co-operation for the common good, fundamental conflicts still exist. Now that the election is behind us it is time to get back to resolving these issues. They were only temporarily set aside--on the understanding that they would be dealt with once the election was over. Burning Issue These issues are the constitutional differences between the ANC and NP [National Party] on the one hand, and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] on the other. Before the election it was agreed that there be further international mediation around the question of federalism and powers for regions. This is probably the most effective method of defining the positions of the main parties relatively quickly, and establishing whether there is any possibility of bridging them. Otherwise we will only revisit the history of constitutional negotiations before April 27. A history which, for the most part, was about stringing the federalists along in a pointless process, whilst Cyril Ramaphosa, and the lets pretend opposition of Roelf Meyer, tried to manipulate public perception to their own benefit. Real Opposition The IFP's insistence on international mediation signals that it is the real constitutional opponent of the ANC. In this it might be supported by the DP [Democratic Party], whilst impulses towards stronger regional powers may also come from some of the ANC's provincial premiers. The NP, as has been clear for a long time, is not a constitutional opponent. Its centre-right rhetoric, which it mouths but does not properly understand, is mostly intended as carving out a niche within South Africa's political system, from which power and position can be preserved. Old Duo The old duo of Ramaphosa and Meyer already appear to be backing away from an agreement reached with the IFP prior to the election, that international mediation would occur. Perhaps they feel, now the IFP is in the process as they define it, that further attempts to humour that party are unjustified. If so they are wrong. At the heart of the Government of National Unity is a compromise which has not yet been fully reached, and which is in important respects implied by the promise of mediation of the burning question of regional power. Unwillingness to address this issue could make the genuinely multi-party nature of the national unity government short lived.
