III. Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment The United States and Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet, Inc. have stipulated that the Court may enter the proposed Final Judgment after compliance with the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)&hyph;(h). The proposed Final Judgment provides that its entry does not constitute any evidence against or admission of any party with respect to any issue of fact or law. Under the provisions of Section 2(e) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(e), the proposed Final Judgment may not be entered unless the Court finds that entry is in the public interest. Section VIII of the proposed Final Judgment sets forth such a finding. The proposed Final Judgment is intended to ensure that Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet, Inc. discontinue all practices which unreasonably restrain competition among automobile body repair shops. A. Prohibitions and Obligations Under Section IV of the proposed Final Judgment, Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet, Inc. are enjoined and restrained from: (1) Agreeing with any other automobile body repair shop to fix, establish, raise, stabilize or maintain any hourly rate or part price or discount; (2) participating in any discussion with or communicating with any other automobile body repair shop concerning adherence to or changes to, or the need or desirability of adhering to or changing, any hourly rate or part price or discount; and (3) disseminating any information to any automobile body repair shop concerning any planned or contemplated change in an hourly rate or part price or discount. Section V of the proposed Final Judgment obligates Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet, Inc. to implement and maintain an antitrust compliance program. This program would require each defendant to designate an Antitrust Compliance Officer within 30 days of entry of the Final Judgment. The Antitrust Compliance Officer for each defendant would be responsible for implementing and supervising the antitrust compliance program and compliance with the Final Judgment. Section V also obligates Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet, Inc. to distribute within 60 days from entry of the Final Judgment, a copy of the Final Judgment to all officers and employees responsible for approving, disapproving, monitoring, recommending, or implementing any hourly rate or part price or discount, as well as any officer or employee who succeeds to such a position, and briefing those persons annually on the meaning and requirements of the Final Judgment and the antitrust laws and advising them that the defendant's legal advisors are available to confer with them regarding compliance with the Final Judgment and the antitrust laws. Further the Antitrust Compliance Officer must obtain from each such officer or employee, annual written certifications stating that he or she: (1) Has read, understands, and agrees to abide by the terms of the Final Judgment; (2) has been advised and understands that his or her failure to comply with the Final Judgment may result in conviction for criminal contempt of court; and (3) is not aware of any violation of the Final Judgment that has not been reported to the Antitrust Compliance Officer. The Antitrust Compliance Officer must maintain a record of recipients to whom the Final Judgment has been distributed and from whom certifications have been obtained. He or she must also report to the Department of Justice any violation of the Final Judgment. Finally, the Antitrust Compliance Officer must also distribute copies of the Final Judgment to the owner or manager of each automobile body repair shop, located within 50 miles of Casper, Wyoming, which is presently in business and has purchased parts or body repair services from the defendant in the last five years. In addition to the prohibitions and obligations contained in Section IV and V, Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet, Inc. are further obligated, under Section VI, to certify, within 75 days after the entry of the Final Judgment, that they have designated an Antitrust Compliance Officer and have distributed the Final Judgment in accordance with the Section V requirement. Section VI also requires Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet, Inc., for a period of ten years after the entry of the Final Judgment, on or before its anniversary date, to file with the Government, a statement as to the fact and manner of compliance with the provisions of Section V of the Final Judgment.
