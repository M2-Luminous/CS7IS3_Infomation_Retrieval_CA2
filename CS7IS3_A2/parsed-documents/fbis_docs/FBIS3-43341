Spokesman Carl Niehaus was referring to reports that ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa had bought a farm in the eastern Transvaal. Niehaus says such reports are unfounded and he says it's the media's duty to avoid being used to disseminate deliberate misinformation. [Niehaus] We are concerned that Radio 702 allowed such a campaign to be carried on the air virtually throughout the day and it took them over four hours before they approached the African National Congress for any comment. The ANC believes that this places a serious responsibility on the media not to run such dubious stories without checking and double checking their authenticity.
