Lambeck report: "Ruehe Rejects Kinkel's Criticism"] [Text] Bonn -- One day before the Constitutional Court deals with Bundeswehr missions outside NATO, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) rejected the criticism by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) regarding the planned reduction of the Bundeswehr yesterday. In an interview with DIE WELT, Ruehe stated that the troops will become smaller and be reduced to about 340,000 because "exercises and investments will again be possible." However, he added: "We reserve the right to 370,000 men." Kinkel insisted on a strength of 370,000 men. The Chancellor's Office also pointed out that, internationally, Germany will reserve the right to 370,000 men. Ruehe's conceptional guidelines for the Bundeswehr that will be submitted to the defense working group of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] today are being supported by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and CDU/CSU Bundestag group leader Schaeuble. They stipulate a peacetime strength of 320,000 to 340,000 men. They also provide for a military service of 10 months. Ruehe told DIE WELT: "The weakening of the Bundeswehr is the result of expenditure cuts involving 2 billion German marks within 12 months. It is now important to strengthen the operational readiness of the Bundeswehr by optimizing the use of the money." The smaller armed forces will be given structures that make it possible to ensure a quick increase to 370,000 men.
