FR940127-2-00101 FR940127-2-00069 The Exchange states that these changes to the provisions governing the suspension and termination of market maker registration will serve to conform the market maker registration suspension and termination provisions to those of the specialist and odd-lot dealer. The proposed rule change also changes current Exchange Rules governing the summary suspension of the registration of specialists and odd-lot dealers. Currently, the rules allow for summary suspension by either the Floor Procedure Committee or the President of the Exchange. Such Rules specify that whenever it shall appear or be called to the attention of any member of the Committee on Floor Procedure or the President that a specialist, co-specialist, relief specialist or odd-lot dealer is violating any of the Rules of the Exchange or the federal securities laws or is conducting business in an unethical manner, the member of the Floor Procedure Committee or the President shall, without the necessity of previous notice, suspend the registration of such party pending an opportunity for prompt hearing on the apparent violation in accordance with Article XII of the Rules of the Exchange. 9 9 Article XXX, Termination of Registration, Rule 8 governs specialists, co-specialists and relief specialists, and Article XXXI, Termination of Registration, Rule 14 governs odd-lot dealers. Both Rule 8 and Rule 14 also provide that, notwithstanding the opportunity for hearing, upon imposition of the summary suspension of registration, the Exchange shall provide notification thereof to the Commission and the affected party may immediately file a request with the Commission for a stay of imposition of the suspension of registration in accordance with such procedures as the Commission may provide. Both Rules 8 and 14 further provide that the Committee on Specialist Assignment may suspend or terminate any such registration based upon a finding (after the opportunity for a hearing in accordance with Article XVII) that the party has not satisfactorily performed his responsibilities as defined in the federal securities laws and the rules of the exchange. The Exchange is eliminating the language in the suspension of registration rules governing specialists, co-specialists, relief specialists and odd-lot dealers which provides that any member of the Floor Procedure Committee may take action to summarily suspend the registration of such parties. The amended rule, therefore, permits only the President of the Exchange to summarily suspend the registration of specialists, co-specialists, relief specialists and odd-lot dealers. This corresponds to the new market maker summary suspension provisions previously discussed. The Exchange believes that due to the serious nature of summary suspension of registration, this type of authority is appropriately exercised only by the President of the Exchange.
