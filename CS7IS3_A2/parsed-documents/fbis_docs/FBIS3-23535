Petrov under the rubric "The People's Army": "Why the Democrats Fear the Army"] [Text] Serve the Fatherland! Television and the press are again vigorously raking the Army over the coals. This time for supporting Zhirinovskiy in the election. We already know that the "free, democratic press" does nothing without first clearing its actions with a certain center for the coordination of propaganda campaigns. Why have certain sages among the democrats suddenly begun devoting so much attention to the army? Is it not because recent events have shown that democracy still lacks the strength to make a statement in internal affairs and some people are afraid it will make a statement on its own? Fear for their own skins put all the "zealots for the people" into a state of panic following the election. Having despicably forced the Army to take part in the October bloodshed, the timeservers decided that they could treat the army like a prostitute. But no, despite the participation by several units and formations in the unconstitutional putsch, the mood in the army as a whole did not become one of greater loyalty to the regime. On the contrary, there was a hatred in the Army for those who provoked it to commit bloodshed! When speaking of the Army, it is impossible not to mention the participation of fightingmen in the execution of the legal authorities, a matter painful to the heart of every honorable officer and enlisted man. I am not in a position to make a legal assessment of the crime. This must be done at the official, state level by experienced legal experts. As an officer I am merely trying to understand the moral and ethical motivation of those who were forced (just that, forced--with the exception of a few scoundrels) to carry out the unconstitutional orders. What was the core around which the entire life and the career of the Russian, a Russian officer, was based, structured and transpired? It was certainly not his earnings. There has never been a time in the history of Russia or the USSR when an officer received very high pay rates. Read the memoirs of the old Russian generals and other officers. Within our memory, in the "stagnant" past, the officer's pay was comparable to that of a skilled worker. And any merchant today receives many times the earnings of an officer. Furthermore, the former does not remain on duty day and night at a range, does not operate in a state of constant nervous tension in a missile silo or on a submarine or a missile-carrier, does not run forth in the face of bullets somewhere in Central Asia or the Transcaucasus. This means that it is not material benefit which has screened these people but a strength commensurate with the difficulties and dangers. Russian historian L.N. Gumilev defined it as "zeal." As applied to the officer, it is a desire to realize his vital aspirations in the military, in service to the state and the people. It was precisely an orientation toward the state which constituted the dominant imperative in the shaping of the officers' world outlook. Beginning at the end of the '80s, however, this core first lost its stability and then, with the collapse of the Union, became an ephemeral element. The most unstable, career-minded, essentially marginal portion of the officer corps set out on a course openly betraying their duty, the army and the state. One need only to recall the exposure of commercial activities being engaged in by higher command personnel in the Western Group of Forces, in certain fleets, in the aviation and the districts. I feel that this development has had an extremely demoralizing effect upon the army, possibly even greater than when the Gorbachev government betrayed the army in Tbilisi and Vilnius; greater than the dirty, vile campaign in which democratized elements in the mass media accused the army of all the sins of the universe. The force of cultivated traditions is so great, however, that even in today's extremely difficult circumstances the large part of the officer corps continue conscientiously to bear their cross. It was precisely the reflexive force of discipline which forced most of those officers who entered Moscow bearing weapons to submit to the unconstitutional orders, since the orders emanated from those groups to which the army is subordinate, the state leadership. Habit is second nature. The fact that the introduction of troops into Moscow was effected with typically authoritarian methods also played a role. General Kondratyev, deputy defense minister, issued orders directly to the commanders of the 2nd and 4th divisions and the 27th brigade (I deliberately and for perfectly understandable reasons omit the word "Guards" in their names). Furthermore, commanders at all levels were forbidden to give any information to staff members of the district, which was not informed of the introduction of subordinate troops into Moscow. The ban was lifted only after the defenders of the parliament were suppressed. How do you like that? The leadership of the Ministry of Defense does not even trust the district command element and its staff! We can see that fear predominates in the sentiments of the upper level even there. Fear forced the Ministry of Security to be destroyed, but since the Army cannot be treated that way, we should anticipate some personnel changes in the leadership of the Ministry of Defense and the districts, primarily the Moscow district. With respect to the prestige of leaders of the state and the Army in the military, its value is vanishingly small, as the mathematicians say. The October events turned against Yeltsin even those few officers who still harbored certain illusions about him. The most unfortunate thing is the fact that none of the prominent military leaders, either of the present or from the past, enjoys absolute or even predominant prestige among the officers. And so, the following conclusions can be drawn: that the Army as a special institution of the state is presently incapable of performing its main function, with the exception of the nuclear forces; that the Army is still capable of exerting a major influence upon the outcome of events inside the country; and that its role can be either fatal or rejuvenating; that the Army in the person of its officer corps absolutely rejects the present regime; that the Army is not yet a unified, unequivocally like-minded organism; it has not acquired a leader, and this is a major destabilizing factor. One can predict events to come. There is no doubt that a narrow group of rulers will continue to implement "their" plan for subordinating the nation to the West, no matter what the cost. Resistance in the people to this course is great and continues to grow. Support for the regime will be sought in so-called power structures. The Ministry of Security was destroyed, and for some time these agencies will not have the capacity seriously to influence the situation. The army's antipathy toward the regime is indisputable, but the inertia of subordination is still great. Only the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] is capable of providing support, a fact demonstrated by past events. It is with good reason that this ministry's strength is presently being vigorously built up. More than 20 percent of the draftees within the MVO [Moscow Military District] are destined for the MVD. This is an unprecedented figure. Considering the inconsistent position taken by the Army (not to be confused with the leadership of the Ministry of Defense), state-minded, patriotic forces, organizations and leaders should interact more closely with the officer corps. In no case should we repeat the errors of the past, when it was taken for granted that the army would refuse to employ weapons, and based on those groundless hopes almost no work was performed with it. The fuss raised by certain officer organizations found the bulk of the officer corps indifferent. The main stress in working with the army should be on appealing to its state-oriented, patriotic instinct. The origins of most officers in the people and their basic linkage with the people should be stressed to the maximum--not an abstract but a concrete people gasping from the current difficulties but still supporting the army which betrayed it in October of '93. We need to promote constantly, persistently and purposefully the concept that a Russian, a Russian officer, if he is a real officer, is incapable of lifting a hand against a compatriot or against legal authority.
