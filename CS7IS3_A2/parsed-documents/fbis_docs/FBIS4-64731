Thank you for attending this news conference, which I want to make very brief. In view of the situation of social alarm existing in recent days and also the atmosphere of political crisis, I thought it necessary to clarify to you, and thus to public opinion, what my position is as head of government and also what the government's position is. First, I must say that I share the climate of social alarm. I think that the cases that have appeared recently, the cases of corruption -- both the affair of Mr. Roldan [former head of the Civil Guard] and the affair of Mr. Rubio [former Bank of Spain governor] -- are serious enough to create that climate of social alarm. Second, I wish to say that I took on a commitment on 6 June last year. During the whole election campaign, but in particular on 6 June, the commitment was to a twofold endeavor for our country. First, to fight against any cases of corruption that might appear, even if they were, as in this case, old corruption cases; and, second, to fight to overcome the economic situation or the economic crisis that our country was going through. These were the two major objectives of the election campaign and of 6 June. All of this has to be done in a climate of political stability. We have been carrying out that task and shall continue to do so. The first doubt that I would like to clear up, because I know that there is speculation -- and not only speculation, there are some opposition political forces that are even calling for my resignation as prime minister -- the first thing that I would like to clear up is that I am not going to resign. On the contrary, I believe that it is my responsibility to remain as head of government, to clear up the cases that have appeared and any others that may appear, and to continue to fight the situation of economic crisis, which we are beginning to overcome. I also believe that this uncertainty and this social alarm may cause economic harm. Therefore, we must continue to fight our country's economic crisis in a serious, rigorous manner. You know what the events of the last few days have been, but I will give an account of them as a brief summing up. Last Saturday [30 April] I received the resignation of the minister of the interior -- a resignation related to the political responsibility that he accepted for the disappearance of Mr. Roldan. I have accepted that resignation and I will explain to you now, in order to avoid speculation, that I will be proposing to the king that Luis Alberto Belloch should take charge of the Ministry of the Interior, as well as his present Ministry of Justice portfolio. Thus the Ministries of the Interior and Justice will be merged and Luis Alberto Belloch will head that double ministry. Because of his sense of political responsibility, I have also received [former Interior Minister] Jose Luis Corcuera's resignation of his parliamentary seat. Naturally this is not a decision I can make; he was elected by voters, but I think that it is an honorable gesture on his part, from the point of view of political responsibility about which so much is said -- and so often -- in our country. Then yesterday afternoon I received -- and therefore I understand that the climate from the political point of view is a difficult one -- I received the resignation of the agriculture minister. He has explained the reasons and of course I want to thank him for the effort he made during this time, his good work from the point of view of his political responsibility, and naturally also for taking on that political responsibility. I also want to underline the fact that I think that one should make a distinction: In the case of the agriculture minister there was never any enrichment due to his public office. Consequently, I think that his explanation yesterday is exactly what happened. I think that we should, or that I should, accept this resignation and I have suggested that the minister be replaced by Luis Atienza, who is now working at the General Secretariat for Energy; he knows the ministry well, having worked with Pedro Solbes while Pedro Solbes was minister. I remain with the question of political responsibility. In the Rubio affair, Carlos Solchaga has tendered his resignation as president of the socialist parliamentary group and also the resignation of his seat in the Congress of Deputies, representing Navarre. In this case, as is also obvious, I wish to thank Mr. Carlos Solchaga for the prodigious work that he has carried out in all the posts of political responsibility that he has occupied. He has done so effectively, with total dedication, and, in my judgement, with laudable integrity in every way. He is, then, capable, as any of us are, of making the occasional mistake, but he has made this gesture, accepting political responsibility in a role -- one in the parliamentary group -- that has nothing to do with the role he exercised before as minister of economy and finance. He has done so seeking to register above all the significance of being able to help the party and help the government in this situation, that, as I admitted at the beginning, is a situation of serious difficulty, which therefore calls for serious measures to be taken. The filling of that vacant post is not my responsibility, but rather that of the party's executive and the parliamentary group, and in my view it will be filled immediately. So here we have a number of the members of the government team or the parliamentary team accepting political responsibility, a degree of political responsibility that probably exceeds what might be demanded in any democracy, but that is perhaps made advisable -- and I am grateful for that reason -- by the climate that our country is experiencing. As I do not want this introduction to be too long -- I do not want to turn it into a speech -- I will repeat, because I want it to be perfectly clear, that I respect, particularly in certain cases, those people who think that the prime minister ought to resign. I do not share their opinion. In some cases, I repeat, the call for my resignation may have good intentions or foundations and I therefore do not question them. In other cases they are part of a political struggle that disregards such important factors as political stability. I know that the issue of whether or not the government is going to face a vote of no confidence is also being discussed. I want to tell you that I do not exclude this. However, according to the Constitution, a no-confidence vote happens when there is proof that there is a lack of parliamentary support. However, regarding the decision to go ahead with a rigorous investigation of the outstanding corruption cases, regarding the decision to forge ahead with the policies that are proving themselves efficient in bringing us out of the economic crisis, in restructuring the labor market and other structural reforms, I can assure you right now, this afternoon, that we still have parliamentary support. The main one-party support is of course that of the Socialist party, the socialist group, with the seats it has. However, I spoke with Mr. Pujol, the president of Convergence and Union, and he repeated his will to maintain this support and this stability. I also had the opportunity to briefly speak to Mr. Arzallus [president of the Basque Nationalist Party]. He says he does now want to enter into a game that could have destabilizing consequences either. Consequently, I think that the stability of our country is very important at this key time for getting over the economic crisis. My aim is consequently a firm will to forge ahead in this twofold direction: I repeat, to clarify the issues at stake and to get over the situation that our economy is going through -- fortunately all the data and all the impartial observers agree that it is getting better.
