Defense Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said the dispatch of the weapons will, however, be implemented after the UN approval. Presently, the weapons used by Malbatt members are meant only for self-defense and not for combat purposes. However, if the situation changes for the worse, the government will not hesitate to send more sophisticated weapons to its troops in Bosnia. He also criticized the Serbs for detaining 18 UN peacekeeping troops in an area not far from Sarajevo on Thursday [14 April]. Speaking after he attended a ceremony to present literary awards in Kuala Lumpur, the minister said even though Malbatt members risk their lives in Bosnia, they are fearless in carrying out their duty. He added that Malbatt members will continue to serve in Bosnia under the UN peacekeeping banner because local people welcome their presence. He stressed that even though Malaysia is unhappy with the UN stand against the Serbs, it hopes that the world community will not bow to the Serbian demands.
