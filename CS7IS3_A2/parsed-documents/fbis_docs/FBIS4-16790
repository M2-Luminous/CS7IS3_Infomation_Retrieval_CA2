FBIS4-16790 "drsov076_b_94038" FBIS-SOV-94-076 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Military & Nuclear Issues Shortage of Draftees Expected Shortage of Draftees Expected LD2004082294 Moscow INTERFAX in English 0551 GMT 20 Apr 94 LD2004082294 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] There will be a big shortage of draftees in the Russian army this spring. Only about 216,000 young men will be drafted, although the demand of the armed forces is 700,000. The draft and allocation to units will be completed by July 1, Commander of the Main Organizational and Mobilization Board of the Russian Armed Forces' General Headquarters General Vitaliy Bologov told INTERFAX on Tuesday. He said that the shortage in the army is caused by the fact that many young men have the right to postpone their service, as well as by the worsening of draftees' health condition. The General noted that in the spring the armed forces can draft only 27 percent of available "mobilization resources." He also said that in other countries the figure is 50 to 75 percent. Bologov noted that the Defense Ministry will suggest that parliament introduce amendments in the near future to the laws on military service, on defense and some others in order to reduce the number of privileges and delays for draftees. Commenting on the Russian president's decree on draft of citizens born in 1967-1976, Bologov noted that according to the Constitution of the country, a young man not older than 27 can be drafted to the army. Bologov said that the autumn draft of 1993 was fulfilled to 90.6 percent. He said that of more than 500,00 citizens 480,000 were sent to serve in the army. The General added that 320,000 draftees graduated from secondary professional-technical schools.
