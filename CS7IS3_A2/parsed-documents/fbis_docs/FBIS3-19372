The idea of containment itself is, of course, nothing new. First proposed by George F. Kennan back in 1947 -- then U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union -- in a Foreign Affairs article he wrote under the pseudonym "Mr. X" ("The Sources of Soviet Conduct"), the concept of "containment" was originally meant to restrain, isolate and ultimately weaken the Soviet Union through constant political and economic pressures. Containment, for the following 47 years, remained the backbone of U.S. foreign policy vis-a-vis the Communist Bloc, all the way down to the Reagan administration. The dissolution of the USSR in 1989 is regarded by some as the ultimate victory of the containment policy. There are many in the conservative camp who believe that the tight military containment forced upon the Soviet Union by Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) program was the straw that broke Moscow's back. But a recent study by Richard Ned Lebow and Janice Gross Stein published in The Atlantic Monthly (February 1994) suggests otherwise. The authors claim that the Soviet Union's defense budget did not rise or fall in response to U.S. military spending in the 1980s. They think Gorbachev decided to throw in the towel despite the Reagan buildup and SDI. Thus, further research seems to be needed to ascertain empirically if containment indeed was the prime reason why the USSR collapsed, i.e. if containment really worked. Containment Is Out, Dual Containment Is In "Partnership for Peace" has now replaced containment in dealing with the new Russian Federation, but the policy of containment has reemerged in a new policy area -- the Middle East. As first formulated on May 18, 1993 by Martin Indyk, the special assistant to President Clinton for Near East and South Asian Affairs, in a speech he gave at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, "dual containment" envisions the containment of Iran and Iraq simultaneously to secure the chief U.S. national interest in the Gulf -- i.e. free flow of oil at a reasonable and stable price. One can argue that dual containment is not new either. Ten years of war between Iran and Iraq crippled both countries simultaneously. And by selling arms to both sides, the United States helped Iran and Iraq, in effect, contain each other. Yet, what was a de facto dual containment did not become an overt U.S. policy until Iran and Iraq pushed the pause button in their war of attrition and turned their lethal attention onto their neighbors. In a recent article in Foreign Affairs (March/April 1994), Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security advisor, gave the concept his official blessings by presenting it as the only realistic way of coping with such "backlash states" as North Korea, Iran, Iraq and Libya. "The basic purpose (of dual containment) is to counter the hostility of both Baghdad and Tehran," Lake says. "In Saddam Husayn's regime, Washington faces an aggressive, modernist, secular avarice; in Iran, it is challenged by a theocratic regime with a sense of cultural and political destiny and abiding antagonism toward the United States.... (Iran) is the foremost sponsor of terrorism and assassination worldwide.... The most effective message (to Iran) is a consistent one: No normal relations until these actions end." Yet dual containment has its own internal contradictions. First of all, as pointed out by Professor F. Gregory Gause III of Columbia University, the United States paradoxically needs Iran's help to contain Iraq and Iraq's help to contain Iran. The Shiite opposition groups in Iraq, like al-Da'wah, are Iranian time-bombs that can go off if Iraq gets too weak. So Iraq cannot be "over contained." But, again, if the power balance gets tilted too much against Tehran, then radical factions like Hezbollah would get a blank check for stepping up terrorist activities and would damage the substantial business interests the U.S. oil and aircraft companies (e.g. Boeing) have in Iran. The second weak point of this line of thinking, as Indyk himself also recognizes, is the fact that dual containment -- just like the anti-USSR containment -- has to be "multilateral" in nature. The support of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states is crucial yet problematic. GCC states like Bahrain, Qatar and Oman, for example, insist that Iraq's territorial integrity must be protected at all costs because an unchecked Iran is as great a threat for the Arab monarchies as Saddam's tanks. Turkey, in this regard, occupies a curious position on the U.S. State Department's chessboard. Turkey by now made it abundantly clear that it does not want to contribute to the containment of Iraq because the U.N. embargo hurts Ankara more than it does Baghdad. Both Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin in their recent visits to Washington made it clear that, if it were up to Turkey, it would be back to business as usual with Iraq, and that is, of course, not the best way to contain anybody. The recent warm overtures made by Iran to Turkey, as reported in the TURKISH DAILY NEWS by Adnan Caglayan, also makes it clear that if the United States wants to contain Iran, seeking Ankara's voluntary cooperation is probably not the most efficient way to attain it since, for Ankara, stopping the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] is much more vital an issue than making sure Tehran or Baghdad never get nuclear weapons -- an American concern. In this context, it is curious that the party that contributes to the containment of both Iraq and Iran by jeopardizing their ties with Turkey is the PKK, which the United States officially labeled a terrorist organization. The oil pipeline between Iraq and Turkey that Ciller wants to keep open, for example, has been sabotaged three times within the last six months by the PKK. By turning the buffer border zones between Turkey, Iran and Iraq into an uninhabitable no-man's-land, the PKK inadvertently created the conditions of isolation that contribute to the containment of both Iraq and Iran. One can argue that by evacuating over 700 villages in the Southeast, the Turkish security forces contributed indirectly to the dual containment of Iran and Iraq as well. Washington's "take-no-prisoners" approach toward Baghdad and Tehran precludes Turkey from developing normal ties with Iraq and Iran. Turkey, spending 6 percent of its Gross National Product to combat the PKK (according to official figures), is not in a position to champion dual containment by hardening its already-fragile relations with Iran and Iraq. But the United States can probably do better, especially in the case of Iran. By normalizing its trade relations with Vietnam, and continuing to treat China as a Most Favored Nation despite China's embarrassing human rights record, the United States has already shown that it can be quite pragmatic when it wants to in its dealings with adversarial nations. Showing that sort of flexibility will free Turkey's policy planners to go ahead with normalizing their relations with both Iran and Iraq. Otherwise, the PKK will continue to be Washington's best friend in the region, creating an increasingly volatile southeastern buffer area that will end up "containing" Turkey more than it does Iran or Iraq.
