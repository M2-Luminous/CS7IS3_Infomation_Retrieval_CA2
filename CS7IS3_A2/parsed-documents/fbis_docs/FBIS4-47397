Liquid-phase triester approach yielded dimers and tetramers in millimolar quantities and octamers at the 0.1 mmolar level. Solid-phase approach on polyethelene glycol support with thioamidite reagent provided the octanucleotide dithioates (T[.sub]8[/](S[.sub]2[/]) and C[.sub]7[/]T(S[.sub]2[/]) in yields of 0.02 and 0.12 millimoles, respectively. The products of solid-phase synthesis were purified by a novel method including cleavage of the protected oligonucleotides from the polymeric carrier, adsorption chromatography on silica gel, complete removal of protective groups and, finally, reverse-phase chromatography on silica gel C[.sub]18[/].
