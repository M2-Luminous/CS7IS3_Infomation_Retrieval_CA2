FBIS3-41006 "jptac001__l94034" JPRS-TAC-94-001-L Document Type:JPRS Document Title:Arms Control 22 February 1994 CENTRAL EURASIA RUSSIA TV Program Details Nuclear Missile Deactivation Process LD3001184394 LD3001184394 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First Channel Network in Russian at 0700 GMT on 30 January a 29-minute Test Range program devoted to nuclear disarmament. Reception is good. The first segment is a brief satirical look at problems in the military. In particular, drug abuse in the Army is noted. An increase from 3,000 addicts in 1991 to over 9,000 in 1992 is noted. The second segment of the show is of an undated three-minute interview between Air Marshal Yevgenniy Shaposhnikov and military commentator Aleksandr Zhilin. The interview covers the situation in the Crimea. Zhilin suggests that the Crimea may become a Karabakh between Russia and Ukraine. Shaposhnikov asks if the whole Black Sea Fleet, however glorious and grand, is worth creating a bloody situation between two great, fraternal peoples, linked together by centuries. He then notes that there will be no fighting between Russia and Ukraine. He says if someone thinks there will be, then that person should be put away somewhere safe, where he can rest with his Napoleonic visions. The third segment deals with implementing provisions of the START treaties. Uragan transporters, fitted with specialized equipment, are seen arriving at the site of one or more missile shafts. Military personnel are seen putting on protective clothing. There is a brief interview with an engineer familiar with the deactivation process. The process is described as a closed system, preventing any contact between fuel components in the missile and the atmosphere; an operation that guarantees ecological safety. Footage from a helicopter over a testing range is shown next. Assorted debris from explosions or launchings is shown. A narrator recalls that Russia is ill-equipped to either scrap its missiles, let alone clean up the single testing range of its strategic missile troops, which occupies an area of 175,000 hectares. During a brief interview with a junior officer, it is stated that 16,000 tonnes of detachable parts have accumulated from falls over the range during 35 years of its existence. The officer says four operations are now under way: 1) to reduce the guaranteed residue in the fuel supplies in missile boosters and to reduce the number of component fall areas; 2) to assess ecological situation in fall areas; 3) to clear up the fall areas; and 4) to keep the local population informed. Dangers that Russia faces from aging nuclear weapons is highlighted next: over 30 percent of Russian warheads on standby will be in a dangerous condition in two years' time. Footage of the (?Surovatikha) deactivation base is next shown. The camera pans around parked missiles which appear to be encased in tubular containers. An announcer notes that the Pebonzhur and Surovatikha facilities are the first Russian bases for liquidating intercontinental missiles. The liquidation process is detailed next. Each SS-17 or SS-18 missile is first cleaned of dangerous fuel components, then painstakingly divided into separate fragments. The base can liquidate over 40 heavy missiles a year, freeing up to 1,000 tonnes of expensive metals and alloys for industry. Past methods of liquidation--via explosions--are noted. The problem of funding for new more efficient bases is mentioned. Russian intentions to create a missile based on the SS-25 are next described. It is stated that this new missile will be more vulnerable than the SS-18 as it will not be able to release up to 1,000 false targets to fool enemy antimissile defenses. Fiscal problems are again mentioned as an impediment in the design process. The 29-minute program ends with the narrator expressing his hope for world nuclear disarmament.
