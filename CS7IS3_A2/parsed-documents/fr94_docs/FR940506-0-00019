Order No. 563&hyph;A Order on Rehearing Issued May 2, 1994. I. Introduction In Order No. 563, 1 the Commission adopted a final rule requiring the standardization of information relating to transportation of natural gas across the interstate pipeline grid. The standards adopted by the Commission reflected the consensus agreements reached by the natural gas industry through a series of informal conferences established by the Commission. Under these standards, pipelines will have to provide access to the required information both on their Electronic Bulletin Boards (EBBS) and through files which users can download from the pipelines' computers to their own computers. Pipelines are required to implement the requirements of this rule by June 1, 1994, except for the requirements regarding a common code for gas transaction points which are to be implemented by November 1, 1994. 1 Standards For Electronic Bulletin Boards Required Under Part 284 Of The Commission's Regulations, Order No. 563, 59 FR 516 (Jan. 5, 1994), III FERC Stats. & Regs.
