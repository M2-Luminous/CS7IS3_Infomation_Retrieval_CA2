FR940511-1-00112 FR940511-1-00016 Section 3833.0&hyph;5␣Definitions. The definitions section would be amended by revising the definitions of ``owner,'' ``proper BLM office,'' ``file or filed,'' ``filing year,'' ``rental fee,'' and ``small miner,'' and adding definitions of ``maintenance fee,'' ``location fee,'' ``related party,'' and ``control,'' new terms introduced in the Act. Also added are definitions of ``forfeiture,'' ``returnable,'' and ``refundable.'' The rule would define ``forfeiture'' as it pertains to mining claims or sites under section 314 of FLPMA, and the acts of October 5, 1992, and August 10, 1993. The U.S. Supreme Court, in United States v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84 (1985), determined that the term ``abandonment'' as used in FLPMA was equivalent to ``forfeiture.'' The definition of ``owner'' would be amended to make it clear that ownership of a mining claim is determined by State and Federal law, and that the owner's current address of record is required to be stated on all instruments recorded or filed with the BLM under this subpart. The definition of ``proper BLM office'' would be amended to add the Northern District Offices Records and Public Information Unit in Fairbanks, Alaska, as a proper recording office for mining claim instruments in Alaska, in addition to the office in Anchorage. The definition of ``file or filed'' would be amended to apply the postmark rule to rental and maintenance fees, to the filing of waiver statements by qualified small miners, and new locations or certificates of location. The definition of ``filing year'' would be amended by substituting the term ``filing period,'' and divided to define the filing dates for fees or exemptions under the Act. The definition of ``rental fee'' would be amended to remove language pertaining to the rental fee required by the Act of October 5, 1992, which is no longer necessary. The definition of ``nonrefundable'' would be removed, and a new section 3833.1&hyph;8 would be added to the regulations providing for the refund of maintenance and location fees as well as rental fees under certain circumstances, in order to conform to the Act, and further clarifying under what conditions a refund may be obtained. Section 3833.0&hyph;9␣Information collection. This section would be amended to add the Acts of April 16, 1993, and August 10, 1993, to the authorities. Section 3833.1&hyph;2␣Recordation of mining claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites located after October 21, 1976. This section would be amended by adding a new paragraph (c) to explain the requirements of the Act of April 16, 1993 (107 Stat. 60), which amended the SRHA as it pertains to the location of mining claims. The Act of April 16, 1993, places additional requirements for approval of mineral operations on Stockraising Homestead lands and for additional bonding to protect the surface owner from the effects of mining operations. These additional requirements will be covered by another proposed rule to amend 43 CFR subpart 3814. Section 3833.1&hyph;3␣Service charges, rental fees, maintenance fees, and location fees; form of remittance and acceptance. This section is amended to add the maintenance and location fees, and restructured to clarify the payment-for-services policy with respect to mining claim documents, filings, and fees. Section 3833.1&hyph;4␣Service charges and location fees. This section is amended to add the maintenance and location fees into the appropriate paragraphs, and is reorganized for clarity. Section 3833.1&hyph;5␣Rental fees and maintenance fees. This section is amended to add the maintenance fees to the existing rental fees, and to state when and under what circumstances each is due and payable. A new paragraph (g) is added to allow an exempted mining claim, if transferred to a party not entitled to a waiver, to have the rental or maintenance fee otherwise owed on the mining claim paid by the transferee at the time of recording the transfer pursuant to 3833.3 of this title. A new paragraph (h) is added to implement section 10105(c) of the Act of August 10, 1993. This section of the Act requires that the maintenance fee and location fee be adjusted every five years, or allows adjustments to be made sooner if the Secretary deems it reasonable, based upon any changes in the Consumer Price Index. Notice of any change is required to be given by July 1st of any year, with the new fee due by August 31st of that same year. A new paragraph (i) is added to state that the $100 annual maintenance fee applies to all mill and tunnel sites, and that a waiver of payment of the fee for mill and tunnel sites may be obtained under special circumstances. Section 3833.1&hyph;6␣Maintenance fee waiver qualifications under the Act of August 10, 1993_Applicable from 12 O'clock noon on September 1, 1993, until 12 O'clock noon September 1, 1998. This section would be retitled and revised to identify the conditions under which a waiver of payment of the maintenance fees under the Act may be obtained.
