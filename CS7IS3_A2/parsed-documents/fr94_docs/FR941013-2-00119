ACTION: Notice of Public Hearing on Addition to Comprehensive Plan. The Susquehanna River Basin Commission will hold a public hearing in conjunction with its regular meeting on November 10, 1994 at the Commission's Headquarters Building, 1721 N. Front Street, Harrisburg, Pa. beginning at 8:30 a.m. This hearing will be for the purpose of receiving public comments on the proposed inclusion of the ``Chesapeake Bay Policy for the Introduction of Non-Indigenous Aquatic Species'' in the Commission's Comprehensive Plan for Management and Development of the Water Resources of the Susquehanna River Basin.'' This policy, which was adopted in November 1993 by five jurisdictions with waters draining to the Chesapeake and the Chesapeake Bay Commission, opposes the first-time introduction of any non-indigenous aquatic species into the unconfined waters of the Chesapeake and its tributaries for any reason unless environmental and economic evaluations are conducted and reviewed in order to ensure that risks associated with the first-time introductions are acceptably low. Written comments will also be accepted and made a part of the hearing record. Copies of the entire policy statement may be obtained upon request to the Commission at 1721 N. Front Street, Harrisburg, Pa. 17102&hyph;2391; 717&hyph;238&hyph;0423. Written comments may be submitted to and further information obtained from Richard A. Cairo, General Counsel/Secretary at the same address and phone number. Dated: October 4, 1994. Paul O. Swartz, Executive Director.
