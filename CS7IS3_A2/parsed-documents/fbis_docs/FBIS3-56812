Comparatively large forces have been put into action near Mardakert. There, the Azerbaijanis are using all types of artillery, almost 20 tanks, and other armored cars. According to reports from the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army headquarters, by noon the Karabakh subunits managed to contain the enemy's pressure in all directions. The Karabakh fighters witnessed an hour-long clash between two Azerbaijani battalions at the southeastern sector of the front this morning. The Karabakh side still has no information on the reason for the internal armed clash. As to the situation on Armenia's borders, the relative calm there for the last two days was disrupted last night. Fire was opened on the defensive positions around Yeraskhavan and Sevakavan in Araratskiy Rayon from Nakhichevan at 2125 for half an hour. The Armenian Defense Ministry press service reported that there were no casualties. Our border guards refrained from retaliating. No serious incidents were recorded today in the border regions of the Republic.
