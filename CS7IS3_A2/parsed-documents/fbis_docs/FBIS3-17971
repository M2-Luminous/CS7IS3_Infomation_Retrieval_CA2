According to the appeal, the actual aim of personal vouchers is "to strip us of national property and of such social guarantees as the right to work, rest, happy childhood, adequate care in old age, free medical care, and housing." The authors of the document believe that the project of issuing vouchers is "the final stage of transforming the socialist socioeconomic system into a capitalist one, which entails such inevitable consequences for working people as poverty, absence of rights, unemployment and diseases, humiliation, and the tragedy of colonial dependence." The DSPS Republican Council calls upon the Belarusian Supreme Soviet to reject privatization and offers another way to overcome the crisis. In particular, it suggests that DSPS candidates be elected to the legislature and local soviets; and that the constitution adopted against people's will, be rescinded.
