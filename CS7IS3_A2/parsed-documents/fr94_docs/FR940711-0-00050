FR940711-0-00050 FR940711-0-00012 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;15&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8959; AD 94&hyph;14&hyph;07] Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Aircraft Limited Model 4101 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes, that requires modification of the mounting structure of the elevator controls on the rear pressure bulkhead. This amendment is prompted by the results of a structural analysis which indicate that certain structure in the elevator control system may be subject to deformation when maximum load is exerted by the pilot(s) in the event of a jam in the elevator control cables. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent reduced controllability of the airplane due to structural deformation in the elevator control system. DATES: Effective August 10, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Jetstream Aircraft, Incorporated, P.O. Box 16029, Dulles International Airport, Washington, DC 20041&hyph;6029. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Schroeder, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2148; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes was published in the Federal Register on March 15, 1994 (59 FR 11947). That action proposed to require modification of the mounting structure of the elevator control components on the rear pressure bulkhead. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. The FAA estimates that 8 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 16.5 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be provided at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $7,260, or $907.50 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .
