After that, Israel bombed some buildings in Hebron, in defiance of the Security Council resolution and the world community. How will the confrontation with Israel end? [Qaddumi] I do not believe that ending the confrontation with Israel is a simple matter. Israel continues to occupy Palestinian land. Ending the occupation will end the confrontation. Without ending the Israeli occupation, the confrontation with Israel will continue using all means. Unfortunately, this community has proved to be one that harbors rancor toward the Palestinians and the Arabs. [Former Israeli Foreign Minister] Abba Eban said this in a lecture he delivered at George Washington [as heard], when he said that it is now the duty of Israel to restore its democratic nature, which it claimed to have had. [Hijazi] What is the mechanism for implementing the Security Council resolution? [Qaddumi] The Security Council is responsible for implementing its own resolution. It urged the cosponsors of the peace conference to use all methods to provide protection for and ensure the safety of the Palestinian civilians inside the occupied territories. Among these measures is the dispatch of international troops, the disarming of settlers, and the adoption of other measures, such as removing the Israelis from Hebron. This is because their presence creates friction and constitutes a provocative act intended to perpetuate such incidents. [Hijazi] Following the Hebron massacre, Israel announced its intention to assemble settlers in settlements close to each other and away from Palestinians in the occupied territories. Do you think Israel is serious about this? [Qaddumi] Israel is now divided. We know very well that there are people who want to resolve the problem, but Yitzhaq Rabin in particular is a man who indeed does not want peace. He has postponed the withdrawal and he does not honor anything that he says, unfortunately. He says that these deadlines are not sacred. We have cautioned the United States and Israel about the consequences of these actions, but the Israeli Army put pressure on Rabin. This became clear during the talks held in Cairo, Davos, Oslo. Yitzhaq Rabin does not want to honor this agreement. He says something but does not honor it. He is acting in collusion with the Army people and with the settlers. I believe that continuing this policy will finish off the peace process. Had the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho not been delayed, these incidents would not have happened. Rabin has given the opposition more cards to strengthen its position, and here are the results, but they will fall on Rabin's head, God willing.
