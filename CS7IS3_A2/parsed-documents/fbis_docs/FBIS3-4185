A spokesman from the DPRK's General Bureau of Atomic Energy stressed that the nuclear inspections his country received in early March "had been fully proved the peaceful aim of the DPRK's nuclear program." But, the IAEA's Board of Governors adopted a resolution on March 21, claiming that its inspections over the DPRK's suspected nuclear facilities early this month could not prove whether it was using its nuclear material for military purposes or not. It also threatened to refer the DPRK nuclear dispute to the United Nations Security Council. Today's official newspaper "NODONG SINMUN" also quoted the spokesman as saying that the DPRK had no obligation to accept IAEA's regular or irregular inspections because it had promised not to withdraw from the international Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty at present. Under such special conditions, the DPRK could only accept inspections aimed at safeguarding the consistency of its nuclear security, the spokesman added. He also criticized the IAEA Secretariat for its unfair stance towards DPRK's nuclear development program, demanding that the Secretariat should suspend the resolution based on what he described as its "wrong appraisal." The newspaper also warned that the DPRK would pull out of the international Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in the end if the United States kept pressuring it over the nuclear issue.
