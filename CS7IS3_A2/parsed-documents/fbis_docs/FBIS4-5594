FBIS4-5594 "dreas070_d_94026" FBIS-EAS-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 South Korea Foreign Ministry Modifies Structure; Cuts Jobs Foreign Ministry Modifies Structure; Cuts Jobs SK1104093894 Seoul YONHAP in English 0819 GMT 11 Apr 94 SK1104093894 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 11 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry has announced an internal reorganization, with 17 positions at the special grade 1 (vice minister-level) downgraded to lower levels and six divisions closed down. The plan was approved by the cabinet as part of the government's overall strategy on streamlining. Ministry officials said the restructuring does away with the controversial attempt to amend the Diplomat Employment Law, which initially envisioned changing the retirement age and lowering the limit in service years to rectify a promotion bottleneck. The 17 special grade 1 positions will be demoted over the next three to five years. Five of the positions will be distributed to special grade 2, seven to grade 1 and another five to grade 2. Officials said this finally reshapes the structure of the number of officials -- from an urn to the ideal pyramid. The Ministry earlier planned to change its employment law to achieve this effect, but the move is no longer necessary since the reorganization will naturally lower the retirement age and service years. The division reorganization affects Middle East Division I and II, which are being merged. Africa Division I and II, Cultural Affairs Division I and II, Overseas Residents Division I and II, and Passport Division I and II are all being merged into single divisions. The reduction, the officials noted, will change the past practice where nearly every employee served as division chief, a necessity before promotion to director-general. Now there will be employees who bypass the division chief position, the officials said. While shedding six divisions, the Ministry adds a new division on disarmament and atomic energy. The new division falls under the supervision of the United Nations Bureau, which succeeds the current International Organizations Bureau. The present Asian Affairs Bureau is being renamed the Asia- Pacific Affairs Bureau, while the Middle East and African Affairs Bureau will be called the Western Asia and African Affairs Bureau by taking over operations in Southeast Asia. U.N. Division I, U.N. Division II and International Organization Division will be known as U.N. Policy Division, Human Rights Division and U.N. Economic Affairs Division. Moving to strengthen its environment policy, the Ministry has separated the environment into an independent division from technology. In addition, 12 attaches from eight other ministries were recalled to their headquarters, the officials said.
