The circular, co-issued by the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC), the Ministry of Public Health and China National Light Industry Council, demands that on no account should any non-iodized salt or inferior iodized salt be allowed to enter the salt markets in the iodine deficient areas. Severe penalties will be assessed to those who transport or sell the above-mentioned salt to the endemic regions. To ensure a sound administration of the state's salt markets, which have shown some disorder in parts of the country, the government will issue new permits to the enterprises which are qualified for salt production or wholesale transaction of salt products. The SAIC has set April 30 as the deadline for the salt enterprises to renew their registrations. According to Yin Dakui, vice-minister of public health, China is one of the countries in the world with severe IDD prevalence. Yin said that the most effective way to eliminate IDD is the constant consumption of iodized salt, which is also China's long-term strategy to prevent such endemic diseases. According to the vice-minister, the government has set the goal to make all salt in China iodized by 1996 and to eliminate IDD nationwide by the year 2000. Yin noted that marked progress has already been achieved in the prevention and treatment of IDD since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. According to him, a total of 385 institutes for IDD control have been set up nationwide in the past decades. And with the preventive measures and treatment over many years, the original 35 million patients with endemic goiter in the country have been reduced to 7 million and the new occurrence of endemic cretinism has been controlled.
