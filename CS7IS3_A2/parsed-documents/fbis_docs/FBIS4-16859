Assurances for favorable opportunities for foreign investment were made by Rashit Kodyrov, chief of the department for work with international financial organisations and banks at the Turkmenian Cabinet of Ministers. He spoke on Tuesday at a briefing in St. Petersburg during an annual meeting of the board of governors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Turkmenia is a major attraction to foreign investment and capital, Kodyrov said. The purpose of investment is the implementation of priority projects in oil and gas extraction, transport infrastructure, telecommunications, the agrarian sector. This work is preceded by international tenders that proved their commercial expedience and attractiveness on the example of the development of deposits on the Caspian shelf and in Kotu-Tepe. Jointly with large petrochemical firms Amoco, Shell, Chevron and others, joint ventures have been formed that intend to invest up to $100 million into the development of deposits. Much interest was shown in a report about plans for a gas pipeline to stretch from Turkmenia to Europe via Iran and Turkey. The volume of the deliveries of natural gas through that pipeline will be 25,000 million cubic meters a year. The Turkmenian government plans the construction of a railway to the border with Iran, of the last section of the Transasian line and of a number of highways. Experts believe that the Turkmenian programme "Ten Years of Prosperity" opens broad opportunities for investment to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and to other international financial institutions. The bank, specifically, intends to invest into the projects for the reconstruction of the port of Krasnovodsk, facilities of the textile industry, for the development of the hotel business in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] and in other cities.
