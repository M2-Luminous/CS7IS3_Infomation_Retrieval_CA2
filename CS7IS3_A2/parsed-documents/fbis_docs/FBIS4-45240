The teams carried out an operation against the occupants of the villa, which stands on four donums of land. The teams, who were armed with automatic firearms, surrounded the villa, the courtyard of which was sealed off by a high wall and barbed wire. The teams crawled to the building and established how many drug traffickers were inside. Then they went in. Under the command of Ismail Caliskan, director of the Directorate of Police Narcotics Department, they broke down the front door and stormed the building. They arrested the drug traffickers without giving them an opportunity to use their arms. The production center was on the ground floor. The teams discovered 60 kg of heroin and morphine base, three handguns, one of which was automatic, and a large quantity of ammunition in the attic.
