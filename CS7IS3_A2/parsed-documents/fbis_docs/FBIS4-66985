The importer of these coffins openly admitted that while he had been solicited to cooperate in drug smuggling, the plan had failed because he had not agreed. A Taiwan police source claims that antinarcotics police and prosecutors had been investigating this case of drugs concealed in imported coffins for two months, and that their intelligence was very accurate. This had included the substance of the plans and fundraising by the goods owners, and even shadowing and monitoring of meetings at the Taipei World Trade Hotel by a Taiwan goods owner, a Mr. Chiang [3068], with Hong Kong and Singaporean drug dealers. The antinarcotics officers even had hard information that a goods owner, a Mr. Wang [3769], had used a certain Miss Chang [1728] to send the money to Hong Kong. In the operation to shadow the truck carrying the container the other morning, the antinarcotics officers had acted to catch the offenders by arranging more than 10 shadowing vehicles on the highway, discovering that the drug ring had also sent out a "road-sweeping vehicle." The driver of a porsche running in the vicinity of the container truck had a long history of drug dealing, making the antinarcotics officers even more certain of his involvement. Who would have guessed that this whole drug shipment planning and coordination was a strategic operation by the drug dealing ring, using a live-troop drill to probe police strength, and to force the police to expose their shadowing operation. The Criminal Police Bureau cooperated with the Coastal Defense Command on 12 March 1994 to seize the container of coffins suspected of holding 500 kg of heroin smuggled from the mainland through Hong Kong to Taiwan. They went to Yungk'ang City to "open the coffins to find the drugs," but after six hours of intensive searching of 67 coffins, found no drugs. But the police had information provided by the merchant in charge of the imported container trade, Chiang X-chen [3068 X 3791], that a Hong Kong merchant had discussed with him the smuggling of drugs in coffins and farm products. Chiang X-chen indicated that while more than six months before, two Hong Kong traders, a Mr. Huang [7806] and a Mr. Chang [1728], had repeatedly discussed with him the smuggling of heroin through an import pipeline of coffins and farm products, he had not agreed.
