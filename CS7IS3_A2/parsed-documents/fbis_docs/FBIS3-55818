According to him, participants in the consultations agreed in principle that the nuclear arms deployed in Ukraine will be removed to Russia in exchange for compensation from Moscow. This circumstance made it possible to conduct a meeting between the Russian, American, and Ukrainian presidents on January 14 within the framework of the upcoming Russian-American summit. According to the ministry official, the plan worked out in Washington envisages that the nuclear arms to be removed from Ukraine will be deconcentrated in Russia. "Russian specialists will deconcentrate the enriched uranium of nuclear warheads, that is bring it to the level of uranium used as fuel," he said. "Russia will sell that fuel to the Americans, who are in control of almost all uranium markets. In addition, part of that uranium will be supplied to Ukraine as fuel for its nuclear power plants. In other words, Ukraine will get some compensation for the nuclear arms to be removed from its territory." This plan, the Russian diplomat pointed out, will be reflected in a special statement and a memorandum to be issued after the proposed meeting between the Russian, American, and Ukrainian presidents in Moscow. "This plan is to be supplemented with concrete figures, calculations, etc. But this is a purely technical issue to be resolved after the Moscow summit in the process of negotiations," he said. According to him, "it is essential that in Moscow Ukraine will indicate the exact date when no nuclear weapons will be left on its soil." The date in question will be known only by January 14, since the relevant negotiations are continuing. Nevertheless, this circumstance prompted the U.S. president to make changes in the itinerary of his trip," he said. According to preliminary plans, the official noted, in the course of his European tour President Clinton was to visit officially not only Moscow and Minsk, but also Kiev. "However, Ukraine's 'nuclear drift' and the Ukrainian parliament's failure to ratify the START-I treaty and the Lisbon Protocol to it in full (IF note: START-I was ratified, with numerous reservations, along with the Lisbon Protocol with the exception of Article 5, which obliged Ukraine to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a denuclearized state) nudged the Americans toward striking Kiev off their list. After the consultations in Washington the stick was replaced by a carrot - Bill Clinton will make a stop at Kiev's airport, if only for an hour," he said. According to the information available to Interfax, the program for the American president's state visit to Moscow has been fully coordinated; it will be published on Wednesday. However some details of the program became known to Interfax. Bill Clinton is expected to arrive in Moscow Wednesday evening (at about 22:00). He will not be accompanied by his wife; he will stay at the Radisson-Slavyanskaya Hotel. However on January 14, when Clinton's wife, Hillary, arrives in Moscow, the couple will move to the Kremlin, where the official residence of the American leader will be located. Russian-American top-level talks are scheduled for January 13 and 14. In addition, on January 14 the Russian and American presidents will be joined by their Ukrainian counterpart. In the evening of January 14, Yeltsin and Clinton are expected to give a news conference. In the morning of January 15, after the farewell ceremony to be held in the Kremlin, the U.S. president will leave for Minsk to hold talks with the leadership of Belarus.
