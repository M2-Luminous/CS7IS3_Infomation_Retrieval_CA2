Working as Russia's deputy premier, first deputy premier and then acting premier, I tried to do my best to enable Russia's economy to stand on its feet as soon as possible, to make it possible for the painful period of transition to be overcome promptly. Thanks to the courage and patience of our compatriots, thanks to your resolve and consistency, we managed to not only avoid social and economic cataclysms that are shaking many former Soviet republics, but even pave the way for the future revival of our country. "The conditions of our work in the government have never been ideal. You are well aware of the fact that we failed to accomplish much as a result of unceasing pressure on the part of the conservative political circles, not because of objective circumstances. Last September, when agreeing to rejoin the government, I realized that, while being responsible for economic reforms in the eyes of society, I will have only limited levers of influence on the economic situation. Nevertheless I hoped that the realization of our common responsibility for the country will make it possible for the government, even if it consisted of people of differing outlooks, to rally behind the president and follow a policy aimed at stabilizing the economy and preventing a catastrophe. Unfortunately, more and more decisions, in preparing which I took no part, and even categorically objected to, have been taken of late. I'll make only two examples. An inter-bank agreement on the unification of monetary systems has been signed between Russia and Belarus. Such unification is possible only if it is carefully prepared and if a mechanism of control protecting Russia's interests is created. However, the measures envisaged in the agreement will only reproduce chaos in the monetary sphere at the expense of Russian citizens' real incomes. The implementation of this decision will lead to a situation whereby the minimal salary and pension in Belarus will exceed the minimal salary and pension in Russia. We are not rich enough to sacrifice the welfare of the Russian citizens to political considerations. I objected to this decision, but my protests fell on deaf ears. Neither is it possible to support the decision to build a new parliament center costing about $500 Mn. This sum far exceeds the resources allocated with great difficulty in 1993 for military conversion and is five time greater than the federal spending on culture and art. This sum equals one fifth of last year's social spending. This destructive decisions was taken without my knowledge and despite my resolute objections. Given this, it will be difficult for me to justify the rigid policy of curtailing expenses on science, culture, education and environmental protection. True, vitally important reforms involve inevitable outlays, but they have nothing to do with the price of thoughtless and hasty decisions. Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich, I cannot stay in the government and at once oppose it. Neither can I be responsible for reforms without having an opportunity to prevent actions similar to the ones I have mentioned or levers for implementing an economic policy which I am sure is correct. Therefore, to my great regret, I have to turn down the post of the Russian government's first vice chairman offered to me. I assure you, however, that I will firmly support You and Your policy of reforms.
