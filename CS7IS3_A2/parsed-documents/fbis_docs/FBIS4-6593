FBIS4-6593 "dreas078_l_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-078 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 Philippines Senator Urges All-Out War Against Communists Senator Urges All-Out War Against Communists BK2204091794 Quezon City MALAYA in English 16 Apr 94 p 2 BK2204091794 Quezon City MALAYA English BFN [By Minnie Cadlina] [Text] Senator Ernesto Maceda (NPC-Nationalist People's Coalition) yesterday urged the government to resume an all-out war with the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army (CPP-NPA), who, he said, are not really interested in negotiating for peace. In pushing for the resumption of hostilities with the CPP-NPA, Maceda said it is time for the government to take a hardline position with the communist rebels since the peace talks have been dragging for two years now with no substantial agreements. "It has come to a point where we should ask whether we are getting anywhere with the peace process with the NPA," he said. Maceda, chairman of the crime committee, made the statement in reaction to a radio message of "Comrade Roger" Rosal commander of the Melito Glor Command, accusing President Ramos of "coddling criminals" in reference to Leopoldo "Comrade Hector" Mabilangan. He said Ramos should not let the accusation pass as he urged the president to order the deployment of six to eight battalions around Mt. Banahaw in the Sierra Madre mountain "to flush out" Rosal, who has admitted masterminding Mabilangan's killing. Mabilangan was sentenced to death by a "people's court" which found him guilty of involvement in kidnapping and carnapping activities. He said government should stop worrying about committing any act that would jeopardize the peace negotiation since even the communist rebels are not interested in pursuing the peace process. "I say we scrap it (peace negotiatian) and resume an all-out war with the NPA," he said. "They (CPP-NPA) have no public support anyway and they have become less dedicated in their ways. They have turned to banditry," he added. Asked if he was not worried about derailing the peace process, he said, "what is there to derail? There is nothing happening." It would be recalled that Maceda reportedly became a target of the NPA in 1989 for alleged corruption.
