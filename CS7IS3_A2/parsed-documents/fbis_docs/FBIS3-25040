Nine soldiers of this force have already been dismissed due to political activities. It is not yet known to which group or groups these soldiers belonged. [Begin correspondent Richard Newton recording] It is thought that the base of the National Peacekeeping force at De Brug outside Bloemfontein is a cauldron of dissension on the verge of boiling over. Some allege that language, ethnic, and political differences have led to a lack of cooperation. Repeated requests to visit the base, also requests to have interviews recorded, have been refused. A media day, however, has been arranged at the base for next week Thursday. The acting commander of the National Peacekeeping Force, Col. Fred Burger, responded to our question by fax, confirming that cooperation between the troops at the base had become a problem. He added, however, that soldiers from such diverse groups needed time to adapt. Col. Burger rejected rumors of racial tension and physical assaults among the troops, saying they were false. What is in fact true, he said, is that there is room for improvement regarding hygiene; that limited intimidation has been noted, and that more than 20 soldiers had requested to return to their units. The media visit to the base next week could help to eliminate some of the rumors. The commander of the peace force, Gen. Ramushwana, will nevertheless have his hands full when he takes over command next week. [end recording] The first group of voluntary military recruits after decades of military service today joined the South African Defense Force. Five thousand young men from all population groups reported at centers in Durban, Cape Town, Pretoria, and Johannesburg. A large group was turned away in Johannesburg. [Begin correspondent Nan Roux recording] Hundreds of young men began gathering in front of the gates at Nasrec [convention center] outside Johannesburg this morning. For many it was a waste of time, however. Only those with the right qualifications and documents were allowed through the gates. A very disconcerted group had to remain outside. Inside the gates, though, those with the right documents marched away in real military style for their first taste of the Defense Force. The recruits will be sent to bases in Pretoria and Bloemfontein, and to Potchefstroom and Heidelberg. After eight months of initial training, they will be able to join either the Defense Force's corps services or the Citizen Force. [end recording]
