In addition to the activity of the recently established contact group for Bosnia, comprised of high-ranking representatives from the United States, Russia, United Nations, and the European Union, attention should be given to last week's meeting of diplomatic heads from the United States, Russia, Great Britain, and France in Geneva, including a three-member delegation of the European Union which included the former, current, and future presiding members of this association from Belgium, Greece, and Germany. Judging by everything, at this meeting, the Bosnian hot potato was again passed into the hands of the Europeans, who, after all, lit the fire underneath it, but the Unites States has retained the cooking utensils and the spices. Representatives of the European Union did not hide their satisfaction with the fact that a consensus was reached on the territorial division of the former Bosnia- Herzegovina -- 51 percent for the Croat-Muslim federation and 49 percent for the Bosnian Serbs -- with the mighty ally across the ocean. Actually, this constitutes a return to its earlier plan. At the meeting of the seven ministers in Geneva, the warring sides were called upon to begin negotiations on a four month cease-fire within the next two weeks. On this occasion, it was established that the Bosnian conflict could not be solved militarily, but rather through negotiations. The agreement also envisaged the maintenance of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union within the internationally recognized borders. All of these positions have their flaws, regardless of the concepts behind them; they were called into question precisely by those who proposed them. Namely, it is known that official Washington quickly rushed to placate the powerful Islamic lobby by saying that it would not pressure the Muslims, but that it would rather attempt to compel them to be more realistic in their demands. The Russians, however, were given the far more thankless role of convincing the Serbs to accept the plan as a whole and all the details. Strange criteria for justice and chivalry. In the history of warfare so far, there is no record of the defeated side dictating terms to the victor, even going so far as to expand territories, which is what is being authorized for the Bosnian Muslims who started the brawl in the smoke-filled, Balkan tavern. It is certain that the diplomacy of unequal treatment of the warring sides is incapable of changing the situation on the ground in the direction of peace. It can only worsen it. There can be no doubt that such treatment has encouraged the Muslim leadership to insist on the war option, because it has perceived this as a green light for a new offensive against Serbian positions in central Bosnia, Posavina, and Podrinja, which is gaining momentum in full view of the UN forces and numerous observers. The latest Muslim offensive has made ridiculous the international media's lamentations of the allegedly dreadful fate of the poorly armed Bosnians which is what Alija's mojahedin are also called. The foreign press is proof that the arms embargo imposed on all the states in the region of the former Yugoslavia by the United Nations back in September of 1991 does not concern them. [Words indistinct] has recently informed its readership about a large shipment of arms for the Muslims in Bosnia that was flown into Zagreb Airport by an Iranian Jumbo Jet. Aware of the danger of armed conflicts flaring up if the Serbian Republic Army is forced to launch a counteroffensive, even the most loyal of U.S. allies in Europe are threatening to withdraw their blue helmets from the Bosnian vortex, and are sincerely -- or so we believe -- striving for a definite, peaceful end to the conflicts. [Word indistinct] also suits Russia, so that it can devote more attention to potential crisis flashpoints in its own country and in the immediate neighborhood, in the area of the former Soviet Union. Therefore, it is up to the United States to make the next move. Washington is expected to finally clearly warn its proteges in Bascarsija [part of Sarajevo] that by continuing the war, they cannot get more than they have been offered at the negotiating table.
