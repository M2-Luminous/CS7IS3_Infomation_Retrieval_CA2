Members of the presidential general staff arrested the man just a few steps from the multiple purpose room where the appointment was announced. The man's name is Miguel Angel Bernal Vargas and he was taken to the Attorney General's Office 7th Agency located at the Cuahtemoc Station. Bernal Vargas said he is a member of the General Secretariat of Safety and Roads, and that his mission was to an act as an ear in the event. He was disguised, sorry to say, wearing a jacket with many pockets, like the ones used by photographers and hunters. These jackets are useful as they can hold film and other supplies in all the pockets. That is the way this individual was disguised. Inasmuch as persons entering the hall were being searched, it was discovered this man was carrying a .38 caliber gun in a small bag. He was arrested and turned over to the 7th Police Station [as heard]. Mr. Lievano Sanchez, PRI secretary of information and propaganda, confirmed the arrest of this man, who claimed he was acting as an ear. This is a regrettable practice of some government offices and people, and even the Federal Army. They send individuals disguised as photographers to certain events so that they can prepare a detailed report on not only what was said, for example in a news conference, but also of the reactions, attitudes, and so forth. They prepare very special reports for certain people or certain offices. They simply carry a recorder or a photographer's jacket and are sent to these events. Sometimes, they carry a recorder and pose as radio reporters, other times, they carry a camera and pose as photographers. They mingle with the rest of the reporters and then go and present their private reports. Unfortunately, this is a method frequently used by government offices. In this case, who knows who sent this ear, but he must not be very intelligent because the ear was carrying a gun to cover an event of this type. This is unbelievable, truly unbelievable.
