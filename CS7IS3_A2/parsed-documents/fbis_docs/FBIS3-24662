Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-15FEB94-CROATIA-BOSNIA Croatia--Bosnia-Herzegovina Statements Suggest Scope of Zagreb's Intervention in Bosnia SUMMARY Zagreb has agreed under threat of sanctions to consider withdrawing forces it admits are present in border areas inside Bosnia-Herzegovina while continuing to deny that it has intervened in the Bosnian war. At the same time, some recent statements from Zagreb suggest that Croatia is more deeply involved in the Bosnian war than its leaders have previously admitted. END SUMMARY In the wake of a UN Security Council demand issued on 2 February that Croatia withdraw all elements of its army from Bosnia- Herzegovina--and having received warnings from the United States and from European Union of the possibility that it could be put under economic sanctions like Yugoslavia--Zagreb has promised to comply with the UN's ultimatum. At the same time, the government of President Franjo Tudjman has claimed that it is only minimally and indirectly involved in aiding the war efforts of the Bosnian Croats. Zagreb television, apparently attempting to downplay the Croatian government's implicit acknowledgment that Croatian Army (HV) units are present in Bosnia-Herzegovina, reported that Foreign Minister Mate Granic had sent a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali assuring him of Croatia's "readiness" to "reduce tensions" between the Croatian and Muslim sides" in the Bosnian war (Zagreb TV, 11 February). In a television interview the next day, Granic explained that HV units would withdraw from "border areas," but that Croatia would insist that the UN establish "control" over the Croat-Bosnian border (Zagreb TV, 12 February). At a 14 February UN Security Council session, Croatian Ambassador to the UN Mario Nobilo, without directly addressing the issue of the HV's intervention in Bosnia, reiterated Zagreb's willingness to cooperate with the Security Council. He stressed that the Croats hoped that the success of recent talks between the Croatian side and the Bosnian government would reduce the threat to Bosnian Croats (Zagreb TV, 15 February). Denials of Large-Scale Intervention Despite the announcement that it would comply with the Security Council's demand that it withdraw its forces from Bosnia, the Croatian government has continued to deny that its army units are fighting against Bosnian government forces. Insisting that troops arriving from Croatia to fight are volunteers of "Bosnian origin," the Croatian Council of Defense and Security, a body chaired by Tudjman, declared that "about 2,000 volunteer soldiers" had been "allowed" to leave the Croatian Army and "go to help their kin" in order "to protect them from aggression and ethnic cleansing." These soldiers "deployed" in Bosnia Croat units did "not engage in any operations to capture territories that belong to somebody else but only defended their centuries- old hearths." While the statement claimed that the "Croatian public has supported" those who went to fight in Bosnia, it did not elaborate on whether that support was material in nature (Zagreb radio, 5 February). At the same time, the Council of Defense and Security statement acknowledged that, according to the terms of an agreement between Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Tudjman signed in July 1992, some HV units are present on Bosnian territory. However, the statement insisted that "Croatian army units are deployed only in the border area" between Croatia and the Herzegovina region of Bosnia-Herzegovina "above Dubrovnik toward Stolac and the Neretva River" (Zagreb radio, 5 February). The statement did not specify which units nor how many soldiers were involved, but Stolac is about 20 kilometers from the Croatian border, while the Neretva valley stretches north from the border through Mostar, suggesting that the Croats may have adopted a loose definition of "border areas." Responding to the UN Security Council's demand that Croatia withdraw its forces from Bosnia, Croatian Ambassador to the UN Mario Nobilo, echoing recent remarks by Tudjman, insisted that the presence of these troops was justified on the basis of the July 1992 Izetbegovic-Tudjman agreement, adding that their removal would "seriously jeopardize the territorial integrity and security of Croatia" (Zagreb radio, 4 February and 11 January). Hints of Deeper Involvement Statements from other Croatian leaders suggest a more significant commitment of military resources to the Bosnian war than that acknowledged by the 5 February Council of Defense and Security statement. Croat leaders including Tudjman have hinted at the need for such support for the Bosnian Croats since fighting broke out between Serbs and Croats in northern Bosnia in March 1992, but have denied that Croatia provided direct aid: Bobetko. Croatian Army Chief of Staff General Janko Bobetko has made several statements that suggest a much higher level of support to the Bosnian Croats than the Croatian government has admitted. During a 29 December 1993 interview on Zagreb television Bobetko, claimed that "a large number" of Croats with roots in Bosnia-Herzegovina "are now defending Bosnia," adding that when the Yugoslav Chief of Staff Momcilo Perisic claims that there are 60,000 Croatian soldiers fighting in Bosnia- Herzegovina, "it seems he has a good computer and can count the heads." Bobetko maintained that it should be "no surprise" that there would be a large Croatian force in Bosnia because the Croats there are "being subjected to the kind of genocide experienced at Vukovar" and elsewhere within the territory of the Republic of Croatia. Bobetko asserted that "it is a fact" the aid to Bosnia "represents a big part of our"--presumably, the Ministry of Defense's--"expenditure." He insisted that the "Croatian people must accept" these expenditures "both politically and financially." Similarly, in a 31 January interview on Zagreb television, Bobetko referred to "thousands and thousands" of Croats born in Bosnia and currently living in Croatia who were affected by the war, asking rhetorically, "Who has got the right to forbid me or any Croat from Bosnia" the right to defend his family? Susak. Without referring specifically to sending troops to Bosnia, Defense Minister Gojko Susak has also suggested that Croatia has provided significant military aid to the Bosnian Croats. In a television interview he stated that "Croatia has helped . . . and it will do all it can to help" the Croats in Bosnia in the future (Zagreb TV, 28 December 1993). General From Zagreb The appointment of General Ante Roso as commander of the Bosnian Croat forces in November 1993 further suggests the degree to which the Croatian military has intervened in the Bosnian war and raises questions about the claimed origins of the "volunteers" who have purportedly returned to their native Bosnia-Herzegovina to serve in the Bosnian Croat forces. Roso, an emigre and former French Foreign Legion officer who returned to Croatia after independence and joined the Croatian army, was a prominent HV general before his switch to the Bosnian Croat army. He rose to prominence in the 1991 war in Croatia and played an important role in the January 1993 operation to take back the approaches to the Maslenica bridge, then held by the Serb separatists. A 24 November article in the Split weekly Nedjeljna Dalmacija asserted that, despite Roso's claim that his family is from Herzegovina, some claim" he is from Imotski, a town near the border with Herzegovina but within Croatian territory. Implications Croatia's reluctance to acknowledge the depth of its direct direct involvement in the Bosnian war suggests that it will try to evade full compliance with the UN Security Council's demand that Croatian forces withdraw from Bosnia. While wary of incurring economic sanctions, the Croatian government has repeatedly voiced its fear that the Croats of Bosnia are threatened with genocide and is unlikely to withdraw military support to the HVO and the so-called Republic of Herzeg-Bosna established by the Bosnian Croats. Like Belgrade, Zagreb is likely to continue to insist that it has no direct presence in Bosnia but merely lends political support to the efforts of its ethnic brothers across the border.
