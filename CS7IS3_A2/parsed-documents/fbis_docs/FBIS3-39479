What conflicts with the PPI still remain unresolved? [Segni] The strategy behind the Pact for Italy, the real reason for its existence, the strategy that prevails over the difficulties, is the formation of a moderate European force that is both liberal-democratic and reformist. In short, an anchorage for serious government. A "broad right wing," made up in reality of entities that are irreconcilable, has now joined the inconsistent left front and there is a greatly increased need for a credible force. [Caprara] The fact remains that you are quarreling over candidacies. Martinazzoli thinks it is unfair to lump together all those under investigation, and warns of "the harshness of purges." [Segni] I have never been an admirer of Khomeyni. It is a question of giving a little more, since the parties have lost their validity. Of course that calls for sacrifices at the human level, too. But they are necessary to restore credibility to politics. [Caprara] You have demanded all these sacrifices from the DC [Christian Democratic Party] left-wingers: [former DC Chairman] De Mita, [Interior Minister] Mancino, [Sicily Regional Secretary] Mattarella. Bodrato says: "They are using the moral issue to get rid of those who might end up on the right." Is that not a political decision? [Segni] That is an unfounded interpretation. [Caprara] Why are you objecting to people under investigation from other teams? [Segni] I am not making a personal issue of it and I am truly sorry that some people interpret it thus. [Caprara] Your opponents are talking about you and saying: "Why must we be `renewed' while he has been a parliamentarian for five legislative terms and is staying on?" [Segni] To tell the truth I have never pondered on the problem of parliamentary terms. In a phase of change, there must be a high level of renewal but also elements of continuity. However painful it may be, the problem is the appropriateness of certain candidacies. My place, however, is still available. [Caprara] In the PPI primaries in Irpinia, De Mita's candidacy was seconded by 8,142 people, and Mancino's by 4,322. Are they not also flesh-and-blood voters? [Segni] I have always said that at an epoch-making turning point, it is necessary to make a change from those who represented the previous system. Let it be very clear that this is not a judgment. It is a political requirement. And it is certainly a very strong one if the Pact for Italy wants to win. [Caprara] Did you expect to have a united bloc, of the type that is emerging now, on your right ? [Segni] I think that Sartori's article in CORRIERE DELLA SERA was perfect. What has been formed is not a political bloc. It is not a liberal-democratic area, it is a conglomeration. [Northern League Secretary] Bossi talks with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, and Berlusconi talks with [National Alliance Coordinator] Fini, but Bossi will not shake hands with Fini. It is impossible for them to have a common program. It is not just the enormous gap in their views on Italian unity. [Caprara] What other differences do you see? [Segni] Is the MSI [Italian Social Movement] as in favor of free trade as Berlusconi? Quite the opposite. The inconsistencies on the left, in a lineup ranging from [Italian Republican Party Chairman] Visentini to [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti, are reflected on the right. We are more consistent, that is why we are suffering more. We know exactly what to do once we have gotten into government, whereas a split is already a certainty on the other sides. [Caprara] You once said that the Pact is an alternative to the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]. After the election would you form an alliance to govern with Bossi and Berlusconi? [Segni] We are asking for votes for ourselves and for our programs. I do not know what will happen if none of the three blocks achieves a majority. There may be a government of technocrats to safeguard the nation, that will complete the institutional reforms and ensure governability. What is certain is that we will be moving in a specific direction, united whether in government or in opposition. [Caprara] Does this mean that the PPI cannot form an alliance with the PDS? [Segni] Exactly. And that is why we have decided to form a single parliamentary group even if it takes the form of a federation.
