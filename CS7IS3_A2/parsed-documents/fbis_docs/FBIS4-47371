Sedova; UDC 550.343(009)] [Abstract] When a short-range prediction of an earthquake becomes known to the public it may result in panic and urgent measures by the government become especially urgent. Especially since the Armenian earthquake there has been improper dissemination of earthquake warnings by the press and some specialists, many of the latter working outside the field of their competence. This includes astronomers, specialists in biofields, those with extrasensory perception and amateurs. Among the seven hundred such predictions reviewed by an expert group not one of them proved valid. Several specialists are named who have been exceptionally active in making and disseminating alarming and unwarranted predictions. This also happens in other countries. This problem was dealt with in two resolutions of the 22d General Assembly of the European Seismological Commission (Barcelona, 20 September 1990) calling for a moratorium on such not fully validated predictions and calling for a code of ethics for those issuing such warnings. Such a code was adopted at Strasbourg on 18 October 1991 (the Russian text of this code, as well as that of the two mentioned resolutions, is given). It is requested that all who make such predictions in Russia direct them for review to: Nauchno-inzhenernyy i koordinatsionnyy seysmologicheskiy tsentr RAN (Scientific Engineering and Coordinating Seismological Center, Russian Academy of Sciences), Moskva, ul. Ulyanovskaya, 51. References 6: 3 Russian, 3 Western.
