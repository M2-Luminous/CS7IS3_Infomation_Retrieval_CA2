By undertaking responsibility for this operation, the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas stated that the car explosion at a Zionist bus stop in 'Afula in the north of occupied Palestine is in answer to the massacre of the fasting Palestinian worshipers at the al-Ibrahimi shrine and in order to avenge their unjustly shed blood. Political observers believe that this attack demonstrates the strength of the Palestinian Islamic movement in organizing and carrying out jihad operations. Yesterday's attack took place on the anniversary of the commencement of the intifadah and the Zionist forces were on full alert. The place where the operation took place was north of occupied Palestine, or, in other words, outside the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a place where carrying out operations is extremely difficult. The admission by the Zionist chief of staff that the Zionist regime's military forces will not be able to prevent such operations in the future proves this point even further. Since its founding, the Zionist regime has unilaterally massacred and rendered homeless the people of Palestine and Arab countries that share borders with occupied Palestine. Because of the unequal military balance and extensive support by international powers for the usurping regime, the reaction by the people of Palestine and the world has not been strong enough to stop this inhuman process. However, now that the Muslim Palestinians have been armed with the spirit of jihad and martyrdom, the situation has completely changed. Seven years ago, with the commencement of the intifadah and the persistent struggle against the Zionist regime, the Palestinians gave up the past beliefs of political leaders of Palestine in defending the rights of the Palestinian Muslims through international organizations. By relying on the Palestinian people and their Islamic belief, they set off on a path that has proven to be effective and, God willing, will lead to victory in the not very distant future.
