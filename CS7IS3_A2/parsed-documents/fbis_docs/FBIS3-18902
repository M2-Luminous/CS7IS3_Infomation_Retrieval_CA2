In a tactical move, the Pakistani delegation circulated a revised resolution on the issue inserting a new paragraph which calls upon the Indian Government to ensure the promotion and protection of human rights in Jammu and Kashmir. However, speaking on behalf of the Indian delegation, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, told PTI that India would not accept any resolution on any aspect of Kashmir which is an integral part of the country. The European Union also said that the substance of the resolution is still political in nature and will not change its earlier stand of abstaining in case of voting. Meanwhile, India has stepped up its diplomatic offensive at the Human Rights Commission's session to expose unbridled terrorism spurned by Islamabad in Jammu and Kashmir. The minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, charged Pakistan with trying to involve the UN Human Rights Commission in its blatant pursuit of political and territorial ambitions. Mr. Khurshid said that Jammu and Kashmir is the symbol of India's secular democracy and declared that India will oppose Islamabad's politically motivated exercise. He said New Delhi is making efforts to manifest still greater transparency regarding the actual situation in Jammu and Kashmir. The leader of the Indian delegation at the ongoing session of the commission, Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, has expressed confidence that the resolution moved by Pakistan would be defeated when it comes up for voting.
