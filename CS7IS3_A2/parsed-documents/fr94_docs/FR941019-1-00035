FR941019-1-00035 FR941019-1-00004 The courts first addressed the question of whether predictions or statements of opinion could ever be considered to be ``facts'' which could be said to be false or misleading for purposes of liability under the securities laws. In Marx v. Computer Sciences Corporation, 52 the court found that while predictions could properly be characterized as facts, the failure of a prediction to prove true was not in itself actionable. Instead, the court looked at the factual representations which it found were impliedly made in connection with the prediction; namely that, at the time the prediction was made, it was believed by its proponent and it had a valid basis. 53 If a prediction was not believed when made or did not have a valid basis, it would constitute an untrue statement of fact which could then be analyzed in accordance with the other necessary elements of the action: 54 i.e., materiality, reliance, scienter, and causation. 52 507 F.2d 485 (9th Cir. 1974). 53 Id. at 489&hyph;90 (``[T]he forecast may be regarded as a representation that *␣*␣* [the issuer's] informed and reasonable belief was that at the end of the coming period, earnings would be approximately $1.00. *␣*␣* In addition, because such a statement implies a reasonable method of preparation and a valid basis, we believe also that it would be `untrue' absent such preparation or basis.''). Many courts have adopted similar formulations. See In re Apple Computer Securities Litigation, 886 F.2d 1109, 1113 (9th Cir. 1989) (``A projection or statement of belief contains at least three implicit factual assertions: (1) that the statement is genuinely believed, (2) that there is a reasonable basis for that belief, and (3) that the speaker is not aware of any undisclosed facts tending to seriously undermine the accuracy of the statement. A projection or statement of belief may be actionable to the extent that one of these implied factual assertions is inaccurate.'' (citing Marx )); Isquith v. Middle South Utilities, Inc., 847 F.2d 186, 203&hyph;04 (5th Cir. 1988) (``Most often, whether liability is imposed depends on whether the predictive statement was `false' when it was made. The answer to this inquiry, however, does not turn on whether the prediction in fact proved to be wrong; instead, falsity is determined by examining the nature of the prediction_with the emphasis on whether the prediction suggested reliability, bespoke caution, was made in good faith, or had a sound factual or historical basis.'' (footnote omitted)); Kirby v. Cullinet Software, Inc., 721 F.Supp. 1444, 1450 (D.Mass. 1989) (``At a minimum, a prediction must be made in good faith and with a sound historical or factual basis.''). Rule 175 and Rule 3b&hyph;6 follow a similar path by providing that a covered statement shall not be deemed to be, inter alia, an untrue statement of a material fact, unless it is shown that such statement was made or reaffirmed without a reasonable basis or was disclosed other than in good faith. Although the Rules use the term ``fraudulent statement'' to refer to such an untrue statement of a material fact, a separate determination must be made as to whether the statement, though untrue, is fraudulent or otherwise actionable under the securities laws. In Wielgos v. Commonwealth Edison Co., supra at 513, the court considered the use of the term ``fraudulent statement'' in the Rules, but easily determined that Rule 175 applies to actions under §11 of the Securities Act even though liability under that section does not depend on ``fraud.'' 54 Id. at 490. In the recent case of Rubinstein v. Collins, 20 F.3d 160, 169 (5th Cir. 1994), the court stated this point succinctly: Simply alleging that the predictive statements at issue here did not have a reasonable basis_that is, that they were negligently made_would hardly suffice to state a claim under Rule 10b&hyph;5. As we have consistently held, scienter is an element of such a claim. *␣*␣* Plaintiffs have satisfied the pleading requirements for scienter. They have claimed that the defendants either knew_or were recklessly indifferent to_the fact that the predictive statements did not have a reasonable basis. (Footnotes omitted.) B. Materiality and Reliance Some courts have disposed of cases involving forward-looking statements without reaching the issue of these implied factual assertions by examining another element of the claim_materiality or, as described in some cases, reliance. Most of these cases have been decided on the basis of the ``bespeaks caution'' doctrine, 55 which has been described as follows: 55 Seven circuit courts have applied the bespeaks caution doctrine in analyzing forward-looking statements (although the Sixth Circuit, after applying the doctrine in one case, stepped back somewhat in a subsequent decision). See In re Worlds of Wonder Sec. Litig., _F.3d _, 1994 WL 501261 (9th Cir. 1994); Rubinstein v. Collins, 20 F.3d 160 (5th Cir. 1994); In re Donald J. Trump Casino Sec. litig., 7 F.3d 357 (3d Cir. 1993); Luce v. Edelstein, 802 F.2d 49 (2d Cir. 1986); Romani v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, 929 F.2d 875 (1st Cir. 1991); Moorhead v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 949 F.2d 243 (8th Cir. 1991). The Sixth Circuit adopted the doctrine in Sinay v. Lamson & Sessions Co., 948 F.2d 1037 (6th Cir. 1991), but revised its application of the doctrine in Mayer v. Mylod, 988 F.2d 635 (6th Cir. 1993). See generally Donald C. Langevoort, Disclosures that ``Bespeak Caution,'' 49 Bus. Law. 481 (February 1994). The essence of the doctrine is that where an offering statement, such as a prospectus, accompanies statements of its future forecasts, projections and expectations with adequate cautionary language, those statements are not actionable as securities fraud. 56 56 In re Donald J. Trump Casino Sec. Litig., 793 F.Supp. 543, 549 (D.N.J. 1992), aff'd, 7 F.3d 357 (3d Cir. 1993). Under the bespeaks caution doctrine, cautionary language, as a part of the ``total mix'' of information, may render a predictive statement immaterial as a matter of law, 57 or make it unreasonable for an investor to rely upon a predictive statement. 58 Recently, some courts have warned, however, that cautionary language, in and of itself, is not necessarily sufficient. 59 ``To suffice, the cautionary statements must be substantive and tailored to the specific future projections, estimates or opinions in the prospectus which the plaintiffs challenge.'' 60 57 See In re Donald J. Trump Sec. Litig., supra at 371 (``[C]autionary language, if sufficient, renders the alleged omissions or misrepresentations immaterial as a matter of law.''); In re Worlds of Wonder Sec. Litig., supra; Rubinstein v. Collins, supra. 58 Rubinstein v. Collins, supra at 167 (cautionary language affects ``the reasonableness of the reliance on and the materiality of [the] projections.'' (footnotes omitted)). 59 See Rubinstein v. Collins, supra at 167&hyph;68; In re Donald J. Trump Casino Sec. Litig., supra at 371&hyph;72. 60 In re Donald J. Trump Casino Sec. Litig., supra at 371&hyph;72. Some courts have taken a more extreme position, determining that, even without cautionary language, some predictions are not material. For example, referring to ``soft,'' ``puffing'' statements, upon which no reasonable investor would rely, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated that, ``projections of future performance not worded as guarantees are generally not actionable under the federal securities laws.'' 61 61 Raab v. General Physics Corp., 4 F.3d 286, 290 (4th Cir. 1993) (quoting Krim v. BancTexas Group, Inc., 989 F.2d 1435, 1446 (5th Cir. 1993)). In Malone v. Microdyne Corp., 26 F.3d 471, 479&hyph;0 (4th Cir. 1994), the Court of Appeals relied on Raab in finding that a forward-looking statement was not actionable because the ``statement obviously did not constitute a guarantee and was certainly not specific enough to perpetrate a fraud on the market.'' III. Criticisms of the Commission's Safe Harbor Some have suggested that companies that make voluntary disclosure of forward-looking information subject themselves to a significantly increased risk of securities antifraud class actions. 62 Recent surveys suggest that this threat of mass shareholder litigation, whether real or perceived, has had a chilling effect on disclosure of forward-looking information. 63 62 U. Gupta & B. Bowers, Small Fast-Growth Firms Feel Chill of Shareholder Suits, Wall St. J., April 5, 1994 at B2. See generally Staff Sen. Subcommittee on Securities of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Report on Private Securities Litigation, (1994) (``Senate Staff Report''). 63 National Venture Capital Association, The Impact of Securities Fraud Suits on Entrepreneurial Companies (Jan. 1994); National Investors Relations Institute, Corporate Survey on Shareholder Litigation Effects (Feb. 1994); American Stock Exchange CEO Survey, Securities Litigation and Stock Option Accounting 1 (Apr. 1994). Contrary to the Commission's original intent, the safe harbor is currently invoked on a very limited basis in a litigation context. 64 Some critics of the current safe harbor provisions cite, among other things, the following as weaknesses of the safe harbor: 64 See Louis Loss and Joel Seligman, Securities Regulation, 622&hyph;39 (1992); Barondes, The Bespeaks Caution Doctrine: Revisiting the Application of Federal Securities Law to Opinions and Estimates, J.Corp. L. 243, 247 (1994). _the protections of the safe harbor are too narrow because they are limited to filed documents, resulting in selective disclosure made outside Commission documents; 65 65 See American Stock Exchange Survey, CEOs Would Release More Financial Information If Litigation Albatross Were Removed (1994); See generally S. Marino and R. Marino, An Empirical Study of Recent Securities Class Action Settlements Involving Accountants, Attorneys, or Underwriters, Sec. Reg. L. J. (1994) at 115; V. O'Brien and R. Hodges, A Study of Class Action Securities Fraud Cases 1988&hyph;1993 (working draft 1994); J. Macey and G. Miller, The Plaintiffs' Attorney's Role in Class Action and Derivative Litigation: Economic Analysis and Recommendations for Reform, 58 U. Chicago L. Rev. 1 (1991). _the provisions of the safe harbor are not applied by the courts in a manner that results in quick and inexpensive dismissals of frivolous lawsuits; 66 66 Senate Staff Report, supra note 62.
