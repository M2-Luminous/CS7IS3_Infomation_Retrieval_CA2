Whoever has mastered this technology possesses the key to a multitude of product innovations. Some materials coming from the laboratory of the Saarbruecken Institute of New Materials (INM) GmbH [GmbH = Ltd] seem to be coming from a witch's kitchen of modern alchemists: From unimaginably small particles, hardly larger than molecules, they make materials which in an almost any desirable way combine the heretofore not concurrently attainable properties of glass, ceramic, metals, and plastics. Novel automotive varnishes whose color can be changed instantaneously by push-button action are foreseen by the INM experts, as are finest filters which automatically close their pores when they detect the presence of certain gases. There is more to such futuristic application concepts than the pure joy of experimentation. "In the future new custom made materials will play the key role in development of innovative products and in solution of confounding problems" predicts Prof. Helmut Schmidt, business managing director of the INM. INM researchers are developing synthetic materials and new processing techniques so that boundaries between glass, ceramic, plastic, and metal become blurred. The new wonder materials satisfy every conceivable requirement: to be more resistant, more durable, and more elastic than every metal; to automatically indicate invisible defects as, for instance, in the outer skin layer of aircraft, or to withstand temperatures of up to several thousand degrees when used as heat shields. The secret of the Saarbruecken researchers are so-called nanoparticles, only a few nanometers large particles. In this field the INM (with a staff of 150 persons) has attained the top position globally and is pressing like a resourceful David against the Japanese superpower in the future-oriented race for new materials. INM chief Helmut Schmidt says, "With their wonder materials these Saarlanders are opening unthought-of application possibilities which promise enormous advantages in the global contest." With relatively simple mixtures, the Japanese have already in the eighties demonstrated how decisive materials are in winning the global contest. "With ingenious and inexpensive components made of glass", Schmidt cites as an example, "copier equipment manufacturers like Canon have dislodged U.S. competitors and their costly optics." Success with Ormocers With tiniest glass globules a few micrometers in diameter embedded in the surface of video tapes, the Japanese were able to set a new standard and conquer the world market. "At the same time", says Schmidt, "about 75% of all high-tech products use materials especially developed for them." This busy materials expert knows what he is talking about. In the mid- eighties he was already engaged in developing the so-called Ormocers (Organically Modified Ceramics), to create a sensation: inorganic ceramics and organic plastics being grown together -- a long technological step forward in materials research. Two heretofore not concurrently attainable properties, hardness of ceramics and high ultimate strength of plastics, are here realized in one material. During the 1986-90 period Schmidt was, as director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Silicates Research in Wuerzburg, successfully engaged in industrial application of Ormocers. An example is the mixture specially developed by the Wuerzburg team and used by the Rupp & Hubrach KG [Kommanditgesellschaft = Limited Partnership] in Bamberg as an exceptionally scratch-resistant material for coating eyeglasses. With only 12.6 kg of this material, the French have reached a sales figure of 15 million DM in 1992 alone. Another Schmidt-Ormocer is used by the Biberacher Basotherm GmbH as an extremely effective additive in a novel skin creme against acne. No wonder that in 1990 this busy materials expert and research manager readily accepted the offer to become chairman of the INM, which had been established in 1987. "Here we can in a downright ideal way combine industry- related projects with government-financed basic research". He can enumerate about 100 joint projects with companies like Daimler-Benz, Bayerische Motor Werke (BMW), or Schering. Some of these projects pertain to extension and further development of the Ormocer technology along with its underlying sol-gel manufacturing process. Still more momentous for the future appears to be nanotechnology invented by the INM basics researcher Prof. Herbert Gleiter. There is an unpredictable number of possible applications for this technology in areas ranging from metals and plastics processing to optoelectronics and bioengineering. Multicolor Mixture What is being researched at the Institute of New Materials? Color emulsions for the nanotechnology: starting material for ultrafine powders of particles a few nanometers in diameter. NANOCOMPOSITE MATERIALS Smart Materials: Intelligent materials whose properties will change for a purpose in response to light, electric signals, or mechanical action are nanotechnological materials. With these materials one can build active components which do not require external sensors and control elements. Environment-Protecting Materials: Custom made materials which absorb toxic gases or harmful liquids such as, for example, gasoline sludge. Bioengineering Materials: Nanocomposite materials can be adjusted more precisely than conventional materials to given biological conditions (e.g., for more compatible implants). Materials for Integrated Optics: With nanocomposite materials one can produce special effects required of optical switches in communications, engineering, and future computer engineering. Passage of incident light rays through a transparent material of this kind can be either permitted or barred by appropriate optical signals. Graded Materials: Controlled growth of the material structure makes it possible to impart special properties to thin (micrometers thick) layers. Coatings For Metals and Plastics: Nanotechnology facilitates improvement of surface properties of addition of new ones. GLASS Glass Composites: The sol-gel process makes it possible to produce coatings which will confer a variety of properties on a surface. The principal aim is to convert the glass surface into an intelligent system to be used in vehicle construction, architecture, and display techniques, etc. Sintered Glasses: The processes which precede sintering (baking a mixture by heating) in glass manufacture by the powder technology are being further developed. Not only synthesis of novel functional coatings for glass surfaces but also joining glasses homogeneously at temperatures below the softening point without use of adhesive becomes feasible. CERAMICS Synthesis of Nanopowders: The goal is to eventually produce diverse nanoparticles of almost any desirable composition and size. Processing Technology for Nanopowders: Techniques of processing extremely fine raw materials already adjusted for practical use by industry indicate new ways of making ceramic materials. Ceramics Processing Technology: Further development of the nanotechnology is aimed at a lower cost of making completely nondefective homogeneous raw ceramic materials (greenware) and at lower the sintering temperatures. Says INM researcher Reiner Kasemann, "The new forms of material synthesis will trigger a revolution similar to that triggered by microelectronics." With tiniest particles, only a few dozens of times larger than a molecule, it is possible to properly program the properties of a material. This is so because the synthetic midgets, visible only under a transmission electron microscope, exhibit entirely new properties when assembled en masse. Granules smaller than 15 nm in diameter thus become properly transparent. A nanocomposite material made by mixing such plastic and ceramic particles in an intricate chemical process becomes astonishingly a transparent material. This leads to application possibilities one can dream of. Electrochromic and photochromic nanocomposites are thus being developed by the INM whose color or optical transmittance can be changed by application of voltage pulses or exposure to sunlight respectively. Window glass coated with such a material could be darkened instantaneously by push-button action. In automobile manufacture, too, there are good opportunities for smart nanomaterials. The color of rear and side windows, for instance, can in the future be arbitrarily varied by an electric signal coming from a dashboard switch. The benefit this feature offers is that it prevents excessive heating of the interior by intense solar radiation. Marketable Nanomixtures In addition, Schmidt is now developing smart fluids for new shock absorbers which will, within fractions of a second, adjust their stiffness to the road condition. The mechanism of this curious change rests on the damper fluid becoming as stiff as legs exactly when an electrically controlled sensor indicates very deep pot holes. On this basis, much more comfortable and also simpler spring systems could eventually be built. Nanomixtures of plastic and ceramic material are harder and have a higher load capacity than every metal, which makes them eminently suitable for coatings. Their first marketable applications have already been developed: 1. For extra highly resistant aluminum surfaces. Conventional coating with epoxy resins provides merely inadequate long-term protection and, moreover, requires surface cleaning and pickling treatments during which chloroferous sludge is being discharged. Much more scratch and wear resistant nanocoatings can, on the contrary, be deposited without polluting prior surface treatment. 2. Nanocomposite materials are also eminently suitable for dirt-repellant coatings. The INM material which consists of special ingredients containing aluminum, silicon, and fluorine respectively is much more durable than the conventional plastic coating material and, in addition, prevents detrimental dirt deposition. 3. The INOPEX GmbH in Saarbruck will eventually produce bathroom mirrors with a nanocoating designed to prevent water vapor deposition and to last much longer than comparable products. For ceramic materials nanotechnology offers downright fantastic possibilities. The shortcoming of these extraordinarily wear-resistant and high-temperature heat-resistant materials has until now been their attendant fragility, owing to irregularities of the original powder mass. With the aid of the nanoparticle technique, the INM researchers were able to effectively avoid dreaded formation of defects in a very promising all-around material by making it from grains thousand times finer than before. In addition to that, the Saarbrueck researchers want to produce by a novel processing technique the heretofore awfully expensive nanopowder (now costing a few thousand DM/kg) for a price of 50-150 DM/kg. They were the first ones able to mix perfectly uniform ceramic particles only 15 nm in diameter so as to space them closely but allow them to move freely. Until now nanotechnologists unfortunately tended to produce particles on the premise that making them smaller made its easier for them to "stick" to one another, but this led to formation of worthless lumps. The INM researchers have tamed these obstinate midgets, a billion of which would fit in a pinhead, by coating them with an ultrathin molecular monolayer sheath. This sheath ensures that they remain spaced exactly 0.4 nm apart. This superior processing technique makes many heralded applications for a heretofore notoriously fragile material realizable. A nanoceramic material may to a large extent replace steel or aluminum in automobiles. While it is so elastic as to be suitable for spring components, its wear resistance and high-temperature heat resistance are also so exceptional that costly water cooling could be dispensed with. Meager Assistance Despite all the successes and magnificent prospects, Schmidt remains altogether skeptical about German materials research. "Materials require an especially long lead time, ten years or more being necessary for innovation. In Germany as a rule", the INM chief complains, "no projects lasting longer then three years are being subsidized." Not so in Japan: The chief guardians of technology at the Ministry of Industry MITI are pumping 10 billion dollars into materials research over the 1989-98 period alone. For comparison: According to the materials expert Michael Witzel at the Arthur Little business consulting firm, the Federal Ministry of Research and Technology subsidized altogether 577 projects with only 894 million DM from 1985 till the beginning of 1992 and in the future it will provide rather less. There is an additional disadvantage which the German industry faces in dealing with competition from the Far East: "The research structures in Japan are," says INM chief Schmidt, "much more efficacious. In Germany we have many specialists, to be sure, but nobody who would lead them as would an orchestra conductor toward coordinated team effort. In Japan this role is taken over by MITI."
