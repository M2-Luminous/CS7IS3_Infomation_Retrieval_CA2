President Bill Clinton has admitted implicitly that one of the possible solutions for the current crisis in Haiti -- and its return to democracy -- would be that the military leaders who took part in the coup d'etat be exiled in Spain or in France. Our correspondent in Washington Luz Rodriguez has the story. Spanish sources have confirmed to Radio Nacional de Espana that our country would be willing to receive the three Haitian military leaders for which the United States is looking for a golden exile. The leaders they are talking about are Commander in Chief Raoul Cedras; Michel Francois, the head of Port-au-Prince police; and Philippe Biamby, the chief of Army general staff. We have not been able to confirm that the United States has made a formal request to Madrid because it is still not clear whether the three Haitian leaders are willing to go into exile even though this exile would be in the best of circumstances. The aim of this operation would be to allow the return of Jean Bertrand Aristide.
