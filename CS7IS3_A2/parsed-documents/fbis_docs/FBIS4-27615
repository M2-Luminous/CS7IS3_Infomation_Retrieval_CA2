I would like to inform you that the inter-Cambodian conference known as the roundtable in Pyongyang, the DPRK -- Cambodia's great friend -- has ended and has produced the following results: 1. His Excellency [H.E.] Samdech Chea Sim, H.E. Samdech Hun Sen, H.E. Khieu Samphan, His Royal Highness [HRH] Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranaridddh, and myself -- the five of us responsible for solving problems for Cambodia -- agreed to always be true and always be loyal to the principle that we will do our best to create conditions for securing peace and security for our Cambodian people, nation, and motherland. Our people have suffered for more than 20 years now. They are in urgent need of a cease- fire, of peace. Therefore, we must do our best to restore peace and fully realize national reconciliation. Furthermore, we will always be loyal to the sacred principle that the country must be free from partition or secession; it must not be divided into three, four, or more parts. We must preserve the territorial unity and territorial integrity of Cambodia forever. We must preserve the land and maritime borders of an independent, neutral, and nonaligned Cambodia which existed from 1963 to 1969 and which were solemnly recognized by the international community. Therefore, we must defend these borders, this 1963-69 territorial integrity and must do all we can so that all countries in the world respect these land and maritime borders. In order to do that we must achieve national unity, we must regard one another as members of the same family and avoid polarization. For this reason, the Pyongyang roundtable unanimously agreed that although Cambodia's overall problems, such as the problem of war, are not yet settled to a satisfactory extent, we must carry on the talks between the Royal Government of Cambodia and the party of Democratic Kampuchea. Consequently, the Pyongyang roundtable decided that in June 1994 another roundtable will be held at Damnak Chan in the Phnom Penh Royal Palace. This roundtable will be a meeting of representatives of H.E. Samdech Chea Sim, H.E. Samdech Hun Sen, H.E. Khieu Samphan, HRH Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, and Norodom Sihanouk. The five representatives will come to the Royal Palace on 15 June, continue the work left over from Pyongyang, and see to it that there will be progress in the search for a solution to all problems, such as the problem of war. I would like to inform all of you, venerable monks and beloved compatriots, that I Norodom Sihanouk am affected with cancer of the bone marrow, an illness for which I did not receive any treatment during the two months that I was having the honor to serve my people, my country between our traditional new year and the day I left home in May. During this time that I was serving the people, the nation, and the motherland, I was very tired every day and I did not receive any thorough medical examination from my Chinese doctor to see whether the cancer had recurred. The Chinese doctor was worried that my overwork and lack of proper medical treatment -- as the one I received in Beijing -- would cause a relapse. The Cambodian and French doctors in Phnom Penh took three samples of my blood for examination. The results of my blood test were not good. It showed that I still had this cancer and a few other afflictions in my system. Therefore, I needed to return promptly to the Chinese hospital in Beijing. However, because we also needed to hold the roundtable to bring peace for our people and end their sufferings, I made the ultimate sacrifice. As a result, my future was not bright and I might become very sick and might even die. Although I was experiencing a health problem, I agreed to make the sacrifice and I did not recoil from personal discomfort when I had to work relentlessly in the past few days. Why did I agree to all of that? It was so that our nation can live in peace, ridding itself of sufferings and fear caused by war. It is most regrettable to me that the delegation of Democratic Kampuchea or Khmer Rouge headed by H.E. Khieu Samphan to the roundtable did not agree with the Royal Government and the National Assembly. Our Royal Government represented by HRH Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and H.E. Samdech Hun Sen and our National Assembly represented by H.E. Samdech Chea Sim, as the chairman, fully accepted the king's proposal, that is, an immediate cease-fire or, failing that, a permanent cease-fire as of 15 June when the war, the fighting must end without any conditions. They also agreed to study with the Khmer Rouge ways to include them into our Royal Government. They agreed to see whether our Royal Government can accept the Khmer Rouge leaders as ministers, deputy ministers, or secretaries of state. A number of Khmer Rouge leaders are thus to be included into the Royal Government and the Khmer Rouge army known as the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea is to be integrated into the Khmer Royal Armed Forces. In this undertaking, I hoped that Pyongyang with its excellent atmosphere and calm would be a perfect venue for us to hold the discussion. I hoped that we would have sufficient time to solve the problems to stop the war, end the Khmer Rouge secession, and include some Khmer Rouge leaders, such as H.E. Khieu Samphan and H.E. Chan Youran, into the Royal Government. However, the Party of Democratic Kampuchea leaders did not agree with the proposal of the King of Cambodia Norodom Sihanouk. They proposed a method of supervision that is different from what Norodom Sihanouk had suggested. They wanted to invite five foreign countries. They asked the royal government to pick five countries from the 10 they had selected to come and oversee the cease-fire. However, the cease-fire cannot be implemented if the problem of a new government, meaning the formation of a new Cambodian Government whose power is jointly shared by them, has not been resolved. If the problem is not completely solved according to their desire, they will not stop fighting. Therefore, the talks will run aground because of the Khmer Rouge's demand for foreigners to monitor the cease-fire. Somehow, when foreigners came during the time of UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia], the Khmer Rouge did not allow them do any overseeing. They also endangered UNTAC and even caused the death of some UNTAC members. Now, they have changed their words, saying 10 UN members -- they did not talk about the United Nations, but 10 countries which are all full members of the United Nations -- should be invited and that five of them should come. However, it would take a long time for them to answer yes or no if we were to ask them. It might take months or even a year to solve the problem of cease-fire supervision. Our people will continue to suffer endlessly. Even if these countries say they will come, I still do not believe they would. I am sure they will not come. They said they had bitter experiences while they were under UNTAC in Cambodia. UNTAC told them the experiences with Khmer Rouge were most bitter. At that time, the Khmer Rouge did not respect UNTAC, but now they said they need foreigners to come and oversee Cambodians. The Khmer Rouge can never be trusted. That is what these countries said. I wish to clarify that when the five countries are allowed to come and oversee us, it does not mean that the Khmer Rouge will agree to stop the war. They will continue to fight; they will agree to stop only if the existing government dissolves itself, contrary to the Constitution. They will do whatever they can to bring to existence a new government through which they can exert control in the areas of state affairs, the state, the country, and the nation with Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh of FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and H.E. Chea Sim and H.E. Hun Sen of the Cambodian People's Party. At least, power should be given to them equally, though they did not take part in the elections. H.E. Samdech Hun Sen has disagreed with that. He said that is against the Constitution and that the sacrifices of the voters will be futile and meaningless. Therefore, he remained in disagreement at the roundtable meeting in Pyongyang. That how the talks turned out. I am no longer able to solve this problem. So, I have asked H.E. Samdech Chakkrei Nhoek Chulong, who is now over 86 years old and trusted by various parties, to go to Phnom Penh. He is staying with me now in Pyongyang and will travel to Phnom Penh to represent the king as the chairman of the roundtable meeting to be held in the Royal Palace on 15 June 1994. This is what I would like to tell the clergy. Anyway, we hope that there would be some good results on 15-16 June. But, is our optimism reasonable? From what I know about the Khmer Rouge, I have little hope. Nonetheless, the Triple Jewel will not forsake us, the supreme patriarchs and clergy will not abandon us. Their teaching about compassion, nonviolence, and national reconciliation will one day help Cambodia, allowing it to regain peace, security, full independence, neutrality, and territorial integrity within its borders recognized during the Sangkum Reas Niyum era prior to the coup d'etat staged by Lon Nol and Sirimatak. Therefore, I wish to call on the clergy to further support the talks so as to allow our people, who have suffered in the extreme, to again live in peace. We will join hands to rebuild our nation and motherland toward glory. As revered Marshall Kim Il-song, president of the DPRK, said yesterday: After you leave here, Cambodian brothers, please compromise before it is too late to reestablish peace for the people, nation, and motherland. Peace should be taken as national reconciliation and reunification, the basis for rebuilding the Cambodian nation and motherland toward prosperity and glory. This will allow Cambodia to catch up with other countries that are developing, while it is regressing due to division and war. Therefore, division and war should be put to an end. You should achieve peace and national reconciliation and reunite around your king to rebuild the nation, and permit it to catch up with other developed countries in this modern world. This is most valuable advice. Therefore, the PDK leaders -- including H.E. Khieu Samphan and his delegation -- who heard this statement with their own ears at Marshal Kim Il-song's palace yesterday, please heed this advice in a timely fashion. Please help our nation so that it can survive like other countries, and prevent it from vanishing in the future. This is the end of my impromptu message. When the royal government delegation bade farewell to me before returning to Phnom Penh, I hurriedly recorded this message for the information of all of you. Thank you very much. I pray that the Triple Jewel, previous Cambodian kings, and goddesses will protect all of you. May you enjoy longevity, social prestige, happiness, strength, and enlightenment. And may our Cambodia and respected and beloved people recover peace in the near future. Thank you very much.
