"The move indicates that customs emphasis has been turned from the inspection of import and export goods to the oversight of companies dealing in the goods," Cao said. With reference to international conventions, Shanghai customs will classify foreign trade companies in accordance with their internal operation and previous cooperation with customs. The first class, including companies with a high business reputation, will enjoy preference and more preferential treatment when undergoing customs affairs. So far there are altogether 24 such companies in Shanghai. Companies with a less than stellar business reputation fall into the second tier, while those with poor management or suspected of illegal trafficking will have their import and export goods strictly examined at customs, the director. Every year, the Customs Office will hold appraisals to upgrade or demote the companies according to their achievements. Along with rapid economic growth, more than 9,000 companies were dealing with foreign trade in Shanghai by the end of last year. There were only some 200 companies in 1985. During the same time, the value of import and export goods through customs increased from 14.87 billion U.S. dollars to 30.9 billion U.S. dollars.
