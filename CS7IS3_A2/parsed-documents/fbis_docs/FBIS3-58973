For instance, if one considers the temporary "accommodation" of a certain sector or a certain product a good thing, there is one kind of answer. Then again, if delivering one sector or product to the depths of international competition is bad, then the answer is different. Let us take up first the issues of "strictly Greek interest": 1) Textiles. It is certainly not good that we (and Portugal as well) failed to secure from the Europeans the capital that would help our textile sector better face the naked competition to which it will be exposed after the agreement. While Portugal, of course, will be even more affected, it did succeed in securing ECU400 million in community funding, and 500 million in community loans (under favorable terms). We accomplished nothing of the sort. [GATT negotiator] Theodhoros Pangalos said that "the programs aimed at strengthening the textile sector had not been ready" to be submitted to the Community so as to ask for the relative financing. According to information from reliable officials, our country submitted to the EC three years ago a five-year program for restructuring and modernizing the Greek textile sector amounting to ECU1.9 billion. Community officials had led us to believe there was hope "for at least some assistance." It is also certain that our Portuguese competitors will enjoy some advantages over us. 2) Maritime transportation. Our merchant marine will surely be favored by the fact that agreement was reached and that as a result, international trade will expand, thus increasing the demand for the services our sector "sells." The protectionism the United States demanded, which would have been unfavorable to us because we have a more competitive and flexible merchant marine, did not come to pass. However, it will again surface very soon, as will also the cabotage issue. We are doing all right for the time being in preventing foreigners from interfering in the Greek sector by invoking mainly national security, but let us not forget for one moment that the war continues and that many battles will still take place. 3) Agriculture. Our olive oil, produce, and wine sectors will surely be affected. Especially with regard to produce, our argument that production in the southern European countries does not affect international trade was not accepted; as a result, the reduction of supports and export subsidies agreed upon means lost income for our producers. While the Community has more or less undertaken to secure financial offsets from the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy), restrictions in the Community budget are such that some doubt the restrictions will actually materialize. Others are more optimistic, citing the precedent of other products that were handled in similar fashion last year in the Blair House pre-agreement (tobacco, meats, dairy products, oil seeds, cereals). We shall soon know who is right. Let us now proceed briefly to a more general review. It is indeed difficult to understand the French, who are claiming victory in the audiovisual sector. If their films, broadcasts, and songs are of lower quality and marketability than Hollywood's, no national legislation will avert the shrinkage of the Francophone culture's share of the world market. The same is true for Greece and the other countries in the Union. For the rest, the opening of international trade and the increase of the worldwide production of goods and services will surely be to the advantage of Greece and all others. However, those possessing competitive national companies and good lobbies to influence public opinion and, hence, consumer behavior, will be most favored. It is thus up to readers to decide who are the losers and the winners from the famous GATT agreement.
