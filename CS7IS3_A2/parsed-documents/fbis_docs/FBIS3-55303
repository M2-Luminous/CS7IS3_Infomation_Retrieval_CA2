Concerning the Situation in the Agrarian Sector"] [Text] Agriculture had a difficult time last year. The problems began in the spring, but the farmers still managed to carry out the sowing at the optimum times. We were expecting a good crop, and these expectations were bolstered by actual results at the start of the harvest. But the farmers were unable to buy combines, spare parts, and fuel in good time because economic arrangements had not been settled between the producers and the purchasers of our products (the rural commodity producers did not have their own resources, and credit was exhausted). Then there were the adverse weather conditions in a number of grain regions. All this delayed the harvest work. More than three million hectares were not cleared. The gross grain harvest was 100 million tonnes. That is less than expected. There were problems with other agricultural crops as well. The sugar beet yield was on a par with past years. The gross harvest was more than 25 million tonnes. But this time the sugar content was somewhat higher. The harvest of oil-seed crops was approximately on a par with 1992. As for fruit and vegetables and potatoes, the situation is as follows: A large part of the harvest (36 million tonnes were harvested) has not been taken up. Those who are supposed to store potatoes have not been taking them. I believe there are two reasons for this. The first is the lack of circulating capital. (Consumers did not receive sufficient credit resources either). On the other hand, the wholesale depots were privatized during that period and these depots found that they could operate more profitably with commodities other than perishable products. In short, the process was administratively unmanageable, while market relations had not yet taken shape. Unfortunately we did not succeed in privatizing the entire rural infrastructure, as we at the Agriculture Ministry were intending. As a result, no matter what production chain you take, it turns out that none of the rural workers' partners is making a loss. Processing, even with reduced processing volumes, is operating profitably by raising the prices of products. The only loser is the rural commodity producer. Even the alcohol industry is not taking potatoes any more, since it is more profitable to produce alcohol from grain. As a result many farms have had to store potatoes themselves, often in unsuitable storage facilities. This means that there will be major wastage. Moreover, owing to the lack of demand, some of the potatoes were not harvested at all, primarily in the European part of the country. Livestock numbers continued to decline. This was due not only to prices, which are dictated by the processing industry. The main problem is that effective consumer demand is low. Some of the products are not being taken up. Even in Moscow Oblast, where milk yields are at their lowest in winter, a great deal of milk stays on the farms. All this is causing rural commodity producers to further reduce livestock numbers. There has been a marked reduction in per capita consumption of dairy and meat products in the current year. Despite the rather good harvest, many agricultural enterprises are now almost bankrupt. The state, in the shape of "Roskhleboprodukt," which concluded contracts for the purchase of grain, owes more than 700 billion rubles [R] for products that have already been received. Purchases of oil-seed crops have been held up for that reason. Sugar beet has been purchased from the countryside, but the payment was in sugar, not money. Moreover the state has not paid peasants for meat and dairy products that were supplied for processing and to the trade network. In view of this, we believe that the total debt to the countryside currently stands at more than R2 trillion. This means that farms are unable to make normal preparations for next year. For example, we were unable to buy mineral fertilizers, seed, and fuel for fall cultivation or storage. Credit policy has been tightened as well. What they are saying to us today is: Have the money, but at the bank rate, which is more than 200 percent. This means that the prices of our products, which are still not being sold in their entirety, are rising sharply. For these reasons we left around four million hectares of winter crop land unsown. This means that next year's harvest is in jeopardy. We left five million hectares unplowed in the fall -- which increases the spring workload by nine million hectares. Even fewer mineral fertilizers were applied than in the previous year. Stocks are not being accumulated. It is still not clear what kind of arrangement the state will have with commodity producers -- whether it will form state food stocks or people in the countryside will be left to face the vagaries of the market alone. Will the state subsidize livestock products or not? All these questions remain unanswered. Worst of all is that fact that the major livestock-raising complexes and poultry farms, once the most efficient, are now in a most difficult situation. They used to buy in feed, which became expensive, so production became inefficient. Unless the question of mixed feed compensation (at least 50 percent) is resolved, they are going to have to start slaughtering poultry, but even that would take at least three-four months, and perhaps as many as six. And the remaining birds have to be fed with something over that six-month period. Even in countries where agriculture is seen as being highly industrialized it is still supported by the state in various ways. Either by direct subsidies or by price regulation. There are countries where the state meets up to 60-70 percent of the cost of agricultural production. It is perfectly clear to us in the agrarian sphere that Russian agriculture will not survive without state support. We appreciate that when the budget is bursting at the seams it is very difficult to contemplate such things. But a way must be sought. Because if the countryside is alive and well, the country and the entire economy will be alive and well.
