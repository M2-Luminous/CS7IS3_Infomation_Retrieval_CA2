FR940112-0-00089 FR940112-0-00021 Comment: Commenters questioned our rationale for the revisions, stating that they knew of no evidence that individuals abuse the present system. Response: Concern about abuse of the existing spenddown methods was not the motivation behind these proposals. The primary objectives of these revisions were to give States greater flexibility to reasonably administer their Medicaid programs and to ensure that eligibility was appropriately based on need. In our communications with States, we were convinced that certain spenddown requirements, although originally well intended, had unintended results. Deduction of older medical bills, for example, was difficult for States to administer, as noted in the NPRM, because we required that States verify whether an individual remained liable for an old bill. In addition, because bills incurred before the eligibility period were deductible only if they were unpaid, as specified under prior policy, an incentive was created for individuals not to pay their bills. The revisions, therefore, are intended to alleviate administrative problems for States and, by only requiring the deduction of payments on older bills, create an incentive for individuals to pay older bills. Comment: Commenters suggested that any incurred medical expenses not deducted from income during a budget period should be carried over to the next budget period. They suggested that the expenses be carried forward whether the spenddown liability was met (that is, an individual became eligible) or not met (that is, expenses were insufficient to meet the spenddown requirement) during the first budget period. Response: We agree, in part, with the commenters. When an individual's incurred expenses exceed his or her spenddown liability (that is, the person becomes eligible without deducting all of the expenses) and when the excess expenses are unpaid, the excess expenses are deductible from excess income in subsequent budget periods, but only under certain conditions. HCFA requires the carryover of excess (that is, unused) expenses to account more fully for incurred unreimbursable expenses in determining whether the Medicaid income standard is met. If States were not required to carry over excess expenses, the spenddown provision would be practically meaningless when an individual with a small monthly amount of excess income incurs a large medical expense. In such a case, the individual could only apply the small amount of excess income in 1 month based on that expense. We have concluded that such a result would not be in keeping with the objective of the spenddown provision to account for unreimbursable expenses incurred for necessary care recognized under State law. Therefore, this final rule provides that medical expenses not deducted from income during one budget period must be carried over and deducted in the succeeding budget periods under the conditions described below. Proposed §§435.831(d)(6) and 436.831(d)(6) (designated as §§435.831(f)(3) and 436.831(f)(3) in the final rule) provide that medical expenses not deducted from income during one budget period must be carried over and deducted in the next budget period. These proposed rules were applicable, however, only when the individual was eligible in the first budget period after meeting the spenddown liability. We are revising what are now §§435.831(f)(3) and 436.831(f)(3) to clarify when excess, unpaid expenses are deductible in subsequent budget periods. In order for excess expenses to be carried over under this provision, eligibility must be established for the budget period in which the excess expenses were unused and in each subsequent budget period in which any part of the excess remains unused; in addition, the spenddown provision must apply in each such subsequent period. (To relieve States of the burden of carrying over such excess expenses indefinitely, specific excess amounts need not be carried over beyond the first subsequent period in which there is no eligibility or no excess income.) It should be noted that the ``carryover'' concept is used in these regulations to describe the ongoing deduction of unused and unpaid expenses, as contrasted to the deduction of expenses based on their being incurred in the retroactive eligibility period or, at State option, earlier. We make a distinction between the two kinds of expenses because of the option for States to disregard old expenses (i.e., expenses incurred prior to the retroactive eligibility period). One of the reasons for allowing old expenses to be disregarded is the administrative difficulty States may encounter in verifying and documenting whether liability for the expense continues. Once an old, or current, expense is initially verified and documented, it should not be unduly difficult to determine the extent of continuing liability from one budget period to another as long as the agency is maintaining contact with the individual. For this reason, we require that the unused, unpaid portion of such expenses be carried over from one budget period to the next, but only for as long as the individual is eligible in each such period (ensuring continuing contact with the agency). On this basis, we are providing that deductible expenses incurred before the month of application may become carryover expenses if they remain unused and unpaid after eligibility is established. The limit a State may place on the deductibility of expenses incurred before the retroactive eligibility period does not affect how long expenses remain deductible under the carryover provision. The age limit that can be placed on old expenses relates to how long before the retroactive eligibility period expenses can be incurred and be deductible rather than to how long they remain deductible thereafter. Comment: Commenters suggested that we revise the regulations so that both paid and unpaid bills may be carried over from one budget period to the next. Response: We do not agree with the views of the commenters on this point. The spenddown process is based on the principle that an individual's actual income is reduced by incurred medical expenses (that is, expenses for which he or she is liable) to the point at which his or her income is equal to or below the State's medically needy income standard. Once the individual is determined eligible for Medicaid, the State Medicaid program pays medical expenses covered under its State plan that were not used to satisfy the spenddown. The individual remains liable for payment of incurred bills that he or she deducted in the spenddown process.
