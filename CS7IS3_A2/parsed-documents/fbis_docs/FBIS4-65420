He pointed out that the embargo on Iraq causes Turkey a loss of $3 to $5 billion annually. He stressed that the UN Security Council and the concerned countries must show understanding in connection with the oil pipeline. The president was replying to reporters' questions at Cankaya Mansion in connection with press reports that Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani offered to carry out a joint intervention to end the fighting in north Iraq. Demirel recalled that Turkey has close relations with Iran, adding that the two countries cooperate regarding both Iraq and the PKK issue. He said the ministers of the two countries and officials of their respective security organizations meet from time to time to review developments. [Begin Demirel recording] There are still PKK members who are able to infiltrate into Turkey through Iran. I told Hashemi-Rafsanjani's brother, who was here last time, about this. It is true, I said, we cooperate very well with Iran, but such things are still happening from time to time. So I told him to bring me something from Hashemi-Rafsanjani which shows Iran's sensitivity about this issue and a reassurance that its interest will continue. [end recording] Demirel pointed out that the invitation to visit Iran on 25 July was reiterated. Asked to comment on the UN debates scheduled for tomorrow in connection with the embargo on Iraq, Demirel stressed that Turkey's interests necessitate joint action with the world. [Begin Demirel recording] However, a great injustice is being done to Turkey. The embargo causes Turkey a loss of $3 billion to $5 billion annually. Also, the pipeline is corroding. It must be filled and emptied a few times. The United Nations and the coalition states, especially the United States, France, Britain, Germany, and Russia must show understanding. That is what we are hoping. [end recording] Demirel stated that Turkey has been stressing the issue for more than two years and urging Iraq to do whatever the United Nations asks it to do. He stressed that Turkey does not want Iraq to be divided. Iran too wants Iraq's territorial integrity to be maintained, he added.
