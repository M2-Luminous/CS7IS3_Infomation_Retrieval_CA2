Data can be entered on the new optical disk using a modified phase-change process, allowing it to be either partially or totally deleted by overwriting, Toshiba said. In phase-change optical disk drives, the reading and writing of data is achieved by converting the recording layer of the disk from an amorphous to a crystalline state and vice versa, using the heat emitted by a laser diode. Toshiba said the system represents a dramatic improvement over conventional rewritable magneto-optical disk systems, in which stored data cannot be changed without first erasing the whole section on which amended data is to be entered. The new optical disk will be suitable for application in a wide range of next-generation multimedia products that run on personal computers, Toshiba said.
