In his cordial exchange of views with Nguyen Huyen Chuoc, a labor hero and prominent machine installation expert, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said: [Vo Van Kiet] "Comrade, do you see any difference between the installation of this 500-kilovolt power transformer and that of a 200-kilovolt power transformer? [Nguyen Huyen Chuoc] "Well, in principle, there is no difference. We face a greater danger, however, in term of insulation here. Furthermore, this project calls for more stringent quality control measures and higher precision. [Vo Van Kiet] "Do you think that once you have completed the installation of this 500-kilovolt power transformer, you can improve your expertise and cooperate with foreign engineers in the future? [Nguyen Huyen Chuoc] "I am positive we can." Vo Van Kiet noted with pleasure that most of the work had been completed. He commended everyone for their great efforts to build the north-south 500-kilovolt power line, which is of great importance to the cause of national construction. The prime minister expressed his hope that everyone will continue to complete the remaining work with the highest results. Next, the prime minister called on the Vietnamese cadres and workers and Russian specialists at the Hoa Binh hydroelectric power plant where the last phase of the installation of the eighth group of generators was in progress. The prime minister reminded everyone of the need to make continued efforts to guarantee the highest level of quality for this last group of generators. During his two-day visit to Hoa Binh, Vo Van Kiet devoted much of his time to touring a number of production establishments and to working sessions with leading provincial officials. He also toured Nam Phong Village in Ky Son District, where he called on a number of households which performed very well in the movement to promote the household economy. Next, while touring Trung Phong Village, the prime minister expressed his keen interest in sugar cane planting. Afterward, he visited the Cao Phong state farm. In his exchange of views with Farm Director Hoang Huu Qui, the prime minister said: [Vo Van Kiet] "What is the average annual income of each household here?" [Hoang Huu Qui] "On the average, each worker here earns 20 million dong per year. Some outstanding workers earn as much as 40-45 million dong each per year. The farm management collects fees on basic depreciation and agricultural taxes. In addition, each worker also makes a three-percent contribution to the production insurance fund. Altogether, each worker contributes about 40 percent of his or her income and keeps the rest, which stands at about 60 percent." [Vo Van Kiet] "Is production stable?" [Hoang Huu Qui] "Yes, it is stable. For example, the yield of each orchard is about 150 quintals, or 15 tons." [Vo Van Kiet] "Are there any supplemental measures to increase the incomes of the farm and households?" [Hoang Huu Qui] "Well, we think that intensive cultivation is one way to increase our crop yield. We also think of ways to generate high-yield saplings, which, in turn, will yield higher revenues." Also at Ky Xuan District, Vo Van Kiet visited the forested area in Dan Hoa village. He urged the local administration and people to continue to plant forest trees and fruit orchards on denuded land to earn more income. After visiting various production establishments, Vo Van Kiet held a working session with the leading cadres of Hoa Binh. Comrade Nguyen Nhu Coc, secretary of the provincial party committee, briefed the prime minister on the socioeconomic situation of the province and its tasks for the days ahead. "In a talk to leading cadres of the province, Vo Van Kiet commended the provincial party organization and people for their efforts in improving the economic structure in accordance with the party lines and policies. He urged Hoa Binh to formulate plans to plant more crops and improve animal husbandry to produce a greater volume of products so as to provide good support to the processing industries. The province should play close attention to each village and help each family develop production to extricate themselves from poverty and strive to amass wealth through their great efforts." He also urged the province to formulate concrete plans to reduce the number of poor families by 20 percent annually, while striving to improve its economic structure through progress toward agro-industrial development. During the working session with leading cadres of Hoa Binh, Vo Van Kiet stressed the necessity of helping the local people overcome their difficulties and poverty, especially those who live in the Da River basin. He also stressed the importance of preserving forests around the Da River basin. The prime minister said: [Vo Van Kiet] "I heard that forests in the Da River basin are being destroyed by some people. If this is true, it is very dangerous. We must take most concrete measures to immediately stop deforestation there [words indistinct]. We must also formulate plans to help the local people engage in various kinds of trade. We must educate and motivate the local people to preserve the forests. For those who intend to destroy forests through illegal logging, we must take drastic measures against them. I would like to stress that first we must formulate plans to help the local people to overcome difficulties, while encouraging them to preserve forests in the Da River basin."
