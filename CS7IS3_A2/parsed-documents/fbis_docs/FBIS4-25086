There have been only 10 millimeters of precipitation since mid- May, or 60 to 90 percent less than the average rainfall in North China, officials for the State Anti-Drought Office (SADO) said yesterday. Rainfall in the South has been 50 to 60 percent less than the previous years in many parts of Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou provinces and some coastal areas of Guangdong Province and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Sichuan Province is hit by its worst drought in 25 years, affecting 115 counties with a population of more than 18.8 million. In most parts of China, the mercury has been rising higher and faster than in previous years, according to meteorologists. As a result, many fields have been parched by the windy and hot days that have persisted since late April and early May, the SADO's officials said. "The long spell of dry weather has already become a major threat to this year's summer harvest in the North because the following week is a critical period for the growth of winter wheat in the north farming areas," they warned. North China is one of the country's most important areas for growing winter wheat. According to the office's latest statistics, the affected farmland has reached nearly 8 million hectares including more than 5.8 million hectares of summer crops and over 2 million hectares of other fields. At least 5.7 million people and more than 5.1 million heads of livestock are finding it difficult to obtain enough drinking water. The hardest-hit areas of North China include Beijing and Tianjin cities, and most parts of Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, as well as eastern Shandong Province. In Shandong, parts of the Yellow River have repeatedly dried up, making it impossible for farmers to irrigate a large number of crops and cotton.
