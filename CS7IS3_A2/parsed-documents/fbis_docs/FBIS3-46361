Situated in the northwest part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai Province is one of China's four inland basins, and its deposits of sodium, potassium, magnesium, lithium and bromine rank first in the country. Jin Wanfu, chief engineer of the Geological and Mining Bureau, said the strontium deposit added greatly to the value of the basin. He said that the strontium deposit found in the basin amounts to more than 18 million tons. He said that the deposit is near the surface and easy to extract. Strontium is one of the materials for making electronic video tubes and strontium products are in strong demand at home and abroad. Qinghai Province has now set up a national strontium salt production association to coordinate the processing of strontium products in the country. Geologists have also discovered a 1,100-square-kilometer lake containing strontium. About 20 million cubic meters of the water can be made use of annually .
