The people in Tianjin gave their heartfelt praise to Comrade Dai Chengjiang, a Communist Party member and people's policeman. People reading the newsletter about his deeds were moved to tears. Comrade Dai Chengjiang was worthy of the praise given by the masses. People's policemen have certain powers for performing their official duties. It is rather convenient for them to use the powers in their hands to seek certain "real benefits" for themselves. Comrade Dai Chengjiang was always sober-headed in facing this issue, and drew a clear line of demarcation between public duties and personal gains. When performing official duties, he gave the "red light" to his personal affairs and the private affairs of his family and friends, and even refused to buy a pair of shoes for his wife at the wholesale price. Did he lead a well-off life? No. The difficulties he was facing was self-evident because he had to support a family of three generations with his salary alone, as his wife was working in a unit that was mired in financial difficulties. Then why did he turn down such little benefits? Because he was determined to safeguard the solemnity and purity of the national emblem on his cap, and to keep it from being sullied by self-interest and corruption. Comrade Dai Chengjiang was deeply aware that he had to always set strict demand on himself and keep himself incorrupt and honest in order to really win the masses' trust and support and to properly perform his official duties. Comrade Mao Zedong said: It is not hard for one to do a bit of good; what is hard is to do good all one's life and never do anything bad. Comrade Dai Chengjiang was precisely this kind of model Communist Party member. He always did good, not because he acted on impulse, not because he wanted to earn some capital for himself in order to climb to a higher position and gain greater benefits; instead he did good really and wholeheartedly for the purpose of seeking benefit for the people. In the eyes of some people, his behavior was "no longer suited to the current conditions" and he was too "silly." After Comrade Dai Chengjiang's death, however, Tianjin residents spontaneously braved the bitterly cold winds to take part in a funeral procession. This was the best evaluation of a man's life. Comrade Dai Chengjiang carried forward the Chinese nation's uprightness and the Communists' lofty belief. Seeing the strong repercussions evoked by Comrade Dai Chengjiang among the people, are the people who are keen only to seek private gains and line their pockets not ashamed of their behavior? Comrade Dai Chengjiang stood at his posts for more that 23 years and always faithfully performed his duties by doing innumerable little and ordinary things. The little things he did showed his lofty spirit, and the ordinary work shone with the splendor of dedication. This splendor lit up the hearts of hundreds of millions of people, and encouraged the vast numbers of cadres and masses to make progress and work with one heart and one mind by following in the footprints of the hero.
