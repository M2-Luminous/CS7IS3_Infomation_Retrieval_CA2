The meeting, which began at 1200 at the president's residence and continued through lunch, lasted approximately two hours. In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said that he held constructive and beneficial talks with Clark and the contacts were positive for the Turkish Cypriot side. Denktas reported that he explained the situation to Clark within the framework of the letter sent to the UN secretary general. Denktas added: I believe they were satisfied. Pointing out that the UN envoy will also meet with Greek Cypriot Administration leader Glavkos Kliridhis and is trying to obtain results from the talks, Denktas remarked that he is trying to be of assistance. The president stressed that the Turkish Cypriots' position and principles are known, adding that he reaffirmed that the Turkish Cypriot side is ready to conduct any kind of negotiations as long as these principles are upheld. Asked if he is subjected to any pressure, Denktas said: No, there is no such thing. In reply to a question if he was given a message on a possible change in Kliridhis' attitude, Denktas remarked that it is the result that is important in such contacts and there is no result yet. Denktas was also asked if any distance was covered, to which he retorted: We did whatever was necessary. Now, we think that the Greek Cypriot side must inform the secretary general in a letter on what they plan to do and what they accept. Recalling that Clark arrived on the island in a bid to accelerate the negotiating process, the president expressed the belief that he achieved this. Answering another question, Denktas said that the preliminary preparations must be conducted in Cyprus before going to New York. Denktas underlined that the changes for progress in the talks will increase if the Greek Cypriot side conveys to its new generation and accepts the fact that the Cyprus problem stems from the Greek Cypriots' wish to annex the island to Greece. Replying to reporters' questions after the meeting, Clark expressed the conviction that all the meetings he held in Cyprus were useful. Noting that he does not wish to make any comments at this stage, Clark said that he may issue a statement before departing the island tomorrow. Asked if he will meet again with Denktas after his meeting with Kliridhis, Clark said that he may establish contact on the telephone.
