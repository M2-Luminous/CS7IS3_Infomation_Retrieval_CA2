Michael Williams was speaking to reporters as UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi dislcosed in a statement in Sarajevo that UN officials had begun an "urgent review" of UNPROFOR operations in light of the deteriorating situation in Gorazde. The mainly Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia is a UN-declared safe haven but is currently under siege by Bosnian Serb forces. "The Gorazde crisis has brought us to an impasse," Williams said. He argued that UNPROFOR had three options before it: "a pullout from Bosnia, a completely new role and mandate with far greater resources in terms of troops, ... or total compliance by Bosnian Serb authorities (with UN orders)." Williams stressed that UNPROFOR's operation had been rendered "completely inadequate" because of a refusal by Bosnian Serbs to cooperate and stressed that UN troops have not been assigned an offensive military role. He explained that Akashi is only entitled to authorize the limited use of close air support by one or two NATO planes on a precise target -- as was the case Saturday when British aircraft were ordered to attack a Serb tank in Gorazde. In the event, no strikes took place because of bad weather and one of the planes was shot down, its pilot ejecting safely. Williams said Akashi cannot order a general air operation on an entire zone, as such authorization must come from UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. There are currently 17 UN military and civilian personnel in Gorazde, the UN spokesman said. UNPROFOR strength in all of former Yugoslavia today stands at 30,000 troops, most of whom are serving in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. The UN Security Council on March 31 approved an increase of 3,500 soldiers for UNPROFOR after the United States objected to plans to boost force strength by 10,000 men.
