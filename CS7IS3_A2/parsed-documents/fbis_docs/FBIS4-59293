He revived the shameful memory of Camp David through signing of an accord with the Zionist regime. Signing the accord was followed by waves of violence and people's hatred against the PLO leaders and the Zionist regime. The accord known as limited self-rule in Gaza and Jericho was signed in Cairo on May 4 between PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and Prime Minister of the Zionist regime Yitzhaq Rabin. Even the most optimistic observers doubt the successful implementation of the accord in view of its ambiguity. Palestinian activists believe that the intifada will determine the fate of Palestine and that the Palestinian nation will never betray the blood of thousands of Palestinian martyrs. An expert on the Middle East issues, Dr. Amir Reza'i, told IRNA Tuesday that the Gaza-Jericho plan was an obvious treason to the cause of Palestine and the main objective of the plan was to suppress intifada. He said the Zionist regime is now trying to sow discord among the Palestinians in an attempt to eliminate their movement. The extensive protest movement in Jericho, Gaza Strip, Halhul, al-Khalil and Ramallah in recent days showed that the plan of the Zionists will not succeed and remain a mirage for Israeli leaders, he said. A general study of the plan formulated by the United States, Russia and some other western states in Madrid conference in 1991 indicated that the only matter that they ignored was the interests of the Palestinians, Reza'i said.
