With regard to the issue of North Korea's development of nuclear arms, Watanabe said, "This should still be resolved through dialogue; I am opposed to sanctions." The Japanese Government has informed the United States of its support of the draft UN Security Council resolution proposing five forms of sanctions, including arms embargo. His position directly contradicts government policy. Watanabe further pointed out the need to: 1) ask Japan and other countries concerned to bring about an early reopening of talks between the United States and North Korea; 2) resume the Japan-DPRK normalization talks unconditionally; and 3) prepare for visits of North Korean VIP's to Japan to promote exchanges between various sectors of Japan and North Korea in order to create correct public opinion in Japan.
