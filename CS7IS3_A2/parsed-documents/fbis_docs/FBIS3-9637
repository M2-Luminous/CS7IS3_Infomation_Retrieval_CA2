[Demirel] At this time, Turkey continues to enjoy the fruits of democracy with all its principles, bodies, and concepts. Democratic freedoms have been institutionalized and the constitutional system guarantees democratic freedoms and the observance of human rights for everyone. Turkey has successfully gone through the transition process to a free market economy. So far 70 percent of Turkey's economy has been liberalized. A substantial improvement in the qualification of human resources and of the potential of entrepreneurs have helped us open rapidly to the world. Along with the conclusion of the Cold War, Turkey's geopolitical and economic situation gained in importance and we have become an island of stability both in our area and in the world. At this point, we are in the midst of the instability in our area. In accordance with the UN Charter and international law, we assume responsibility in bringing peace and stability in these sources of conflict. [Oroveanu] Mr. President, with what thoughts have you come to Romania on this visit? [Demirel] The Turkish people have always harbored feelings of friendship for the Romanian people. We have lived in peace throughout history, both during good and bad times. We share common ideals and aims regarding the promotion of our nation's wellbeing and regarding peace and stability in the area in which we live. Our relations are based on mutual respect and cooperation. Thus, the means to intensify relations between the two countries have always been clear. It is enough to consider the list of recent official visits, at all levels, to Turkey or to Romania to realize the potential of our political will to continue to develop our friendly relations. These visits are excellent opportunities to identify -- on the basis of the already existing potential -- new and varied realms of cooperation between our countries. These visits also permit us to consult each other about important questions of regional interest for both countries. The search for new opportunities of cooperation regarding global problems is also one of our common aims. Finally, we believe that the "Treaty of Friendship, Good-Neighborliness, and Cooperation" between Turkey and Romania reflects the desire for peace by the two peoples. With these thoughts I am looking forward to my visit to Romania. [Oroveanu] Considering the political, historic, and geographical situation, in your opinion, what role may Turkey and Romania play together in our area and in the existing overall international relations? [Demirel] The traditional friendship between Turkey and Romania does not only represent the foundation for intensifying cooperation between the two countries in all areas, but also constitutes a factor for ensuring an atmosphere of peace, understanding, and cooperation in the Balkans. Turkey and Romania are two important countries in this area. From a regional point of view, our countries are important in the Balkans both in terms of population and economic potential. Both endorse a responsible policy of promoting peace and stability in this area. Both are struggling for seeking a just and lasting solution to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Their desire to contribute to peace in this area is welcomed by the international community. Therefore, it is natural for the excellent relations between Turkey and Romania to contribute to establishing stability in the Balkans. At the same time, both Turkey and Romania want to be part of the European structures, whose principles they honestly embrace. They are both members of the Treaty of Cooperation in the Black Sea Area and both support the initiatives for cooperation in the Balkans. Turkey and Romania and, like them, the entire area have gained a great deal from cooperating within these forums, as well as within other regional and international organizations. [Oroveanu] Mr. President, in your view, what are the chances for the cooperation projects in the Black Sea area and its immediate vicinity? [Demirel] As you know, there is a significant economic potential in the Black Sea area, including natural resources. We believe that economic cooperation in the Black Sea basin will help the countries in this area benefit from this potential. We are confident that the establishment of lasting multilateral economic relations based on free trade will contribute to the prosperity of this area. The chances for the success of the Treaty of Cooperation in the Black Sea Area (BSEC) affirm themselves along with the transformation process experienced by most of the economies in the BSEC countries. One has to bear in mind, however, that BSEC represents a long-term investment the fruits of which will be noted in the long run. Anyhow, there are already a number of short-term projects under way; the accords on their implementation have already been signed. These projects will be followed by short-, medium- and long-term projects in the area of transportation. A problem we may confront is the one of identifying appropriate sources for financing these projects. Our experience proves that the true problem consists in presenting feasible projects. The creation of the Bank for Trade and Development of the Black Sea proves the growing interest of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and of international financial circles in the BSEC projects, and it also proves that feasible projects may ensure their own financing. Thus, if the private sector, the leading force behind BSEC, may come up with feasible projects, there is a great chance that they will be implemented. Within this context, we attach particular importance to developing economic and trade relations with Romania. I would like to remind you that the number of Turkish companies doing business with Romania has exceeded 2,500 in the past four years and the capital invested in this country amounts to $30 million. During my visit, we will attend the opening of the Turkish-Romanian Bank. The results we have achieved in these four years should not be underrated. We are sure that this positive trend will also continue in the not too distant future. [Oroveanu] Mr. President, would you like to address a few words to the readers of our paper? [Demirel] As I have mentioned before, Turkey and Romania share numerous goals and ideals regarding the promotion of the well-being and prosperity of their two peoples and in the area as a whole. We have to continue to make efforts in this direction. Both our countries have large resources, both human and natural, supported by their attachment to the democratic ideals and the principles of the free economy, so that nothing can hamper the settlement of the problems we are facing. From this point of view, we are ready to support Romania by any possible means. We wish the Romanian people success in fulfilling their aspirations.
