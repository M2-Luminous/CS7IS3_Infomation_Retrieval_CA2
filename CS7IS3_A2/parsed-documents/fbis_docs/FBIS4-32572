I would be interested in hearing your view of the prospects in our mutual relations. [Havel] Romania and Bulgaria are two European states with a rich and interesting history. These two states have the same importance as any other state of that region. In a few years' time, these two states could reach a level comparable to that of Greece or any other state that has not experienced a period of communism. These two states are following a complicated path of tackling the consequences of communism, as are we. In many aspects, we are ahead of them. They are well aware of this and are look upon us with almost uncritical respect. However, at the same time, I think that any belittling attitude towards these countries is misplaced. [passage omitted] [Hulkova] It is clear that behind any trip of a high official there is a question asked by the citizens of our country: What are we going gain from it? This is what matters. [passage omitted] [Havel] The Balkans are also part of Europe. I have gradually visited all European countries, or almost all of them. This has been a part of my long-term plan, through which I am realizing the idea of returning to Europe, becoming a part of Europe. We must not think that Europe is only Brussels. Europe also includes Romania, Europe also includes Bulgaria. We want to have good relations with all European states, both political and economic relations. [passage omitted] Europe does not consist of only the member states of the European Union. [Hulkova] I think it was after your talks with the Bulgarian president that you spoke in favor of cooperation and closer contacts but not in favor of doing so under an umbrella of institutions because this would simply lead to a further division of Europe rather than its unification. How was this idea received? [Havel] We agreed on it with President Zhelev. I think this view has begun to prevail in our countries. I have discussed this with many officials from various countries. All of us have begun to feel that turning the alliance and community spirit of the former communist countries into institutions incorporates the danger of some sort of new division. There are people in the West for whom this would make life easier because it is simpler for them to deal with us as if we were some sort of alternative bloc, a counterpart, a partner, as they dealt for decades with the Warsaw Pact or CEMA. This is, of course, simpler than to perceive every single country as an individual country, as a legitimate democratic country that strives to become a legitimate part of the European democratic structures. This is why I perceive as dangerous all those hints, emerging now and then, coming above all from the West, expressing their preference to see us all in one bag and to deal in a certain manner with that one bag. However, this is not advantageous for us. [passage omitted] [Hulkova] It is obviously in the greatest interest of the West to have good relations with Russia; therefore, I would like to hear your comment from this point of view on the signing by Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev of the Partnership for Peace, especially as this has consequences even for us. Can we be less fearful of their enormous armed might and strength? [Havel] I thought from the beginning and also had discussions to this effect when I met President Clinton here concerning Partnership for Peace, that there must be some kind of partnership-based relations between the North Atlantic alliance and Russia. I felt that there must be good relations, which is in the interest of Europe and the world. That relationship will always be in a certain manner specific because Russia is a large Eurasian nuclear power that is surrounded by its own security system, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and that is in an entirely different position from a small Central European country like ours. Whether Partnership for Peace should be a starting point for good relations between the alliance and Russia I was not sure. I was more inclined toward the view that it should, that Partnership for Peace was such an open program that made possible so many different means of implementation that it could indeed be the starting point for that necessary good relationship with Russia. Now, of course, it also depends on the content with which it is implemented. I cannot imagine that it could be implemented with the same content as is desired by us for the Partnership for Peace program. For us, it is the first stage toward legitimate, full membership in the alliance. I cannot imagine Russia as part of the North Atlantic alliance. That is an almost nonsensical notion, is it not? However, friendship and good cooperation between the alliance and Russia are unavoidable. What is most significant about the Russian signing is the fact that it is not linked to any special position in the sense that Russia could advise the alliance as to who it may or may not accept as a member, how it may or may not expand, that it could have some kind of veto, that it could have a privileged position in this respect on account of its being more powerful. I think attempts were presumably made to link the signing of Partnership for Peace to this kind of specific position, and, fortunately, they did not succeed. [Hulkova] This is exactly what I wanted to ask as regards the right of veto. I would like to know what is, in your view, the meaning of the fact that the alliance has resisted this pressure and that this idea has been put forward by Russia? [Havel] The fact that it was voiced by Russia probably reflects Russia's internal political situation. Russia is a country going through a shock following the loss of superpower status, following the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the loss of its former satellites. Moreover, this is a country where pushing through economic reforms is incomparably more difficult than in our country. Its citizens are suffering much more. It is a country without great democratic traditions; there are social, national, and other tensions there. The loss of superpower status is, of course, felt painfully there, and this is to a certain extent reflected in certain tones present in their foreign policy, which seems to be attempting to calm society with impressions of some kind of special status. This is also linked to the traditional Russian distrust of others, above all those to the west of them. They fear the alliance expanding eastward, as though an enemy were approaching. They must understand that the eastward expansion of the alliance means extending the zone of democracy, freedom, peace, and civic principles and that this is nothing to threaten Russia, that, on the contrary, this is something that, by means of radiation, could help Russia. I consider it good that the West has managed to defend this idea that we, the former Soviet satellites, kept repeating--I wrote various articles on this, published in the United States and elsewhere--that it has managed to defend this fundamental position against Russian attempts to win some special status. This is a sign of a certain faithfulness to one's own principles and to the principles on which the community is based. [Hulkova] With regard to developments on the domestic political scene, undoubtedly the most important and certainly the most interesting point was the fact that this week the government did not approve Kalvoda's concept of higher territorial and administrative units. What is your view? [Havel] Because I anticipated this question, I prepared a note. Allow me to read it out to you. It is obvious that democracy cannot be limited only to the state level and that most of the decisionmaking process should be transferred directly to the citizens. That is why the reform of state administration and its decentralization will be the paramount task of the government in this sphere in the coming period. These two points are a condition of the success of economic transformation and of the functioning of a free civic society. The government will make sure that regional and local self-administration is implemented in the area it will specify to a greater degree than has been the case so far. The territorial setup of the state will correspond to the basic requirement of democracy, which constitutes the transfer of decisionmaking powers and responsibility as close as possible to the citizen. This territorial setup will be based on self-administered communities, natural regions or possibly historical territorial units equipped with relevant powers and funds, which will lower their dependence on the Republic's budget and will enhance the citizen's coresponsibility for the development of the community in which he lives. We want our society to be a civic society. We shall be defending its basic principles. [Hulkova] Excuse me, but the note you referred to is, in fact, the government policy statement. [Havel] Yes it is, precisely. It is the government policy statement delivered by the government in the parliament two years ago. On the basis of this policy statement, parliament voiced confidence in the government. Two years have gone by and here we are! The coalition lacks concord on the basic outline of the reform of public administration, which is absolutely essential. I have serious concerns about this. I intend to step up my dealing with this issue, or perhaps get involved in it somehow. I firmly believe that our ruling coalition will recall its policy statement and that it will quickly unite on the nature of this reform and its timetable. [Hulkova] If I understand this correctly, you no longer regard this problem as an everyday problem of the coalition. [Havel] I think that the controversy within the ruling coalition is quite serious. [passage omitted] It is a matter of a consensus within the ruling coalition to arrive at a decision with which all four parties [of the Czech coalition] will eventually agree. Up until now, this has been attained. I firmly believe that a consensus will be attained even in this case. This appears to be the most serious dispute within the coalition. [Hulkova] You have mentioned your intention of joining the game. Do you regard yourself as a sufficiently strong player? [Havel] I do not know to what extent I am a strong or a weak player, but what I do know is that the president's duty is to contribute to the country's political stability, to look after the country and possibly even to make sure that the promises given to citizens have been adhered to.
