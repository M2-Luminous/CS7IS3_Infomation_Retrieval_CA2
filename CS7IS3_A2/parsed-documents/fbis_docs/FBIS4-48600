"It was the legislation passed in Parliament that brought me into the election," Chief Buthelezi said. Answering reporters' questions on his way to joining his cabinet colleagues for their first meeting at Tuynhuys, Mr Buthelezi said the Ingonyama [kings'] Trust Act had been debated in open session in the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly. In terms of the legislation, the 1.2 million hectares of KwaZulu tribal land -- that would have become state property under the new constitution -- was ceded to Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. The legislation had been approved by former President FW de Klerk "in the way that he signs all legislation". Mr de Klerk approved the Ingonyama Trust Act on April 25, four days after it was passed by the KwaZulu government. "All communal land was always protected. It was to prevent it becoming state land," he said. The land was transferred to the KwaZulu government three years ago. "I don't find anything controversial in it," he said. Chief Buthelezi said the issue would not be discussed at the cabinet meeting.
