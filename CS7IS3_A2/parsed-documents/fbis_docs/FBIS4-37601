Seemingly another encounter of the Israeli-Palestinian committee on Jerusalem affairs. This time, however, Shahal was not planning to hold a discussion, but rather to convey a clear-cut message. "The agreement stipulates that the Palestinian administration's institutions will be located in Jericho. That is where you belong. I warn you on behalf of the prime minister," Shahal stressed, "that if Orient House turns into a governing institution serving the autonomy, we will be forced to take action against it. Israel will not tolerate any independent Palestinian policing activities in Jerusalem. We will not hesitate to take punitive action." Al-Husayni tried to defend himself. "We have no intention of establishing a governing institution, we plan to provide the residents with services and to maintain ties with consuls. And why should you have problems with our guards?" al-Husayni asked innocently, "Did we not refuse your offer of guns?" The next day both sides flexed their muscles. Shahal dispatched four Border Police jeeps and placed them demonstratively at the Orient House gates, while al-Husayni, in an attempt to highlight the Orient House aims, invited all consuls based in East Jerusalem to a special briefing. On Monday night, al-Husayni organized a rally of solidarity with Jerusalem at Orient House, and on Tuesday afternoon, acting in perfect sync with the media, he invited East Jerusalem homeowners who had received house demolition notices, to lodge complaints against the Israeli orders. On Wednesday morning, totally ignoring the political storm around Peres' letter on the issue of Jerusalem -- and perhaps for spite -- Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi announced the establishment of the Palestinian Citizens Rights Society in Jerusalem. The committee's headquarters are, of course, in Orient House. Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine, the Palestinians announced even before negotiations on the city's future were launched. The PLO started investing efforts in strengthening the city's Arab-Islamic status as well as its political status as early as in mid-1970's. In early 1980's, dozens of institutions, organizations, and research bodies were ordered to launch operations inside Jerusalem; they were even granted appropriate financial backing. In parallel, the PLO invested ample funds to establish an alternative to the Israeli rule in the city. The Israeli defense establishment was aware of the process even before the intifadah. Reports were written, warnings relayed, declarations made. In practice, almost nothing was done to block this political development. When the Israeli public representatives woke up this week, it was too late. The facts that had been established in East Jerusalem made the city a Palestinian political center. Faysal al-Husayni said this week that the battle for Jerusalem has been launched. "Al-Husayni is right," prime minister's bureau sources said, "it is a war for the city. The Palestinians will have no choice, they will have to honor the agreement and move all autonomy-serving Jerusalem institutions to Jericho." Rabin did declare war on these institutions, but the publication of Peres' letter to Jorgen Holst, the late Norwegian foreign minister, bungled the issue. The Palestinians flaunted the letter, which legitimized the activities of East Jerusalem institutions established prior to the Oslo agreement. (By the way, no new institutions were established last year because of the PLO's empty coffers, not because of the agreement.) Moreover, the letter promised to encourage the development of these institutions. The opposition -- most notably Beni Begin -- raged and fumed. Ari'el Sharon failed to understand the brouhaha. All these institutions were established in the Likud era, he said. The Orient House building acquired the status of the "nascent Palestinian government house" during the Likud era. The building, owned by the al-Husayni family, was built at the end of the previous century. It was a lodge and a hotel for many years. In early 1980's, al-Husayni used it to house the Center for Arab Studies. On a Shin Bet recommendation, the Central Command commander used a special warrant to close the building at the beginning of the intifadah. In August 1990, the warrant expired. Those were the pre-Gulf-war days. The defense chiefs were so preoccupied with their fear of Iraqi Scud missiles that they forgot to renew the warrant. In the wake of Baker's shuttle tour and the start of negotiations that were to lead to the Madrid Conference, Orient House assumed a patently political character. The "territories PLO" established its command in the building, which became the Palestinian delegation's official residence. It was used for working sessions and news conferences. It was -- and still is -- used for fax and telephone communication with the PLO. The technical teams -- working groups, each of which was assigned a topic -- that were established as quasi-ministries of the incipient Palestinian government, were also stationed in the building. Computer and telephone systems were installed. Secretaries, clerks, and economic, administrative, and legal experts filled the rooms. The Palestinian diplomatic section, headed by Faysal al-Husayni, was also stationed in the building. Consuls based in East Jerusalem began making pilgrimages to the house. They were followed by Tel-Aviv-based ambassadors, foreign ministers, and foreign delegations. About two years ago, after Faysal al-Husayni declared the establishment of the Palestinian shadow government, its members dispersed throughout the building. Since they now required security arrangements, a security officer was appointed. A fence was put up, an electric fence was installed. Fatah youths were hired as guards, becoming the first nucleus of the Palestinian police in the territories. On al-Husayni's recommendation, they were sent for special training with the Jordanian police, where they learned weapons handling. Nowadays the building is guarded 24 hours a day. All visitors, including reporters, are inspected by security guards. A large antenna for the Jerusalem-PLO wireless communication system was installed on the roof. On 13 September 1993, the day the Oslo agreement was signed, the Palestinian flag was flown from the Orient House flagpole in a festive ceremony. It has been there ever since. After the Hebron massacre, it was lowered to half mast. When the Japanese foreign minister visited the building three weeks ago, the Japanese and Palestinian flags were flown side by side, in accordance with the rules of diplomatic etiquette. A parliamentary delegation from Turkey visited Orient House a few days ago and a joint cooperation agreement between Palestine and France was signed there 10 days ago. This week, Prime Minister Rabin finally decided to put an end to this PLO enclave inside Jerusalem. He asked the attorney general to examine legal steps to stop the activities at Orient House. Rabin did not rule out the possibility of asking the Knesset to enact legislation barring any non-governmental bodies from conducting foreign relations from territory within the State of Israel. Rabin would encounter no problem in trying to pass such legislation. The Likud would give him its full support. Defense establishment officials this week said: "It is true that this building was in operation before the Oslo agreement. The problem, however, is that its activities have been imbued with new content." The officials explained that "an attempt is being made, also as part of the internal Palestinian power struggles waged by Faysal al-Husayni, to strengthen the status of Jerusalem vis a vis Gaza and Jericho. Al-Husayni is also trying to set up a private police force." The officials cautioned: "One must be alert to these developments before it is too late." Al-Hakawati theater -- the Palestinian national stage -- is a short walk away from Orient House. Although the hall was originally built for theatrical companies, it has mainly served as a national conference hall, sort of like a Palestinian version of Jerusalem's Binyeney Ha'uma hall. The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], women's and student organizations from all over the territories, as well as Fatah all hold conventions there. The theater blossomed during the Likud's tenure. Even then, the theater building, much like Orient House, attained a special status: the police never burst into the hall when the Palestinian flag was flown there, or when the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] held its conventions. The policemen always stayed in the courtyard. The offices of the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation [PBC] are on an adjacent street. PBC Chairman Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, and his team of advisers are currently preparing Palestinian radio and television broadcasts. These broadcasts, of course, will not be restricted to the residents of Jericho and the Gaza Strip. This office also serves as the Palestinian government press office. For example, it is responsible for issuing special press cards to journalists, Israelis as well, who want to enter the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The office provides information services, and whenever necessary, transportation, translation services, and escorts. The Palestinian economic office, PECDAR [Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction], which is in charge of economic development and building the Palestinian economic infrastructure, is located in north Jerusalem, in the Dahiyat al-Barid neighborhood. This office is currently preparing the autonomy's budget and is already allocating sums that have yet to arrive from European countries and the United States. PECDAR is formulating plans, at this stage, for economic projects in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The Palestinian medical infrastructure has also been set up in Jerusalem. It includes the Higher Palestinian Council for Health in East Jerusalem, the national al-Maqasid Hospital on the Mount of Olives, and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, which is located not far from Orient House. The General Federation of Palestinian Charity Organizations, one of the most important institutions in Palestinian society in the territories, operates similar to the Israeli National Insurance Institute and channels contributions from abroad to the residents of the territories. The monies are transferred from the federation's offices in Jerusalem to local charity organizations throughout the territories, including in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Bayt Hanina is home to the General Federation of Trade Unions -- the Palestinians' own Histadrut labor federation. Palestinian housing affairs are handled by the higher Palestinian council on housing, which is located near the Israeli construction and housing minister's bureau. This office will soon receive a large budget for building in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Recently, it has begun construction on a housing project near Jabalyah, using funds contributed by the EC before the Oslo agreement. In Jericho, land has already been allocated for the construction of a housing complex. Jerusalem is also home to "al-Quds University," which, at this stage, only comprises several buildings scattered around the city. However, plans for the national campus have already been made. The higher education council also has offices in Jerusalem. Even Gaza's Islamic University has a liaison office in the eastern part of the city. The higher Palestinian councils on tourism, industry, culture, and information are all located in East Jerusalem. These constitute, for all practical intents and purposes, the ministries of the incipient Palestinian state. Jerusalem also houses the Palestinian organizations which wage the political and public relations battles: the various research institutes, newspaper offices, the associations of Palestinian students and writers, the Palestinian Council on Foreign Relations, and a large computerized translation institute. The United States and six European countries maintain consulates in East Jerusalem, which serve as conduits for the marketing of the political struggle. Naturally, it is easy for the Palestinians to maintain political activity in Jerusalem. Israeli law, which applies to Jerusalem, is far more flexible than the military orders in the territories. There are no curfews in Jerusalem. There is no army. The telecommunications systems are more developed. No restrictions are put on conventions and rallies as in the territories. When Palestinian functionaries from Hebron, Nabulus, or even Gaza decide to launch a political struggle, not only against Israel but also within the domestic Palestinian arena, they prefer to do it in Jerusalem or conduct their battles through the offices in East Jerusalem. That is why Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi, seeking a prominent platform from which to attack 'Arafat, was provided with a stage in Jerusalem. Not only the PLO is firmly established in the city. The PFLP's political headquarters, and its magazine offices are also in Jerusalem. The DFLP also has offices in town. The Association of Muslim Sages, which guides Hamas and grants religious legitimacy to its activities is also located in Jerusalem. The main office of QUDS PRESS, the London-based Hamas news agency, is quite near al-Husayni's house. Each of these dozens of offices could be housed in a single room, but their combined presence is what gives them power. This state of affairs began a long time before Oslo; however, the continuation of the peace process, with the issue of Jerusalem at its center, has increased the level of Palestinian awareness with regard to the city. For all this, one must also add Jerusalem's holy status in the eyes of all Muslims. Temple Mount serves as the focus for religious feelings which quickly turn to nationalistic sentiments on the ground. At the same time, there is the surrounding infrastructure of religious institutions -- the religious courts in the territories, the Waqf, and the Supreme Islamic Council -- which also transform the city into something approaching a Palestinian capital. Defense establishment officials recently prepared a list of all the Palestinian offices and bodies. "If they wish to honor the agreement, they have to remove all the institutions which are not directly related to the Palestinian residents of Jerusalem," the officials said. "We are not asking them to vacate al-Maqasid Hospital or liquidate any local soccer clubs. However, the bureau of statistics, the economic office, the post office, and the offices for water and development must be located in Jericho." Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, who also has an office in Jerusalem, claims that the Israeli policy is an attempt to alter the city's status quo. "These institutions are not new," he says, "they were there all the time, even before Madrid. One must remember that the agreement stipulates that the central institutions will be in Gaza and Jericho. As for the other institutions, which serve the general Palestinian populace and have nothing to do with the Gaza-Jericho First agreement, these can be in Jerusalem." Abu-Zayyad explains: "I am not talking about political matters but about institutions that serve a community." Abu-Zayyad goes on to firmly assert: "East Jerusalem will be the capital of Palestine. I am not saying that this will happen now, but it will become our capital in the framework of a peace agreement."
