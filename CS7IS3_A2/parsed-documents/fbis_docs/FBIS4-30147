You recently attended the meeting in Phnom Penh of the roundtable commission for national reconciliation and peace. On behalf of the Voice of the Great National Union Front of Cambodia radio [VGNUFC], please comment on the two items on that meeting's agenda. Why did the meeting fail to agree on the agenda as called for by the Cambodian nation and people, who want national reconciliation and peace? [Chan Youran] I would like to express sincere thanks to our VGNUFC for giving me the opportunity to talk about this meeting. On 15 June, the meeting, chaired by Samdech Nhoek Chulong, representative of the king, agreed to abide by the king's guidance by adopting the following agenda. First, an unconditional, immediate, and permanent cease-fire nationwide. Second, the minimal policy program proposed by the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] to the meeting which has received the king's consent. During the discussion about the agenda, our Democratic Kampuchea [DK] delegation expressed the following views: 1. The PDK was attending the meeting as a Cambodian side, equal to all other Cambodian sides, with rights equal to other Cambodian sides to discuss the two items. 2. Legally, these two items have the same status and value. The meeting's responsibility is to discuss the two items because they form an entity for national reconciliation and peace. If only one item is discussed and the other left out, this is neither just nor correct. This cannot solve the Cambodian problem and achieve national reconciliation quickly. Our nation and people very much want a quick end to the war and their great suffering and hardship in order to have ordinary lives again. Our nation and people want genuine national reconciliation and national concord. Therefore, we ask that all sides take this opportunity to respond to the sacred aspiration of our nation and people by discussing the two items and striving to solve the problem gradually. The representative of Prince Ranariddh, chairman of FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia], and the representative of Chea Sim and Hun Sen of the Cambodian People's Party, puppet of communist Vietnam, did not respond to these views. They only talked about the cease-fire, but refused to discuss proper and strict supervision. They did not accept a competent committee to deal with this issue. So, our delegation said this: You are cheating on this cease-fire because it is not genuine and definitive throughout the country. It is not a cease-fire within the framework of national reconciliation. It is a cease-fire without proper and strict supervision by a competent committee or technical group. Furthermore, you did not say a word about national reconciliation because you are afraid of this. You refused to talk about the minimal policy program, which is the basis of the national reconciliation and peace policy. You only talked about the cease-fire to dupe national and international public opinion in order to continue fueling the war in Cambodia. These people could not answer. They remained quiet; they were stuck. Samdech Nhoek Chulong, chairman of the meeting, and many observers noted that our side's stance is correct and reasonable. For this reason, Samdech Nhoek Chulong decided to let our delegation read the PDK clarification on the minimal policy program. I read our address dealing with the minimal policy from the beginning to the end. These people had their heads down. In sum, these people categorically oppose national reconciliation and peace. They oppose a genuine national government and national army in accordance with the sacred aspiration of our nation and people. Our nation and people and the PDK, however, are absolutely determined to achieve national reconciliation and peace so that our Cambodia will not become a second Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian territory now part of southern Vietnam].
