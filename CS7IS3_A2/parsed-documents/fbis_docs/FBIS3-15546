According to initial reports, this group is to include newspaper editors and representatives of news agencies and television and radio broadcasting companies. The editors cited as the causes of the current crisis of the "fourth estate" the monopolism of the Ministry of Communications and the impossibility of destatizing printing plants with the participation of editorial collectives. In the words of Pavel Gusev, chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists, the mechanism for subsidizing publications must be immediately changed, creating equal conditions of survival for them. It was also observed that all branches of power should be legislatively prohibited from being sponsors of mass media. Ivan Rybkin gave assurances that the State Duma has no "pretensions to run or control the press." He stressed that the State Duma intends to support the mass media and save them from the "burden of ruthless economic censorship." Ivan Rybkin proposed that mass media leaders join in elaborating the draft law on the functioning of the mass media in 1994-1995, which will enable the press to secure a dignified existence in the crisis period. In his opinion, this draft law should include priority measures to ensure the press' survival. The draft law is due to be examined in session by the State Duma in late April.
