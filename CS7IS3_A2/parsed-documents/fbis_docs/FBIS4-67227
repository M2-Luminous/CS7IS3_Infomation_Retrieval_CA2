This X, a citizen of Turkmenistan, led a large criminal group which transported narcotics from Southeast Asia to Central Asia. In Rostov the mafioso hoped to lie low and acquire new contacts. Employees of the Rostov counterintelligence administration press service believe this operation has been a very successful and remarkable one. On the one hand a palpable blow has been dealt to the drug mafia and on the other there has been a demonstration of the now so rare close collaboration and cooperation between the special services of republics of the former USSR in the struggle against organized crime.
