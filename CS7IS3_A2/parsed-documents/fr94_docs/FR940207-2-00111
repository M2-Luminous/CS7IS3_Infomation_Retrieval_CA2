FR940207-2-00111 FR940207-2-00060 NUCLEAR WASTE TECHNICAL REVIEW BOARD Panel on the Engineered Barrier System Looks at Engineered Barrier Research, Tours Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Pursuant to its authority under section 5051 of Public Law 100&hyph;203, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board's Panel on the Engineered Barrier System will hold a one-day meeting on March 10, 1994, on current and planned research on the engineered barriers that could be used in a potential repository at Yucca Mountain. A site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, currently is being characterized by the Department of Energy (DOE) for its suitability as the possible location of a permanent repository for civilian spent fuel and defense high-level waste. The meeting, which is open to the public, will be held at the Sheraton Inn, 5115 Hopyard Road, Pleasanton, California 94588; telephone (510) 460&hyph;8800; fax (510) 847&hyph;9455. An important focus of the meeting will be the DOE's strategy and timing for determining what the long-term corrosion performance will be for materials_particularly modern materials such as stainless steels and nickel alloys. The Board also is interested in current and future linkages between engineered barrier system research and performance assessment and in the corrosion models to be used in the next total systems performance assessment. Other subjects to be covered include (in-repository) criticality control, the DOE's plans and timing for developing research on filler materials for canisters, changes in engineered barrier system research plans due to the evolution of the waste package design, the effects of human materials and products on repository performance, and the potential for corrosion influenced by microbes in an unsaturated repository. The Board has invited representatives from the DOE and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to make presentations at the meeting. On Friday, March 11, 1994, LLNL representatives will conduct a brief morning tour of the laboratory facilities, ending no later than noon. Transportation for the tour will be provided by the laboratory. The tour is open to the public, but space is limited, and all who wish to attend must preregister as soon as possible. Submit the following information to Frank Randall at the Board's offices (Tel: 703&hyph;235&hyph;4473; Fax: 703&hyph;235&hyph;4495) no later than February 17, 1994: Complete name, home address, telephone number, social security number, place of birth, date of birth, and your business name and address. You must also bring a photo-ID with you to the badging office when beginning the tour. Please indicate what type you will bring, the ID number, and the state where it was issued. Transcripts of the meeting will be available on computer disk or on a library-loan basis in paper format from Victoria Reich, Board librarian, beginning April 22, 1994.
