FR941117-0-00111 FR941117-0-00011 (1) Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 must be used as the value for h in the above formula. (2) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction, or 0.1 Watt, whichever is more. (3) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the service contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function of angle. However, in resolving petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate the distance to the service contour using the formula in paragraph (c) of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station radial and additional radials above and below the inter-station radial at 2.5 ○ intervals. (d) VHF interfering contour. For base and fixed stations transmitting on the VHF channels, the radial distance from the transmitting antenna to the interfering contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows: (1) If the radial antenna HAAT is less than 150 meters: d=8.577×h 0.24 ×p 0.19 where: d is the radial distance in kilometers h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters p is the radial ERP in Watts Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 must be used as the value for h in the above formula. (2) If the radial antenna HAAT is 150 meters or more: d=12.306×h 0.23 ×p 0.14 where: d is the radial distance in kilometers h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters p is the radial ERP in Watts (3) The value used for p in the above formulas must not be less than 27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction, or 0.1 Watt, whichever is more. (4) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the interfering contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function of angle. However, in resolving petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate the distance to the interfering contour using the appropriate formula in paragraph (d) of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station radial and additional radials above and below the inter-station radial at 2.5 ○ intervals. (e) UHF service contour. For base stations transmitting on the UHF channels, the radial distance from the transmitting antenna to the service contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows: d=1.726×h 0.35 ×p 0.18 where: d is the radial distance in kilometers h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters p is the radial ERP in Watts (1) Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 must be used as the value for h in the above formula. (2) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction, or 0.1 Watt, whichever is more. (3) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the service contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function of angle.

(f) UHF interfering contour. For base and fixed stations transmitting on the UHF channels, the radial distance from the transmitting antenna to the interfering contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows: (1) If the radial antenna HAAT is less than 150 meters: d=9.471×h 0.23 ×p 0.15 where: d is the radial distance in kilometers h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters p is the radial ERP in Watts Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 must be used as the value for h in the above formula.
