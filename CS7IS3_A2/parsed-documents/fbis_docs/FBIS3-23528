Miryanin, candidate of technical sciences] [Text] In evaluating prospects for development of mortar weapons, foreign military specialists note that even in the future, mortars will remain the basis of battalion artillery and an irreplaceable means of infantry fire support and effective engagement of personnel, weapons and vehicles, especially where high-trajectory fire is required for their destruction. Qualitatively new models of mortars and ammunition for them were developed as a result of a complex of work done to upgrade mortar weapons in the 1980's, which led to a change in organizational structure and tactics for employment of mortar subunits. A new direction was developed in creating self-propelled [SP] mortars with a turret design and full armor protection of crew personnel, equipment and ammunition. Smoothbore, muzzle-loading mortars are the most widespread. They are designed according to the classic scheme of an imaginary triangle with charge ignition according to the Stokes scheme (Fig. 1 [figure not reproduced]). According to this scheme, ignition and combustion of the primary propelling charge occur within its round located in a hollow tube called a chamber. On attaining a certain pressure, powder gases pierce the walls of the primary charge round, ignite the secondary charges contained in the chamber and impart a translation movement to the mortar round. The design implementation of the imaginary triangle scheme is that the mortar tube is hinged with a bipod assembly and base plate; the bipod assembly and base plate rest on the ground with no joint between them. In the assessment of the NATO command, saturating opposing sides' combat formations with mechanized means, providing improved protection for targets and providing subunit personnel with means of protection against bullets and fragments pose the task of substantially increasing the effectiveness of mortar ammunition, including kinetic energy of their submunitions (fragments). And the dispersal of combat formations and increased depth of unit and subunit echelonment under conditions of highly mobile combat operations lead to the need to increase the range of mortar fire and increase fire and tactical maneuverability of mortars. Conduct of large-scale troop airlifts also requires lessening the weight of weapon models and reducing their dimensions without decreasing combat capabilities and effectiveness. Among shortcomings of mortar weapons, the NATO command includes their great variety of types, (which complicates maintenance), combat employment, coordination of fire control, and logistic support. In this connection it is necessary to resolve problems of reducing the number of models of mortars and ammunition for them, since with limited capacities of transportation, the unit of fire carried with the mortar may prove sufficient in quantity but unsuited for performance of a specific combat mission. Foreign military specialists also note the low velocity and long flight time of the mortar round, which makes mortars an easy target for detection by modern reconnaissance assets. Therefore, work to create new models of highly maneuverable, SP mortars based on a light, armored, wheeled or tracked chassis with a load-carrying capacity up to 5 tons is becoming widespread abroad. These and other requirements being placed on mortar weapons show that their upgrading in the 1990's will be conducted along the following directions: Increase in range of fire, increase in maneuverability and reliability, increase in rate of fire, improvement in grouping and accuracy, and so on. The increase in range of fire of mortars is being accomplished both through increased muzzle velocity of the mortar round and decreased loss of velocity in flight and through an additional increase in velocity of the mortar round on the trajectory and on the approach to the target. First of all, to increase muzzle velocity reinforced propellant charges and charges made of powders of a new mixture (for example, ballistite-cordite powders) are being used, which provide for increased muzzle velocity without a substantial increase in bore pressure; secondly, the mortar tube is being lengthened. To reduce energy losses the design and configuration of propellant charges are being improved and the quality of stabilizing fins and bodies is being increased to improve the mortar round's aerodynamic shape. New rocket-assisted mortar rounds are being developed and also are being widely used to additionally increase velocity on the flight path, which in addition provides for an increase in muzzle velocity by 125 m/sec or more. To increase maneuverability work is being done to reduce the weight of mortars in deployed and traveling configurations. To this end possibilities are being sought for wider use of light materials possessing high strength, rigidity and anticorrosive properties. Alloyed steels, light, high-tensile alloys (with use of aluminum, titanium, chrome, nickel and molybdenum), and reinforced plastics are being studied. Results of such studies from an early period already have been realized in specific models. Thus, the L16A1 81-mm mortar tube is made of alloyed steel and the M61 81-mm mortar tube is made of chrome-nickel steel. The United States and other countries have developed polyethylene containers for mortar rounds instead of wooden packaging, and cases made of light synthetic materials for the propellant charges. This permitted considerably reducing overall weight of the transported ready inventory and increasing operational reliability of ammunition during storage and transportation. Work is constantly being done to create SP mortars to increase maneuverability (Fig. 2 [figure not reproduced]). Advanced mobile equipment possessing buoyancy, air-transportability, and increased speed, range and off-road capability is being used as the chassis. The design of devices for installing a muzzle-loaded mortar on a self-propelled chassis and its removal when conducting fire from the ground is being improved. New recoil mechanisms such as of a torsion or hydropneumatic type are being developed, considerably reducing the force of recoil, which permits using lighter and more highly maneuverable mobile equipment as the chassis for the SP mortar. To improve safety of operation of mortars and their ammunition, new explosives and more reliable standardized proximity fuzes are being developed and trigger mechanisms and safeties (interlocks) for them are being upgraded. The United States, FRG and Great Britain presently are developing 120-mm SP mortars of turret design loaded from the breech end. Automatic loaders using robotics (for example, for the RO 2003) and systems for diagnosing malfunctions (for example, for the FAMS) are being manufactured for them. The rate of fire of muzzle-loaded mortars is rather high, but duration of continuous fire is limited by tube heating temperature, which is limited to a temperature of 180-200ï¿½C because of possible self-ignition of the powder of secondary charges. New steels and alloys resistant to heating and possessing high strength characteristics, increased heat exchange with the surroundings in a broad range of temperatures and under various climatic conditions, are being studied for increasing the rate of fire. New design schemes and plastic-ceramic materials are being sought for mortar round obturating devices, which reduce friction as the round moves in the bore. New powder mixtures with low combustion temperature are being studied for propellant charges. To increase the rate of fire, mechanical and automatic devices also are being developed for restoring aim after a round is fired. Patents have been registered for a mortar round magazine and a loader for a muzzle-loaded mortar (Switzerland), and automatic mortars with a turret configuration are being created (USA, FRG, Great Britain). Research in the area of improving the grouping and accuracy of fire are aimed at improving the design of propellant charges and the ignition devices ensuring their reliable initiation, creating new obturating devices and improving the aerodynamic shape of the mortar round. Stabilizing fins of a new design, which make a certain rotation of the mortar round possible, are being used to improve mortar round stability on the flight path. The design and shape of base plates are being changed in order to have greater stability of the mortar when firing from different soils, new sighting devices are being developed, and firing tables are being improved. Mortars and mortar subunits are being outfitted with modern means of fire support and fire control. Thus, the United States proposes to outfit the FAMS 120-mm SP mortar with a topographic survey and orientation system, a computer which figures initial data for firing and fire control, and an automatic system for laying the mortar. From the early 1980's foreign military specialists began to consider the mortar as one of the weapons for combating armored equipment, since its ammunition can hit tanks and IFV's from above, where they have the weakest armor. Moreover, the range of fire of modern 81-mm and 120-mm mortars, which is 5-8 km, exceeds the range of fire of antitank missile systems and antitank guns. Based on this, a number of western countries have stepped up creation of guided mortar ammunition, including that which does not require target illumination. Thus, since 1975 the FRG has been developing the Bussard 120-mm mortar round equipped with a semiactive guidance system with laser homing head envisaging the mandatory presence of a device for illuminating the target, which is not always possible under conditions of modern battle. Therefore, in recent years work has been carried out successfully to create mortar rounds with infrared or radar homing heads (millimeter waveband), which operate on the "fire and forget" principle (Fig. 3). In this case, on the descending branch of the mortar round's flight path (for example, the Merlin 81-mm) there is a circular scan of the Earth's surface by the homing head's field of view. The scan area in searching for a moving target is 300x300 m. If a target is not detected, a search for a stationary target begins in an area of 100x100 m. On detecting it, the tail fin and four control canards located on the front part of the body carry out guidance to the target. In the assessment of military specialists, compared with the Milan antitank missile system (range of fire 2 km and cost of Â£7,500) use of the Merlin mortar round clearly is preferable (4.5-6 km and Â£3,700 respectively). Guided mortar rounds with an active guidance system also are being developed in the FRG, United States, Sweden and France. Their principal characteristics are in the table.

Radar France Bussard 120-mm, 17.0 5.0 1,000 Laser, IR or FRG radar Adoption of guided munitions will permit outfitting mortar subunits with a new, effective means of combating armored vehicles. The aggregate of such factors as rate of fire, high accuracy of fire, reliable crew protection and high maneuverability of SP automatic mortars will permit delivering strikes against armored targets that are attacking or moving in columns; and it will permit quickly changing firing positions to move out from under enemy fire. Such a self-propelled system would be more advantageous from the standpoint of cost effectiveness than the SP antitank gun or ATGM system. At the same time, some foreign military specialists also note shortcomings of guided munitions--complexity of design and high cost. It is emphasized that mortars cannot compete with antitank weapons, since they are incapable of performing their primary mission of giving close fire support to infantry subunits when there are no other means for this, but they themselves are engaged in combating enemy armored vehicles. To improve effectiveness of action of mortar rounds new mixtures of explosives are being developed abroad which provide a high level of kinetic energy of the fragment stream with optimum choice of body material. Malleable perlitic iron and graphitized steel are beginning to be used to manufacture the bodies. For example, use of malleable perlitic iron for the bodies of 81-mm mortar rounds doubles their fragmentation effect against personnel compared with a ferrosteel body. Graphitized steel provides even better mortar round body fragmentation. In recent years the United States and Spain have been giving great attention to developing 120-mm cluster munitions with shaped-charge-fragmentation submunitions of the SADARM type providing a sharp increase in effectiveness of engaging personnel and vehicles. Resolving questions of unification and standardization of mortar weapons is facilitated by coordinating overall technical requirements for mortars and ammunition within the NATO framework. In addition, joint developments are being conducted abroad, as a result of which a new model of mortar or ammunition goes to several countries. The export sale of mortar weapons is being carried out on a broad scale, which for many states precludes the need to perform their own development and adjust series production. For purposes of unification, it is also the practice to develop several versions of individual parts of a standardized mortar (tubes, base plates), which permits putting together models for subunits of different combat arms. The development of mortar weapons will follow the path of creation of new models and modernization of existing ones to improve their main specifications and performance characteristics. The scale of RDT&E being performed abroad to create new mortar weapons and ammunition for them indicates that in the future as well, mortars will hold an important place in the armament system of ground troops of armies in many countries.
