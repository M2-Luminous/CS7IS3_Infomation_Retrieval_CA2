FR940318-2-00061 FR940318-2-00048 [FRL&hyph;4852&hyph;3] Final Decisions by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on the List of Sources Identified by the State of Idaho, Under Section 304(l) of the Clean Water Act as Amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 AGENCY: United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Region 10. ACTION: Public notice. SUMMARY: I. Description of Section 304(l) Requirements Section 304(l) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) required every state to develop lists of waters impaired by pollutants, along with a list of sources discharging toxic pollutants to the impaired waters. More recently, the EPA amended its interpretation of section 304(l) in response to a decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. This amendment required all states to revisit their previous list of section 304(l) sources and add to their list in accordance with EPA's broader interpretation of section 304(l). EPA originally interpreted the statute to require states to identify point sources that discharge toxic pollutants to the waters on the 304(l)(1)(B) list or ``short list''. In response to the remand, EPA amended the regulation to require states to identify point sources discharging toxic pollutants to waters on any of the 304(l) waterbody lists. II. The USEPA's Final Decisions on 304(l) Lists for the State of Idaho In 1991, the U.S. EPA approved, after public comment, the lists of waters and sources for the State of Idaho under section 304(l). In the decisions pertaining to this notice, EPA has approved that no additional listings or changes to Idaho's section 304(l)(1)(C) list of sources is warranted based on the modified interpretation of Section 304(l). III.
