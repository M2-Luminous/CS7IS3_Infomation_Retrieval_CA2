The Veterinary Service has ordered all kibbutzim and agricultural settlements in Israel to take precautionary measures and to prohibit outside vehicles from entering their farms. In the villages near Qalqilyah, entire herds have died after contracting the disease. Over 200,000 animals in Samaria have been inoculated so far in a lightning vaccination drive. Our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling reports that Israeli farmers fear their herds will contract the disease, especially through transmission by deer in northern Israel.
