First, because for the first time a civilian -- who is not familiar with military issues -- is leading the armed forces, and second, because many of the members of the Army Intelligence Direction claim that Tinca used to work for the Securitate, more precisely for SIE [Foreign Intelligence Service]. During the reign of the deceased [former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu] it was known that the Army and the Securitate used to loath each other. The memory of those times still persists. Had it not been for the precedent of the CADA [Action Committee for the Democratization of the Army, an organization of young officers immediately after December 1989], when the attempt by certain officers to revolt against the army leadership was suppressed, many officers would now react more harshly, the sources said.
