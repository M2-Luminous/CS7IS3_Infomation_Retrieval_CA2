He was received by Francois Mitterrand this morning. When he left the Elysee Palace, Pascal Lissouba said that he had echoed Africa's cry of despair after the devaluation of the CFA [African Financial Community] franc. Africa deserves better than this, he said. He added that Paris has to tackle problems differently, including the debt issue. The visit of the Congolese president seems to reflect a rapprochement between Paris and Brazzaville. Monique Mas reports: [Mas] Indeed, relations between France and Congo seem to have improved after a period of severe tension. There were problems, one has tried to deflate them in order to go on, Pascal Lissouba said. He met his French counterpart earlier today. A series of official meetings is on the agenda of his private visit. President Lissouba will also meet the French minister for foreign affairs, the minister of cooperation, and the interior minister. There will be more talk about developments in the Congolese political situation after international arbitration on the electoral dispute and after violence has subsided. In that respect, Paris believes that there has been some progress, but that more is needed; for instance, details on the concrete form the national reconciliation at a political level announced in Brazzaville might take. As for economic matters, Paris has referred Congo to the IMF. It has been badly hit by the devaluation of the CFA franc. There will also be some talk about the timeliness of the return of French cooperation workers. The oil issue has no longer been a bone of contention since President Lissouba backed down in favor of French interests. As for the rest, Paris remains cautious.
