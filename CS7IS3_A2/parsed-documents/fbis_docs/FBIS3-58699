Messr. Moraitis (agriculture), Pangalos (deputy foreign minister, who will chair the General Affairs Councils), Simitis (industry, trade, technology and research), Romeos (secretary of state for the national economy), Papantoniou (deputy minister for the national economy), Boutos (governor of the bank of Greece), as well as Mrs. Melina Mercouri (culture) and Mrs. Papazoi (secretary of state for the environment, town and country planning and public works) stressed the following elements: 1) General Affairs. Mr. Theodoros Pangalos spoke of the following dossiers: i) Community anti-racist policy: "It is very difficult to legislate against" the phenomenon of racism and the far-right; ii) Committee of the regions: The one country behind, Portugal, has told Athens that the Portuguese delegation within this body would be "ready by next week," which will enable the Committee to hold its first meeting in January (but not, as planned, 15 January); iii) Partnership in Europe: Refusing to speak out on the American plan which Mr. Clinton will be presenting to NATO, Mr. Pangalos said that there had not yet been a debate on the possible accession of Hungary and Poland to the Western European Union. On two occasions, he will have contacts at different levels in Hungary, and said that it was necessary to "think along the lines of a variable geometry"; iv) Cyprus: The need to apply pressure on Turkey (which "decides the Turkish Cypriot policy" whereas the majority of people who voted in this part of the island "are settlers") "remains as true as ever"; v) Former Yugoslavia: "The Community must not always let itself be led into an action that leads to nothing," says Mr. Pangalos, who will "soon" be meeting Merrs. Owen and Stoltenberg in Geneva. And he stated: "There are limits to the European commitment" if there are no positive responses on the part of those engaged in the conflict; 2) Agriculture. Georges Moraitis said that his meeting on Wednesday (at the meeting between the Greek Government and the Commission) with Commissioner Steichen had essentially concerned coordinating the necessary actions to tackle six problems. i) Enlargement. It is up to the General Affairs Council to conduct negotiations with the four candidate countries, but the Agriculture Ministers cannot be left out of aspects that concern them. Mr. Moraitis says that personally he believed that formal consultation of the Agricultural Council would be a "good initiative to avoid problems." For the time being, Athens is, however, only thinking about bilateral discussions at ministerial level, even should the Presidency try to make things work so that the Agricultural Council "can give its opinion"; ii) Setting agricultural prices and connected measures for 1994-1995. The Commission will submit its proposal "toward the end of January" and the debate begun at ministerial level at the 21/22 February Council; iii) Follow-up to the elaboration of the final texts of GATT. While the experts finalize the text of the Uruguay Round, it will be up to the Agriculture Council to assure its compatibility with the revised CAP; iv) The revision of the common organisation of markets in the following sectors: \ a) wine (the Commission's final proposal toward the mid-February and debate in Council from March onwards); b) fats, fruits and vegetables (Commission proposal in April, according to Mr. Steichen); c) sugar (the Twelve have more time in this sector, the current regulation having been prolonged and not needing replacing before 1995); v) The modification of the regulation relating to the control by member states of measures funded by the EAGGF [European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund] (Commission proposal in February and beginning of ministerial discussions in March); vi) Relations between the EU [European Union] and East Europe in agriculture, the Commission's proposals being expected "toward the middle of the presidency." Asked about the possibility of the EU deciding to reduce the controls by the Twelve on agricultural exports from these countries, Georges Moraitis said that this question (which is the subject of a current study) would be "raised"; but it is "too early to say what measures will be taken," the aim only being to "reestablish a relationship which would allow for wider cooperation" with these countries. At its own initiative, the Greek presidency will also grant priority to two other dossiers, these are: a) Promoting discussion on inter-professional organisations. For Mr. Moraitis, there are today farmers organisations and production cooperatives: it would be "very useful to have mixed organisations too," which would "facilitate the final decision at Community level for each product"; b) Employment of the new farmers and, through this, questions of means of succession in farming. As the agricultural population is ageing, "we must ease the integration of the young" (which in particular poses the problem of the transmission of quotas). According to Mr. Moraitis, the Commissioner showed "great interest" in this question which, as that of the inter-professional organisations, will be at the centre of the 16/17 May informal meeting. 3. Ecofin. According to Georges Papantoniou, three categories of subjects will be studied by the Finance Ministers, these are. i) Materialization of the white paper, the presidency being resolved to take "all the initiatives required to promote it as soon as possible" from three angles: a) the policy of employment (in collaboration with the Ministers for Employment); b) improving the competitiveness of SMEs, subject for which it has been agreed with Commissioner Vanni d'Archirafi that the Internal Market Council would deal with on two occasions on the basis of an action programme to be presented by the Commission; c) the realisation of the trans-European networks, Ecofin having the "responsibility for financing them." ii) the realisation of macro-economic policy, the Ecofin Council having to discuss the Commission's annual report during the Greek presidency and, in June, the major economic policy guidelines (to be adopted at the Corfu Summit). The Twelve will also learn of the convergence programmes for Denmark, Greece, Ireland and Portugal. As for the 2nd phase of European Monetary Union [EMU], Mr. Papantoniou said that he would soon visit to the president of the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt. Speaking personally, he said that Mr. Lamfalussy would not be called on to attend every Ecofin Council session, but rather be invited "from time to time." As for the nature of the activities to hand over to the European Monetary Institute [EMI] (narrow definition or management of the common reserves), the Deputy Minister for that National Economy said that Athens supported full implementation of Maastricht, but that there were two other parameters to take into account: a) The first phase of EMU had not been a success, having been characterized by a great "relaxing of the rules of monetary cooperation" following the crisis of the European Monetary System [EMS], which would make it "illogical to be particularly ambitious for the second phase"; b) that fact that a member state regarded as premature handing over the powers of monetary authority to the EMI, considering that this "presupposed much too greater convergence." Whence, the Greek presidency notes that "it is not realistic to expect EMI to work immediately like a Central Bank embryo." As for the 3rd phase of EMU, Mr. Papantoniou firmly denied being ready to open the debate in order for the Maastricht criteria to be relaxed. But Yannis Boutos said that, personally, he feared a situation arising which would force one to reconsider the criteria for convergence. As for the EMS, Georges Papantoniou said it was "premature" and "of not much use" to study its reinforcement under the Greek presidency, the priority having to go to "considerable promoting cohesion before thinking about reconstructing the previous EMS"; iii) Strengthening relations with East Europe, especially in the light of choices to be made in the trans-European networks.
