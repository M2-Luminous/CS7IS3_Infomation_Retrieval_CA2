For foam adhesives used in product subject to flammability testing 1.8 0.2 ii. For all other contact adhesives (including foam adhesives used in products not subject to flammability testing); or 1.0 0.2 (b) Use a control device d 1.0 d 0.2 a The limits refer to the HAP content of the coating, as applied. b Compliant washcoats, basecoats, and enamels and thinners containing no more than 10 percent HAP by weight must be used if they are purchased premade, that is, if they are not formulated onsite by thinning other finishing materials. If they are formulated onsite, they must be formulated using compliant finishing materials (i.e., those that meet the limits specified in this table) and thinners containing no more than 3.0 percent HAP by weight. c The control device must operate at an efficiency that is equivalent to no greater than 1.0 kilogram (or 0.8 kilogram) of HAP being emitted from the affected emission source per kilogram of solids used. d The control device must operate at an efficiency that is equivalent to no greater than 1.0 kilogram (or 0.2 kilogram) of HAP being emitted from the affected emission source per kilogram of solids used.
