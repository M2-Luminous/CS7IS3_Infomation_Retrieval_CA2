Den said he had received reports that two separatist groups -- the Pattani United Liberation Organization (Pulo) and the Barisan Revolusi Nationale (BRN) -- had earlier met and planned the abortive bomb attack. The landmine, a 4 x 15-inch pipe containing dynamite, was found and defused at about 10 p.m. on Saturday by army officers. It had been placed on the railway track about 500 metres from Joh-airong station in Narathiwat. "The two groups had planned to carry out sabotage over the New Year holidays to take revenge for authorities' allegations that they had torched southern schools," Den said "We later found the bomb on the railway tracks, prompting me to believe the reports." Den and his New Aspiration Party have several times disputed reports by police and the southern army that Muslim separatists were responsible for the arson attacks against 35 schools in the Muslim-dominated deep South last August. Den's elder brother had been alleged to be former leader of a Muslim separatist group. New Aspiration is known to want to expand its political base in the southernmost provinces. A few suspected arsonists have been arrested over the school attacks but deny the charges. They have yet to be prosecuted. Den once said the suspected arsonists were scapegoats. Meanwhile, Permanent Secretary for Interior Ari Wong-Araya said he had instructed the administrative centre for the four southern border provinces to be more alert for possible acts of terrorism. Ari said the separatists had to stop their terrorism because their fellow Muslims could be affected. Also yesterday, 4th Army Region Commander Lt Gen Kitti Rattanachaya said the situation in the deep South was under control because soldiers had intensified their crackdown on the separatists. "There should be nothing to worry about," Kitti told reporters in Bangkok. "Soldiers and police can handle (the situation) and we are launching operations to root out the separatists." He said the intensified crackdown was working because more separatists had been pressured into surrendering. The southern army chief said there were very few people still supporting or sympathizing with the Muslim terrorists.
