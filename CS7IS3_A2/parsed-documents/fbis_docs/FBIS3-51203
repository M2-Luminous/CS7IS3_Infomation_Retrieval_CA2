This is a result of pressure from the U.S. Senate over the human rights situation apparently linked to arrests based on antiterrorist laws. Camet said that the United States, which offered $105 million to improve Peru's balance of payments, is the only country of a group of six that pledged to help Peru achieve this goal that has failed to fulfill its promise. "The disbursement is being delayed by U.S. Senate pressure, perhaps because it is not properly informed about the human rights issue in Peru," the minister said. The withholding of funds will apparently be the main issue that the Peruvian Government will discuss with Alexander Watson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, during an official visit that the high-ranking U.S. official will make to Peru from 18 to 21 January. Camet added that Watson's visit to Lima "will have the important effect of unblocking the aid, because the United States is the only friendly country that has not yet honored an offer made last year." Washington's concerns over human rights in Peru, according to various sources, are focused on abuses committed in the administration of justice during trials of people charged with terrorism based on strict antiterrorist laws. The discrepancies recently led to an incident between Peruvian Justice Minister Fernando Vega and a U.S. State Department and Congress commission in charge of evaluating the administration of justice in Peru. Vega refused to receive the commissioners because he deemed "unacceptable" both the preliminary report approved by the commission and a letter sent to him by former U.S. Ambassador George Brayshaw asking him to receive the delegation. The minister said the commission, headed by jurist Robert Goldman, reported that the laws in question remained in effect "even though the commission was appropriately informed that the laws had been effectively invalidated." As for Brayshaw's letter, the minister said "it contained inadmissible terms for any sovereign nation," but he did not provide more detail. The human rights situation in Peru improved significantly in 1993, the National Human Rights Coordinating Board reported this week. But it did ask the government to rectify several legal norms for fighting terrorism, which in its opinion have led to an "alarming" number of arbitrary arrests. These laws constitute "a source of permanent human rights violations," the National Human Rights Coordinating Board also indicated. The Peruvian Human Rights Association reported on 2 January that the number of arrested or missing people in 1993 "continued to be extremely high," with 87 cases, of which only 20 have been cleared up.
