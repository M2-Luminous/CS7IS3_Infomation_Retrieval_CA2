He will try to rely on a majority in parliament and his first moves will be directed toward improving the work of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet -- deputies are at present divided and understand each other poorly. There will be no change to foreign policy priorities. Describing his attitude toward Stanislav Shushkevich, the new chairman of the Supreme Soviet said it was normal. He stressed that the former speaker has many fine qualities, but like anyone else he also has adverse traits: Shushkevich and I differed only on certain aspects of politics in relation to the CIS countries' collective security agreement. Hryb regretted that the process of adopting the new Constitution has been subject to unjustified delay in parliament and stressed that ever since entering parliament he has constantly called for the introduction of a presidency with the functions of head of the executive authorities. Hryb decribed the prospects for Belarus-Russian relations as extremely good. We are Slavs, we are neighbors. I have high hopes regarding the arrival in Minsk of a Russian Government delegation headed by Viktor Chernomyrdin. Hryb supports the idea of combining the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus and hopes that the same prices for fuel will apply in both states. The new chairman of the Belarus Supreme Soviet dwelt on his attitude to the concept of neutrality. He announced that to be neutral is our wish, but pure neutrality is at present impossible because a foreign state's troops are on Belarus soil and will remain there under treaty until the year 2000. He supported [Prime Minister Vyacheslav] Kebich's idea of reorganizing the government.
