In the working-level contact which continued for the second day in New York this morning, Korean time, the United States and North Korea reportedly have virtually finished drafting the letter of agreement which contains the four principles: The International Atomic Energy Agency will start nuclear inspections on 1 March; at the same time, the discontinuation of the Team Spirit exercise for this year will be announced; North-South dialogue for the exchange of special envoys will start; and the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks will resume next month. In drafting the agreement, the United States and North Korea had different views on the timing of the North-South exchange of special envoys and on the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks. However, North Korea agreed that it would affirmatively examine the North-South contact for the exchange of special envoys in case South Korea so proposes. As a result, a compromise was reached. The United States agreed that the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks would be held late March on the condition that North Korea resumes the North-South dialogue. If North Korea obtains approval for the agreement with the United States from the Pyongyang authorities, the sides are expected to exchange the final letter of agreement at the third-day working-level contact which will open late this evening Korean time. However, Washington and New York sources have said that the sides would not release a joint communique because their meeting is a working-level contact.
