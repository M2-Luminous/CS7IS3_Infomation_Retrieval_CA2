We will give the neediest decent and affordable housing, whether they own or lease. We will promote economic growth in hand with social progress. 4. Land and housing allocations made by agrarian reform and the Housing Ministry will be given equitably to men and women to protect the family, and to only one of them, except in confirmed cases involving unwed mothers, who will be the object of our special attention.

We will continue to defend the 13th month bonus. 8.

The Public Force will continue to be headed by civilians and will be trained and equipped to protect a democratic society and guarantee that security to all citizens. 13.
