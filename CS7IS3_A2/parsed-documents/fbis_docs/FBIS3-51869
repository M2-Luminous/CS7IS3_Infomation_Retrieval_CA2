In former times, the CPI would not have even been instituted or, had it been instituted it would have come to nothing. Had it not fizzled out, it would have been suspended or killed on this and that pretext. In the end, it would have fallen into oblivion before the culprits were identified, much less punished. Let us now compare this gloomy scenario with the reality of openness, clarity, correction, and balance that has characterized the work of the CPI. Which leads us to just one conclusion: The CPI is not the cause, but rather the consequence of the change in Brazilian political habits. Moreover, this case is not the only one. The CPI on [Former President Fernando] Collor's government served as precedent for the Budget CPI. Optimists were then outnumbered by skeptics but, in the end, the reverberations of the outcome surprised everybody. It goes without saying that such a deep change entails a fair dose of suffering. The reports on the CPI contained attempts to explain -- which convinced no one -- examples of powerful men being publicly humiliated, and details of voters' disappointment. Some even considered the CPI a threat to politicians. It was argued that a tidal wave of charges could prompt an over-generalization, branding all politicians -- guilty and innocent -- alike. If such a risk existed, it was averted. The CPI exalted Brazilian politicians. A few were exposed, but many grew in stature, beginning with CPI chairman Senator Jarbas Passarinho and CPI rapporteur Deputy Roberto Magalhaes. The most praiseworthy achievement of these outstanding Brazilians was their presence of mind and balance. They ensured that everybody had the right to a defense. They never allowed the CPI to become a witch hunt. If there were injustices, they arose from the natural imperfection of human judgment. Political parties also stood to gain from the CPI, starting with the PMDB. From the very beginning, its representatives in the Chamber of Deputies staked their good reputation, and the invariably decisive number of their votes, on the CPI. An example, among many, of impeccable behavior was that of Roberto Rollemberg, chairman of the PMDB in Sao Paulo. If a negligible minority of congressmen have been found guilty in the final CPI report, the only line to take is to accept the verdict and expel them from the party. There is no alternative. There has been a shift in political habits in Brazil. As a final lesson, the CPI showed us that the most vulnerable points of Brazilian legislation must be urgently corrected. Now is the time to do so. The constitutional reform enables us to implement mechanisms that will prevent (or at least make more difficult) a repetition of such events. Changing the rules that govern parliamentary immunity, raising bank confidentiality for all those who hold an elective post, implementing a new strategy for drafting the budget, incorporating the mixed district system [changing the election system to base representation on units of local government, i.e. counties], and creating a vote system to enable the dismissal from office, among other measures, will enhance the management of public money. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. May corruption be forever banished from the national budget.
