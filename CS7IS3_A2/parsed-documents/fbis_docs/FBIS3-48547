"Our discussions with our Japanese counterparts yesterday and today did not produce agreement," a somber-faced senior U.S. official told reporters after the talks. The official, who did not want to be identified, said any agreement with Tokyo must contain provisions "of substantial opening of the Japanese market along with objective criteria to assess progress toward that goal." Japanese and U.S. officials are supposed to draw up a progress report on the framework trade negotiations by the time Hosokawa and Clinton meet February 11 in Washington. U.S. officials reiterated that "objective criteria" are essential for defining a new framework of trade relations with Japan, which runs a 50 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States. "If there are no objective criteria, there is no agreement," a senior U.S. official said. Members of the Japanese negotiating team, headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura, acknowledged that the U.S. insistence on quantifying the openness of the Japanese markets reflects a "lack of trust" between the two trading partners. Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice trade minister for international affairs and a key member of the Japanese negotiating team, said he feels the U.S. negotiators "understand Japanese reasoning" for opposing import targets but still want to use indicators to quantify the openness of Japan's markets. U.S. officials contend that past agreements by Tokyo to lower trade barriers have failed to produce the desired results. The U.S. wants Japan to accept the import levels of other industrialized countries as benchmarks to prove that its markets are truly open to foreign goods. Japanese officials say Japan will oppose the use of any indicators, arguing that governments in market economies have no power to dictate the level of imports for specific industries. Speaking at a news conference Tuesday, Japan's Ambassador to the U.S. Takakazu Kuriyama called the U.S. expectations of predetermined market shares "unrealistic" in market economies. "The United States should understand that putting up a certain quantitative goal and trying to achieve it isn't something that can happen in the real business world," he said. Kuriyama, who is due to fly back to Tokyo Sunday for consultations ahead of the Clinton-Hosokawa summit, urged Washington not to "lose sight" of the principal purpose of the framework agreement -- how to make the Japanese market more open to foreign goods and services. The framework accord, concluded last July, calls for a "highly significant decrease" in Japan's current account surplus and promised "tangible progress" in the access and sales of foreign goods in the Japanese market. The two governments designated the Japanese automobile market, insurance, and Japanese Government procurement in telecommunications and medical equipment as priority areas that must be settled by the February 11 summit meeting. U.S. officials said the two sides have reached a "complete impasse" on negotiations involving the auto industry sector and described progress on Japanese Government procurement and the insurance market as "marginal." Japanese and U.S. officials are scheduled to hold more working-level talks this week in Washington, but there is no agreement yet on a further round of senior-level talks prior to the summit meeting. U.S. officials said the Japanese side has proposed another round of high-level talks in Tokyo but the U.S. Government will have further consultations before deciding on the next move. "We intend to do all that we can between now and February 11 in anticipation of a successful summit," a senior U.S. official said. But the official added, "in our view, we would prefer not to have agreements than to have bad and cosmetic ones."
