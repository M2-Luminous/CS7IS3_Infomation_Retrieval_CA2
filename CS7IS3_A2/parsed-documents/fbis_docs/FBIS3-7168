An NSP investigation showed that Yi Pok-hon, age 33, of Sinam 1-tong, Taegu, left the country in 1990 and had joined an international criminal ring, "AS," in Southeast Asia as a mid-boss. It said that Yi, while working at the "AS," was recruited by North Korean agents, an NSP official said. "The mission the North Koreans gave to Yi was to kill anti-Pyongyang Koreans abroad and win over South Korean gang leaders," he said. Yi is alleged to have visited North Korea six times from 1992 through November 1993 to receive instructions and give reports on his espionage activities. In one of his activities for North Korea, Yi provided North Korea with 100kg of heroin he obtained through the "AS" organization in June 1992, which North Korea smuggled to and sold at about 30 million U.S. dollars in Europe, the official said.
