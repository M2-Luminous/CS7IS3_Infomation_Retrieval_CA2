FR940830-0-00080 FR940830-0-00013 Space Guidelines Comment: Two commenters suggested changes regarding space guidelines. One PHA suggested that HUD should delete the maximum space guidelines for administrative, maintenance and community space. Instead, PHAs should determine the amount of space, the configuration of space and type of space appropriate based on the intended usage. The needs and usages of space were stated to vary widely and did not warrant an arbitrary imposition of a set square footage criteria. Providing space for service providers serving HA residents including community organizations, Head Start, early childhood education, parent education, English as a second language, medical clinics, food shelf, teen centers, drug elimination activities, employment and Section 3 training, family self-sufficiency should be a high priority for use of these HUD funds. Response: Non-dwelling space standards are to be viewed as guidance, not mandatory. HAs may exceed the standards. However, the Department notes that modernization funds may be used only to provide space which is primarily for the benefit of the public housing residents. Comment: Another PHA suggested that HAs should have the ability to convert all existing non-dwelling space (whether previous dwelling space or not) into dwelling space. This ability could ease the unit loss impact of complying with Section 504 as well as address design deficiency conditions. Response: The CGP Handbook 7485.3 cites the extension of exterior walls to enlarge interior dwelling space or provide for physical accessibility as an ineligible work item. HUD has decided to revise its policy and to amend the regulations to allow the adding of dwelling space to existing units, including Mutual Help and Turnkey III units. However, it is noted that HAs are not required to exercise this option in order to meet 504 requirements. Modernization funds may not be used to construct or acquire additional public housing units. The HA may use its own funds to provide additional dwelling units, but without a reservation of development funds, such units will not be covered by the ACC and, therefore, not included in the operating subsidy calculation. Comment: HAs should be permitted to utilize CGP funds to convert studio units in elderly developments into one bedroom units as local conditions warrant. Response: Conversion of efficiencies or studio units into one-bedroom units is an eligible modernization cost, with prior Field Office approval. Environmental Reviews Comment: One comment was received which indicated that the proposal to require HUD conduct environmental reviews of all proposed activities in the Five-Year Action Plan should be a part of the burden on the HA to obtain an independent environmental analysis and submit it to HUD prior to modernization activities occurring. The commenter concluded that HUD did not have the travel funds nor the staff to do this type of review and suggested that HAs could hire and train residents out of management improvement funds to perform these reviews. Response: The Department is required by law to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 and related environmental and historic preservation laws before approving funding for specific developments. The provision for fungibility of work within the entire Five-Year Action Plan means that the Department must make this determination on an annual basis for each development within the Five-Year Action Plan. This responsibility cannot be delegated to HAs. On April 11, 1994, S. 1299 became law, and added, among other things, a new Section 26 to the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended. This new Section 26 authorizes the Department to designate a State or unit of general local government to assume the responsibilities for environmental review. The authorization for State and local governments to conduct such reviews continues a statutory precedent embodied in the legislation of other HUD programs. The delegations are limited to entities with general governmental powers to control development, land use, development standards and special mitigation requirements. HAs do not possess these powers and do not qualify for such delegations. In order to implement this new Section 26, the Department must issue regulations after consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality. Until those regulations are issued, the Department must continue to comply with NEPA and related environmental and historic preservation laws by undertaking the required reviews itself and cannot delegate any responsibilities to State or local governments. In addition, it should be noted that Field Offices are encouraged to maintain previously completed environmental reviews on file and update them as necessary when undertaking the required reviews. Procurement Procedures Comments: A number of comments were made on HUD's discussion of procurement procedures in the preamble to the proposed rule. CLPHA indicated that PHAs have identified possible conflicts between comprehensive grant procurement procedures and the requirements of other HUD procurement rules. CLPHA recommended that HUD ask PHAs for recommendations in this area, then follow up to clarify these areas and provide PHAs with greater flexibility and consistency. One PHA wanted to see additional information addressing contract administration in the revised CGP Handbook. PHAs and CLPHA recommended an extensive review of procurement requirements to identify proper and appropriate ways to simplify or ease how HAs contract for work. Suggested items included establishing procedures for HAs to better utilize alternative procurement vehicles like state procurement, job order contracting, and a revived, modified HUD Consolidated Supply Program and accelerating the approval process of HUD Form 5230, the Previous Participation Certificate. A PHA suggested the use of competitive proposals and indicated that the seven percent administrative cost limit would not be required to be increased because it would be part of the contract cost. Another commenter disagreed and indicated that this method was not successful for development of public housing units and would not be appropriate for modernization except on a small scale at a limited number of HAs. HUD's clarification on the use of indefinite quantity contracts for A/E services and the ability to perform modernization work through competitive proposals was viewed as a real benefit in expediting construction. One PHA disagreed with the limit on modifications or contract modifications in the Handbook (7460.8, REV.1 dated 1/14/93, paragraph 11&hyph;1 (e). They challenged the rational for this requirement since they may award construction contracts exceeding several million dollars without prior HUD approval, but must obtain HUD approval on all contract modifications exceeding $25,000. In addition, HAs are not required to forward contract documents to the Field Offices which would appear to make it difficult to approve any contract modification. The present process was found to slow down construction. It was requested that HAs be allowed to authorize contract modifications up to 10% of the original contract amount without prior HUD approval. CLPHA commented that pre-qualification of vendors should be encouraged and expedited.
