I. Selection of Accounting Personnel 1. Principles governing selection. A) All economic (commercial) counseling offices involved in foreign economic aid programs and enjoying diplomatic funding should select and detail professional accounting personnel who have certain work experience in the accounting field. All economic (commercial) counseling offices enjoying diplomatic funding only should detail professional or part-time accounting personnel (i.e. concurrent posts taken by personnel of other professions or by people outside the authorized personnel quota) according to their own conditions. B) Professional accounting personnel should be familiar with, and have a good mastery of, the financial accounting system as well as the financial system in Chinese embassies (consulates) and acquire knowledge of the financial accounting operation of foreign contracted labor services. Part-time accounting personnel should have a good mastery of the financial accounting system of Chinese embassies (consulates). C) Professional accounting personnel should be selected from among the professional financial accounting personnel in relevant units and departments, such as the Financial Accounting Department, the Administrative Department, and multifaceted companies [cheng tao gong si 2052 1152 0361 0674] under this ministry; part-time accounting personnel should have the educational qualifications of technical secondary school, high school, or above. 2. Selection methods. A) Candidates selected by the Personnel Department in accordance with the above principle will be assigned to the financial sections of the Administration Department and multifaceted companies to become familiar with relevant financial accounting operations. They should take an exam on accounting operations according to relevant stipulations and the Personnel Department will be notified of their exam results. All those passing the exam can immediately go through the necessary exit formalities, while those who fail the exam should not be sent abroad as accounting personnel. B) All professional accounting personnel who have worked as accounting personnel in economic (commercial) counseling offices and are competent can be exempted from taking the exam. The Financial Accounting Department will sponsor irregular training courses on the financial accounting operations of economic (commercial) counseling offices. Those who can obtain the completion certificate from the training course are also exempt from taking the exam when sent abroad. II. Tasks of Accounting Personnel 1. Observe, publicize, and implement relevant policies, decrees and orders, stipulations, and financial and economic disciplines of the state. 2. In accordance with the stipulations of the financial accounting system concerning foreign economic aid, manage the funds and properties of foreign economic aid programs; take charge of the settlement of local costs and contract purchase price of projects under the economic aid contracted responsibility system; and keep, work out, and submit accounts of economic activities already incurred in a timely fashion. 3. In line with the stipulations of the financial accounting system of Chinese embassies (consulates), manage the diplomatic funds and properties of economic (commercial) counseling offices; and keep, work out, and submit accounts of economic activities already incurred in a timely fashion. 4. Supervise and check the financial revenue and expenditure of projects under the economic aid contracted responsibility system and find out and reflect problems to higher levels in a timely manner. 5. Acquire knowledge about the overseas-based financial accounting operations in representative offices, contracted projects, labor cooperations, and joint ventures of various international economic and technical cooperative companies; provide them with relevant information about the country in which they function; relay and supervise the implementation of relevant internal documents and systems; and give assistance to work in this aspect. 6. Conduct frequent investigations into and studies of the financial accounting system, foreign exchange management, taxation rules, operation of banking institutions, and financial markets in the resident country, and send investigation and research data back to the relevant departments at home without delay. 7. Take good care of accounting records. An accounting archive should be set up in line with relevant stipulations to classify, codify, and bind accounting vouchers, books, and various fiscal statements; specify the period for safe custody; and assign special people to take charge of records management. 8. Do a good job in the handover of accounts. Before their departure from economic (commercial) counseling offices due to job transfer, accounting personnel should go through handing over procedures with their successors in the resident county. A handover inventory should be signed by the two parties concerned and an overseer of the handover. It is imperative to make a detailed inventory of fixed assets, reserve materials, and cash in the treasury and ensure that there is neither discrepancy between accounts and actual resources nor disagreement between accounts. As regards temporary credit and debit, detailed account statements should be worked out by unit or by an individual and handed over with the proper endorsement of the units and individuals concerned. A "Statement on the Balance of Bank Deposits" should be prepared to ensure the accuracy of the deposited amount. III. Supervision, Examination, and Leadership Over Accounting Work 1. Relevant departments, including the Financial Accounting Department, the Administration Department, and multifaceted companies, should organize, in a planned way, accounting work inspection groups and call meetings on overseas-based accounting work every year; check and give guidance to the financial accounting work of relevant economic (commercial) counseling offices; and hold lectures and tuitions on relevant financial accounting operations to help accounting personnel deal with certain problems and enhance the level of financial accounting work. 2. As regards those economic (commercial) counseling offices which are plagued by a relatively larger number of problems, the ministry's Financial Accounting Department should work with the relevant departments, organize a special work group, conduct a comprehensive examination of the situation, and help solve existing problems. The work group can also make suggestions to the Personnel Department on the dismissal of truly incompetent accounting personnel working in economic (commercial) counseling offices. 3. Leading comrades of all economic (commercial) counseling offices stationed abroad should strengthen their leadership over the financial accounting work of their own offices, take the lead in observing financial and economic discipline, support financial accounting personnel to handle matters impartially, and conduct regular supervision and examinations on the financial accounting work of their own offices. 4. Accounting personnel who are on holiday back home should go and report their work to the ministry's Financial Accounting Department and the financial sections of the Administration Department and multifaceted companies at a prearranged time. Meanwhile, the Financial Accounting Department and the financial sections of the Administration Department and multifaceted companies will brief the accounting personnel on newly promulgated financial accounting systems and offer explanations and answers to relevant questions.
