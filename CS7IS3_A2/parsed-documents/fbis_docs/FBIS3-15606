The Russian delegation at the past, 17th round of talks with Estonia said Russia won't sign the agreement on troop withdrawal, the document that also sets the deadlines for the process, before Estonia ensures what Russia defines as social guarantees for its retired military in Estonia, and fulfills certain other conditions. Officials at the British Embassy in Tallinn told BNS that the British Government was worried about such a statement from Russia. "According to the final act of the CSCE Helsinki meeting of 1992, Russia must withdraw its troops from Estonia quickly, in an orderly manner, and completely, and must not tie it to other issues. Also the international community has repeatedly underscored that the withdrawal of troops must take place without any additional conditions. Therefore, the Russian troops must be pulled out by Aug. 31 this year, as was earlier announced," the statement by the British Government says. It also says that good relations between Estonia and Russia are essential to ensuring stability in whole Europe and that the withdrawal of Russian troops is a vital part of this process.
