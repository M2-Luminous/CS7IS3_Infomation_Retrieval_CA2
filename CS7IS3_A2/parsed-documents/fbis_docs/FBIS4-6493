Expressing thanks to Comrade Kim Chong-il from the bottom of their hearts for his invitation and hospitality, the letter dated April 19 says: We came here in the interest not only of regional peace and stability but ultimately of world peace and stability. To achieve this it was imperative to have the presence not only of world leaders comprising the Summit Council's International Commission for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, but of world media, consisting of THE WASHINGTON TIMES, CNN and NHK, who would reach out to all corners of the world, and give unbiased, fair, objective and respectful reporting covering your side of the story on the different issues that divide world opinion. These media came not only to hear your views directly but to report on the astounding progress this nation has made through self-reliance, rebuilding itself out of the ashes of war. The reports we have heard from around the world are that everyone is absolutely happy with the constructive media coverage generated from this trip. It has certainly brought new light and challenged the status quo of misinformation and distortion. We feel very happy and satisfied with our work. We leave with a renewed commitment to continue our work for the peaceful resolution of the difficulties on the Korean peninsula.
