The duel took place around the village of Lahij, around 30 kilometres (18 miles) north of Aden, a day after troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih edged closer to this port city, a correspondent said. Southern anti-aircraft guns in Aden also went into action but no missile or bomb explosion was heard. Salih's northern forces have mounted "fierce offensives on all fronts, destroying villages and killing civilians," charged the southern command of the president's rival, 'Ali Salim al-Bid. "We are resisting with all our strength to protect our land and our honour," it said. The south also renewed a charge that Iraqi soldiers were fighting alongside the northerners. Five Iraqis were captured in the oil region of Shabwah, 300 kilometres (180 miles) northeast of Aden, it said. Al-Bid's self-declared Yemen Democratic Republic also renewed its acceptance of Security Council Resolution 924 calling for a ceasefire in the month-long civil war. The north on Thursday also said it was prepared to halt the fighting and implement the resolution, as several dozen people were killed in battles on all the frontlines around Aden. On the political front, a northern spokesman in Sanaa condemned the south's formation of a separate government and warned that it could only lead to further bloodshed. "This separatist act aims only to torpedo the efforts underway to restore security and security in our nation in line with Security Council 924," the spokesman said. "This band of secessionists has shown once more that it is determined to pursue the bloodshed to impose secession by force," he charged. The south on Thursday formed a cabinet headed by Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, appointed prime minister of the breakaway state, a day after the Security Council resolution. A senior northern official, meanwhile, welcomed the appointment of Lakhdar Brahimi as UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's special envoy to Yemen. Brahimi is a "respected Arab figure and capable of carrying out this mission," 'Abd-'al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, a member of the presidential council, said in an interview with the Qatari news agency QNA. Under the ceasefire mission, the former Algerian foreign minister is in charge of a UN fact-finding mission to Yemen. Egyptian President Husni Mubarak telephoned both Salih and al-Bid asking them to call a halt to the fighting, Cairo Radio reported Friday. He called them late Thursday and urged them to withdraw their forces from the combat zones as a first step towards resolving the crisis. Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad also called the Yemeni rivals on Thursday urging them to settle their differences.
