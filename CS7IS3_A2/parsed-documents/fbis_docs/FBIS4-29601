Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, the coalition government's core party led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, said the coalition continues to take priority in urging the second largest opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] to return to the ruling camp. "We do not reject holding discussions simultaneously with other parties, because we do not have much time," Ozawa said at a news conference. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Monday his party will seek a one-shot alliance with the LDP to call for a snap poll if realliance talks with the ruling coalition fail. The LDP has reportedly decided to propose a no-confidence motion against Hata as soon as the 1994 budget passes, saying the minority government does not represent the will of the people. The 73.08 trillion yen budget was approved by the House of Representatives on June 8 and is expected to clear the House of Councillors during the current session ending June 29. If Hata fails to survive a no-confidence vote, he either has to resign en masse with his cabinet or dissolve the lower house. The SDP seceded from the coalition government in April after other ruling parties formed the parliamentary group "kaishin" (innovation) without consulting with the SDP.
