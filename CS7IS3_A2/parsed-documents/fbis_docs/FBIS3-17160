Station commentator (Aleksey Kondrachev) writes: What is Moscow's reaction to this matter? In a news conference, Gregory Karasin, official spokesman of the Russian Foreign Ministry, said: Moscow cannot but express apprehension over how the agreement between the IAEA and Pyongyang is being carried out. First and foremost, Pyongyang must abide by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. Regarding the DPRK statement, Gregory Karasin said there are doubts about whether the inspections will continue. He pointed out that North Korea's remark that it will withdraw from the NPT is indeed arousing worry and apprehension around the world. Russia hopes that as a member of the NPT, the DPRK will abide by its obligations. Also, the DPRK should completely abide by the agreements reached with the IAEA. Moscow is calling for bilateral or multilateral talks to ease the tension surrounding the Korean peninsula. In a news conference with reporters, a U.S. undersecretary of state said Washington is also calling for a diplomatic solution to the issue of inspecting the DPRK's nuclear facilities. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher pointed out that stronger measures could follow, depending on what Pyongyang does. He warned that if there is no change in the DPRK's position, the UN Security Council [UNSC] may even adopt a resolution resulting in sanctions against the DPRK. In a news conference, Takemura Mashiyoshi, director general of the general affairs agency, pointed out that Japan is already examining what concrete measures it will take if the UNSC proclaims sanctions against the DPRK. According to a statement by the official spokesman of the French Foreign Ministry, France recognizes that international sanctions must be taken against the DPRK. However, Beijing absolutely opposes such a measure. In a news conference, Chinese Premier Li Peng said China consistently believes that the issue of inspecting the DPRK's nuclear facilities must be resolved not through pressure but through dialogue and negotiations. Pyongyang's position remains the same. The DPRK is rejecting all denunciation. In a news conference in Moscow, the DPRK ambassador to Russia said it is inevitable that the DPRK will have to take countermeasures against pressure and threats from the United States.
