Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, in Vienna Thursday, is to participate Friday "for the final phase, if the talks end then," Bosnian justice minister Kasim Trnka said. The head of the Croatian delegation, Zagreb's deputy foreign minister Ivo Sanader, said further discussions were needed on the "demarcation of the Croat and Moslem cantons" in the future federation. The Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic might also participate in the talks Friday, Trnka said. U.S. special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, Charles Redman, returned to Vienna, following trips to Belgrade, Zagreb and Sarajevo earlier this week in an unsuccessful effort to convince the Serbs to join the federation plan and end more than two years of bloodshed. There was "still a lot of work to do" on the federation before negotations were completed, he said. The talks are focusing on a U.S.-brokered federation plan signed last week in Washington. It calls for Bosnia's Moslem and Croats to join their territories under a loose federation that could eventually be linked with Croatia. Thursday's session was focussing on the number and delineation of cantons in the future federation, according to a Bosnian official. "There could be three Croat cantons and four Moslem cantons," he said. The talks were also to cover the organisation of Bosnian and Croatian forces, until recently engaged in bitter fighting in central Bosnia, and the federation's political structures. In Zagreb, the Croat news agency Hina said U.S. General John Galvin, the former head of allied forces in Europe, flew in from Sarajevo to the southern Croatian city of Split Thursday to prepare a meeting the following day between Bosnia's Moslem and Croat military leaders, Generals Rasim Delic and Ante Roso. The Friday talks, expected to be also attended by U.S. General Larry Smith from NATO's Naples base, are to focus on the military aspects of the Vienna talks, including a joint command.
