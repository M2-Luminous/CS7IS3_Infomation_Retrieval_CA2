Why has this process, of all others, attracted the government's attention? Yevgeniy Lenskiy, an adviser to the first deputy prime minister, answers this question. [Lenskiy] In our difficult conditions it became necessary to implement such production maneuvers as changing the production profile, organizational restructuring of industrial sectors and enterprises with precedence given to the development of the nonstate sector. Under these circumstances, there is a shift from an expenditure-based economy to a system of sectors and enterprises, which produce, on the basis of new technologies, the output everybody needs. [Golyayev] What general economic tasks are being resolved in the course of such a maneuver? [Lenskiy] First and foremost, the fastest possible overcoming of the production decline on a, so to say, noninflationary basis. This is probably the most important point. [Golyayev] Is there a mechanism for resolving this problem? [Lenskiy] This involves a series of economic measures, among which one of the most important is to create conditions that stimulate natural market changes in the structure of goods produced and hence change the proportional weight of different economic sectors. The meaning of the maneuver is not a state-directed structural restructuring of industry from above, but the state creating conditions whereby old enterprises undergoing transformation along with newly-emerging private enterprises build product markets along technological chains of demand and supply. An FPG is one of such mechanisms for implementing Russian industrial policy. You see, it would be wrong to change the "rules of the game" in the implementation of the privatization program. This does not mean, however, that issues of adjustments to the privatization policy are no longer on the agenda. Today, in my opinion, it is mainly aimed at excessive fragmentation of production and cannot result in the creation of a modern market economy. I support the proposals of those who propose a course toward the creation of large FPGs that will be competitive in the world market, rather than creating internal competition at the cost of a sharp decline of effectiveness of the national economy. What is needed are groups of enterprises linked together financially and technologically, exercising precise planning of joint work, interacting with scientific and design organizations. At the same time, we should avoid conglomeration of enterprises making similar products--along the pattern of a ministry or a main administration. What is needed are associations competing with each other. [Golyayev] They say that there are different opinions regarding financial-industrial groups... [Lenskiy] The people who do not accept FPGs are those who know a plant or a shop only from textbook descriptions. This is not serious. I support those who believe that we can no longer put up with the fact that ministries and agencies are virtually removed from the processes of reforming enterprises, their privatization, forming the vitally needed market infrastructure, influence over the consumer market. The role of the state should be in facilitating the development of financial and legal norms, personnel training, and other infrastructure-related activities. In addition, the idea of organizing large quasi-government multisectoral associations also sprang up among Russian industrialists. In the summer of last year, First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets signed a directive, which envisaged creating a commission on the development of a "variant concept for implementation of industrial policy in the environment of privatization of state property." It is a long title, but the substance of the document is quite simple: creating conditions for setting up multisectoral industrial groups. The role of the state also is clearly delineated: not to force the process of FPG formation, but to monitor it, cut off the unneeded. There have been many drafts, including those from the State Committee on Industry, the State Committee for the Administration of State Property, the Committee on Machine Building, the Property Fund, and so-called independent experts. An attempt to reject constructive alternatives and to present the current industrial policy as the only true and possible one represents, in our opinion, the most dangerous form of monopolization, which blocks the road to the development of a rational strategy of reforms. That is why the work on perfecting the FPG concept continued, the final result of which was the president's edict. [Golyayev] What do we currently have in real life? [Lenskiy] An amazing thing. The state is interested in it; corresponding normative documents have been adopted; and at the same time one gets the impression that someone is benefiting from slowing down this process. Judge for yourself: In order to "legitimize" creation of FPGs, concurrence of almost 10 ministries and agencies is needed. One would think it should be simple: band together and start working. At this point, however, it is impossible to "push through" the needed concurrence. Half a year has passed, but not a single FPG has acquired the status of a legitimate entity registered in a corresponding registry. Plans are being developed on a broader scale as well. The main efforts in the integration processes of CIS member countries may be placed on interstate transnational corporations and financial-industrial groups formed on a share-holding basis and representing the entire complex of business services. We would like very much to move from talk to action. I am not a supporter of campaigning, but let 1994 become a year for forming Russian and transnational FPGs, corporations, and other integrating entities. Otherwise, foreign transnational corporations will suppress Russian industrial structures, with the exception perhaps of those in the raw materials sector. Russian citizens will hardly be happy with this.
