In a commentary today, the official newspaper NODONG SINMUN said that "there exists absolutely no DPRK missile threat." The commentary added that the defense capacity of the DPRK, a peace-loving country, was set for self-defense only. It said the U.S. allegation of a DPRK missile threat was a "plot" designed to justify its plans to deploy "Patriot" missiles in South Korea and set up a "theater missile defense system" with Japan. The commentary said the United States, which had increased its military presence in South Korea and other areas, had created obstacles to the effort to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. It pointed out that the "DPRK missile threat" resulted from the U.S. desire to maintain and expand its military status in Northeast Asia. It stressed that if the United States continued to put pressure on the DPRK by using its military might, the situation on the Korean peninsula would be intensified and the possibility of war heightened.
