In an article today under the headline "A New Chapter in the Scheme of Conspiracy," the paper adds that the priority given to discussions of the developments in the Arabian Gulf stems from heightened U.S. interest in the situation in this region and because Iraq has held fast in defiance of the forces of evil, conspiracy, and aggression, rebuilding all the pillars of advancement that the evil ones destroyed. The paper says that recent international changes, particularly on the part of three permanent UN Security Council members, provide strong evidence that Iraq has an important regional and pan-Arab role, that it is part of the real world, and that it must be respected and dealt with seriously. It is useless for the United States and Britain to continue to ignore history and geography or to continue the imposition of the blockade against the steadfast Iraqi people.
