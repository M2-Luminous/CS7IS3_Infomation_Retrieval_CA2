FR941012-0-00067 FR941012-0-00011 OSHA received many comments regarding the number of employees who should be trained in first aid in order to provide adequate protection. There was no consensus among those commenters on the appropriate number of employees who must be trained. Their recommendations about the number of employees who should be required to receive first-aid training covered a wide range of options, including the following: 1. All employees (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;17, 9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;20; Tr. W1 175, W2 209, OR 100, 375, 393, 681); 2. All supervisors and fellers (Ex. 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13); 3. All supervisors and enough additional personnel so each work site would have a trained employee (Tr. OR 21); 4. All supervisors and fellers, plus two additional employees on a logging job (Ex. 5&hyph;54; Tr. OR 647); 5. All supervisors, fellers, and one-fifth of remaining crew members (Ex. 9&hyph;19, Tr. OR 282); 6. All supervisors, fellers and one-fourth of remaining crew members (Tr. OR 206); and 7. All supervisors and some fellers (Ex. 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;63). Commenters who recommended first aid training for a limited number of employees, said that training all fellers or all other employees was excessive since the proposed rule would also require employees to work within visual or audible contact of another employee (Ex. 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;55). Another commenter said that requiring all fellers to be trained would be duplicative since more than one feller may work at a work site (Ex. 5&hyph;63). Other commenters said they already provide first-aid training for each employee: Everyone_all the people on our crew are trained [in first aid] on a rotating basis. Now, the fellow that's been with us six months, he has not been to the first-aid class yet. Also, one of the_I believe it's in with the Nortim Corporation, the Nortim self insured, it is one of the regulations that we do have people on the job that are versed in first aid (Tr. OR 174). Another hearing participant stated: Along with overall safety training, I feel that required first aid training for all employees is simply common sense (Tr. OR 393). Other commenters indicated that they are providing first aid training to a substantial portion of employees, in part because the company's logging operations are in isolated locations in Alaska: Mr. Lesser: Does your training program include first aid training? Mr. Bell: We provide first aid training to just about whoever wants it. Mr. Lesser: Who do you require to have first aid training? Mr. Bell: We require all supervisors, leadmen, hook tenders, leaders of crews. Mr. Lesser: Using the voluntary nature offering the first aid, do you get a lot of volunteers? What percentage of the work force is trained in first aid? Mr. Bell: I'd say 35 percent (Tr. OR 375). As discussed above, there is no dispute that logging is a hazardous industry. All data sources in the record show that a significant number of accidents occur in the logging industry and that the severity of injuries sustained by loggers is greater than that suffered by employees in other industries. Loggers often work in isolated locations that are far from hospitals or health care providers that sometimes are accessible only by helicopters or vehicles designed to operate on the most rugged terrain (Ex. 9&hyph;20; Tr. OR 21). Accordingly, loggers need to be trained and equipped to handle the significant number of severe injuries that might arise. In many instances these trained employees will be the only persons available to render assistance at a critical time.
