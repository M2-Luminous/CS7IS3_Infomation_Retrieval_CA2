FR940912-0-00029 FR940912-0-00006 B. Section 630.3_Publishing and Filing the Report to Investors 1. Section 630.3(a) The FCA received two comments on §630.3(a), which establishes the due dates for publishing the annual and quarterly reports to investors. The FCC opined that the word ``publish'' in §630.3(a) is subject to interpretation, and could mean printed, mailed, or received by the investors. The commenter suggested that the word ``publish'' be replaced with the phrase ``make available.'' Section 630.3(a) requires not only that the System ``make available'' the report to investors by the dates specified in §630.3(a)(1) and (a)(2) but that the System take affirmative steps to distribute the report to investors. One such step, as noted in the rule proposal, is distribution of sufficient copies of the report to the selling group dealers for subsequent distribution to interested investors. The FCA believes that the suggested substitution of the phrase ``make available'' may discourage exploration of other report distribution techniques and, accordingly, has retained the word ``publish'' in §630.3(a). The AICPA also commented on §630.3(a), suggesting that the FCA reconsider whether the due dates prescribed in §630.3(a) provide sufficient time for preparation of the combined information from various entities within the System. The FCA believes that the due dates established in §630.3(a) for publishing and filing an annual report within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year and a quarterly report within 60 days after the end of each reporting quarter are adequate. The 90-day requirement for publishing the annual report to investors is consistent with industry practice. The 60-day requirement for publishing the quarterly report permits the Funding Corporation to publish the report 15 days after the constituent System banks and associations have filed their quarterly reports with the FCA pursuant to part 620 of this chapter. In addition, in the event the Funding Corporation is unable to prepare and publish the report to investors because one or more banks fail to fulfill their responsibilities for providing information to the Funding Corporation in accordance with §630.4(c), §630.4(a)(7) authorizes the Funding Corporation to request the FCA to extend the due date for publishing the report to investors. Accordingly, the FCA has adopted the due dates established in §630.3(a) as proposed. 2. Section 630.3(f)_Banks' Joint and Several Liability for Consolidated Bank Debt Obligations Section 630.3(f) requires that each report to investors include a statement that Systemwide debt securities and consolidated bank debt obligations are joint and several liabilities of individual banks. The FCC questioned the statutory basis for this required statement as regards individual bank joint and several liability for consolidated bank debt obligations. The FCC requested that the FCA provide a legal analysis of the statutory basis and extend the comment period for this provision. The FCA believes that no extensive analysis is required to justify the position that consolidated bank debt obligations are joint and several liabilities of individual banks. The basis for this disclosure is found in section 4.4 of the 1971 Act, which clearly establishes joint and several liability of all banks for consolidated and Systemwide debt regardless of the title of the 1971 Act under which the bank operates. The FCA notes that the 75-day comment period on these regulations included a 30-day extension of the original comment period and believes that another extension of the comment period is unnecessary. The FCA has adopted §630.3(f) as proposed. C. Section 630.4_Responsibilities for Preparing the Report to Investors 1. Section 630.4(a)(2)(ii), (a)(3), and (a)(9)_Report of Examination Proposed §630.4(a)(9) authorizes the Funding Corporation to make a request to the FCA regarding the content of the latest Reports of Examination of any banks and related associations if the information is necessary for preparation of the report to investors. Two System institutions_the Funding Corporation and the FCBT_commented on the proposed provision.
