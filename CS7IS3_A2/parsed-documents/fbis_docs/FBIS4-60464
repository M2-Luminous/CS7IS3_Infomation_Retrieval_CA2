The Pakistan People's Party government may cease to exist, but the nuclear program cannot be wound up. Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, chairman of the National Assembly's Kashmir Committee, has also said that the foreign minister's statement about the acceptance of the U.S. proposal for inspection of Pakistan's nuclear program is tantamount to ridiculing the whole nation. The Pakistan Muslim League-J also expressed concern over the foreign minister's statement about Pakistan's readiness to accept the inspection of its nuclear installations and declared that we will protect the nuclear program the way people protect the dignity of mothers and sisters. Sheikh Abdur Rashid, deputy chief organizer of the Muslim League and member of the National Assembly, has warned in a peculiar way. He said that he will burn himself at Lahore's Minar-i-Pakistan tower if the present government allows a nuclear inspection. Various religious parties have also condemned the foreign minister's statement and expressed the apprehension that the government might have knelt down to the United States. They feel that the term of "nonphysical inspection" of Pakistan's nuclear installations actually means the American idea of establishing Indian hegemony in the region. Hamid Gul, former chief of the Inter Service Intelligence, has also said that accepting the U.S. conditions on the nuclear program will be a national tragedy. The foreign minister's statement hints at grave dangers. The nation does not accept the U.S. inspection in any manner. We had taken a strong note of the foreign minister's remarks in these columns the other day. Despite his prompt statement refuting his earlier remarks, we had suggested him to think twice and be very careful before making any statement on the most sensitive issues of the nation. The foreign affairs department requires great caution. The past record of Sardar Asif Ali is not that enviable, either. He had accused Pakistan of being involved in terrorism when he was a minister in the previous government. We had to suffer for his accusation, and the sufferings manifested themselves in the form of U.S. steps against us and our failure to present the Kashmir issue at the Geneva Human Rights Commission meeting. Similarly, he continues to make irresponsible remarks about Islam. A progovernment paper issued a clarification on his behalf yesterday. The irony is that instead of accepting the clarification as true, the paper published an editorial supporting the foreign minister's statement. The Foreign Office also issued a rejection of the statement and blamed the newspapers, saying that they carried the report in an irresponsible manner, despite the fact that the same report was also released by the government news agency of ASSOCIATED PRESS OF PAKISTAN itself. The nation is not willing to accept the argument that the foreign minister was not careful when making the statement or that the press attributed a wrong statement to him. There is definitely something wrong, and the statement, not the refusal, is more important. As the issue is very sensitive and delicate, and it is feared that a compromise has been made on a program that grantees national security and the country's independence, it becomes imperative that the foreign minister make a clarification of his statement to the nation, either at the Senate or the National Assembly or on television, and assure the people that his government is not involved in any compromise with the United States. Only after this will the nation decide whether it is satisfied with the clarification or the statement. Any kind of compromise on the nuclear program is not in the interest of Pakistan. The nation has already been afflicted by grief at the disclosure of the news that the nuclear program has been capped. The United States is now demanding an inspection. It is apparently trying to compensate by promising to supply the F-16 planes. The fact is that the F-16 is Pakistan's right. The cost of these planes have already been paid by Pakistan under a bilateral trade deal. Any kind of interference by the United States in our nuclear program, whether physical or nonphysical, that is, whether a visit to our country by a team of U.S. inspectors as was done in Iraq or monitoring the Kahuta nuclear plant through telescopes installed on satellites, is not acceptable to the Pakistani nation. If a government accepts such a proposal and defends it by juggling words, it will only be committing an act of stupidity. The reality is that the nation knows how to protect the nuclear program, which protects the Pakistani nation. The present government might have some ill intentions, but it should not make any mistake in understanding the nation's aspirations.
