FBIS4-8899 "dreeu075_k_94010" FBIS-EEU-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 CROATIA Notes From Croatian Press Notes From Croatian Press 94P20643B 94P20643B CSO [Editorial Report] The following reports on developments in the Republic of Croatia are drawn from recent issues of the Zagreb news weekly GLOBUS. Weekly Charges Zagreb Mayor Involved in Illegal Sugar Imports In 1992, while he was Croatian trade minister, current Zagreb Mayor Branko Miksa signed 230 permits allowing the illegal importation of 280,000 metric tons of sugar, from which "skillful merchants" earned at least $50 million, charges GLOBUS (25 March). The weekly states that it has at its disposal "carefully concealed documents which could reveal the greatest importing scandal in the recent history of Croatia." The "Sugar Affair" created an "entire new class of rich people," GLOBUS alleges, explaining that all one needed was a bank loan to purchase, for example, 3,000 tons of sugar at $350 per ton, import it, and resell it for a net profit of $1 million. The Zagreb Voce enterprise began importing sugar in 12,000-ton shipments, and "a certain Robni Promet enterprise" received a permit to import 22,000 tons of sugar valued at $7 million, GLOBUS says. Although Miksa's permits, without which the sugar could not have been imported, cite authorizations from the Croatian Economic Chamber, GLOBUS says that it has a letter from the chamber addressed to Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Seks stating that it did not issue any such authorizations in 1992. GLOBUS further reports that in 1993, Attorney General Stjepan Herceg had publicly accused three Croatian enterprises, Sibenka, Vinoplod, and Veti, of smuggling sugar. Not long after making these charges, Herceg was forced to submit his resignation. Along with large, well-known enterprises that were illegally importing sugar, GLOBUS reports, hundreds of "totally unknown" small firms, some with "comic names," had also received permits to import sugar and, after importing just a few batches, disappeared. The paper publishes the names of the following firms that it says engaged in such activity: HA-ST, Vedison, West Commerc, Zenit Company, Idea MGG, Fijomi Trade, Newa Internacional, Anik Impex, Boss Impex, Ida Komerc, Alfa Impex, HVH Trade, K.V.A.K., Sun Markt, Equus Caballus, Panex West, Teuta Trade, and Stella Mare Commerce. Representatives of the finance police, customs office, public prosecutor's office, and trade inspectorate have discovered falsified documents and abuses by the Ministry Of trade, but the public does not know whether any of these discoveries has led to misdemeanor or criminal charges, according to GLOBUS. In a detailed account in its 10 March issue, GLOBUS also accused Miksa of illegally importing a Mercedes-Benz vehicle for his personal use and of "defrauding the state of 35,253 German marks" by not paying customs fees and taxes. Dismissals in Ministry of Foreign Affairs GLOBUS reports that numerous dismissals of diplomats have occurred in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MIP]. In an 18 March article entitled "Why Is Dr. Mate Granic Removing His Diplomats en Masse?" the weekly reports that the first important persons to go were Vice Vukojevic, chief of the MIP's intelligence service, and Benjanin Tolic, also of the intelligence service, followed by Zeljko Bujas, ambassador to the United Kingdom, who was recalled at the beginning of 1994. "Two-and-one-half months later" Milan Ramljak replaced Ivan Brnelic in Vienna, and on 1 May Ambassador to Poland Milivoj Slavicek and Ambassador to Bulgaria Bernardo Jurlina will be replaced. Additional dismissals of ambassadors in countries that "are very important for Croatia" are planned but have been postponed due to difficulties in finding "adequate replacements," GLOBUS claims. The paper states that Tomislav Simic, MIP adviser on the international media whose "propaganda circulars to foreign journalists provoked sneers and aversion," is also scheduled to be removed. GLOBUS welcomes the changes in the MIP, saying that they are caused partly by "pressure" to remove "old cadres" from responsible positions. Former Foreign Legionnaire Commander of New HVO Brigade Brigadier General Zeljko Glasnovic, one of the 50 members of the French Foreign Legion who returned "to defend their country" at the beginning of the "war against Croatia," is today commander of the Ante Bruno Busic First Guard Brigade of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] in Capljina, Herzegovina, according to the 18 March GLOBUS. The brigade is one of four that are currently being formed in Herzegovina. GLOBUS says that Glasnovic is, together with General Ante Roso, "the most significant man of the HVO." The weekly further reports that Glasnovic has been tasked with forming "the real army in the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna." According to a brief biography provided by the paper, Glasnovi was born in Zagreb on 24 February 1954 and moved to Canada at the age of eight. In 1974 he joined the Canadian Army and in 1988 the French Foreign Legion, as a member of which he participated in the Gulf War. To show that Glasnovic believes that the Croatian Army in Bosnia needs strict discipline, GLOBUS cites his remark: "Look at our army! What army in the world has soldiers who wear earrings!"
