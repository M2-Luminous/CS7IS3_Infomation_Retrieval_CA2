Hiroshi Ueno, director general of the agency, told reporters that to counter the high demand for Japanese rice and to ensure a fair distribution of it among consumers, retailers will be prohibited from selling Japanese rice alone. Retailers will, in principle, be obliged to sell blends of Japanese and Thai rice, basically on an 80-20 percent basis, Ueno explained. The agency also decided on other emergency measures, including stepped-up rice supplies from domestic producing areas to consumption centers, quicker domestic transportation of imported rice, a closer watch for attempts to hold back sales of Japanese rice in anticipation of future price rises, and a better explanation of rice supply and sales plans to consumers to dispel worries about supply shortages. The package of emergency measures will be reported by Farm Minister Eijiro Hata to a regular cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Immediately after the meeting, the agency will start giving administrative guidance to rice wholesalers and retailers.
