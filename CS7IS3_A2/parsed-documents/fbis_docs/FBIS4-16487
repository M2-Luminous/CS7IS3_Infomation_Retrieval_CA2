Lieutenant-General Vladimir Kulakov, commander of the Vladikavkaz military garrison, told ITAR-TASS that field engineers have been instructed to draw a chart of mine fields within a week and check the safety of economic facilities, transport thoroughfares and gas pipelines. Several incidents were reported in the Prigorodny region, where agricultural machinery and several agricultural workers exploded on mines planted by terrorists. Military sources say that the situation in North Ossetia where a state of emergency was extended until May 31, remains rather complex, but kept under control by Russian peace-keeping forces and local law enforcement bodies. Local observers believe that a second round of talks held in Nalchik by North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov and Ingush President Ruslan Aushev gave a certain impetus, helping to relieve tension in the Prigorodny region. Local observers believe that a discussion of problems of stabilisation in the region expected to be held by the Russian Federation Council and the Russian Security Council in the context of the Russian president's decree on the return of refugees will help to disentangle a difficult knot of international problems. Akhsarbek Galazov met with commander of a special Caucasian border guard district, Lieutenant-General Viktor Zemtsov, the press service of the North Ossetian president reported on Sunday. During the meeting the sides discussed a number of problems connected with reinforcing Russia's southern borders. The talks were attended by North and South Ossetian government officials who expressed concern about the fact that the introduction of the network of border-check points on the Transcaucasian road will remove a "transparent border", which will impede integration processes between the two republics in the area of science, economy and culture.
