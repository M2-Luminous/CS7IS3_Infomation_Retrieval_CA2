FR941006-2-00133 FR941006-2-00091 Small Business Investment Company Computation of Alternative Maximum Annual Cost of Money to Small Business Concerns 13 CFR 107.302 limits maximum annual Cost of Money (as defined in 13 CFR 107.3) that may be imposed upon a Small Concern in connection with Financing by means of Loans or through the purchase of Debt Securities. The cited regulation incorporates the term ``Debenture Rate'', which is defined elsewhere in 13 CFR 107.3 in terms that require SBA to publish, from time to time, the rate charged on ten-year debentures sold by Licensees to the public. Accordingly, Licensees are hereby notified that effective the date of publication of this Notice, and until further notice, the Debenture Rate for computation of maximum cost of money pursuant to 13 CFR 107.302 is 8.20 percent per annum. 13 CFR 107.302 does not supersede or preempt any applicable law imposing an interest ceiling lower than the ceiling imposed by its own terms. Attention is directed to Section 308(i) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, to that law's Federal override of State usury ceilings, and to its forfeiture and penalty provisions.
