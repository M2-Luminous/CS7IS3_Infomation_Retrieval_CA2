Both laws come into effect May 1. The size of excises will be determined by the government. According to the new law, excises will be imposed on beer, chocolate, cocoa, liquors, tobacco, jewelry, gasoline, diesel fuel, luxury cars, as well as publication of erotic or violent nature. Excises will not be applied to coffee and electric energy. Finance Minister Eduardas Vilkelis told Lithuanian TV that the excises law should not strongly affect prices, although some goods may become more expensive. The value-added tax will replace the currently existing 18-percent general excise tax. The new tax rate is also 18 percent. The value-added tax will be imposed on all import, including energy. The amendments adopted Thursday create slightly more favorable conditions for local producers. Payment of the tax may be put off to enterprises that import much material resources. The parliament also extended the term of paying the tax. According to various estimations, the value-added tax will increase prices by an average of 8 to 10 percent. But Vilkelis said a package of documents on compensations for the price-leap will soon follow. The minister said the government intends to raise pensions and budget salaries by no less than 10 percent May 1.
