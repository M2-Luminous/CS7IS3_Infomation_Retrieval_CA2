The report's text follows: Government's Report Concerning the Economic Situation The government has submitted a report to the National Assembly concerning economic conditions in the country, describing developments of the situation with regard to public finance, the oil sector, directions and changes of monetary policy, the foreign trade sector, and the securities market. The report went into structural problems that the Kuwaiti economy faces and proposals to counter those issues, even though they are within desirable limits in many of their directions. There was tangible progress in the report, compared with previous reports and statements by the government, in which there was wariness concerning political reactions and a desire not to publish recent or clearly defined numbers. The government based its expectations for general revenue in the draft 1993-94 budget on production levels of 1.8 million barrels per day [bpd], at an average price per barrel of $14. Oil revenue in the first half of the current fiscal year (July-December 1993) was approximately 1.235 billion Kuwaiti dinars [KD]. This means that it was a little higher than budget estimates, if it were computed on the basis of an entire year. However, the present crisis in the oil market has forced the government to modify its estimates and compute oil revenues for the rest of the year at a production rate of a million bpd, at an average price of $10.50 per barrel. That is a healthy direction. The government estimates that if the current level of oil prices continues, it will add 210 million more dinars to the estimated budget deficit, which will total KD1.2 billion, if we exclude the savings from income earmarked for future generations' reserve. The government estimates the deficit for half the fiscal year at KD820 million, as a result of its disbursing more than half of the budget credits. Total remitted to the ministries, agencies, and organizations was ID2.221 billion, an average of KD370 million a month or about $1.2 billion. This is not a good indicator since, usually, actual expenditures are less than estimates. If disbursement rates continue as they are, they could put pressure on future budget credits. The numbers put forth by the government do not reflect the country's actual financial position for a half year, nor the estimated position for a full year. There is either a lack of comprehensiveness in the draft budget or the government's estimates, because of reduced revenue and expenditures outside of the budget. The part pertaining to oil dealt with less than half of the known developments in that sector, such as the rise in production rates during 1993 from 1.5 million bpd to 2 million barrels daily, after OPEC's recent agreement. There was also the increase in refining capacity from 415,000 bpd to 580,000 barrels, following the resumption of operations of most of Ash Shu'aybah's refinery units. The report confirms the initialling of an agreement to establish a new petrochemical complex, costing--by previous statements--about $2 billion. The important matter is that the project will have foreign participation. The report also dealt with the monetary and banking sector and referred to the rise in private sector deposits with commercial banks. However, it mentioned that most of the increase was in deposits of foreign currencies, attributing that to the banks' fear of accepting Kuwaiti dinar deposits, in view of their expectations of a greater drop in interest rates for the dinar, on the one hand, and because of the dearth of local investment opportunities on the other. The increase in private sector deposits totaled KD339 million. The deposits in foreign currency were KD234 million, or 69 percent of the total. The Central Bank believes that the lowering of interest rates and activity of the Kuwaiti securities market contributed to the 9.7-percent increase in volume of credit incentives in November 1993 over December 1992. About 39 percent of those incentives were personal. In another matter, the report stated that the development of foreign trade statistics lagged five months behind, since they only cover the first seven months of 1993. This is unjustifiable. Those statistics show a trade surplus of around KD522 million, since the value of exports was KD1.678 billion, while imports totaled KD1.156 billion. The latter number is close to pre-invasion levels, because imports totaled KD1.146 billion for the first seven months in 1990.
