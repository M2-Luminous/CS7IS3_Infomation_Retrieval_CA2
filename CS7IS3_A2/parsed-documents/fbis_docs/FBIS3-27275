On the eve of the Lunar New Year, I would like to extend New Year's greetings to all compatriots at home and abroad, wishing you a happy New Year and every success. The year end is a time for reviewing the past and looking to the future. Over the past year, thanks to the concerted efforts of all compatriots, we have achieved substantive progress and fruitful results in internal, economic, diplomatic and cultural affairs, as well as in cross-strait relations. In internal affairs, our long-term endeavor to promote democracy has taken root and begun to blossom in the Taiwan, Penghu, Chinmen and Matzu areas. The elections of county magistrates and a city mayor held toward the end of 1993 and of county and city assemblymen two weeks ago came to successful conclusions, even though the styles of fierce campaigning still need much improvement through the joint efforts of all people. Obviously our countrymen have gradually become more familiar with the exercise of democracy and, while airing individual views, have also displayed the consensus of sharing a common destiny, thus enabling us to take a giant stride toward a rational, just society. In economic affairs, despite the global depression our society, propelled by its enormous vitality, has seen a steady and continual expansion of the national economy, achieving a 6 percent growth rate. The government's efforts to improve the investment environment and open up the market for free competition have also laid a sound foundation for Taiwan to become a business center of the Asia-Pacific region. In diplomatic affairs, we have adhered to the pragmatic principle of working actively to return to the international community, thus arousing the attention of various countries to the existence of the Republic of China [ROC] as well as their awareness of the reality of China's separation and divided rule. Through participating in international organizations, attending international conferences, and strengthening cooperation with and providing humanitarian aid to foreign countries, we have won the affirmation of the international community and, even more, the respect and position we deserve. In cultural affairs, we have integrated traditional with modern cultures to create the most dynamic new culture in Chinese history. Through popularizing cultural activities, we have incrementally achieved successes in enriching our countrymen's cultural life and fostered their awareness of individuals versus community and state. In cross-strait relations, we have prudently carried out the policy toward the mainland in line with the timetable set in the "National Reunification Program." Since the Ku-Wang meeting, mutual understanding between the two sides of the strait has been further enhanced through consultations on routine affairs, exchange of visits by people of various circles, and continuous nongovernmental exchanges, thereby enabling the "Taiwan experience" to exert considerable influence in the Chinese Mainland. Dear elders, brothers and sisters: The achievements over the past year have laid the foundation for future development. Looking into the future, we are confident and determined to once again open up a new situation in history. Meanwhile, we must thoroughly recognize the following: -- The ROC's development will not lead to its alienation from the mainland. As a matter of fact, the fruitful results of our endeavor for political democratization and economic modernization have placed us in the van of a transformation period of Chinese culture; and our experience during the course of development is precisely what Mainland China will need in the future. -- The ROC should not shut itself out of the international community, but should actively participate in international affairs and exert its utmost to the establishment of a new international order. Moreover, it should play a more active role in consolidating economic relations between Asia-Pacific nations and should become a major partner in promoting regional development. -- The mainland, which should have maintained brotherly relations with Taiwan, must abandon its anachronistic ideology and structure and carry out economic modernization and political democratization with new knowledge, understanding, and strategies so as to work together with us in striving to rejuvenate the Chinese nation and assist each other with full pride in the international arena. Another new year is around the corner. I hope all countrymen will continue to work concertedly and will dedicate themselves to the people of this land, striving to rejuvenating the Chinese nation and creating a brighter future. Finally, once again, best wishes and a happy New Year to you all. Thank you!
