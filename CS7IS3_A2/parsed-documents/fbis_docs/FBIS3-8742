Tomanek: "Three Research Institutes and Six Enterprises Have Been Privatized"] [Excerpts] Bratislava--Following yesterday's 86th Session of the Slovak Government, there can be no doubt that privatization is picking up pace. The Cabinet yesterday discussed and approved nine privatization projects. A report on establishing a City University in Kralovsky Chlmec and a draft law on certain measures concerning state supervision of security work were withdrawn from the agenda. Material on the Foundation for the Development of the Regions in the Slovak Republic suffered the same fate. Moreover, three documents--a draft law that alters and supplements the law on income tax and two draft privatization projects--came onto the agenda. Approved The following documents were among those approved at yesterday's government session: a draft law on conducting business; a report on the fulfillment of the Slovak Government's policy in the struggle against crime, including its prevention; a report on the activity of the joint Slovak-Czech Border Commission; a proposal on the appointment of the members of the Slovak Forestry Commission Preparatory Committee; and an analysis of the current situation with regard to the upbringing and education of physically handicapped children and young people. The government also approved other important materials yesterday, including an addendum to the proposal on providing guarantees from the state budget for credit from a foreign bank for the North Slovak Pulp and Paper Mills, a report on the disposal of radioactive waste, and a draft agreement between the Slovak Government and the Government of the Kingdom of Denmark on succession to bilateral agreements. The government also approved a proposal to conclude an agreement between the Slovak Government and the Russian Federation Government on cooperation in culture, education, and science. Into Private Hands The government approved nine privatization projects yesterday: the Trnava Nuclear Power Plants Research Institute; DATA-STAV Presov; the Bratislava Research Institute for Engineering Projects; Stavex Humenne; CHEMVAP Kosice, an enterprise providing services for cement plants and lime works; the Bratislava Institute for the Economy and Organization of the Construction Industry; the Lucenec Civil Engineering Works; the Humenne Meat Industry plant; and Vino Kosice. [passage omitted] The Popularity Stakes Slovak Statistical Office Chairman R. Krc gave a report on the trends in support for politicians and parties. At the beginning of February, respondents placed most trust in Prime Minister Meciar. President M. Kovac came next. The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia was the most popular party. On the other hand, the Democratic Party-Conservative Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party of Slovakia were among the parties whose support declined to below 2.0 percent. Surprisingly, the number of citizens who reject the screening law has declined.
