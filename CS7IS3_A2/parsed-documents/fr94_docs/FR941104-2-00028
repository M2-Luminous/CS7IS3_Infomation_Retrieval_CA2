FR941104-2-00028 FR941104-2-00021 [FRL&hyph;5096&hyph;7] Agency Information Collection Activities Under OMB Review AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and comment. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected cost and burden. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before December 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For further information, or to obtain a copy of the ICR contact Sandy Farmer at EPA, (202) 260&hyph;2740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Office of Research and Development Title: National Survey of Radiological Laboratory Capability (EPA ICR No. 1731.01). Abstract: This ICR is a new information collection to survey the capabilities of radio-analytical laboratories in support of EPA's responsibilities under the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan. The plan tasks EPA with providing radio-analyses of environmental samples collected during a Federal Radiological Monitoring and Assessment Center (FRMAC) response to a radiological accident. The information is needed to ensure that, in the event that EPA's capabilities become overburdened during a FRMAC response, an outside laboratory can be expeditiously identified and their analytical support voluntarily enlisted. EPA will distribute questionnaires and subsequently follow-up with telephonic instructions to participating laboratories. Recipients will be asked to provide information that includes: (1) Name, address, location and point of contact information, (2) fixed/mobile capabilities, (3) radionuclide/sample type analysis capabilities, and (4) response time and availability. The EPA will store the information on a database, designed to be transported to radiological accident sites and used by FRMAC for selecting laboratories to augment EPA's capabilities. Burden Statement: Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 30 minutes per response, including reviewing instructions, searching existing information sources, completing and reviewing the collection of information, and submitting the information to EPA. Respondents: Government and private radio-analytical laboratories. Estimated Number of Respondents: 350. Frequency of Collection: One time. Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent: 1. Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 175 hours. Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to: Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (2316), 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. and Timothy Hunt, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20503. Dated: October 28, 1994. Paul Lapsley, Director, Regulatory Management Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27404; Filed 11&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
