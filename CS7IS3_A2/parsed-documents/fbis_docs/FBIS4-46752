Such enterprises will help develop competition, overcome sectoral and territorial monopolism, improve the economy and the financial sphere, and expand export potential. While They Were Being Set Up, the Money Melted Away At first glance, small business is constantly at the center of attention. It has been said many times what exactly entrepreneurs need in order to get on their feet, flourish, and even expand abroad. In reality, however, the state's attitude toward small business has not changed at all. The standards applied to them--tax, credit, and leasing--were the same as those applied to large businesses. The president of Russia's decree on the development of small and medium-size business proved unfocused, declarative, consisting of generalized statements and exhortations for the ministries to support entrepreneurship economically. In May 1993 the president and the government did finally issue a decree on priority measures in small business development. It contained the main point: the decision to allocate money for their development and instructions to the new Fund for Support of Entrepreneurship and Development of Competition to distribute it. According to economists' calculations, however, 100 billion rubles [R] is needed to revive the small business sphere rather than the R25 billion that has been allocated--and even that only on paper. By the end of the year only R5 billion was left at the fund's disposal. Members of our union (who presented relevant programs) also counted on some share of that money. Unfortunately, the procedure for distributing the money turned out to be very complex, and the fund has never really managed to get a grip on it. For more than half a year it was busy setting itself up and developing a concept of monetary distribution, while the money melted away under the onslaught of inflation. With this arrangement, small business will not see fundamental changes in the foreseeable future. According to preliminary data, in the future the Fund for Support of Entrepreneurship and Development of Competition intends to use the long-awaited money as credit that will be provided to small businesses on the same terms as the Central Bank's prime rate--210 percent annually. In order to utilize such credit successfully, the amount has to be turned over four times a year. This means that it can be used only for trading, not production. Entrepreneurship in the production sphere, the one capable of saturating the market with goods and services, needs preferential credit support and taxation regime, exemption of reinvested profit from taxation, and a tax break of two to four years depending on the nature of the production. Alas, Russia has practically already chosen a very unfavorable road for the development of entrepreneurship. Its fate was determined by the government, which made changes to tax legislation that left entrepreneurs in a state of shock. Tax rates and indirect taxes were increased, new taxes and duties introduced. As a result, an entrepreneur will have to give up for public needs 35-43 percent of profits, and the combined tax on payroll reaches almost 40 percent. The only real benefit small businesses got is exemption from paying estimated tax on profit. It is also very good that profit reinvested in capital assets and put into R&D and design work (NIOKR) will not be taxable. However, in the current conditions few small enterprises can afford such expenditures without additional credits. Security--in 149th Place In this situation small business could get help from foreign investment, but the terms of obtaining it and the insignificant volume do not meet the current needs and cannot satisfy Russian entrepreneurs. The main reason, in the opinion of international financial organizations, is that the investment climate in Russia over the past five to six years has changed for the worse. For instance, the financial magazine YEVROPEYSKIYE DENGI ("European Money") in March 1993 placed Russia in 149th place (among 169 countries) in terms of investment security. In addition to difficulties built into the code of law, foreign investors also encounter many organizational and informational problems. This precipitates their reluctance to increase investment in Russia. Privatization with the participation of foreign investment can and should play an important role in the development of small and medium-size business. It opens the opportunity for the free import into Russia of managerial experience and know-how. Another advantage of such privatization is that enterprises undergoing privatization will be appraised at their real value. A private investor will invest his money only if he is certain that the enterprise he is acquiring will flourish and bring in profit. So far he is encountering only difficulties, the main among which remains the haphazardness of economic legislation. For instance, certain types of activities are permitted only by license; quite often far from the best facilities--take it or leave it--are offered for privatization; there are numerous restrictions regarding auctions and competitive bids, while almost all such deals must be licensed. For the foreign business world the Law on Foreign Investment in Russia, which contains the most general provisions with a considerable set of restrictive conditions, so far has not become a document for practical action. Serious modifications to it are urgently needed, as well as developing as soon as possible a set of accompanying documents that will specify in concrete terms the norms of participation and preferences for foreign investors. Until recently, however, Russian state bodies did not treat seriously the problem of attracting foreign investment. The Russian Union of Entrepreneurs and Lessees petitioned the former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet on these issues many times but never received a reply. However, the issues raised a year ago have not lost their urgency. The main among them, in the union's opinion, is the question of ownership rights. It still has not been defined clearly who and at what level makes the decisions on granting which kind of ownership. From the standpoint of international standards, we have not defined ownership rights at all, and therefore a foreign investor does not know what he can count on when he acquires a Russian enterprise. In order to create a favorable investment climate it is also necessary not only to make corrections to the legislation but also to guarantee observance of already existing statutes. Structures qualified to work competently with foreign investors of capital in Russia so far are not sufficiently developed. Potential foreign investors are reluctant to come into the Russian market among other reasons because they do not find local structures professionally trained to interact with them. International Investment Center Will Select a Company Against the background of such unfavorable trends, the Russian Union of Entrepreneurs and Lessees, in partnership with the international consortium Newform International (Paris), in August 1993 created the International Investment Center, whose task is to facilitate attracting foreign investment into the Russian economy. The center was founded in order to bring together and utilize the experience of specialized consulting and engineering firms, whose sphere of activities encompasses the main spheres of applied knowledge. All projects are carried out by independent international experts. The center will transfer to the customer the technologies and ensure the participation of local partners in the project. Through its international contacts, the center will select for each project a company responsible for its implementation, based on its experience and reputation, as well as the knowledge of local conditions. The company to which the project implementation will be commissioned uses as needed the capabilities of all members of the Newform International consortium. Well-integrated into the world economy with international contacts, the center's flexible structure and its multiprofile orientation allow it to develop and realize technically and economically most complex projects and pick the management for them. The International Investment Center has already begun to implement a number of projects. Among them, first and foremost we should mention the project to develop a timber raw material base in one of the rayons in Tomsk Oblast utilizing waste-free wood processing technology and the development of a social infrastructure, and the project on the construction of an international airport in Ufa. In addition, the International Investment Center has begun to actively promote abroad the products of members of the Russian Union of Entrepreneurs and Lessees, using advertising and promotional materials supplied by customers, and assist in signing the contracts. On the other hand, it is using the capabilities of Newform International to identify potential buyers for their products. The Russian Union of Entrepreneurs and Lessees has established working contacts with Russian ministries and agencies dealing with investment programs in order to identify Russian projects financed by foreign and Russian state institutions and funds, and determine how the International Investment Center may join in their implementation. The regional unions of the Russian Union of Entrepreneurs and Lessees were advised to cooperate more closely with local administrations in developing and implementing investment projects and programs, and select concrete projects and designs for which the International Investment Center could provide, on a commercial and contract basis, international evaluation and find foreign investor companies. The center closely cooperates with such recognized international specialized companies [as published] as the World Bank (Washington), the African Development Bank (Abidjan), the UN Development Program (New York), the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (Rome), the Asian Development Bank (Manila), and the Inter-American Development Bank (Washington). Policy Must Be Registration-Based How do we stimulate and boost investment? I think that in order to achieve this it is necessary, in legislative order, to completely exempt from taxation domestic and foreign investment in the Russian economy (first and foremost in the development of small and medium-size business in priority sectors), as well as give up for a certain period of time taxing profits received. Incentives must be provided for capital to flow into those sectors and spheres of activities of small and medium-size business where the problems of life support and structural restructuring of the economy are concentrated: food production and processing, basic necessity goods production, etc. For this, however, our investment policy regarding potential investors must finally become based simply on registration. This may be perhaps one of the most cardinal problems of reforming the Russian economy today and in the future. Implementation of the set of priority tasks in the area of developing small and medium-size business in Russia must not only ensure the achievement of goals associated with economic stabilization but also form a positive attitude toward entrepreneurial activities and the emerging entrepreneurial class.
