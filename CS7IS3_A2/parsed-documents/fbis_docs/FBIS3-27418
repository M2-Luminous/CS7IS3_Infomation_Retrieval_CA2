He told XINHUA reporters that the Russian troops will not be on the side of the Bosnian Serbs, but will treat all sides equally. He said his forces have not yet begun their mission, and were now familiarizing themselves with the complicated situation and environment in the Serb-held areas. The commander said that the peacekeeping forces, as well as the civilian population, require security guarantees. He added that his battalion would stay as long as the UN peacekeeping force commander in Sarajevo and the Russian Government so desire. Russia, a traditional ally of the Serbs, intervened in the Bosnian crisis on the eve of the NATO ultimatum deadline threatening air strikes against the Serbs. Some 400 Russian troops stationed in Croatia arrived in Sarajevo Sunday evening to enforce and monitor the cease-fire. The Russian troops, along with French forces, are deployed along the dividing line between Serbs and Muslims, and are led by French Brigadier General Andre Soubirou, the commander of UN forces in Sarajevo. The commander said his forces will continue to carrying out their peacekeeping mission and monitor the cease-fire. Since the cease-fire agreement signed two weeks ago the 22-month-old war has subsided, as local people try to resume a normal life. A Sarajevo resident told XINHUA reporters that he felt much safer now than ten days ago, and sees a gleam of hope for Sarajevo "after Russia's efforts to solve the Bosnian conflict".
