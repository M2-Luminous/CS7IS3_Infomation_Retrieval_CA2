Estonian border officials and the police "K" special task force in a joint operation on May 5 arrested five persons suspected of being engaged in organizing the illegal transits. One of the persons detained was already being sought by Swedish police on the same charges. The head of the Estonian Border Guard Command, Aare Evisalu, earlier said Estonia has caught four larger groups of a total some 200 Kurdish immigrants having arrived in the country illegally this year. Investigation is being conducted into all four cases of illegal transit attempts, he said in an interview. The government on March 15 set up an investigation party of border guard, Police Department, Central Criminal Police and Defense Police officials. Evisalu said that information received at questioning of the Kurds had created a possibility to find the persons organizing the transit. "On the basis of that information we can bring these persons to charges and close the transit route for taking the Kurds to the West through Estonia," Evisalu said. Evisalu in the interview a week ago said that investigation into who had organized bringing of the Kurds to Estonia was expected to be finished within a few weeks' time.
