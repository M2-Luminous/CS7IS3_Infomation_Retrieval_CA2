Official sources said that in 1993 the province poured some 310 million yuan (about 35.6 million U.S. dollars) into the work of flood control on the Huaihe. About 28.7 million cu m [cubic meters] of earthworks was completed in the same year. According to official statistics, by the end of 1992 some 637 million yuan (about 73.2 million U.S. dollars) had been used in the work, of which 120 million yuan (about 13.8 million U.S. dollars) was collected within the province. Meanwhile, some 80 million cu m of earthworks had been completed. Officials from the provincial government said that in 1993, 100,000 workers were engaged in the task, as against 300,000 in 1990 because of the increased use of machinery. Located on the middle reaches of the Huaihe River, the province, most of whose land is lower than the high-water level of the river, has suffered from flood disasters throughout history. In 1991, after suffering a particularly serious flood disaster, the province formulated a set of policies for combating the menace. During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995) China has listed 13 projects concerning flood control work in Anhui Province as state key projects, with a total investment of some three billion yuan (about 345 million U.S. dollars). In the meantime, the province plans to allocate some one billion yuan (about 115 million U.S. dollars) to support the projects. In addition, the state government has earmarked some 100 million yuan (about 11.5 million U.S. dollars) since 1991 for the construction of roads and temporary shelters in case of further flood disasters.
