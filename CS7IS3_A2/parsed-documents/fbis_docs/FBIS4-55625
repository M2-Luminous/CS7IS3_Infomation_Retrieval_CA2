The April 4-5 trip was the first time the Czech prime minister has set foot in a former Soviet republic since his party gained control in the 1992 elections. Out of Klaus' 52 trips abroad as prime minister, 37 have been to Western countries. His visits to Germany outnumber those he has made to the Czech Republic's fellow Visegrad countries--Poland, Slovakia and Hungary--combined. His scheduled trip next week to the far-flung capitals of Argentina, Chile and Brazil, to foster commercial contacts, is an even more unusual departure from his usual Western itinerary. Klaus has been singled out for criticism in the Central European press for his alleged neglect of the Visegrad countries and his generally non-cooperative and competitive relationship with them. "It's not true," Klaus shot back in an interview with the daily LIDOVE NOVINY, published April 8. "I meet with Polish politicians more than anyone else." But the fact that Klaus has made three official visits to Poland as prime minister--and has met with Polish government representatives both here and in other countries--is overshadowed by the overall pro-Western drive of his government. "The orientation of the Czech Republic is clear," said Jan Zahradil, a foreign advisor for Klaus' Civic Democratic Party (ODS). "It's our aim to get into the Western European structures, so of course the frequency of visits [to the West] would be higher than, say, to Hungary or Poland." As might be expected, Germany tops Klaus' destination list with 13 official, unofficial and working visits in the past 21 months. Second on the list is Austria, with five visits. In comparison, the closest he has come to visiting an Asian or Middle Eastern country was a three-day working trip to Israel in February. He has visited the Czech Republic's fellow Visegrad countries a combined total of eight times. The unabashed pro-Western push of Klaus' foreign policy was apparent even in his seemingly less important visit to Finland last month. "Finland is important because it's waiting to get into the European Union. So Mr. Klaus sent there to see how the preparations are getting along. To see it with his own eyes," said Zahradil. The prime minister's trip to Russia caused a minor stir in Moscow. The Izvestia news agency requested an article from him on economic reform, and he gave a well-attended lecture at a Moscow university on systemic reform in former communist countries. When it was all over, Klaus walked away with a promise from the Russian side to sign an agreement within two months on paying off its $3.4 billion debt to the Czech Republic. Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said his country can learn something from the Czech experience. But even in this cheery diplomatic setting, Klaus made it clear that he was mainly in the East to collect debt from the Russians, not to work out any sort of alliance. The closest he came to officially complimenting Russian leaders was to say that he "found the political and economic situation a bit more stable than anticipated." By contrast, a Russian television report on Klaus' life was filled with compliments. "Klaus is a born polemicist, armed with well-considered arguments, erudition and irony as well." It is clear that there is also a personal dimension to the government's strongly Western policy. Klaus seems far more comfortable in the company of Western leaders and business people; his visits to Western countries don't necessarily have to hold a direct political or economic aim. Last month, he personally brought a huge bouquet of flowers to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and stood beaming beside her as camera shutters clicked. "They are very good friends," said Lucie Weissova, a journalist for Czech Radio who occasionally covers Klaus' trips abroad. "He couldn't let this meeting go by. They agree on everything." Later, Klaus wrote a lovingly nostalgic article for LIDOVE NOVINY about London and British right-wing politics, titled "English Conservatism Is Close to Us." But Klaus doesn't let politics get in the way of good relations with important Western neighbors. So when Rudolf Scharping, chairman of the German Social Democratic Party and a strong candidate for German chancellor, passed through Prague, he met with both Klaus and President Vaclav Havel. The ODS' Zahradil said this is an honor not afforded most other countries' opposition party leaders during an election year. However, since Scharping might be the leader of the Czech Republic's most important economic partner by year's end, usual procedures were waived. When deciding which countries to pay an official visit to, the Klaus government has the advantage of a world-renowned president in Havel. So while the prime minister has never been to Asia, Havel has. Other politically problematic invitations, from countries such as Syria or Iran, are normally given to other government ministers or deputy ministers, Zahradil said. But as far as Western Europe is concerned, invitations--whether to meet a head of state or to visit a university for an honorable doctorate--are always given special consideration. "One of the aims of the Czech Republic is to have good relations with all our neighbors," said Zahradil. "Of course, Hungary isn't as important as Germany."
