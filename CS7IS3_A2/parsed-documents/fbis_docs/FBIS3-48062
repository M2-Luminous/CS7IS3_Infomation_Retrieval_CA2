The occasion, in Myitkyina, will mark the official end to armed hostilities which began when the Kachin formed the Kachin Independence Organization and its armed wing in 1961 to fight Rangoon for greater autonomy. Despite a ceasefire deal, the Kachin will retain their arms and ammunition as the two sides have yet to resolve political issues of power sharing and greater autonomy for the Kachin State. Lt Gen Khin Nyunt, for the State Law and Order Restoration Council, and the Kachin chief of staff, Brig Gen Zau Mai, will represent their respective sides at the ceremony which will also include some festivities. Lt Gen Maung Thint, minister for development of border areas and ethnic minorities, said in an interview on Friday that there would be no signing of a truce agreement at the ceremony. The Kachin group, like nine other armed ethnic groups which have earlier struck ceasefire deals with Rangoon, will be allowed to retain its weapons for safety reasons. "There will be no signing of a peace treaty. It is like a pledge between the government and the group and will take place by the end of this month or beginning of next month," he said through interpreters. "The deal (with the Kachin) will be like that with other groups. We will assist them as we do the other groups. We will allow them to hold arms for their own safety, not for hostilities, and the government has pledged to cooperate with them in implementing development projects in their areas," he added. Maung Thint said that eventually a peace accord worked out between the government and the rebel groups will include the laying down of arms. In an interview later the same day, Col Kyaw Win, deputy director of the powerful Directorate of Defence Services Intelligence, said the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) will have to disarm itself if it wants to participate in the National Convention, which is in the process of drawing a new constitution, or if it wants to establish a political party. A Kachin official, speaking during a long-distance telephone interview yesterday, said he had no comment at the moment about the Slorc-KIA ceasefire ceremony. He added that the KIA wants to see a nationwide ceasefire and that it was still too early to comment about eventual disarmament. Col Kyaw Win said separate negotiations between Rangoon and two remaining armed ethnic forces, the Mon and Karenni, which are active along the Thai-Burmese border, are still in progress and that he expects the groups to reach a ceasefire deal with Slorc within the next two to three months. He said official negotiations between Rangoon and the strongest remaining ethnic rival, the Karen, could take place soon, and that the two sides have already held preliminary talks in Thailand. The intelligence officer said official Slorc-Karen meetings have to be held in Burma as Rangoon considers the matter an internal issue.
