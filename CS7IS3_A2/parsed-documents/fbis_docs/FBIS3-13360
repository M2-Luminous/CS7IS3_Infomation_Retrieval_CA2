The address expressed unequivocal support for a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East and strongly refuted Israeli claims and attempts to mislead world public opinion. President al-Asad noted Syria is totally open to the peace process and has offered much to bring this process to a successful conclusion. He stressed that our delegation to the Washington talks is invested with authority and is very trustworthy. Israel's security claims and demands, such as upgrading the level of the talks, are part of a pattern of prevarication, extortion, and avoidance of the needs of peace, topped by withdrawal from the occupied territories and recognition of Palestinian rights. For over two years, Arab delegations have heard nothing from the Israelis except security pretexts. Upon reviewing documented events in UN reports and resolutions, we see that Israel has always been the aggressor. Since 1948, Israel has been denounced by the United Nations on all fronts of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Today's events clearly reveal the continuation of this premeditated hostile Israeli policy. Southern Lebanon, for example, is exposed daily to thousands of Israeli shells from the ground, air, and sometimes the sea. Palestinian people are daily losing their sons, who are either killed or wounded by the bullets of the Israeli Army and settlers. After luring the Palestinian negotiating side into an agreement whose clauses are almost entirely based on ways and means to protect Israeli security and Zionist settlers, Israel committed, at the hands of its settlers, the ugliest and most serious massacre of the modern age when it killed over 50 Palestinian citizens in the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque while they were kneeling in prayer to God. Since 1948, Israeli security has only been a pretext for aggression and expansion. Israel launched several wars in the name of this alleged security. It forcibly seized Arab lands and planted them with settlements. Today, it refuses to return these lands, even in exchange for peace and despite the fact that its settlements are insecure. No people in the world would remain silent over the usurpation of their land. Tomorrow, Israel might embark on new aggressions and expansions to protect the security of its settlements. In the midst of this cycle of violence, which it itself created and which it sustains, Israel is naturally ignoring the fact that a real just and comprehensive peace in the region is the certain and ideal security guarantee. In his speech to the Palestinian delegation, President al-Asad revealed that former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Shamir made every possible effort to sabotage the U.S. peace initiative, but was forced to go to the Madrid conference because of Syria's positive attitude, although he rejected the U.S. initiative. Rabin came, and people regarded this as a good omen. Substantive issues were discussed in the Washington talks, but no substantial progress was made due to continuing Israeli prevarication. The question that poses itself is: Is Rabin implementing Shamir's plan? It is known that Shamir disclosed he was planning for futile negotiations in Washington for at least five years, during which he would be able to Judaize all the occupied Arab territories and confront the world with an accomplished fact. Washington's talks have entered their third year, but the Israeli position continues to be the same, not changing even an iota. Israel's lies and its rulers' falsehoods are countless. Israel has no word or pledge to honor. It claims peace and works against it. It claims a desire for a just settlement to the conflict in the region, but does all it can to fuel the conflict. It claims to protect Palestinians, but slaughters them. We shoud remember that a senior Israeli military commander refuted all the Rabin government's claims when he told the inquiry commission formed to investigate the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre that the Israeli Army had clear orders not to attack Zionist settlers, even if they were shooting at Arabs with an intent to kill. Thus, the settlers entered the al-Ibrahimi Mosque and committed the massacre before the very eyes and ears of the Israeli Army and with the instigation of the Israeli Government. Building peace in the Middle East requires sincere intentions, sincere efforts, and a sincere commitment. The rulers of Israel possess none. Their intentions are aggressive and expansionist, their efforts do not go beyond attempts at delusion, and their commitment is missing. Thus far, they have not abided by UN principles and resolutions, to which they owe their existence. The Arabs, however, will continue the peace process to the end and until everyone in this world is convinced that Israel and peace are at odds.
