In late January, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher held talks with the French president, prime minister, and foreign minister in Paris. The two sides, however, stuck to their own views and the talks failed in discord. The results of the talks between British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and the U.S. secretary of state in Washington on 3 February again proved that Britain was unable to change the set U.S. policy on the Bosnian issue. The differences between the United States and Britain and France over the Bosnian conflict are difficult to resolve. So what are the differences between the Western countries over the Bosnian conflict? Regarding the question of whether resolving the Bosnian crisis by force or through talks, it is not only that the European countries differ from the United States, but that European countries differ among themselves. France and Britain argued that the way to resolve the Bosnian conflict is by greatly enhancing the strength of the peacekeeping troops and forcing all parties to the Bosnian conflict to come to an agreement. Therefore, at the NATO summit earlier in January, France repeatedly urged the United States to send troops, but the United States has rejected this appeal all along with solemn statements. On this issue, owing to historical and political reasons, Germany does not agree to resolving the crisis by force. Not long ago, German Chancellor Kohl expressed clear doubts about the feasibility of publicly intervening in the Bosnian conflict by force. On the question of whether or not to lift the embargo on arms supplies to the Bosnian Muslims, Washington repeatedly has favored lifting the embargo and has maintained that placing an arms embargo on the Muslims alone means encouraging the aggressors. Paris, however, has maintained that this will only compel the United Nations to withdraw its peacekeeping troops and allow the Bosnian conflict to spread. On 25 January, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said: "The United States will have to assume responsibility for the `catastrophe.'" The U.S. State Department immediately retorted, alleging that France's position on the Bosnian issue was "puzzling." Washington held that the Bosnian Muslims are victims in the conflict and that pressure should be exerted on Serbia first. Europe and the United States have long had contradictions over the Yugoslav and Bosnian issues. At the very beginning, without consulting its allies, Germany was the first to acknowledge the independence of Slovenia and Croatia, and this compelled other EC countries to acknowledge the two countries. The United States has criticized this many times, maintaining that it is because of the recklessness of the Germans that the Yugoslav situation has gotten as bad as it is today. Moreover, the Americans hold that the Bosnian crisis should first be resolved by Europeans themselves, and ask why the Americans should be implicated now that trouble has broken out in the backyard of Europe? While the Americans favor launching air strikes at the Serbs, Britain and France are resolutely opposed, fearing their peacekeeping troops in Bosnia would be used as "hostages" and as bargaining chips. Why are these contradictions and differences between the Western countries difficult to resolve? Let us first analyze the U.S. position. We should say that on the Bosnian issue, the United States has taken a comparatively aloof position. At first, it warned other Western countries that they should act prudently. Last year, after becoming President, Clinton urged that the arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims be lifted, and put forward the idea of launching air strikes at the Serbs, but Britain and France did not accept this. Since then, the United States has taken a "spectator's" stance on the Bosnian conflict and has not taken any specific action. At a time when Britain and France are strongly urging the United States to send troops, the United States has stated that it will never send troops to Bosnia because it maintains that the Bosnian conflict, which involves many complicated problems, cannot be resolved by force or else it will probably be aggravated. However, there is an underlying reason why the United States is opposed to sending troops: First, the United States sent peacekeeping troops to Somalia last year, got deeply bogged down, and had 18 U.S. soldiers killed there, leading to denouncements at home. Second, the Bosnian conflict directly concerns the security interests of Britain, France, and other European countries, and does not very much concern the other side of the Atlantic, so the United States does not want to get involved in a regional conflict that does not have much bearing on its own interests, nor does it want to take any unnecessary risks. That is why France obliquely criticized this U.S. position, saying that Washington has always taken an "indifferent [ge an guan huo 7133 1489 6034 3499]" stance.
