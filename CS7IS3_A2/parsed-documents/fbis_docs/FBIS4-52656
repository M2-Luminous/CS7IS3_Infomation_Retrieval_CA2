FBIS4-52656 "dreas092_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-092 Daily Report 11 May 1994 North Korea Spokesman Denounces U.S. `Double Standard' Spokesman Denounces U.S. `Double Standard' SK1205055294 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2100 GMT 11 May 94 SK1205055294 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2100 GMT 11 May 94 Korean BFN [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry answered a question put by KCNA reporter on 11 May on the U.S. efforts to force the Arab countries to lift their economic sanctions against Israel. His answers are as follows: Making frequent visits to Mideast countries in late April and early May, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher put pressure on Arab countries to withdraw their economic sanctions against Israel. However, a number of Arab countries are expressing their opposition and discontent [pulman] by maintaining the position of not withdrawing sanctions until the issues concerning the Mideast are comprehensively resolved. We cannot but wonder about the United States' actions of trying to lift sanctions against Israel. It is no secret that Israel possesses nuclear weapons. The United States is trying to get economic sanctions on Israel, which threatens peace in the Middle East with nuclear weapons, lifted. However, the United States is blaring that sanctions will be taken against our country which has no nuclear weapons in actuality. This is a reversal of logic and an undisguised application of a double standard in international relations. This contradictory act [mosunjogin haengwi] of the United States makes it plain that the nuclear issue over which it is raising a hue and cry is a fictitious invention for the sinister political aim of isolating and crushing [korip apsal haryonun] our republic. The United States must not apply a double standard to the solution of international issues including the nuclear issue. The world people should approach the unjust act of the United States which is trying to impose its unilateral assertion on others, ignoring the stand of the parties concerned, and styling itself as international policemen with high vigilance .
