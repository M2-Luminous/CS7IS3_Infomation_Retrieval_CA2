At the next "Eurosatory" ground defense equipment fair to be held in June, "the Mercedes EXF and the Vextra will be on display on a specific stand bearing the name of one of the companies." These models will be the concrete implementation of the French and German proposals, but we will also see "a central model of the joint EVA [expansion unknown] concept proposed by the industrial groups." For the time being, Giat Industries has refused to comment on the subject. However, at the Defense Ministry, the contents of this memo, although considered to be "confidential," were confirmed. It is up to the Germans, probably in the first quarter of 1994, to validate the technical choices and in particular to choose between a wheeled armored vehicle (the solution felt to be most likely) proposed by Krauss Maffei, MAK [Kiel Machine-Building Company], and perhaps Wegmann; and a more conventional tracked vehicle as Thyssen is said to be proposing with the TH-495. Since Mercedes originated the project and the design for the wheeled vehicle but is not scheduled to produce it, Bonn will have to choose a company to act as prime contractor. Krauss Maffei is the clear favorite, giving rise to the four-party solution mentioned in the confidential memo. `Very Active Support' of Paris and Bonn The joint EVA design to be presented in June at Eurosatory will not perhaps have been officially validated, but will benefit from the "very active support" of Paris and Bonn. The Defense Ministry states that the first version of the modular armored vehicle should be a six-wheel drive (a six-by-six) weighing approximately 24 to 25 tonnes and bearing 9 tonnes per axle. This would make it possible to produce a 36-tonne eight-wheeler. The basic versions will be in troop transporter and command post configurations. France also envisages a direct support vehicle with a turret and a 45-mm gun, and a weapons system carrier with, among the options, a 120-mm gun. Initially, the Germans want to configure it as a repair, ambulance, transmission, and observation vehicle. The French plan to put 3,000 vehicles into service to replace -- given the recent reductions in army hardware -- the existing 4,000 front-armored vehicles, the 900 AMX personnel carriers, and the 325 AMX 10 RC's [expansion unknown]. Germany should also purchase 3,000 VBM's, although it has only included 800 in its future planning. The cost per vehicle remains fixed at 5 million French francs [Fr] excluding tax. Development costs are estimated at between Fr800 and Fr900 million. This represents a reasonable level of expenditure -- development will continue from 1996 to 2000, with the first mass-produced vehicle planned for the end of 2002 -- which justifies, according to a source close to the project, "the correct place" given to the VBM in the upcoming French military programming law for 1995 to 2000, which proves so difficult to complete.
