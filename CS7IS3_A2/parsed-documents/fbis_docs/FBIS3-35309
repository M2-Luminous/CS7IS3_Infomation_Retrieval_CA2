Mirsalim thanked the leader of the Islamic revolution Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i and President Rafsanjani for their confidence in him and disclosed the western conspiracies against the Islamic Republic. He underlined the importance of the Islamic culture for the Iranian nation and said today's world is faced with the domination-seeking tendencies of certain heinous states who insist to score cultural supremacy through dominating over other nations so as to pave the way for pocketing more interests. Underlining the extensive dimension of the cultural assault, he said that only last year, 40 European and American research centers have published 214 books and 300 articles on Iran and Islam while 16 counterrevolutionary and eight foreign radio stations broadcast programs in Persian. He added that 1,100 counterrevolutionary t.v. stations also broadcast programs in Persian and 214 publishing centers of Iranians and non-Iranians abroad distributed 315 books in Persian in an effort to mock the Islamic values and to level accusations against Iran. Giving more statistics, he also said that 310 cultural centers abroad were engaged in activities against the Persian and Islamic culture through publishing materials in 114 periodicals in Persian while world's leading publications have published 110 articles on Iran and Islam. Moreover, he added, eight world conferences were held on Iran during the period including the one on Iran-U.S. relations known as Clinton conference. The minister underlined that cultural growth is more important than economic and social growth. Mirsalim noted that language is the main medium for transfer of cultural concepts and that he plans to make efforts towards "preserving and strengthening the eloquent Persian language while at the same time to refine the language of alien words." He added that efforts will also be made to promote Persian in other regions particluarly in Persian speaking countries. As another domain of his plans, he said that he will protect the rights of the writers and artists and systematize cultural and research centers. As far as cultural relations with foreign countries are concerned, he said that facilities would be provided for cultural cooperation with the Central Asian states while such cooperation with Pakistan and Afghanistan would be strengthened and cultural ties with the Persian Gulf littoral states would be continued.
