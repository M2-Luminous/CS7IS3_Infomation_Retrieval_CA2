Noting that the new year address of the great comrade President Kim Il-song indicates in detail the way of building socialism and reunifying Korea, he said Mozambique holds that Korea should be reunified according to the confederacy formula and 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation advanced by the president. There is no other way but to carry the confederacy formula into effect for the reunification of Korea, he stressed, adding that the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula must be solved through DPRK- USA talks.
