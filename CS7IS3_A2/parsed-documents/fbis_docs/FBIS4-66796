He hinted at the "limitless" scope of cooperation between the two countries. Though Israel had no specific plans, he said it could sell arms to India and share its experiences in tackling problems relating to agriculture and water scarcity. India and Israel could also join in helping developing countries such as those of the CIS in the former Soviet Union. He also said that Israel hoped to establish diplomatic relations "very soon" with several Muslim countries that included the Gulf nations, Morocco and Tunisia. These countries were awaiting the implementation of the peace process in West Asia. Mr Beilin, who had signed an agreement on civil aviation ties between the two countries with Mr Ghulam Nabi Azad, the Union Minister for Civil Aviation, before attending the press conference, spoke warmly of his talks with several Indian leaders of the ruling party as well as the Opposition, including the Foreign Minister, Mr Dinesh Singh, and Mr L.K. Advani, the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] president.
