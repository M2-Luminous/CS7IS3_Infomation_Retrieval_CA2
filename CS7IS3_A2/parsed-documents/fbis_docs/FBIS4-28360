FBIS4-28360 "dreas111__a94034" FBIS-EAS-94-111-A Daily Report 29 May 1994 ANNEX Japan SDPJ's Political `Maneuvering' Criticized SDPJ's Political `Maneuvering' Criticized OW0606113794 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 29 May 94 Morning Edition p 5 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0606113794 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Editorial: "SDPJ's Outrageous Political Maneuvering"] [Text] It is over a month since the Hata cabinet was formed and the administration continues to drift on uncertain waters, betraying weaknesses as a minority government such as the resignation of a justice minister for his ignominious remark, and contradictory statements by various ministers at Diet sessions. Even more dismal is the spectacle of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] since it seceded from the coalition to join the ranks of the opposition. Immediately after the present cabinet was inaugurated, SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama attempted to take political leadership by advocating "negotiated dissolution" of the House of Representatives. He proposed: "The next general election should be held under the current multiseat district system on condition that the following general elections are held under the new system of single-seat districts and proportional representation." However, "Murayama's initiative" that advocated an early dissolution of the Diet under the current multiseat constituency system met with fierce opposition from the "Democrats," a policy group of SDPJ rightists who advocate political reform. The reasons for opposition are twofold: (1) political reform bills which were passed by the Diet will be complete only when bills on redrawing electoral districts for the Lower House, which are being drawn up at present, are passed by the Diet; (2) if a general election is held under the current multiseat constituency system before political reform bills are passed by the Diet, the single- seat constituency system, whose introduction was decided by the will of the Diet, will become merely nominal. This would be tantamount to "torpedoing political reform" in the final analysis. As a replacement for "Murayama's initiative" which lost its persuasiveness, SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo advocated "voluntary general resignation." Kubo said: "The Hata cabinet should resign en masse after the budget for the current fiscal year is passed, and should begin talks with the SDPJ toward forming a third coalition government within a new framework." Although "a new framework" is set as a condition, in the final analysis this is a clear indication of the SDPJ's intention to "return to the coalition government." To cope with the political situation after the passage of the budget, the SDPJ chairman and the general secretary presented two strategies which are diametrically opposed to each other. In addition, "Kubo's initiative" encountered criticism from inside and outside the party. At the central committee meeting of the SDPJ which began on 28 May, an immediate action plan was proposed in which two contradictory strategies -- "Murayama's initiative" and "Kubo's initiative" were written side by side. Kubo's initiative was criticized for "pandering to power in an unprincipled manner." Depending upon the interpretation of the strategies, they may be taken as a two-pronged plan amid an unclear political situation, but both contain fatal contradictions. In establishing the post-Hata administration in the ruling coalition parties, the SDPJ confirmed a "new policy agreement" after lengthy policy discussion. However, when it found out about the group called "Kaishin" that excluded the SDPJ, it broke away from the coalition government, claiming it was a "breach of faith." Although the blame may be laid on the side that formed "Kaishin" without notifying the SDPJ, the SDPJ made the Hata administration a minority government by resorting to the most forceful action -- breaking away from the coalition government. The SDPJ will never obtain a satisfactory understanding from the public if it tries to "return to power" in such a short time no matter how it emphasizes "a new framework and discussion for political power." Moreover, apart from an emergency such as the prime minister falling seriously ill, if the current cabinet resigns en masse merely because of talks with the SDPJ, and without the passage of a non-confidence vote or a situation where the passage of a non- confidence vote is inevitable, and undertakes to establish a coalition government, that will be not so much illicit union as "collusive politics" which seek one's own interests without regard for the public. What the SDPJ needs at present is not to be swayed by the prospect of immediate advantage but to conduct an all-out debate within the party on how to develop its own perspective of the future political situation.
