Time is working against the party's electoral prospects. Ruiz said that "the idea of selecting a presidential candidate at this time is premature. In my view, however, those who believe we should make that selection in 1995 are also mistaken." Ruiz spoke before 180 Sandinists during a party meeting in Leon. Ruiz, who has been mentioned as a candidate for FSLN general secretary, said: "If my becoming a candidate will serve to unite the party, then I will accept. I cannot agree to say, however, that having two or more candidates would affect FSLN unity." The FSLN treasurer expressed concern over the fact that "we are spending time on this discussion, while our political contender is quickly gaining strength." He stressed that "losing again in 1996 would mean the end of Sandinism as we know it." The Sandinist leader said: "There is no time to organize another congress." We must begin the task of organizing from the ground up, so as to inspire the popular support we will need in 1996. The meeting was led by Leon Mayor Luis Felipe Perez, Deputy Doris Tijerino, and Fanor Herrera, the FSLN political secretary in Leon. To start selecting a presidential candidate in 1995 "would drag us into an internal debate. The Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility [ESAF] is already in motion, and I doubt the Congress will go back on the decision it took at its last meeting to disapprove the plan," Ruiz explained. He continued by saying: "That decision, however, does not say how to counter those economic and political formulas. We must move on to the next task: What national plan should the FSLN work on and develop for what comes after the elections?" Ruiz affirmed that it is necessary to begin the process of selecting teams and people, comparing them, and seeking new alliances with the people who are bound to approach us in search of specific posts and responsibilities with the new government. In his analysis, he stressed the need for the party to act openly. "If we are late in doing so, we will end up in an image game with our own militants. The first thing they will say is that we have just finished a congress during which we decided to act one way and that now we are rearranging things. We need clarity." In addressing congressional sovereignty, he said that "the delegates will have the responsibility of reviewing the benefits of FSLN party modernization or renewal, considering the historic responsibility of dividing or uniting the party, and, before the people, deciding on rising to power within a short time." According to Ruiz, the FSLN must aspire to a power "not of minorities but of majorities, and, thus, it must have national consensus. That is why a national proposal is needed." He cited the example of agriculture, saying that there is no Sandinist proposal on the topic. Ruiz called upon the Sandinists to "heal the injuries and erase the memories of the war in order to be able to build a new nation." To open the doors of the FSLN to all the politicians in the rural sectors is, in his opinion, "the modernization and renewal of the FSLN." Ruiz called for "finding politically feasible solutions that will strengthen the cohesion and unity of Sandinism." "If the discussion is insufficient, if we are unable to solve all the issues through this means, and if we only have the political solution to preserve unity during the next two years in order to tackle the 1996 elections, it would be a pity not to accept it. It would be necessary to accept it because, if not, we face fragmentation and the prospect of not achieving power," Ruiz stated. According to the FSLN treasurer, the party's internal debate process "is showing that several issues that we initially thought would weaken us -- such as opening the doors of Sandinism -- have [not] been so contentious." Ruiz considered the possibility "that this process could, perhaps, end up in a political discussion rather than an ideological debate." He added that, in his opinion, the political solution should be implemented prior to the congress "without confabulations, unprincipled conciliations, or artificial commitments."
