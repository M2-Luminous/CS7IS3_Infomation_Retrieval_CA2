[Shakhray] I learned about the decision after it was made, and the same applies to the new minister. Formally, from the legal point of view, the decision is correct. But there is also such thing as official or human ethics. Therefore, my decision to resign was prompted not by emotions -- I had time to think it over -- but by the fact that ethical norms were violated. [Kiselev] Are you under the impression that all this is kind of natural since people from the 1991 August-December period are now leaving the pinnacle of state power and the president is parting with those who featured at the beginning of his activity. [Shakhray] You know, my feeling -- or observation, rather -- is that it is difficult for the president to part with people he has worked with for a long time. He finds this difficult as a person. Psychologically, this may show in the fact that after spending a long time trying to resolve a cadre issue, he makes a decision in a very sudden and resolute manner, as if tearing this problem away from him, so to speak, tearing it like one pulls a knot without untangling it. And then we have many examples when we usually say that a person who has been fired found out about his resignation... [Kiselev, interrupting] Do you think that the president's decision not to accept your resignation, which was read by his press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, also proves the fact that a person finds it difficult to part with his colleagues. [Shakhray] May be, may be. The other thing is that it should not have been announced by the esteemed Mr. Kostikov. I am not going to mention any personal assessments or lexicon which was used at the time but if it were up to Kostikov to decide, he would have accepted my resignation. [passage omitted] [Kiselev] What are the real reasons for your resignation? Why is it that you were notified without any warning, that you were simply told that you were no longer the minister for the affairs of nationalities? [Shakhray] If no motives or reasons are stated in the document releasing me from the post of minister, we can only learn them from either the prime minister or the president. Everything else is just our suppositions. The ministry has become a real tool in the management system. I'll tell you why. [words indistinct] the ministry has real means, power, and financial levers in its hands. For example, seven trillion rubles [R] for Russia's north will be handled by the ministry as well as R40 billion for Russia's Germans in accordance with intergovernmental agreements concluded between Russia and Germany, and R20 billion for the budget fund to support Russia's peoples which is, in essence, Russia's national policy of cultural revival of its peoples and which encompasses textbooks, languages, training of ethnic cadres, and so on. As soon as the ministry becomes a real institution, its ministers are replaced. It is obvious that those who are behind the decision believe that somebody else should operate the control levers. This is the financial reason of what happened. There are also purely political reasons, namely that the ministry is headed by the leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord. I think this is the outcome of maneuvering which has been going on for many months. Not all of those drawn into these maneuvers even realize what has been going on. [Kiselev] What is the origin of these maneuvers, as you put it, these intrigues if you like, which have been hatching for some time? Is it the presidential office or the Federation Council? Or do they originate here, within the Council of Ministers? [Shakhray] Well, again, you and I can only conjecture and assume. I think that the prime minister demonstrated one of his characteristics. He does not like reshuffling ministries or governments which he is working with. He prefers to work with experienced people. So, this maneuvering does not originate with the government. I believe in the principle: Don't judge if you don't wish to be judged yourself. So I won't throw stones of accusation in any direction. I think that all those who have a stake in this maneuvering have drawn the spotlight on themselves without any help from others. [end recording] [passage omitted] There are many hypotheses about the reasons for Shakhray's resignation. One which deserves special mention is the Chechen connection, the claim that Shakhray's departure is connected with serious disagreements within the Russian leadership about the problem of a settlement with Chechnya. When I asked Shakhray what lay behind these disagreements, he said: [Begin Shakhray recording] I really feel uncomfortable even talking about this. Why? Because this is not the view of Shakhray, or the view of Shumeyko and Filatov, who allegedly represent a different point of view. The fact is that a formula for settling this conflict is contained in the president's message and in parliament's decision, that is, talks and consultations with the Chechen authorities and consultations with all political forces in Chechnya. The subject of these consultations must be a draft treaty on the delimitation of responsibilities and powers. Then the treaty must be signed after elections have been held -- in 1994 or 1995, though the date of the elections is not the issue. If esteemed Vladimir Filippovich or anybody else says that it will not be done that way, that we will solve the Chechen problem a different way, he will be changing the president's official line, changing the State Duma's official line. The entire logic of events is leading up to the following scenario: One of the Chechen leaders will normalize relations with Russia and do his people a favor and himself a favor as a political leader. All the intrigue began because esteemed Ruslan Imranovich Khasbulatov arrived in Chechnya. His contacts with aides to Rutskoy and other politicians convince me that he will not sit idle there for long. He will behave as politicians do. He will enter the federal elections, if they are held there under, say, an outline agreement for normalization of relations between Chechnya and Russia. Then a completely different fate will await other politicians. So, the personification of figures within the Chechen Republic, taken together with their previous incarnation on the Russian Mount Olympus, leads to what you call different approaches. These are not different approaches. I personally believe, all told, that the important factor from Russia's point of view is not personalities -- Shakhray, Ivanov, Sidorov, or somebody else. The important thing is to ensure that this tendency, political and economic normalization of relations as a whole, strengthening of Russia's unity and integrity, should make headway. [end recording] Let us focus on three aspects of Sergey Shakhray's interview which vividly illustrate Russian politics. First, as soon as any state official gets his hands on real political -- and especially economic -- levers of power, he immediately becomes the target of fierce attack from other politicians -- not necessarily from within the camp of his hardline opponents, either. Second, the interview shows quite clearly that on the Russian political Olympus there are figures who fear the prospect of Ruslan Khasbulatov's return to politics more than they fear the prospect of endless crisis in Russian-Chechen relations. Last, in spite of everything, Shakhray displays in this interview maximum loyalty to the president -- and not just in the interview. He has, as it were, left the door open, saying that he will not make a final decision on whether to resign or not from the post of deputy prime minister until he has had talks with the president -- talks which will probably be held next week. However if, as he has said, Shakhray realizes as a result of these talks that it will be impossible for him to operate normally as deputy prime minister responsible, in particular, for ethnic and regional policy, his decision to resign will stand.
