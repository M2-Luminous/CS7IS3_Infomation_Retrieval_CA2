Considering the talking held in Belgrade, Mr. Stolheim said that "our talking in Belgrade were concentrated on the Serbian views for the situation in Kosova and what we were told there is not something unexpected for you because their official attitude toward Kosova is that it is a natural part of Serbia and it will be this one for ever." Later on, he said, our talking were concentrated in the Albanian's position and in the great matters of the independence of Kosova as well as in the protection of the human rights and freedoms in Kosova and the right of the Albanians for non-investigation by the Serbian police. Mr. Stolheim said that they have talked also about the fate of the Albanian refugees turned back by Norway because there are evidences that these people are being maltreated by the Serbian police and their human rights are not respected. This is an important part of the present debates in Scandinavia, he said. Asked about his trust to the words of the minister for the minorities in rump Yugoslavia, Mrs. Margaret Savovic, considering the investigation by the Serbian police of the Albanian refugees turned back from Norway and other countries, the Norwegian parliamentary man said "No." [sentence as received]
