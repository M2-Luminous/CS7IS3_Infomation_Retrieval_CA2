While conceeding that the alliance partners might be simply excercising "their democratic right," there is still reason for concern. The "FA cannot be allowed to pursue narrow political gains at the expense of the lives of millions of our people," what Inkatha leader Buthelezi calls "politics of resistance." All the alliance partners together, "never said a word when it was absolutely necessary .... today when people are about to taste their freedom, they make noises about a civil war." BEELD Only Path for Right Wing is Negotiation -- The Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 8 February says in a page-8 editorial that "as Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg said at the weekend, there are indeed many shortcomings in the right-wing's plan to unilaterally demarcate a right-wing homeland." "The major shortcoming, which he does not mention, is that the right wing has no territory which it can claim as its own, where they form the majority of the population." "There simply is no such region. And that is also the major shortcoming in their other alternative, which is to fight for the homeland. There is no homeland to fight for; no territory to defend; no invaders to repel; no identifiable enemy to shoot dead. Up to now the fighting has consisted mainly of blowing up power pylons and railway lines..." "In the final analysis the only way forward for the right wing remains negotiation, which means give and take." Mandela's Tirades Against De Klerk `Unacceptable' -- A second editorial on the same page of the 8 February BEELD argues that "the manner in which Mr. Nelson Mandela continues with his personal attacks on the state president is unacceptable. His references to President de Klerk as `an unstable person' and a `weakling' overstep the bounds a civilized political leader should go in an election campaign. South Africa rightfully expects any political leader, who sees himself as a future head of state, to behave like one. Mr. Mandela's emotional tirade against President de Klerk excludes him from this category." "By increasingly playing the man rather than the ball, Mr. Mandela appears to be seeking a lightning conductor for criticism against aspects of his policy. We appeal for a raising of the level of political debate -- otherwise South Africans will in the future reap the fruits of these outbursts." Negotiations Reach `Moment of Truth' -- The Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 9 February argues in a page-8 editorial that "the moment of truth has arrived for the Freedom Alliance's negotiations with the government and the ANC. With only a few days left before parties must register for the election, the negotiation cards are on the table, and it appears that the government and the ANC are prepared to make several more concessions in order to remove the alliance's objections to peaceful participation in the election." "Should the remaining stumbling blocks in the negotiations be removed, the Freedom Alliance, in the light of these concessions, will have no other honorable choice but to participate. Should they do so, they will be able, as honorable negotiators, to make a contribution to the political process in bringing about greater peace, stability, and prosperity for all in South Africa." ILANGA Negotiations With ANC Viewed -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu on 7-9 February in a page-4 editorial states that "the African National Congress' [ANC] decision to accept the double ballot system is commendable indeed as it is a step forward in resolving problems plaguing the negotiations on the future of this country." "Now we hear that because the ANC has agreed to the double ballot, it now wants the Freedom Alliance leaders to sign documents binding them to taking part in the 26-29 April election." "People should not get confused here, because there are other important proposals put forward by the Freedom Alliance that the ANC has said nothing about." "What is their story on the Zulu monarchy, kwaZulu, and the Zulu nation? There is still a lot they have not said anything about. So do not get confused!"
