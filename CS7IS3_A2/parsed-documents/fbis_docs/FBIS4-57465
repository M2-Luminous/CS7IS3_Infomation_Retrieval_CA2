We do not accept the results provided by the Central Electoral Board, which gives a slight advantage to President Joaquin Balaguer, Pena Gomez said in a television program. He also demanded a review of all vote tally sheets. Pena Gomez also referred to his remarks during the 1994 elections, when he said that fraud must be proven before a call for violence could be made. In a letter addressed to the Central Electoral Board, Jose Francisco Pena Gomez demands the suspension of the vote count due to the despicable, serious irregularities detected during the process. If the vote count continues, Balaguer would be proclaimed president, he said. Moreover, Chilean Luis Ayala, chairman of Socialist International for Latin America, has denounced serious irregularities in the general elections held on Monday [16 May] in the Dominican Republic. In a news conference, Ayala supported the denunciations made by the PRD presidential candidate who said he would be present today at the Central Electoral Board to refute the process and demand new elections in those districts where thousands of citizens were unable to vote. Luis Ayala added that Socialist International delegates, in the Dominican Republic to observe the elections at the invitation of Pena Gomez, have detected serious and grave irregularities. Ayala added that citizens linked to Balaguer's government had two identification cards. Balaguer was leading when the latest vote count results were announced.
