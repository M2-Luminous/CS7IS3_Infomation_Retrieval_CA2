Ren Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and president of the Supreme People's Court, spoke at the meeting, stressing the need to step up efforts to raise court cadres' academic levels and to train a number of professional judges. Ren Jianxin said that since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and with the development of reform, opening up, and of the building of the socialist legal system, courts have made great progress in strengthening the rank of court cadres and achieved marked results in educating and training court cadres. Work on multi-level education and training of court cadres was comprehensively carried out particularly since the establishment of the Sparetime Law University for the nation's court cadres in 1985, of the China Senior Judge Training Center, and of provincial-level judge training centers in 1988. Now China has basically realized the goal of raising court cadres' professional levels to the college law department level or higher, of having trained more than 600 holders of master's degrees in law and over 1,000 senior judges and reserve forces for senior judges, and sent a number of court cadres to make further studies abroad. The decade-long efforts of educating and training court cadres have greatly changed the phenomenon of low educational and professional levels among court cadres due to historical reasons and helped courts raise the quality of and efficiency in handling cases. Ren Jianxin said the gradual establishment of a socialist market economic system and of a legal system that is adapted to the socialist market economic system have markedly increased courts' roles and responsibilities. This sets greater demands on court cadres. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a sound and regularized judge training system and to train judges in a planned and systematic manner. It is also necessary to establish a state institute for judges. Provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities should step up establishing institutes for judges in their localities. Only through this way can we meet the requirements for and improve China's modernized judge system. Vice President of the Supreme People's Court Zhu Mingshan said at the meeting that courts will provide a complete pre-post training for their 42,000 new members in the next several years, will sponsor special seminars on new laws in a timely manner, and will regularly hold training classes for judges, so as to constantly raise court cadres' quality and academic levels. The current national work conference on educating and training court cadres was the second meeting following the first meeting, which was held in 1990. Some 100 leaders from all of the nation's levels of courts and from relevant departments attended the meeting.
