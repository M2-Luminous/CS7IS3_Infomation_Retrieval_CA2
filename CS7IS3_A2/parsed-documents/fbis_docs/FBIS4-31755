Following the meeting, Horn told journalists the MSZP presented a compromise proposal regarding the guarantees of the coalition agreement which is to be worked out. He said they had exchanged views on the distribution of government offices and ministries, but no concrete persons were mentioned in this context. These issues will be discussed by the general negotiating delegations of the two parties on Tuesday. The MSZP naturally has ideas as regards personnel, but that is a topic for the general committee talks, Horn said. As regards the post of deputy prime minister, Peto said the main point was not the introduction of the post itself, but rather that the smaller coalition-partner will have a person alongside the prime minister to represent it in the course of coordinations. The name of the function -- deputy prime minister or coalition deputy prime minister -- is a technical matter to be decided. At the same time, it is obvious that the SZDSZ's representative will not fill in for the prime minister in a case of his absence, Peto added. Both chairmen said the guarantees imply only the first step towards a coalition agreement. The concrete issues are to be discussed by the expert committees, and reaching agreements in these will not be an easy task. Peto said they wanted to govern jointly, but this does not mean they can quickly agree on the details. Horn and Peto also said they consider the first session of the new parliament on June 28 to be a determining factor with respect to the timetable for coalition talks. Their goal is to complete negotiations by then, although the concrete establishment of the new government is not bound to the opening of Parliament. According to the two chairmen, an agreement should be concluded by around June 24, in order for the MSZP Congress and the SZDSZ delegate assembly to be able to ratify the document before the founding session of parliament.
