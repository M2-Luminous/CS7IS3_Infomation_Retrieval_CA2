Laso D'Lom and F. Cortes: "Borrell Asserts That `Users or Taxpayers' Should Pay for Investment Effort in Infrastructures"] [Text] Madrid -- At its meeting yesterday the cabinet approved the Infrastructure Master Plan [PDI], which envisions a total investment of 18.753 trillion pesetas up to the year 2007, with an annual average of 1.250 trillion pesetas. Out of the total amount of investments, 13.173 trillion pesetas will come from the budget, while the remaining 5.580 trillion pesetas will be funded from nonbudget sources. That is, they will have to be paid "either by the users of the services, the autonomous administrations, or the taxpayers in general," Borrell asserted yesterday following the plan's approval by the government. At the presentation of the PDI, Jose Borrell, minister of public works, transport, and the environment, said that a "rational" debate on how to finance infrastructure should now begin: [At issue is] whether the financing should come from taxpayers, as hitherto, or users of the projects carried out should contribute more, as is currently the case with the tolls on some highways. Borrell asserted that neither he nor the government has a set position on whether or not user fees should be applied, and asked that the debate begun in this connection should not be "Manichaean," and that people should not seek to say that the Spanish people will pay twice for highways -- once as taxpayers and then as users. The minister cited as an example the fact that maintaining the current highway network, with the new projects recently completed, will cost the administration 100 billion pesetas this year, and asked who should pay for them. Charges The ministry has studied the introduction of user fees for infrastructure -- especially highways -- and even examined the amount which could be charged, this being an annual fee of around 5,000 pesetas per light vehicle and 10,000 pesetas for heavy vehicles. However, since this kind of charge is not the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works, Transport, and the Environment, Borrell asserted yesterday that it is the Ministry of the Economy and Finance which should promote this debate in Spanish society, as has been the case in other European countries. Over 75 percent of the investment (around 14.2 trillion pesetas) will be earmarked for transport infrastructure. Specifically, 10.7 trillion pesetas will be for regional areas, while another 3.4 trillion pesetas will be allocated for urban areas. Investment in water projects will exceed 2.2 trillion pesetas (12 percent of the total), while 9 percent (1.8 trillion pesetas) will be allocated to environmental infrastructure (water drainage and purification and waste management). Coastal projects will receive 0.5 trillion pesetas, which will be mainly devoted to improving and regenerating beaches. An investment of 45 billion pesetas is planned for research and development in technologies related to transport and infrastructure. "This," the ministry states, "is the first strategic planning conducted in Spain to affect the basic infrastructures as a whole." The ministry also states that the PDI is characterized by being a master plan, and thus "outlines a coherent framework for action," and is conceived as "an instrument of dynamic and flexible planning, adaptable in time to society's economic and technological evolution." As far as intercity roads are concerned, the 5.4 trillion pesetas earmarked make them the most important part of the PDI. The section devoted to high-volume roads includes the construction of 5,300 km of new freeways and expressways, and 1,400 km of link roads. The construction of a turnpike between Madrid and Tudela is also proposed. Railroads In the case of railroads, the PDI envisages an investment of 3.2 trillion pesetas, aimed at improving the layout and extending the busiest routes. Suburban services will be boosted, and part of the investment will be devoted to preserving over 3,000 km of track. The plan also consolidates a high-speed network through the Madrid-Barcelona-Frontera lines, the so-called Basque "Y," the Navarre corridor, and a new Madrid-Albacete-Valencia line. Some 0.8 trillion pesetas and 1 trillion pesetas are earmarked for ports and airports respectively, aimed at optimizing the functioning of the port and airport systems and carrying out projects such as the enlargement of Madrid's Barajas Airport. Another 3.3 trillion pesetas will be devoted to resolving transport problems in 18 metropolitan areas and in medium-sized and small cities. Water Projects The PDI includes a section whose aim is to increase water resources, including water conservation and recycling programs. The planned projects include increasing regulating capability within each basin, interbasin transfers, and seawater desalination. Some 0.3 trillion pesetas will be earmarked for improving and regenerating beaches.
