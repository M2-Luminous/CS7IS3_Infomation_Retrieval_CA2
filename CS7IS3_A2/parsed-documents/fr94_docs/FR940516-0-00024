FR940516-0-00024 FR940516-0-00011 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;25] Establishment of Class E Airspace; New Haven, CT AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This action establishes a Class E airspace area at New Haven, CT. At present this area is designated as Class D airspace during the time when the New Haven air traffic control tower (ATCT) is in operation. A need for controlled airspace at New Haven continues, however, after the ATCT closes. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for aircraft conducting instrument flight rules (IFR) operations when the ATCT is closed. DATES: Effective date: 0901 UTC, June 23, 1994. Comment date: Comments must be received on or before June 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments on the rule in triplicate to: Manager, System Management Branch, ANE&hyph;530, Air Traffic Division, New England Region, Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;25, Federal Aviation Administration, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299. The docket may be examined in the Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, New England Region, Federal Aviation Administration, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299, weekdays, except Federal holidays, between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Karl D. Anderson, System Management Specialist, System Management Branch, ANE&hyph;530, Federal Aviation Administration, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; telephone, (617) 238&hyph;7530; facsimile, (617) 238&hyph;7599. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the DATES section. However, after review of the comments and if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or amend the regulation. Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes a Class E airspace area at New Haven, CT. At present, this area is designated as Class D airspace during the time when the New Haven air traffic control tower (ATCT) is in operation. A need for controlled airspace at New Haven continues, however, after the ATCT closes to provide adequate controlled airspace for aircraft operating under instrument flight rules (IFR) when the ATCT is closed. As noted in the Airspace Reclassification Final Rule, published in the Federal Register on December 17, 1991, airspace at an airport with a part-time ATCT should be designated as Class D airspace when the ATCT is in operation, and as Class E airspace at other times. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for aircraft conducting IFR operations when the ATCT is closed. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designated as surface areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need to establish Class E airspace in the vicinity of New Haven, CT, in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and an opportunity for prior public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
