"It is only through reconciliation that the people of South Africa can be able to build a new, peaceful and progressive country," Mwinyi said in a statement to the media. Mwinyi said the whole world was satisfied with last week's historic elections, which ended centuries of white minority in South Africa. Tanzania was a strident critic of South Africa's apartheid policy which disenfranched the majority black community. Mwinyi pledged to cooperate with whatever government comes to power after the elections results are declared.
