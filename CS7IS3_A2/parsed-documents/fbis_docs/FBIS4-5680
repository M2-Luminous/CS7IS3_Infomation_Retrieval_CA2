Although some members are cautious about shifting the burden toward direct taxation and want further discussion, no opposition emerged at a panel meeting, Kato told a news conference afterward. Kato, an emeritus professor at Keio University, said the advisory panel to the prime minister must pick up the pace of its deliberations to meet a June deadline for its final report, which the government is to use to craft its tax policy. The commission, which will meet again Friday, also agreed to form a working group of scholars, excluding bureaucrats and interest- group representatives, to examine the possibility of a regional consumption tax, Kato said. The tax options that the commission is to lay out in its report will likely not be numerical, he said. Kato has said he agrees with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa that the net tax burden must be raised to meet the needs of Japan's aging society. The commission ended its previous meeting in confusion just as Hosokawa announced last Friday that he will quit as premier. But Kato said the members agreed Tuesday to press on with their work, noting Japan's international promise to spell out by the end of June its pledge for tax reform, including permanent income tax cuts, to be enacted by year's end. "Whoever becomes the next prime minister, the road is narrowing" as the tax debate proceeds and time runs out, Kato said.
