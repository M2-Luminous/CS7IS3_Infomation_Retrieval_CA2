Any differences may be due to climatic variations, changes in course severity, non-uniformity of wear rates between individual tires within the same lot, effects of aging and storage on the wear rates of the CMTs, errors in the calculation for adjusting BCWRs, or perhaps some combination of those factors. The test course is well maintained by the State of Texas and does not appear to have changed appreciably since testing first started there in 1975. That suggests that a significant part of the change in BCWRs may be attributed to the CMTs instead of course variability. NHTSA has noted that in every case in which one lot of CMTs is replaced by another, the new lot invariably shows a lower BCWR than the former. The first batch of CMTs were procured from Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in 1975 and had a wear rate of 4.44. Tires from that same lot were tested again in 1979 and showed a wear rate of 4.08. A new CMT batch was purchased in 1979 which showed a wear rate of 3.82. By 1980, however, tires tested from that batch showed an increased wear rate of 5.29. In each batch, the wear rate varied when tested at a later date, from one to four years after purchase. A possible explanation for those changes in wear rate among tires in the same lot could be attributed to aging and/or environmental degradation of the tires. To minimize those factors, the agency now purchases a one-year supply of CMTs at a time and stores them in the basement area of a warehouse which is typically 20 degrees cooler than ambient summer temperature. In addition to the aging/environmental degradation of CMTs affecting the BCWR, the agency believes that the method of calculating the BCWR may be in error. As stated above, the purpose of using a CMT is to provide a common baseline for all candidate tires. However, it appears that the practice of relating all new CMTs to all prior CMTs by the procedure described above has somehow distorted the treadwear grading procedure to the point that treadwear grades of candidate tires are now highly suspect. If, instead of utilizing the BCWR to establish treadwear grades, the wear rates of the CMTs were compared directly to those of the candidate tires to determine the projected mileage of the candidate tires, much lower and perhaps more realistic grades would result. In the case of the previous example, the average wear rate for these candidate tires was 4.90 mils per 1,000 miles when tested. For the CMTs that accompanied these tires, with the same convoy, the average wear rate was 6.49 mils per 1,000 miles. The actual wearout rate for radial CMTs tested in 1975 was 67,000 miles, which is equivalent to a grade of 223. By assuming that the wearout for the CMTs remains the same, the calculated wearout for the tires in question would be 88,700 miles (6.49/4.90 x 67,000). This would be equivalent to a grade of 295 or 280 when rounded off to the nearest lower 20-point increment. The direct comparison of wear rates between CMTs and candidate tires may produce lower and more realistic grades for tires. It would, however, change the original intent of the CMT, which was to provide a common baseline for comparison, regardless of when a candidate tire is tested. Further, it would present a problem for the marketing of tires that are already graded and still in production. Nevertheless, improvement in the treadwear grading procedure appears to be needed in order to provide treadwear grades that are realistic, consistent, and meaningful to consumers. II. Traction Traction grades are established on test pads also located at San Angelo, Texas. Two surfaces are used in the test: wet asphalt and wet concrete. A test trailer is equipped with ASTM E501 standard tires utilized in the tests as control tires. Two standard tires are inflated to 24 pounds per square inch (psi), statically balanced, allowed to cool to ambient temperature (with inflation pressure readjusted as necessary), and mounted on the test trailer. Each tire is then loaded to 1,085 pounds. The trailer is towed by a light truck over the wet asphalt surface at a speed of 40 miles per hour (mph). One wheel is locked, and the locked-wheel traction coefficient is recorded for that wheel for a period of 0.5 to 1.5 seconds after lockup. The test is then repeated on the wet concrete surface, locking the same wheel. Those procedures are repeated 10 times on each surface for each wheel. The 20 measurements taken on each surface are averaged to find the standard traction coefficient for each surface. Those standard traction coefficients are then utilized to determine the adjusted traction coefficients of the candidate tires.
