The results of the activity of the Ministry of Energy and Fuel and the Ministry of Construction during 1993 were discussed. A report on the work of the ministries during the aforementioned period was presented by First Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Vardan Movsisyan. The ministers presented reports on the activity of their departments. Minister of Energy and Fuel Miron Shishmanyan noted that in 1993 the republic produced 68.5 percent of the planned quantity of electric energy. Because of the shortage of energy sources its production at heating and electric power plants decreased sharply. It amounted to 31.7 percent of the overall quantity of electric energy produced. As a result of the transportation blockade in 1993 the republic received: 27 percent of the envisioned quantity of fuel oil, 11 percent of the gasoline, 23 percent of the diesel fuel, 16 percent of the aircraft fuel, 27 percent of the lignite, and 22 percent of the liquefied gas. Because of the constant explosions in the gas line the republic received 22 percent of the expected quantity of gas. Work on creating small hydroelectric power plants continued throughout the year. In spite of the irregular deliveries of fuel in 1993 a number of branches of the national economy continued to function, city transportation, the sphere of services, and partially the system of education continued to operate, albeit with interruptions. During the winter several rayons of Yerevan and a number of cities of the republic were supplied with heat. Within the framework of the Zima program, kerosene and liquid fuel obtained through humanitarian aid from the United States were distributed to socially needy segments of the population. Preparatory, organizational, and technical measures were also taken to put the Armenian nuclear power plant back on line. Minister of Construction Feliks Pirumyan noted that the main task for his department was to prevent further decline of the volume of construction work. Presenting the overall picture of capital construction, he reported that in 1993 a number of structures that are of great significance to the republic economy were put into operation. Capital investments totaling 9,904.4 million rubles [R] were made with internal funds of the enterprises and organizations. With state capital investments it was intended to put into operation 287,200 square meters of dwelling space. This program was fulfilled by 82.8 percent. With funds from the population and state subsidies, 97,100 square meters of dwelling space were put into operation, 15,700 of which were in the disaster zone. There was an exchange of opinions about the reports that were heard. Summing up the results of the discussion, Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan noted both the positive aspects of the ministries' work and their shortcomings and omissions.
