FR940314-2-00088 FR940314-2-00051 National Park Service Santa Rosa Island Development Concept Plan; Channel Islands National Park; Availability of Draft Environmental Impact Statement SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91&hyph;190 as amended), the National Park Service, Department of the Interior, has prepared a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) assessing the potential impacts of the proposed Development Concept Plan for Santa Rosa Island, Channel Islands National Park, Santa Barbara County, California. The draft plan proposes the development of infrastructure and facilities to support maintenance and protection of resources and historic structures, research and further study of both natural and cultural resources, limited experimental restoration of natural systems, and the provision of limited visitor use opportunities. Maintenance and housing facilities would be provided in two locations. One alternative is evaluated, that of no action, which would maintain existing housing, provide minimal maintenance of facilities to provide for basic health and safety of visitors and employees, and provide essential resource protection with minimal research and planning for restoration of natural systems. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Written comments on the draft Development Concept Plan and DEIS will be accepted until May 31, 1994 and should be sent to the Superintendent, Channel Islands National Park, 1901 Spinnaker Drive, Ventura, Ca. 93001. A public meeting on the plan will be held April 27, 1994, from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., at the park visitor center located at the above address. National Park Service officials will be available at this time to present the plan, receive oral and written comments, and answer questions. Copies of the draft plan and DEIS are available at the park headquarters at the above address. Copies are also available for inspection at libraries located in the park's vicinity and at the Western Regional Office, National Park Service, 600 Harrison St., suite 600, San Francisco, Ca. 94107&hyph;1372.
