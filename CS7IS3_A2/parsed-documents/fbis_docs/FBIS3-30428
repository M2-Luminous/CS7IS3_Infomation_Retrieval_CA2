Actually, it has been postponed until Tuesday [8 February]. The new Assembly Chairman Dragan Tomic stated that the reason for the delay in the session were consultations among the heads of the deputy caucuses. They were supposed to agree on the candidates for the [four] posts of deputy assembly chairmen. The meeting was not attended by any DEPOS representatives. In addition, only two people were proposed as deputy chairmen. Tomic thought that the best thing would be to hold more consultations and that the session should be postponed until Tuesday.
