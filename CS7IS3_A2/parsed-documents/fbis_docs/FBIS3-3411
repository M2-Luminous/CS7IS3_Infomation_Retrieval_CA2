Sun Weiben, chairman of the Heilongjiang PPC, said at a press conference that local legislatures have the right to supervise local governments, courts and procuratorates according to a 1993 amendment to China's Constitution. The Heilongjiang PPC, he said, assesses the performance of the provincial government by listening to its work reports and examining its enforcement of laws and regulations. While legislatures' supervision has been carried out smoothly at all levels of governments, courts and procuratorates, he said, government institutions have yet to take greater initiative to accept supervision by local people's congresses. "A major obstacle comes from people's understanding of the role of people's congresses. On the one hand, people's congresses have to be more mature in exercising their supervisory power; on the other hand, local governments, courts and procuratorates need time to become accustomed to such supervision," he said. Lu Chuanzan, chairman of the Hebei PPC, said that local people's congresses play their role in four fields: lawmaking, supervision over the work of local governments, decision-making for local major issues, and election of officials and personnel appointment. "The provincial people's congress has the power to appoint, elect and dismiss government officials, including the governor, and the province's top judge and procurator," he said.
