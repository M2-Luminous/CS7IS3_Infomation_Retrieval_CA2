FR940722-2-00092 FR940722-2-00060 [Docket Nos. STN 50&hyph;520, STN 50&hyph;529, and STN 50&hyph;530] Arizona Public Service Company; Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1, 2, and 3; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards; Consideration, Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License Nos. NPF&hyph;41, NPR&hyph;51, and NPF&hyph;74 issued to Arizona Public Service Company (the licensee) for operation of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1, 2, and 3 located in Maricopa County, Arizona. The proposed amendment would implement recommended changes from Generic Letter (GL) 93&hyph;05, ``Line-Item Technical Specification Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation.'' Specifically, the licensee proposed to change their Technical Specifications corresponding to the following GL 93&hyph;05 line numbers: 4.1.2, 5.8, 5.14, 6.1, 7.5, 8.1, 9.1, 12, and 14. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Standard 1_ Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. This amendment request does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated based on the safety analysis, because the proposed changes to the TS do not affect the assumptions, design parameters, or results of any UFSAR accident analysis. The proposed amendment does not add or modify any existing equipment. The changes to the surveillance requirements will result in an overall improvement in plant safety by reducing the frequency of plant trips and subsequent challenges to the safety systems, decreasing equipment degradation due to excessive testing, reducing radiation exposure to plant personnel (which is not justified by the safety significance of the surveillance), and eliminating an unnecessary burden on plant personnel (time required for testing is not justified by the safety significance of the testing). Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Standard 2 _Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. This amendment request does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed since the proposed TS changes do not involve modifications to any of the existing equipment or affect the operation or design basis of the equipment. The proposed changes increase the surveillance intervals for a small fraction of the SR [surveillance requirement], while ensuring that overall plant safety is improved. Therefore, the proposed TS changes would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. Standard 3 _Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The margin of safety presently provided is not reduced by the proposed changes in surveillance intervals in this TS amendment. The operability requirements of the affected systems, structures, and components are not changed by this TS amendment. Although the proposed changes increase the surveillance intervals for the affected TS, the reliability and operability of systems, components, and structures continues to be ensured by periodic testing. Since equipment reliability and operability will be maintained, the proposed TS changes will not involve a significant reduction in margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.
