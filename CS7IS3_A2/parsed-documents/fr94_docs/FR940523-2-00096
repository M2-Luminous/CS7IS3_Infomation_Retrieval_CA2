FR940523-2-00096 FR940523-2-00051 Information Seminar JTPA service providers that are interested in receiving such technical assistance to develop and start operations on their own CET model job training program must, as stated above, contact CET at the address listed above, to arrange attendance at the information seminar. Attendance at the information seminar is restricted to those individuals who have the capacity to make decisions of participation for their organizations. Although for the 7 selected organizations most funds required for future travel to CET's headquarters in San Jose are provided for in the CET and DOL agreement, the initial costs to attend the information seminars are not covered. CET will assist in making these travel arrangements; however, all costs are the responsibility of the individual service providers. Application Process Selection of service providers will be based upon criteria in three categories: Eligibility, competitiveness, and additional factors discussed above. In order to be considered, an applicant must meet each of the criteria under the eligibility section. The information received under the competitive issues section will be used to rank applications. After all applications are ranked, the additional factors discussed below will be used to select a diverse group of sites. I. Eligibility (1) All entities must be or become JTPA service providers. All providers that are not JTPA administrative entities must submit their applications jointly with the SDA administrative entity. This joint application with the service delivery area administrative entity should show that the service provider is or will be receiving JTPA funds during Program Year 1994, (July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995). The application should elaborate on the relationship between the service provider and the administrative entity. This should include descriptions of previous services, previous and current JTPA funding levels, and discuss the level of cooperation between the provider and the administrative entity. Further, any local procurement procedures, including those for a noncompetitive award, if applicable, that will be required to be met for starting and completing this project should be detailed in the application. A timeline for the procurement process should be provided. Applicants must be able to show that there is funding available to the proposed service provider. Given the short time frame for the technical assistance (August through December), procurement activities should be initiated as soon as possible. To simplify and speed up the procurement process, it is suggested that SDA administrative entities, that do not wish to run their own program, consider modifying a current service provider's existing agreement to convert their present training program to the CET model. (2) All entities must state that they are willing to participate in evaluation studies and to fully implement the core CEP job training model. II. Competitiveness Applications will be judged equally based upon (1) the organization's level of commitment to the replication project, and (2) the apparent capacity of the organization to succeed with the replication. Measures of this commitment include but are not limited to, cooperative relationships with the JTPA administrative entity (in those instances where the service provider is not the administrative entity), coordination with the State JTPA organization, coordination with other programs or activities for the JTPA eligible population, including Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS), funds available for this project, evidence of research into additional funding sources, ability of the service provider to operate the program in the future and private sector involvement in project. Measures of organizational capacity include, but are not limited to, the number of clients the service provider intends to serve, the number of occupations for which the service provider intends to train, previous experience, present facilities, and ability to meet JTPA performance standards. III. Additional Factors Other factors may be considered in the selection process to diversify the group to allow for studying the appropriateness of the model in various settings and providers of various sizes. These factors include: geographic area, service area (SDA) size, urban or rural SDA, intended target population, and service provider's organizational size. If the applicant feels that other factors are significant or unique, please discuss these additional areas, as appropriate. Questions about this Notice may be directed to Lisa Stuart or James Aaron at the DOL address or number above. Additional information about the CET job training model may be obtained from Max Martinez at the CET address or number above. Signed at Washington, DC, this 12th day of May 1994. Hugh S. Davies, Director, Office of Employment and Training Programs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;12416 Filed 5&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
