FBIS3-18801 "drweu046__a94033" FBIS-WEU-94-046-A Document Type:Daily Report 9 March 1994 ANNEX Germany Czech Fund To Provide Guarantee for Oil Pipeline AU0403205594 Prague CTK in English 2019 GMT 4 Mar 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0403205594 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Waidhaus, Germany March 4 (CTK) -- Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy agreed here today with the Bavarian Economy Minister Otto Wiesheu that the National Property Fund (FNM) would provide a guarantee for uninsurable damages to the oil pipeline that will run from Ingolstadt, Bavaria to Nelahozeves, Central Bohemia. The FNM will deposit the guarantee of 80 million Deutchmarks with the Czech National Bank for the whole period of existence of the pipeline, stated Wiesheu. Dlouhy said that the FNM was happy to do so because of the significant amount of interest that it would receive from the deposit. He added that if the FNM ceased to exist while the pipeline was still in operation, the state would take over the guarantee. The pipeline is expected to operate for 20 to 25 years. Dlouhy expects the guarantee from the Bavarian side to come from the Bavarian Government or a state organisation. "In the case of terrorist attack, each side would cover half the damage. If there is war or revolution, both sides have the right to withdraw from the agreement," stressed Dlouhy. Details of the agreement will be worked out by a group of experts on March 14, according to Wiesheu. The agreement should be ready for signing by the end of March. The Bavarian Government has prepared legislation enabling construction of the pipeline to go ahead, which the Bavarian parliament is expected to approve in April. It was necessary to resolve the issue of the guarantee against damages resulting from acts of God before the legislation could be passed. Construction of the pipeline began on the Czech side last September, and will begin in Germany this spring. The project should be completed in 1995.
