The conference mapped out specific plans for implementing the three reforms in our province in accordance with the CPC Central Committee and the State Council's demands. Provincial party and government leaders Lu Rongjing, Fu Xishou, Yang Yongliang, and Liu Guangcai attended the conference, which was chaired by Yang Duoliang. Provincial party Secretary Lu Rongjing spoke at the conference. He urged principal party and government leaders at all levels to assume personal responsibility for actively organizing and spearheading reform of the three systems. We should unify thinking, improve understanding, and truly convert the central authorities' decision and arrangements into the common understanding of party committees and governments at all levels, as well as the conscientious actions of the masses. Lu Rongjing emphatically said: We should devise overall plans and make sound arrangements for economic work while planning for the three reforms. At no time should we slacken economic work. We should solve problems and find solutions during the course of reform in a reform spirit. We should strictly implement policies and enforce rigorous organizational discipline to ensure smooth progress in the three reforms in our province; promote changes in organizational functions; smooth work relationships; promote social stability; inspire the enthusiasm of the vast numbers of functionaries, effectively advance all areas of work; and maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development in our province. Fu Xishou, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor, delivered a work report. He noted: Carrying out the three supplementary reforms is of great significance because it is urgently needed to deepen reform of the economic system, an important aspect of reform of the political system, and the inevitable choice for establishing a socialist market economic system. Therefore, the entire province should actively but steadily carry out organizational reform and promote reform of the civil service and payroll systems in a planned and step-by-step fashion in accordance with the unified plans of the party Central Committee, the State Council, the provincial party committee, and the provincial government. At the conference's closing, provincial party Deputy Secretary Yang Yongliang arranged for implementing the conference's guidelines. Vice Governor Yang Duoliang gave a summing-up report. Over 300 people attended, including members of the provincial leading group for organizational reform; leading party and government responsible comrades from various prefectural, city, and provincial and central-level units in Anhui; and directors of personnel bureaus and divisions, organizational offices, and payroll sections.
