This morning the foreign minister, Dr. Abass Bundu, claimed that NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] forces are active on the side of Foday Sankoh's RUF [Revolutionary United Front] rebels, and he issued a warning that the war may be about to assume a new dimension. From Freetown, Victor Sylver telexed this report. Briefing newsmen this morning in Freetown, Foreign Secretary Abass Bundu said that there was ample proof that Charles Taylor had moved large quantities of arms, ammunition, and men into Sierra Leone, not only to beef up Foday Sankoh's RUF rebels, said Dr. Bundu, but also to create an enclave within Sierra Leone for keeping arms and men of the NPFL that would not be disarmed when the process gets under way in Liberia under the terms of the Cotonou Accord. The foreign secretary said that the Cotonou Accords did not envisage that the ploys now being used by the NPFL would crop up, such as using neighboring countries to evade the disarmament procedure. He said that the accords were mainly concerned with events in Liberia and that recent developments of attempted attacks on Guinea and in Sierra Leone call for a closer look at the agreement. Dr. Bundu revealed that the Sierra Leone Government intends to ask the ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] secretary general to convene a meeting of the nine countries that have been assigned the task of reviewing the implementation of the Cotonou Accords in Liberia with a view to highlighting the new development in the war in Sierra Leone. The foreign secretary told the press that evidence now revealed that Charles Taylor has been using a number of ploys to escape the process of disarmament, disguising his troops as police personnel or [words indistinct] of a number of different organizations. He said reports from areas recently attacked by the rebels talk of stories by local villagers that ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] forces were fighting alongside NPFL and RUF forces against government troops. This is just one ploy now being used by Charles Taylor, said Dr. Bundu, to create confusion inside Sierra Leone.
