He made the remark in his May 28-31 tour of the province, which is one of China's most important energy bases, producing most of the country's coal. Tian, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out that Shanxi should put the same emphasis on stabilizing both coal mining and agricultural production. The province has placed agriculture, infrastructure and basic industry as the key sectors for future development.

A new airport and railway station are under construction in this provincial capital. Tian also inspected Dazhai Village in Xiyang County, which used to be a national model for farming. Great changes have taken place in this village in recent years, as the villagers have set up a series of factories.
