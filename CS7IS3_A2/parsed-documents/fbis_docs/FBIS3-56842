He said that the President and the Latvian Government officially apologized to Russia for the incident on January 10, when two Russian generals were for several hours detained. However, the command of the North-Western forces ordered the use of weapons in the case of assault of the facilities and servicemen of the Russian Army, stationed on the Latvian territory. Besides, Gvido Zemribo stressed that the Latvian Republic is an independent and democratic state, where only its laws and court may work. Anyone, who commits a crime on the Latvian territory will face the penalty provided by the criminal code of the Latvian Republic. If crimes would be committed by diplomats or other foreigners their cases will be reviewed through the diplomatic channels or in accordance with the mutual agreement between the countries. There is no such an agreement between Latvia and Russia, saying Russian servicemen are not subject to the Latvian jurisdiction. Therefore, the above mentioned deeds and actions by the command of the North-Western military groups violate Latvia's sovereignty, said Gvido Zemribo. In case Russian servicemen unlawfully use weapons against Latvian residents, they will have to answer for their reactions as it is provided by the Latvian legislature. This refers both to those who used weapons and to those who ordered to use them. Moreover, such crimes will be investigated by the Latvian investigatory bodies and not by the Russian Military Office of Public Prosecutor.
