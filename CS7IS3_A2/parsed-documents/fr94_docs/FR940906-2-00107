FR940906-2-00107 FR940906-2-00083 Tuesday September 6, 1994 Part II Federal Emergency Management Agency Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan; Notice Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 171␣/␣Tuesday, September 6, 1994␣/␣Notices FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY Proposed Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan (FRERP) AGENCY: Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). ACTION: Notice and request for comments. SUMMARY: The Federal Emergency Management Agency gives notice and invites comments on a proposed revision to the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan (FRERP) to update and supersede the original FRERP. The FRERP establishes an organized, integrated capability for participating Federal agencies to respond to a wide range of peacetime radiological emergencies. The FRERP provides a concept of operations, outlines Federal policies and planning considerations, and specifies authorities and responsibilities of each Federal agency that has a significant role in such emergencies. DATES: Comments on the proposed revision should be received by October 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: FEMA invites your comments on the FRERP. Please send your comments to the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20472, (facsimile) (202) 646&hyph;4536. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Charles G. McIntosh, Interagency Planning and Liaison Division, Response and Recovery Directorate, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646&hyph;3602. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 304 of Public Law 96&hyph;295, requires that the President prepare and publish a plan to provide for expeditious, efficient, and coordinated Federal response to accidents at nuclear power facilities. Executive Order (E.O.) 12241 (September 29, 1980) delegated this responsibility to the Director, FEMA. FEMA published the first FRERP on November 8, 1985, 50 FR 46542. This proposed revision to the FRERP is essential to update the original plan, and to take into account new laws, regulations, and changed operating conditions. Seventeen Federal departments and agencies on the Subcommittee on Federal Response of the Federal Radiological Preparedness Coordinating Committee prepared this proposed revision. Each of the 17 departments and agencies has roles and responsibilities involving response to peacetime radiological emergencies. The concept of operations described in the FRERP is based on specific authorities for responding to radiological emergencies. Federal agencies respond to radiological emergencies using the FRERP, each agency in accordance with its existing statutory authorities and funding resources. The Lead Federal Agency has responsibility for coordination of the overall Federal response to the emergency. FEMA is responsible for coordinating non-radiological support using the structure of the Federal Response Plan. The relationship between the two plans, which is discussed in the proposed FRERP, will be further described in an Annex to the Federal Response Plan. Dated: August 26, 1994. Richard W.
