He said at the launch of the bank's annual report that in the past financial year about R716.7m of project finance was disbursed, a 59 percent increase from the previous year's R446m. New project approvals for the year amounted to R1.7bn. By the end of March the bank had approved a cumulative total of 1,475 programmes and projects worth R8.9bn over 11 years, while a further 246 projects were under consideration with an estimated loan value of R2.1bn. Le Grange said regarding the return flow of maturing loans that no zero performing loans were reported in the year. Loan repayments, which would increase as the years passed, would play an important role in the continued financing of projects and in the repayment of capital market debt, he said. The Development Bank is essentially a wholesale national development finance institution owned by government. Le Grange said the bank would maintain its "arms's length" approach to government so as to avoid political prescription at the cost of economic soundness. Proposals had been made to increase the shareholding of the bank to include the nine provinces, but it would take time to implement. About 10 percent of the bank's current loan profile was for the funding of projects and policy development projects outside SA's borders, but inside the southern African region. Most of these projects would benefit SA in the long run, such as the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. The bank worked closely with the Southern African Development Community and preferential trade agreement organisations on projects outside SA, and would continue to do so, he said. He believed SA should not blindly accede to pressure to join regional trade agreements. SA should instead adopt a functional approach, starting possibly with bilateral agreements, before deciding on which institutional approach to take. As a result of problems with the implementation of projects in the past financial year arising from political violence and uncertainty, the bank's liquidity was 39 percent. Le Grange said the bank aimed to reduce this to 25 percent of loan disbursements, which would probably result in a small surplus of R200m this financial year.
