ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock by trawl vessels using non-pelagic trawl gear in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the BSAI bycatch allowance of halibut specified for the trawl pollock/Atka mackerel/``other species'' fishery category. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), September 6, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. The 1994 bycatch allowance of halibut specified for the trawl pollock/Atka mackerel/``other species'' fishery category which is defined at ยง675.21(b)(1)(iii)(F), was established as 957 metric tons by the final 1994 initial specifications (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994). The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with ยง675.21(c)(1)(iii), that the bycatch allowance of halibut specified for the trawl pollock/Atka mackerel/``other species'' fishery category has been reached. Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock by trawl vessels using non-pelagic trawl gear in the BSAI from 12 noon, A.l.t., September 6, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at ยง675.20(h).
