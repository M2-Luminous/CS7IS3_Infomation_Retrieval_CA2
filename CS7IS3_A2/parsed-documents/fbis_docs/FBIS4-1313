FBIS4-1313 "drafr080_cs94011" FBIS-AFR-94-080-S Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Thousands of East Rand Hostel Dwellers Lack ID Thousands of East Rand Hostel Dwellers Lack ID MB2604141194 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1311 GMT 26 Apr 94 MB2604141194 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [By Guy Rogers] [Text] Johannesburg April 26 SAPA -- The elections must be extended if necessary to allow thousands of East Rand hostel residents, isolated by violence, to acquire identity documents and to cast their votes, says Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] Thokoza chairman Abraham Mzizi. Speaking at Thokoza hostel on Tuesday [26 April] afternoon, Mr Mzizi said thousands of East Rand hostel residents still had no identity documents. He would send a fax to Ulundi to notify IFP leader Mangosutho Buthelezi about the situation, he said. East Rand SA Defence Force Commander Col Chris du Toit had already agreed he would take the matter "to the highest levels of government". Hostel inmates, most of whom are IFP supporters, had been unable to get to Home Affairs Offices in surrounding white towns to get ID, said Mr Mzizi. "They will be abducted or killed (if they leave their hostels)." Inkatha's late entry into the election had exacerbated the problem. There were more than 1,000 eligible voters without ID in Thokoza hostel and more than 2,000 in the Katlehong hostels and the outlying Zonkezizwe hostel. "There are also problems in Tembisa I have not spoken about." Mr Mzizi called on the Independent Electoral Commission to visit the hostels to issue temporary voters cards and if they could not come on Tuesday they should do so on Wednesday. "And if necessary the election must be extended. If people cannot vote because they have no ID it will not be free and fair. It will be grossly unfair," Mr Mzizi said.
