He said it was up to Russia to choose who should represent it at the talks, diplomats in Brussels or a delegation from Moscow, and added that the alliance was awaiting a response from Moscow. The invitation was issued following a weekly meeting of ambassadors from the alliance's 16 member countries. "The North Atlantic Council decided to invite Russia to begin talks in Brussels immediately," the spokesman said. Russia and NATO sketched out last Friday the form their post-Cold War security relationship would take after months of maneuvering and confusion. NATO said it was prepared to give Russia special leeway in negotiating the terms of military cooperation that would fall under the alliance's Partnership for Peace programme. Twenty countries have already joined the programme, but Russia had been delaying its entry while it fought for special terms.
