Speaking at an international employment forum organised here by the European Social Studies Institute, both men pointed to Italy's summer cost-of-labour accord as an example of a more flexible and responsible approach to economic policy, while Delors highlighted the Volkswagen hour and pay-cutting deal as an instance of how employers could pursue socially responsible solutions to industrial crisis. Ciampi stressed how national and European problems -- with spiralling unemployment to the fore -- were "interpenetrating" and how the European Union remained an "indispensable" forum for seeking solutions to the recession. He reiterated the importance of monetary and political integration within the Twelve, and expansion to include other European countries, while Delors called on the Union to "bridge the gap" with East Europe -- for which "we are also responsible" -- and look at institutional changes with a view to creating a future 35-nation Europe. The European Commission President also revealed that he will probably attend the March Group of Seven Detroit summit on growth and employment, saying that U.S. President Bill Clinton was one of the G-7 leaders who was most concerned with coordinated strategies to pull the world economy further out of recession. Ciampi again hailed the July cost-of-labour accord as an achievement that had allowed Italy to peg inflation (making "realistic this year's goal of 2.5 percent" and bringing a big pay-off in debt servicing costs), cut interest rates, boost exports and regain international confidence. He pointed to the government's recent employment booster as a way of raising the efficiency of social buffers and free up the labour market so as to create jobs for young people. Delors also praised the labour accord as an atypical example of cooperation "at a time when social dialogue in Europe seems to be between deaf persons," while pointing to the Volkswagen deal as an important example of "flexibility inside firms." Indicating his White Paper on pan-European communications projects, funded by possible European Union bonds, as a way of "opening the windows onto the mid term and getting away from a day-to-day approach to economic policy," Delors said that "budget and monetary policies are not the only elements needed to reach full employment." In reference to high unemployment benefit costs -- 80 percent of European spending in job-protection policy -- Delors stressed that "we must stop funding idleness and make it an obsession to create new work." At the same forum, the vice president of the Italian employers' association, Carlo Callieri, pointed to "an assessment of instruments of social coordination to allow monetary authorities to loosen the noose of interest rates" as one of the ways in which competition and employment might be reconciled. Callieri called on the present and future government to meet pledges on cutting the weight of the public sector and reducing the cost of labour, if employment is to be boosted. The leaders of Italy's big three trade unions, CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor], CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions] and UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions], also had their say. CGIL leader Bruno Trentin called for talks between the government, employers and unions to look at ways in which the White Paper could be implemented in Italy. CISL leader Sergio D'Antoni censured the Ciampi government for a perceived lack of industrial policy, and called for Europe-wide fiscal policies. UIL leader Pietro Larizza said it was "not possible to think of a politically and economically united Europe and leave each country with separate union policies," and criticised the government for alleged lack of action in public works, for which "not one lire will be spent this year, even though the projects are on the agenda."
