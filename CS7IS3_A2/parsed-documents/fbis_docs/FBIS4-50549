Sihanouk, who is 72, returned to Cambodia on 8 April. Before he returned to Cambodia, he had received six months of medical treatment in Beijing. The results were quite satisfactory. With the approval of his doctors, he returned to his nation for recuperation. When Sihanouk stepped out of the plane, people could see that the king was in high spirits, and his face was filled with a kindly smile. The doctor by his side suggested that while in Phnom Penh, he should have lots of rest and eat nutritious food so as to restore his health completely, but faced with a complex political situation and the task of full-scale reconstruction in Cambodia, Sihanouk, ignoring the fact he was recuperating from illness, immediately began to work arduously. His schedule was very tight. He worked from morning to evening accepting credentials, meeting domestic and foreign guests, and attending nongovernmental activities, and frequently he worked until late at night. Sihanouk is very much concerned about peace and national reconciliation in Cambodia, to which he has devoted much of his time and energy. Not long after his return, the bloody conflicts between government troops and those of Democratic Kampuchea in the northwest region were expanding. Worried about this, he put forward a proposal on 22 April for convening a peace and national reconciliation roundtable conference. The leaders of both sides expressed their support the same day, but the serious confrontation and distrust created by war and political conflicts over a long period of time can in no way be dissipated in a short period of time. Both sides could not agree on the venue for the meeting, and the roundtable meeting slated to open on 2 May was aborted. After that, Sihanouk was disappointed with the way each side stuck to its own view. While continuing to mediate between the two sides, he mobilized public opinion and popular forces to push forward the peace process. On 2 May, Sihanouk met with responsible persons and reporters from over 30 newspapers, radio stations, and television stations in Cambodia. After that, he braved the heat to meet with the chief monk of Cambodia and more than 500 monks in front of the palace. During the meeting, he repeatedly expounded on the importance of placing national interests above all else by immediately stopping fighting and restoring peace. He said that according to the Constitution, he, as king, is forbidden to engage in political affairs. However, peace is not a political issue between political parties; it concerns the vital interests of every Cambodian, and he has the responsibility to express his views and put forward a proposal. On 4 May, while wearing a traditional national costume, King Sihanouk stood on the rostrum of the east gate of the palace, took part in a peace rally, and made a 40-minute speech. At the end of his speech, he told those in attendance that his doctor had discovered that the number of white blood cells in his body had decreased due to overwork. He said that the state of his health was not very good but that he did not mind, and he added that he would continue to work to end the war and to restore peace in Cambodia. In following his doctor's request, Sihanouk limited his daily activities to two sessions, and each session was not to exceed two hours. In fact, this rule was often broken. On 12 May, after a long trip by car, he took part in a Buddhist ceremony at a temple for seven hours. Two days later, he traveled by car to (Kompiseu) County in Kompong Speu to call on villagers and help them solve housing and drinking water problems. Before 1970, Sihanouk used to meet with ordinary people on a regular basis. After he returned to Phnom Penh this time, he has received at his palace ordinary people every week to listen to their opinions. There, he told the officials present his views about solving the problems. Sihanouk is very kind to children and handicapped people. At the new-life-day activities for Cambodian children held on 11 April, Sihanouk braved the 33-degree heat [Celsius] to distribute clothing to 300 shabbily dressed orphans and poor children. He personally measured their sizes. When he received handicapped people in the palace, he extended his regards to every one of them. It was very touching. Before his departure, Sihanouk comforted his people, saying "I will return in two to three months after leaving the country for medical treatment. After my illness is cured, I will continue to serve the country, the nation, and the common people."
