FR940412-2-00119 FR940412-2-00087 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration [Docket No. 93D&hyph;0259] Action Levels for Aflatoxins in Animal Feeds; Revised Compliance Policy Guide; Availability AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a revised Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 7126.33 entitled ``Action Levels for Aflatoxins in Animal Feeds.'' The CPG revises the action levels for aflatoxins in peanut products intended for animal feed use (i.e., peanuts, peanut meal, peanut hulls, peanut skins, and ground peanut hay) and provides guidance on levels of aflatoxin contamination of peanut products intended for use in animal feeds which, in the agency's view, may be necessary to support a charge of adulteration under certain provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). FDA is inviting public comment concerning the revised action levels for peanut products that contain aflatoxins and that are shipped in interstate commerce for use in animal feeds. DATES: Written comments by June 27, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written requests for single copies of revised CPG 7126.33 to the Communications and Education Branch (HFV&hyph;12), Center for Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855. Send two self-addressed adhesive labels to assist that office in processing your requests. Submit written comments on revised CPG 7126.33 to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. Requests and comments should be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. A copy of revised CPG 7126.33 and received comments are available for public examination in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Daniel G. McChesney, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;222), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1728. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FDA's use of action levels is defined in ยง509.4(c)(1) (21 CFR 509.4(c)(1)) of FDA's regulations governing unavoidable contaminants in animal food and food-packaging material. FDA is announcing that it has revised CPG 7126.33 ``Action Levels for Aflatoxins in Animal Feeds'' to reflect changes in the action levels for aflatoxins in peanut products intended for animal feed use, in accordance with ยง509.4(c)(2), and to provide guidance on levels of aflatoxin contamination of peanut products. FDA is inviting public comment on the revised action levels for aflatoxins in peanut products shipped in interstate commerce and intended for certain food-producing animals. The revised action levels are: (1) 100 parts per billion (ppb) aflatoxins for peanut products intended for breeding beef cattle, breeding swine, or mature poultry; (2) 200 ppb aflatoxins for peanut products intended for finishing swine (i.e., 100 pounds or greater); and (3) 300 ppb aflatoxins for peanut products intended for finishing (i.e., feedlot) beef cattle. The original 20 ppb action level remains unchanged for aflatoxins in peanut products for use by immature animals, dairy animals, and for aflatoxins in peanut products for which the intended use is not known (CPG 7126.33). Both the revised action levels and the one that remains unchanged were the subject of a memorandum that FDA's Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs issued on December 7, 1990, to the FDA field offices (hereinafter referred to as the December 7, 1990, memorandum) (Ref. 1). Aflatoxins are added poisonous or added deleterious substances which, depending upon their level in food or feed, may cause the food or feed to be adulterated under section 402(a)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(1)). This section states that a food (or feed) is deemed to be adulterated if it bears or contains an added poisonous or deleterious substance ``which may render [the food (or feed)] injurious to health.'' If the government charges such a violation of the act, the government must show that there is a reasonable possibility of harm. Thus the action levels for aflatoxin are intended to represent levels of contamination above which, in the agency's view, the government could satisfy the ``may render it injurious'' test under section 402(a)(1) of the act. Based on available scientific data, the agency believes that consumption of products containing aflatoxins in excess of 20 ppb may be injurious to the health of humans and immature animals, and that if such products are fed to dairy cattle, aflatoxin residues in fluid milk products that approach 0.5 ppb, the current action level for aflatoxin residues in such products (CPG 7106.10), may result. In 1989, FDA published revised action levels for aflatoxin in corn intended for use in animal feed (Ref. 2). FDA revised the action levels, which appear in CPG 7126.33, because it was able to further define subgroups for which levels of aflatoxin greater than 20 ppb may be necessary to support a ``may be injurious to health'' charge of adulteration under section 402(a)(1) of the act. Thus, for finishing swine, aflatoxin levels in excess of 200 ppb can support the charge, while levels above 300 ppb aflatoxin in corn and peanut products can support a charge under section 402(a)(1) of the act when the corn or peanut products are intended for finishing (i.e., feedlot) beef cattle. For breeding beef cattle, breeding swine, and mature poultry, corn and peanut products containing aflatoxin in excess of 100 ppb aflatoxin can support the adulteration charge. Furthermore, FDA concluded from its evaluation that meat and eggs from these animals would not contain increased residues of aflatoxin. For immature animals and dairy cows, aflatoxin levels in excess of 20 ppb can support the adulteration charge. For all other species and commodities the action level remains at 20 ppb until revisions to CPG 7126.33 are warranted. In deciding to revise the action levels for aflatoxin in peanut products, FDA relied on the data in the support paper entitled ``Background Paper to Support Action Levels for Aflatoxin-Contaminated Corn'' (Ref. 2). Based on this information, FDA concluded that the inclusion of aflatoxin-contaminated peanut products in animal feed at the revised action levels would have a negligible effect on the tissue residue. Accordingly, the agency has adopted and will use the revised action levels as a basis for guiding its enforcement of section 402(a)(1) of the act, provided FDA is assured that peanut products in interstate commerce that contain more than 20 ppb aflatoxin are destined for the appropriate subgroups of animals. Without such assurance, the agency may conclude that the peanut products could be destined for humans, immature animals, or dairy cattle and, if it bears or contains more than 20 ppb aflatoxin, FDA believes that the Government would probably prevail in an enforcement action charging adulteration under section 402(a)(1) of the act. In December 7, 1990, memorandum (Ref. 1) the agency recognized that all action levels, including those for aflatoxins, must be viewed and used as guidance rather than a definitive enforcement standard. The agency's action levels are not binding on the courts, the public (including food producers), or the agency. (See 55 FR 20782 (May 21, 1990).) There may be situations where circumstances warrant enforcement action at levels below an action level or where enforcement action is not warranted even though an action level is exceeded. In considering enforcement action where aflatoxin levels are below the pertinent action level, FDA field offices must take into account the agency's ability to support the adulteration charge that will be included in the complaint. If a field office believes that enforcement action is warranted at levels below an action level, then the recommendation for enforcement action should include all compelling reasons for pursuing such action. Similar consideration is required if a field office believes that enforcement action where aflatoxin levels are above pertinent action levels is not warranted. The statements made in CPG 7126.33 are not intended to bind the courts, the public, or FDA or to create or confer any rights, privileges, immunities, or benefits on or for any private person, but are intended merely for internal FDA guidance.
