FR940208-0-00118 FR940208-0-00031 Service Response: The Service based the critical habitat designation on recommendations provided in the Draft Recovery Plan, which is the most comprehensive source of information on the desert tortoise at this time. Should the recommendations in the final recovery plan differ significantly from that of the draft, the Service will reevaluate the critical habitat designation. Issue 46: One respondent stated that the proposed critical habitat designation focused attention only on activities that impair vegetation, soil structure, or other physical attributes of the habitat, and considered this analysis to be too narrow. The criteria should also include rectifying biological imbalances that result from habitat alteration (e.g., ravens and non-native plant species). Feral predators, such as dogs, should be considered in the same way as feral horses and burros. Surface disturbances caused by such activities as utility rights-of-way, road construction, and real estate development should be included. Service Response: The Service already addresses those actions that may increase feral predators or ravens through section 7 of the Act to determine if such actions are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the desert tortoise. The Service agrees that habitat imbalances negatively affect desert tortoises and should be avoided within critical habitat. Such imbalances often result in increased exotic species, such as weedy vegetation, and have contributed toward the increase of ravens in the Mojave Desert. The final rule discusses road and utility construction and issuance of Federal housing loans as requiring consultation pursuant to section 7 of the Act to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether or not such proposed actions are likely to adversely modify or destroy critical habitat. Issue 47: Several letters stated that desert tortoises are not native to the Upper Virgin River Recovery Unit (nor CHU); they were imported into the area by humans. Therefore, critical habitat designation is really land acquisition, not a designation of natural habitat. Service Response: Listing of the Mojave population of desert tortoises as a threatened species affords it protection under the Act, regardless of speculation on the origin of populations. Issue 48: Several commenters pointed out that areas proposed as critical habitat within the Upper Virgin River CHU included areas that do not have desert tortoises present (e.g., developed areas, high elevations). Service Response: The Service has used readily recognizable land features and legal descriptions to define the boundaries of desert tortoise critical habitat. Only the land within those boundaries that is suitable desert tortoise habitat (i.e., contains the primary constituent elements) is treated as critical habitat. Although the Service has adjusted boundary lines to exclude non-habitat to a great extent in this final designation, it remains mechanically impossible for the Service to specifically identify all non-habitat by legal description, particularly because many of these lands are less than 40 acres in size. Actions proposed within areas without the primary constituent elements of desert tortoise habitat will not be subject to section 7 of the Act, unless such actions may affect nearby critical habitat. In the case of unoccupied, suitable desert tortoise habitat, the Act states clearly that areas in need of special management (inside or outside of the current range of the species) can be included in designation of critical habitat. Recovery of the desert tortoise within the Upper Virgin River Recovery Unit is dependent upon maintenance and improvement in the quantity, quality, and/or arrangement of habitat. Issue 49: One letter stated that critical habitat designated on Tribal land in Utah is insufficient to support a viable population of desert tortoises.
