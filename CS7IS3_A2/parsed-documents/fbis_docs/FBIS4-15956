FBIS4-15956 "drsov071_v_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 Lithuania Premier: Russian Trade Rules `Discriminatory' Premier: Russian Trade Rules `Discriminatory' WS1204170194 Tallinn BNS in English 1307 GMT 12 Apr 94 WS1204170194 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Vilnius, Apr 12, BNS -- The head of the Lithuanian working group for talks with the CIS, Virgilijus Bulovas, disagrees with Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius that a dialogue between Lithuania and Russia has been ruptured. The prime minister expressed such a view at a press conference in Vilnius last Thursday [7 April]. Allegations that talks with Russia broke off are unfounded, Lithuanian TV quoted Bulovas as saying Monday. The negotiator said Lithuanian and Russian experts, dealing mainly with transportation problems, will be working in Kaliningrad all this week. At the same time, an agreement on employment of foreign citizens is being drafted and the restoration of border between Lithuania and the Kaliningrad region is underway. The sides also continue work on determining the boundaries of economic zones in the Baltic sea, Bulovas said. But Slezevicius said there has been no reply to any of his letters to Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and all attempts to arrange a telephone conversation failed. Lithuania's primary concern is a reciprocal agreement on the most favored nation trade status, which is yet to be ratified by Russia. The Lithuanian premier said Russia carries out an aggressive policy with respect to the Baltics. In his words, the new Russian import-export regulations, which came into effect March 15, are "discriminatory." The prime minister said Lithuania may respond with adequate measures, which would primarily affect the Kaliningrad region. Slezevicius said a possible retaliatory measure would be to impose limitations on the supply of Lithuanian electricity to the region.
