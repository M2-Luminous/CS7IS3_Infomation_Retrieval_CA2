Addressing the convocation of the National Defence College (NDC), Leghari said: "The Agni threatens a vast region, from China and south East Asia to Kazakhstan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. India's acquisition of cryogenic engines provides it a licence to acquire ICBM [Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile] capability. Other countries of the region cannot sit back complacently while India acquires a potential stanglehold over them." He said: "It was not enough for us to be told that India will promise not to deploy Prithivis. How long does it take to actually deploy those mobile launched missiles, 12 hours, 24 hours?. "Our region must be saved from a missile race. Unless we settle for a zero-missile regime in the region, the race will become inevitable. The US and Russia must act positively now and restrain India," he demanded. Leghari said: "In response to our security imperatives, we also seek self-reliance and indigenisation in our country in general and defence production in particular. Import of high tech equipment from abroad is not only a heavy drain on our economy, but also subjects us to a high degree of uncertainty." "We have learnt that no nation can expect to be truly sovereign if it is totally dependent on others for import of arms and technology. The President urged that Pakistan must plan its indigenisation effort with vision and follow it with the resolve to stand on its own feet as early as possible.
