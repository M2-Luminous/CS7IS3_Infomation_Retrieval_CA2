FBIS4-48969 "drchi084_u_94005" FBIS-CHI-94-084 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 PRC MEDIA ON TAIWAN Commentary Criticizes Taipei Stance on Qiandao Incident Commentary Criticizes Taipei Stance on Qiandao Incident OW2904153694 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese 1212 GMT 29 Apr 94 OW2904153694 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service Chinese BFN ["Commentary" by unidentified XINHUA reporter] [Text] Beijing, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- After the major case involving robbery, arson, and murder on Qiandao Lake was cracked, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] sent letters to the Taiwan Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] twice, on 20 and 23 April, inviting the latter to send personnel to Hangzhou. These personnel will be accompanied by relevant experts who will give briefings on specific situations pertaining to the case and answer questions. We have now found out from Taiwan media reports that relevant Taiwan authorities have been adopting an attitude of procrastination regarding the ARATS invitation. People hold that the Taiwan side has been urging the Zhejiang side to make public the truth about the case after it occurred. Now that the case has been solved, we are willing to give a face-to-face briefing on details of the case and answer questions -- in addition to having the ARATS provide the details -- but the Taiwan side has intentionally been procrastinating by not coming, and that is definitely not a wise move. According to the ARATS, replies sent to it by the SEF on 21 and 24 April noted that the SEF is willing to "positively consider" the ARATS invitation, but they also said that before the SEF decides on the time of arrival in Hangzhou and the list of experts who will accompany the trip, the mainland side will have to first provide information on how the crime occurred, an autopsy report, a report on the crime site, relevant exhibits, and answers to questions raised by the Taiwan side about doubtful points on the case. People have observed that a large number of items mentioned in the SEF replies appear to be preconditions for the SEF's coming to Hangzhou. Despite having paid close attention to details concerning the case and having indicated that it will show understanding toward feelings of the victims' families, the Taiwan side has set up preconditions on its coming to Hangzhou to directly understand the case and hear answers from relevant experts. What is particularly noteworthy is that the SEF has repeatedly asked for "relevant exhibits" and other such materials used in handling the case. Exhibits of a crime are used by public security departments and judicial organs when handling cases and passing sentences. It is hard to understand why the Taiwan side is requesting such exhibits. Actually, ever since the incident occurred, the ARATS has continually informed the SEF about progress made in solving the case. Mainland media have also made numerous reports on the incident. Most of the materials requested by the SEF in its replies have already been given to the Taiwan side, and some information can be obtained directly by coming to the mainland. Why does the SEF hesitate to move forward? People around here believe that the Qiandao Lake case has invoked grave concern from compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. The death of 32 compatriots has caused deep pain among the people. We have finally solved the case now, and the murderers will not escape the net of justice. To show its sincerity and dispel misunderstanding, the mainland side has repeatedly invited the Taiwan side to send people over to hear briefings on the case. Its attitude is open and aboveboard, and shows that it is seeking truth from facts. However, what merits our attention is that a small number of Taiwan people who harbor ulterior motives have politicized the criminal case. These people, who lack interest in information about the case, which is followed closely by Taiwan compatriots and media circles on the island, are only fond of spreading continuously the so-called "questionable points" and attacking the mainland for "concealing" the truth. They are actually trying to continue fanning hostility and poison the cross-straits atmosphere in an attempt to pull back relations across the Taiwan Strait. This matter gives much food for thought for compatriots across the strait, the large number of overseas Chinese, and countrymen residing abroad, who are all concerned about the development of cross-straits relations.
