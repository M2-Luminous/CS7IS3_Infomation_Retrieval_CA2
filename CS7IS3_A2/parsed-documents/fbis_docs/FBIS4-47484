D. Mukhamedyarov, doctor of technical sciences; UDC [528.837:621.384.3]:629.78] [Abstract] The characteristics of aerospace instruments developed during the last 15 years at the NPO State Institute of Applied Optics are given and possible fields of their applicability are discussed. Among the instruments described (all accompanied by their pertinent technical specifications) is a high-resolution thermal imager for low-orbit satellites. Another is the ``Klimat'' IR radiometer which is part of the Meteor-3 meteorological satellite. This radiometer is used for the registry of thermal images and measurements of the radiation temperature of cloud cover and the surface (ice and snow cover, rivers and seas, forests and other natural formations). The high-resolution MSU-V multispectral scanner, a part of the ``Okean'' space system, is used for observing the surface in eight spectral ranges. A multispectral pyrometer was developed for measuring energy brightness and surface temperature for constructing synoptic charts of thermal gradients and studying the radiation balance of the Earth and atmosphere from aboard the Mir orbital station. A hemispherical radiometer was developed for measuring terrestrial radiation fluxes and global temperature sounding of the atmosphere. Different kinds of thermal imagers also have been developed for aircraft and helicopters and are briefly described. Fuller descriptions of these instruments and systems are given in the cited literature. Figures 3; references: 8 Russian.
