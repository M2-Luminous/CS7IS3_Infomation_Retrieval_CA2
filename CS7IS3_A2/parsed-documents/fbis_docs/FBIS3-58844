The Lower Saxon Land Office of Criminal Investigations [LKA] has been investigating the group for more than two years on the grounds that some of its members are suspected of belonging to a terrorist group. The "Autonome Antifa" on Tuesday [18 January] described the effects of the police investigations on the group. The members of the group are exposed to permanent harassment, including regular observation of their meetings and even their private apartments. Telephones have been bugged. Their publications and press releases are picked up at the receivers and the papers are then examined for fingerprints by the LKA. Whenever the group rents halls for meetings, LKA officers have questioned the owners of the premises and even showed them files with photographs. For one rally, the group rented a loudspeaker van; the officers later confiscated the files of the car rental place and even questioned employees. Over the weekend, the Greens party of Goettingen stated that representatives of their party, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], and the Federation of German Trade Unions [DGB] received summons from the LKA. They were asked to testify in the preliminary procedures against members of the "Autonome Antifa." Last March, this group assumed the initiative for a demonstration against neo-Nazi activist Hans-Michael Fiedler and his training center in Adelebsen (Goettingen district). Some 2,000 demonstrators participated in the nonviolent protest march after the appeal was also backed by members of the Greens, the SPD, and the DGB. The "Autonome Antifa" has concluded from the LKA actions that "efficient, broadly based antifascist work is to be prevented." Neo-Nazi activists such as Fiedler, however, are able to enhance their activities under the eyes of the state prosecutor and the LKA, it was said. When asked about this by FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU, a spokesman for the Lower Saxon Interior Ministry said the LKA was conducting its investigations on the instructions of the chief state prosecutor of Celle.
