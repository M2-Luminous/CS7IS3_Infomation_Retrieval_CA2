A press note issued at noon by the national television newscast referred to the forceful entrance by more than 100 Cubans to the Belgian ambassador's residence on Saturday afternoon "to apply pressure tactics in order to leave the country." It pointed out that "this new incident is nothing more than the result of provocations to commit illegal actions by counterrevolutionary stations that transmit from Miami, and especially the result of the restrictive policy implemented by the U.S. immigration authorities." The United States, the note adds, "continues to obstruct the legal procedures of people interested in migrating to that country who, after failing several times, resort to illegal means, even violent ones, to achieve their goal." The text, which was also aired by the radio stations, says that the Cuban Government has not prevented the departure from the island of people who complete their procedures legally. Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said that the group occupying the Belgian diplomatic residence must leave that place "because pressure tactics and forceful means are not adequate mechanisms to leave Cuba." He pointed out that the island, in view of this incident, will maintain its usual position and that the Belgian authorities, being aware of the position toward such cases, should take the proper measures.
