The three domestic centers now specialize in the following areas: research in information science, production and development of machine translation systems (MTSs), and technical training, respectively. The two new centers have already taken on over 10 research projects including State 863 Program key tasks, NSFC key tasks, and international and domestic cooperative projects. The centers have admitted into their facilities over 100 invited guests and cooperative research fellows from Beijing University, Qinghua University, and 16 other higher-learning institutions and research institutes. With 863 Program support, Dr. Chen and his colleagues have developed a number of MTSs including English-Chinese, Chinese-English, Russian-Chinese, and German-Chinese. The Kuai Yitong 863 series of MTSs, developed and marketed in cooperation with Hong Kong's Quanzhi [2938 2535] Company, are now in mass production with a scale indicated by annual sales of 600 million yuan, direct benefits of $5.1 million to the State, and fixed assets of over $8 million. A while back, the original CAS MTC pooled its research talent with Quanzhi's investment capital to form the joint venture Shenzhen Kezhi [4430 2535] (``Sci-Sense'') Language Information Processing Ltd., the strongest and richest language information processing industrial base. The third base or center, specializing in technical training, admitted 12 MS candidates and 1 Ph.D. candidate last year, and this year will admit an additional 10 master's students and 4 Ph.D. students.
