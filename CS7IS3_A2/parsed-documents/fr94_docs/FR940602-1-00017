ACTION: Notice of data availability and request for comments. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announces the availability of a revised draft Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) prepared by the Agency for the proposed Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) requirements for corrective action for solid waste management units at hazardous waste management facilities. The information includes data in support of the proposed Subpart S rule relating to corrective action, published on July 27, 1990, and the final rule for Corrective Action Management Units (CAMUs) and Temporary Units (TUs), promulgated on February 16, 1993. DATES: Comments on this report must be submitted on or before July 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the report may be obtained by calling or visiting the RCRA Information Center. The RCRA Information Center is located in Room M2616 at EPA Headquarters and is available for viewing from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding Federal holidays. Requests for obtaining the document by telephone may be made by calling (202) 260&hyph;9327. Copies cost $0.15 per page. Comments on the data in the document must be submitted to the docket clerk at the following address: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, RCRA Information Center (5305), 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. One original and two copies of comments must be sent and identified by regulatory docket reference number (F&hyph;94&hyph;CA2A&hyph;FFFFF). In order not to be considered ``late'', comments must be postmarked on or before July 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For general information, contact the RCRA/Superfund Hotline, Office of Solid Waste, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, telephone (800) 424&hyph;9346; in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area the number is (703) 412&hyph;9810, TDD (703) 412&hyph;3323. For technical information regarding the Regulatory Impact Analysis, contact Linda Martin (Mail Code 5305), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, telephone (202) 260&hyph;0062. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. July 27, 1990 Proposal On July 27, 1990 EPA proposed a comprehensive rule (Subpart S) specifying corrective action requirements for facilities regulated under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (55 FR 30798). The proposed rule was developed to replace the existing Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) rules with a detailed regulatory program for implementing corrective action. A Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) to estimate the costs and benefits of the Subpart S proposed rule was developed to support the proposed rule. In that proposal, the EPA explained that it would continue to refine its estimates. As indicated in that proposal, the EPA is making available this revised draft RIA, and the Agency will take public comments, as well as comments received from EPA's Science Advisory Board (November 1993) into account in making its decision on how to proceed with the final Subpart S rulemaking. This Subpart S RIA includes supporting data regarding studies conducted by EPA concerning the use of CAMUs in RCRA corrective actions. EPA used these supporting data in a recent rulemaking authorizing the establishment of CAMUs (58 FR 8658, February 16, 1993). Although the CAMU rulemaking included a separate RIA and a summary report, some commenters requested additional information on the data supporting that analysis. EPA believes the summary report provided sufficient detail for purposes of the CAMU rulemaking; however, because the results of the CAMU RIA will be important for regulatory options analysis in the final Subpart S RIA, a more detailed breakdown of the CAMU data is included in this first installation of data. Additionally, the data made available through this notice may be relevant to a related RCRA rulemaking initiative, known as the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR) for contaminated media, which is intended to result in amended RCRA rules for the management of contaminated media. Comments on the data made available in today's notice may assist the Agency in assessing how the CAMU rule may relate to this new rulemaking initiative. II. Description of Available Data Included in the RCRA Docket for review are: _Draft Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Final Rulemaking on Corrective Action for Solid Waste Management Units: Proposed Methodology for Analysis (with APPENDICES), March 1993; _CAMU Analysis Expert Panel Outputs summarizing remedy selection; _``Supplementary Data for Corrective Action Management Units (CAMU): Facility characteristics'' (Table 1); _``Supplementary Data for Corrective Action Management Units (CAMU): SWMU characteristics'' (Table 2); and, _``Overview of SAB Comments and Recommendations on the Proposed RIA for the RCRA Corrective Action Rule,'' November 1993. (Compilation of six reports). Dated: May 18, 1994. Elliott P. Laws, Assistant Administrator, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response.
