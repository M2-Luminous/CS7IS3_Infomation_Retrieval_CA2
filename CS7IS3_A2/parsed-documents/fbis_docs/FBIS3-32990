Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina addressed numerous local and foreign journalists after officially announcing "The Nation and the Immigrants" conference, scheduled for April in this capital, and he outlined the characteristics of this meeting. The foreign minister recalled that contacts between Cubans who live abroad and their country of origin have been systematically undermined following the victory of the revolution by Washington's hostile policy toward the Caribbean island. Cuba cannot continue to wait until relations with the United States improve before attending to immigrant problems in a civilized, coherent, and correct manner, because they do not depend on current differences with the White House, he said. Robaina said the event, scheduled for 22, 23, and 24 April, will gather in Havana approximately 200 representatives of Cubans who live in numerous countries throughout the world. Although the largest delegation will come from the United States, where the largest number of immigrants have settled, the foreign minister said delegations will also arrive from Spain, Venezuela, Mexico, Panama, Slovakia, Mozambique, Namibia, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Czech Republic, among others. Four Cuban Government officials will be in charge of outlining essential issues during the meeting, and this will serve as the basis for debates. Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's Government, will discuss the immigration issue in a general context; Carlos Lage, vice president of the Council of Ministers, will deal with conditions within the current economic period, as well as the country's possibilities in the future. Moreover, Abel Prieto, president of the National Union of Cuban Writers and Artists, will talk about Cuban culture and immigrant intellectuals' contributions; and Robaina will personally talk about the tasks which correspond to Cubans living inside the country and abroad to sponsor relations with other countries. Robaina emphasized: Even though all pending issues will not be solved within three days, the goal is to start a discussion on topics of interest, including procedures to be carried out for trips, immigration permits, ways to help relatives, cultural exchange, and nationality problems. A gap must be filled, a hand must be offered to many immigrants who seek to maintain a normal relationship with their country, and the number of people who want to do this tends to increase, he said. He said: The conference will be held with absolute respect for everyone's opinion and without provisions, which is how Cuba would be willing to talk with Washington concerning any improvement of relations. The foreign minister recalled that, as far as immigration affairs are concerned, the U.S. Government has always failed to implement the agreements reached with Cuba. In reply to another question, he said those who endorse an anti-Cuban hysteria would not be allowed to attend the conference. In reply to another question, he said the announcement of this conference does not represent a concession, or a sign of weakness, because everyone knows Cuba would never choose that option.
