ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: NASA is amending subpart 1209.4, ``Inventions and Contributions Board,'' to reflect the current organizational structure. This regulation describes the functions, authority, and membership of the NASA Inventions and Contributions Board. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Paul A. Curto, 202&hyph;358&hyph;2279. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NASA published 14 CFR Part 1209, subpart 1209.4, on January 31, 1986 (51 FR 3945). This amendment revises section 1209.403 to make an organizational change and makes editorial corrections to section 1209.402. Since this action is internal and administrative in nature and does not effect existing regulations, no public comment period is required. NASA has determined that this regulation does not constitute a major rule for the purposes of Executive Order 12866, and it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
