FR940405-1-00080 FR940405-1-00013 The most common internal measure of CO exposure is blood carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO). Blood HbCO provides a useful measure of exposure to CO, and can be related to the cardiovascular effects of CO. A way to determine the occupational component of one's total CO exposure is to measure workplace CO levels and predict blood HbCO with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for CO [Ex. 4&hyph;11]. A difficulty associated with the use of CO or HbCO as a biomarker for ETS effects is the presence of other sources of CO in the workplace. Nicotine can be measured directly in body fluids and the circulating concentration can be related to physiological effects, such as heart rate [Ex. 4&hyph;26]. Alternatively, measurements of nicotine in air or cotinine in body fluids can be measured, and the circulating concentration of nicotine can be inferred using a pharmacokinetic model. The use of a pharmacokinetic model to relate inhaled nicotine to circulating nicotine and cotinine levels is the main focus of this section. PAHs are inhaled in the form of particulates on which they are adsorbed. Developing an appropriate biomarker for ETS-associated PAHs is complicated by the presence of PAHs on particulates not associated with ETS, and by the low, and variable, composition of PAHs adsorbed to particulate matter. One candidate material which has been suggested as an environmental marker for ETS-associated particulates is solanesol, a non-volatile tobacco constituent. However, the pharmacokinetic information necessary for use of solanesol as an internal biomarker is not currently available. The use of these three different biomarkers (CO, PAHs, and solanesol) does not appear to be practical. It appears that the most effective strategy currently achievable would be to rely on nicotine (or cotinine) measurement as a specific marker of ETS exposure as well as a direct measure of nicotine exposure. 3. Carcinogenicity The mechanism of carcinogenicity from exposure to ETS is not known, but it has been established that ETS includes a number of chemicals which have been identified as carcinogens (see Tables II&hyph;2, III&hyph;6, and III&hyph;7), although most of the identified carcinogenic components of ETS are not unique to ETS. Therefore, direct measurement of the carcinogenic components or related biomarkers in biological fluids would not provide a unique measure of exposure from ETS. The potentially carcinogenic components of ETS include highly volatile chemicals such as formaldehyde and benzene, lower volatility chemicals such as the nitrosamines, and non-volatile chemicals such as PAHs and metal compounds, which are bound to particulates. Given the current lack of information on the mechanism of carcinogenicity of ETS it is impossible to identify which components of ETS should be targeted for exposure estimation. The most prudent choice for a biomarker in this case would be one which provides the most general representation of all the components of ETS, and which is itself unique to ETS. In an experimental study of potential ETS-unique environmental markers of exposure, only nicotine was found to represent both the gas phase and particulate phase organic constituent of ETS [Ex. 4&hyph;97]. Several studies have shown a strong correlation between measurements of nicotine in the air and the mutagenicity of ETS [Exs. 4&hyph;198, 4&hyph;215]. In these studies, the relationship of nicotine to mutagenicity was as good as or better than the relationship of RSP to mutagenicity (RSP is assumed to be the major contributor of the carcinogenic effects of ETS). Therefore, since measurements of nicotine in the air correlate better than measurements of RSP to mutagenicity of ETS, and there is a positive correlation between short-term mutagenicity tests and carcinogenicity, the use of nicotine as an exposure marker for the carcinogenic effects of ETS appears to be justified. 4. Evaluation of Cotinine as a Biomarker for ETS The purpose of this section is to discuss the use of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, as an internal biomarker for inhalation exposure to nicotine, and, as such, its usefulness as a metric for the health effects of ETS. Cotinine is preferred over nicotine as an internal biomarker because of its slower clearance from the body [Ex. 4&hyph;71]. There is a strong correlation between nicotine intake and plasma cotinine levels [Ex. 4&hyph;115]. There is also a strong correlation between cotinine measured in body fluids and ETS exposure. In a controlled study, urinary cotinine was found to be a reliable marker for long-term ETS exposure, and plasma and salivary cotinine were found to be good indicators of short- as well as long-term exposure [Ex. 4&hyph;73]. Several studies have also demonstrated a positive relationship between self-reported exposure to ETS and cotinine in serum [Exs. 4&hyph;166, 4&hyph;250, 4&hyph;301], saliva [Ex. 4&hyph;166], and urine [Exs. 4&hyph;166, 4&hyph;211, 4&hyph;316]. In general, the currently available data support the assumption that nicotine and cotinine kinetics parameters for smokers can be extrapolated to nonsmokers for estimating exposures to ETS in nonsmokers [Ex. 4&hyph;24]. Studies have also demonstrated that salivary levels of cotinine are directly proportional to plasma levels [Ex. 4&hyph;73], and that urinary excretion of cotinine is linearly related to plasma levels [Ex. 4&hyph;82]. Thus all three biological fluids provide a reasonable metric for nicotine intake, and thus can serve as biomarkers of ETS exposure in nonsmokers. There are two potential difficulties associated with the use of cotinine as a biomarker for ETS. The first is the presence of nicotine in the diet. Several foods, including tea, tomatoes, and potatoes, have been shown to contain nicotine in measurable quantities [Exs. 4&hyph;49, 4&hyph;81, 4&hyph;281]. However, a study of 3,383 nonsmokers was unable to substantiate an effect of tea drinking on serum cotinine levels for self-reported daily tea consumption [Ex. 4&hyph;301]. The same study did find a strong correlation between self-reported ETS exposure and serum cotinine level.
