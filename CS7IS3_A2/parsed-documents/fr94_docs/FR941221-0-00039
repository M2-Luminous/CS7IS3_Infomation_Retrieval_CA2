FR941221-0-00039 FR941221-0-00015 Second, if we had chosen to use drawdowns rather than SLIAG-related costs to determine unexpended funds, the total amount of unexpended funds might be lower than if we use SLIAG-related costs. The commenter, for instance, suggests that States' drawdowns may be higher than their accepted SLIAG-related costs. If a State with drawdowns higher than its accepted SLIAG-related costs were, in its final cost report, unable to document the additional costs for which it was claiming reimbursement, the State would be required to refund the amount of the excess drawdown. If we were to use the definition proposed by the commenter, we would be precluded from including that amount (i.e., the amount of the excess drawdown) in the total of unexpended funds. We believe that using accepted SLIAG-related costs instead of drawdowns will ensure that the maximum amount of unexpended funds is available for reallocation. The commenter also suggests that drawdowns rather than SLIAG-related costs be used in determining unexpended funds because States with drawdowns greater than accepted SLIAG-related costs can appeal an order for repayment and such an appeal can be time-consuming. In the final rule, we have allowed 90 days for States to submit their final cost reports; we have allowed an additional 76 days for States to respond to our comments on their final cost reports and to submit revisions. In view of the amount of time we have allowed in the final rule to States to submit their final cost reports and to submit revised reports, if necessary, we believe that the likelihood of any appeal is slight. Although an appeal would reduce the unexpended funds available for reallocation as of March 15, 1995, we believe that the total amount of unexpended funds available for reallocation will be greater using SLIAG-related costs, rather than drawdowns, as the basis for determining unexpended funds. Finally, although some States may have drawdowns which exceed their accepted SLIAG-related costs as of December 30, 1994, other States have chosen, during the course of the SLIAG program, to draw down funds only after SLIAG-related costs have been accepted by the Department. We believe that the definition proposed by the commenter might unfairly penalize States which have chosen to draw down funds after acceptance by the Department of their SLIAG-related costs. In particular, use of this commenter's suggested definition might require us to take back and reallocate to other States funds granted to such States which exceed their drawdowns but are less than their accepted SLIAG-related costs, leaving these States with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs. To avoid creating a new group of States with SLIAG-related costs for which they would not receive reimbursement, we have not incorporated the suggestion of this commenter in the final rule. Section 402.11, Limitations on Use of SLIAG Funds In the SLIAG regulation, States are required to document and report to the Department the SLIAG-related costs they have incurred in providing services to eligible legalized aliens through September 30, 1994. The cost reports are due 90 days after the end of the final year. The final cost reports for grants awarded under §§402.31 and 402.33 are therefore due December 29, 1994. In the final rule, §402.11 has been amended to provide that, for States to receive reimbursement from SLIAG funds, costs submitted by States must be accepted by the Department as allowable by March 15, 1995. Comment (Limitations on Use of SLIAG Funds) One commenter suggested that the requirement that SLIAG funds be available for reimbursement only for SLIAG-related costs accepted as allowable by the Department as of March 15, 1995, be deleted. The commenter suggested that this requirement would be unfair to local governments which cannot report SLIAG-related costs directly to the Department nor respond directly to comments. The commenter also noted that the proposed rule provided no mechanism for appealing decisions by the Department not to accept costs while under the existing regulation, States can appeal disallowances before repaying funds. Response In the proposed rule, we established the deadline of March 15, 1995, for accepting SLIAG-related costs for two reasons. We believe that this date provides as long a period of time as possible for States to respond to our comments on their final cost reports and to submit revised cost reports while ensuring that there is adequate time for the Department to complete the reallocation process and for States with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs to draw down reallocated funds by July 31, 1995. Specifically, we are allowing 76 days between the due date of the final cost reports on December 29, 1994, and the final date for acceptance by the Department of SLIAG-related costs on March 15, 1995, to States for revisions of their costs reports. Although the commenter expressed concern about the impact of the deadline of March 15, 1995, on local governments, we believe that this deadline does allow adequate time for States (the grantees under the SLIAG program) to document, review, submit, and revise their SLIAG-related costs, incurred by both State and local governments, Furthermore, we have no reason to believe that any extension of the March 15, 1995, deadline would necessarily ensure that local governments would be able to work out with State grantees problems with the cost submissions of the local governments. We have retained the deadline of March 15, 1995, in the final rule as we believe it provides sufficient time both for States to report their SLIAG-related costs and for States with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs to draw down their reallocated funds.
