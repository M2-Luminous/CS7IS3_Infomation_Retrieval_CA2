FR941125-0-00032 FR941125-0-00016 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AC04 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Two Puerto Rican Trees Determined To Be Endangered AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines Eugenia haematocarpa (uvillo) and Pleodendron macranthum (chupacallos) to be endangered species pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended. Both species are small trees endemic to Puerto Rico. They are variously threatened by habitat destruction and modification, forest management practices, hurricane damage, restricted distribution, and possible collection. This final rule implements Federal protection and recovery provisions for these species as provided by the Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 27, 1994. ADDRESSES: The complete file for this rule is available for inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours, at the Caribbean Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 491, Boquerón, Puerto Rico 00622; and the Service's Southeast Regional Office, 1875 Century Boulevard, Atlanta, Georgia 30345&hyph;3301. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Eugenio Santiago-Valentín at the Caribbean Field Office address (809/851&hyph;7297) or Mr. Dave Flemming at the Atlanta Regional Office address (404/679&hyph;7096). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Eugenia haematocarpa was first collected in 1939 from Barrio Maizales in the municipality of Naguabo by Leslie R. Holdridge but was named in 1963, 24 years later, by Henri Alain Liogier (Little et al. 1974; Proctor, pers. comm.). Since then, subsequent collections have been made from the El Verde area of the Luquillo mountains, and it was also recently discovered (in 1990) from a privately-owned property located adjacent to the Carite Commonwealth Forest. Eugenia haematocarpa is a small tree, 6 meters (20 feet) tall and 12&hyph;13 centimeters (4.8&hyph;5.2 inches) in diameter. The elliptic leathery leaves are 13&hyph;18 centimeters (5.2&hyph;7.2 inches) long, 6&hyph;8 centimeters (2.4&hyph;3.2 inches) wide, almost stalkless, hairless, dull dark green on the upper surface, and light green beneath. Blades contain many slender, slightly raised side veins, forming a prominent network. The flowers are produced on trunks, with slender, nearly equal stalks. Flowers have a four-lobed rounded calyx, 1 millimeter (.04 inch) long; four rounded light pink petals 3 millimeters (.12 inch) long; and numerous stamens. The fruit is a dark red, round berry 2.3&hyph;2.9 centimeters (.9&hyph;1.1 inch) in diameter, containing a 1.6 centimeter (.6 inch) diameter seed. Eugenia haematocarpa is known from five localities in the wet montane forests of the Sierra de Luquillo and Sierra de Cayey. Less than 50 plants are known from four populations within the Caribbean National Forest, managed by the U.S. Forest Service. A population of approximately 15 plants occurs on private property adjacent to the Carite Commonwealth Forest in the Sierra de Cayey. The populations within the Caribbean National Forest may be affected by forest management practices. The population on private land may be affected by clearing of the vegetation. All the localities where the species occurs were impacted by Hurricane Hugo in 1989. The fact that the species produces edible fruits could make it an attractive one for collecting. Pleodendron macranthum was discovered by the French botanist August Plée in 1822&hyph;1823 and was first described by Baillon under the genus Cinnamodendron. In 1889 vanTieghem placed the species in the current genus, which honors its first collector (Vivaldi et al. 1981.)
