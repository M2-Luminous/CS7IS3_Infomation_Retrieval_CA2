FR940628-1-00065 FR940628-1-00014 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 575 [Docket No. 91&hyph;68; Notice 03] RIN 2127&hyph;AC64 Consumer Information Regulations; Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Rollover Prevention AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (Consumer Information Regulation); Termination of rulemaking (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard). SUMMARY: As part of its comprehensive efforts to address the problem of light vehicle rollover, this agency is proposing a new consumer information regulation that would require that passenger cars and light multipurpose passenger vehicles and trucks be labeled with information about their resistance to rollover. This information would enable prospective purchasers to make choices about new vehicles based on differences in rollover risk; motivate manufacturers to give more priority to rollover stability in designing their vehicles; and inform motorists that they can reduce the risk of injury in a rollover by wearing their safety belts. NHTSA believes that this would reduce the number of injuries and fatalities from rollover accidents. DATES: Comment Date: Comments must be received by August 29, 1994.
