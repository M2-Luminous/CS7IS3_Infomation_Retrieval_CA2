This is a part of the measures designed to show at home and abroad the transparency of Japan's plutonium utilization, in which other countries are interested. He explained this plan in response to a question asked by Osamu Imamura (of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]) at the House of Representatives Science and Technological Committee meeting on the same day. In response to an inquiry by Tadatoshi Akiba, lower house Dietman (of the SDPJ), the STA disclosed last October the amount of plutonium in stock. However, the agency will make regular announcements in the future. Regarding the frequency of and how to make the announcements, the STA will study some possibilities while taking several factors into consideration, including progress at meetings on the framework of international plutonium utilization. Director General Omi stressed: "To obtain understanding and cooperation from the people, it is important for us to disclose as much information as possible, except information on the protection of property rights, such as know-how regarding the protection of nuclear materials." The amount of plutonium in stock as of late December last year, when the same agency made the announcement, was 1,600 kilograms. Moreover, 2,900 kg of plutonium was stored in Britain and France, where plutonium is being reprocessed for Japan. The government announced previously that it would continue to maintain a balance between the supply of and demand for plutonium. Therefore, the government needs to disclose the amount of plutonium in stock to actually show that it is abiding by its own announcement.
