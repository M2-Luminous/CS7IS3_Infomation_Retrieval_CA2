Against a background of rivalry within the Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) party for presidential elections in May 1995, Balladur appealed to RPR deputies to show "unity" and "solidarity" behind him. Addressing a meeting of RPR MPs held on the sidelines of a new session of parliament, Balladur said unity was a "condition of success" while division meant the "certainty of failure," Balladur aides reported after the meeting. The prime minister spoke after coming under heavy criticism from supporters of RPR president Jacques Chirac, a candidate in the 1995 presidentials, for his handling of a plan to allow firms to pay less than the legal minimum to unemployed youths. Balladur, who has barely concealed his own presidential ambitions, withdrew the plan last Wednesday after more than a month of sometimes violent student agitation. Presenting himself both as "head of the government" and head of the ruling right-wing parliamentary majority, Balladur said the government drew its "strength" from the "unflinching" support of its majority, his aides said. Without naming him, Balladur attacked RPR assistant-secretary general Jean-Louis Debre, a strong Chirac supporter, for criticising the government as demonstrations were actually going on. Balladur also alluded to the presidentials, saying it would be an "illusion" to believe that his own failures would benefit any other right-wing candidate in 1995. The prime minister rejected calls for the resignation of Labour Minister Michel Giraud over the failed youth jobs scheme, saying he accepted full responsibility, the aides added. Balladur also said he accepted responsibility for the failure of government plans to aid private schools at the expense of the public sector, which brought 600,000 demonstrators into the streets of Paris last January. In February, the prime minister pledged handouts of 30 million dollars after violent protests by fishermen against cheap imports. Meanwhile MPs of the opposition Socialist Party said they put down a censure motion on the government's five-year employment act, under which decrees on the youth jobs scheme were published. Communists said they would demand abrogation of the law. Charles Millon, parliamentary leader of the centre-right component in the ruling coalition, the Union for French Democracy (UDF), pledged "total solidarity" for the government, but warned it to take account of "common sense" criticisms from its backers. Bernard Pons, head of the RPR parliamentary group and a Chirac supporter, renewed calls for Giraud's resignation in an interview with the GLOBE weekly to be published Wednesday. He said the RPR group thought there had been failures by some ministers. "It is up to the prime minister and him alone to draw the conclusions." Pons also confirmed that Balladur and Chirac had reached "a sort of pact" for the presidential election after the right's sweeping victory in legislative elections in March, 1993, and this "will be respected." Under the pact, Balladur was to have headed a caretaker government under socialist President Francois Mitterrand, leaving the field to Chirac in the presidentials.
