FR941130-0-00014 FR941130-0-00002 After a review of the comments and an internal review of the issue, the Board has decided to defer to the judgment of the converting bank's board or directors or trustees and the applicable state law on whether a stock purchase priority is provided to local depositors. The FDIC continues to believe, generally, that local depositors, collectively, should be granted a preference because they typically have made significant long-term contributions to the financial success of the converting State Savings Bank, in contrast to certain non-local depositors who have made deposits solely in anticipation of a conversion. The FDIC also believes, however, any potential abuse by professional depositors can and should be handled on a case-by-case basis by the converting bank's management, under the applicable state law. Thus, the final rule does not require the local depositor preference contained in the Proposed Rule. The FDIC will consider, on a case-by-case basis, the reasonableness of any local depositor preference included in a proposed conversion. In that connection, the Board notes that it will not object to a local depositor preference based on the definition of ``local community'' contained in the OTS Revisions. C. Priority for ESOPs The proposed rule included a provision requiring that ESOPs not be accorded a higher subscription right priority than ``eligible depositors''. As noted above, the term ``eligible depositors'' was defined as depositors holding qualifying deposits at the bank as of a date designated in the bank's plan of conversion that is not less than one year prior to the date of adoption of the plan of conversion by the converting bank's board of directors/trustees. This proposed requirement was prompted by the Board's belief that ESOPs (tax-qualified or otherwise) should not be accorded higher purchase priority rights than long-term depositors. This is in keeping with the principle of fiduciary duty requiring that the board of directors/trustees of a State Savings Bank put the interest of long-term depositors ahead of the interests of management and employees. The FDIC received several comments on this proposed requirement. In essence, they were evenly divided between those for and against the proposal. Those in favor of the requirement argued that eligible depositors of a converting State Savings Bank should be accorded the first priority in purchasing stock in the conversion. Those opposed asserted that the employees make the bank successful and, thus, should be accorded the first subscription priority. One group commented that ESOP participants and eligible depositors should share priority on a pro rata basis. The Board does not disagree that ESOPs promote greater employee productivity and motivation and that the employees of a State Savings Bank should be permitted to benefit, through the purchase of subscription stock by an ESOP, in the bank's mutual-to-stock conversion. The Board continues to believe, however, that, under general principles of fiduciary duty, ESOPs should not be accorded higher purchase priority rights than long-term depositors. Thus, the Board has decided to include in the final rule the requirement that ``eligible depositors'' be accorded a higher subscription priority than ESOPs. 6. Business Plans The Proposed Rule included a requirement that State Savings Banks that propose to undergo a mutual-to-stock conversion submit a business plan including, among other things, a detailed discussion of how management intends to deploy the capital raised through the sale of stock in the conversion, expected earnings resulting from the plan, and the justification for any intended stock repurchases. The FDIC received five comments on this proposed requirement. All agreed that a business plan should be required in connection with a proposed mutual-to-stock conversion of a State Savings Bank. As indicated in the Proposed Rule, for safety and soundness purposes the FDIC must know the institution's business plan for post-conversion operation, growth and investment of any newly injected capital. The reason is that institutions converting from mutual form undertake a major restructuring that possibly could lead to significant changes in the nature or volume of business conducted. Converted institutions become answerable to shareholders for the first time, and the shareholders are concerned with obtaining reasonable earnings on their investment. For these reasons and upon consideration of the comments, the Board has adopted in the final rule the business plan requirements of the Proposed Rule. 7. Stock Repurchases The Proposed Rule included a provision to prohibit State Savings Banks from repurchasing stock for one year following the bank's conversion to stock form. After that period the FDIC would consider such proposed repurchases on a case-by-case basis under section 18(i)(1) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(i)(1)) (Section 18(i)). Section 18(i) prohibits state nonmember banks from reducing or retiring capital without the prior consent of the FDIC. The FDIC received several comments on this issue, the majority of which opposed stock repurchase restrictions. Those against it asserted that the inability to repurchase stock for one year would constitute an unnecessary and inappropriate restriction on the ability of officers and trustees to carry out their duty to maximize the value of the shares of the bank. Those for the restriction stated that it would help prevent insider abuse. One state regulator said any such restriction should be determined by the bank's primary regulator. As indicated in the Proposed Rule, the Board is concerned that a substantial stock buyback program begun immediately after the bank's conversion to stock form may not have a legitimate business purpose and would raise issues about whether the conversion stock was appropriately valued. The Board is also concerned that a recently converted institution have a capital base adequate to safeguard against possible unexpected losses that may occur under the new organizational structure. Thus, upon consideration of the comments, the Board has decided to implement the one-year restriction. To allow for some flexibility in this respect, however, the final rule modifies the restriction to allow limited stock repurchases up to 5 percent during the first year where compelling and valid business reasons are established. This would give the FDIC the explicit ability to permit repurchases during the first year after the conversion where it is in the best interests of the bank and its shareholders. All proposed stock repurchases by State Savings Banks are considered by the FDIC on a case-by-case basis under section 18(i).
