FR940512-0-00010 FR940512-0-00004 Civil Justice Reform This document has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. It is the determination of RDA and FmHA that this action does not unduly burden the Federal Court System in that it meets all applicable standards provided in section 2 of the Executive Order. Environmental Impact Statement This action has been reviewed in accordance with FmHA Instruction 1940&hyph;G, ``Environmental Program.'' FmHA and RDA have determined that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91&hyph;190, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. Background This regulatory package is an agency initiative to make the IRP more effective at stimulating rural community economic development. The current regulation prohibits approval of any IRP loan that would result in any one intermediary having an outstanding IRP indebtedness exceeding $2,000,000. RDA is still not encouraging initial loans of more that $2,000,000. However, some intermediaries have received and reloaned $2,000,000 and have demand for additional funding to meet the needs of the communities they serve. The primary reason for this action is to allow subsequent loans to those successful intermediaries that have reached the current limit. Interim Rule It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits or contracts shall be published for comment notwithstanding the exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. However, FmHA/RDA is making this action effective upon publication in the Federal Register without securing prior public comment. It would be contrary to the public interest to wait for public comments before implementing an increase in loan ceiling. There is an immediate need to provide funds to the public to help alleviate severe economic hardship which exists in many rural areas as the result of high unemployment and poverty level wages. Numerous intermediaries now exist that have received the maximum of $2 million, have successfully used all of the funds to assist rural businesses, and have urgent need for additional loan funds. These intermediaries have proven their ability to play a major and successful role in stimulating the economy and developing jobs in rural areas with high unemployment and depressed economies. Increasing the IRP loan ceiling quickly will allow them to receive additional IRP funds and continue to provide urgently needed assistance to businesses in their service areas. Delaying action will deprive them of needed funding. Comments will be accepted for 60 days after publication and, if appropriate, adjustments will be made in the regulation based on the comments.
