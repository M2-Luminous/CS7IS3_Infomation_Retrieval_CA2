SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the notice of receipt for PRM&hyph;35&hyph;12 published on December 2, 1994 (59 FR 61831), the paragraph under the heading, ``Benefits of the Test,'' revised to read as follows: The petitioner states that under the current regulations, the test is 95 percent accurate and quite inexpensive because of its simplicity. The test would permit doctors to determine easily whether or not ulcer patients have been cured of their infection. By providing the public with an inexpensive, easily accessible diagnostic test, more individuals would be accurately diagnosed and treated for H.pylori infection. This would save the United States an estimated $500 million per annum over conventional therapy. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 13th day of December, 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Michael T. Lesar, Chief, Rules Review Section, Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration.
