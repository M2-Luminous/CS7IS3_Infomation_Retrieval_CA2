The Ukrainian leader believes, though, that the development of all-round relations with the Baltics aggravates both objective and subjective factors. In an interview with the popular Lithuanian newspaper LIETUVOS RYTAS Kravchuk described as an objective problem the painful transformations in the economy in the republic. As a result of such transformations, believes the president, it is difficult to maintain long-standing contacts among the republics. Kravchuk believes as subjective factors the passive attitude of the regions, enterprises and the governments. Kravchuk believes that the situation may start improving following the meeting between the presidents and he invited the head of the Lithuanian state Algirdas Brazauskas to visit Ukraine at any time suitable for him. He is also prepared to visit Lithuania. Asked by the newspaper to comment on the Lithuanian official statement to enter NATO, the Ukrainian president has favoured the initiatives "Partnership for Peace" and added that Ukraine would not object against Lithuania's entry to NATO, since we do not see in it any discomfort or strategic threat. Kravchuk said that neither the United States nor Russia are interested to expand NATO. He explained his view by the fact that today large states, like the United States and Russia want to have zones of influence. Russia, believes the Ukrainian leader, attempts to retain in its sphere of influence former Soviet republics and the countries of the central and eastern Europe. He said that the methods to ensure the influence contradict those universally acknowledged. The Ukrainian president has said that in principle he does not approve the division along these lines and added that large and small states should be equal partners. If so, we can rely on stability and lasting peace, and neighbourly relations, said Kravchuk.
