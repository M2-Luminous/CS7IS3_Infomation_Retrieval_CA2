Meeting them over luncheon, President Kim said he would execute "clean politics" where industries will be able to manage their businesses without bothering to read the faces of the government and politicians. The six elders present at the Chongwadae [presidential offices] working luncheon were ex-Prime Ministers Sin Hyon-hwak, Yu Chang-sun and Yi Hyon-chae, ex-Deputy Premiers Kim Chun-sung and Yi Han-bin, and Chong Su-chang, former head of the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The attendees called for resolute improvement of the economic structure with a view to enhancing the nation's international competitiveness, steady pursuit of deregulation, and preparation against the sudden collapse of North Korea. "We should not sit idly by simply because the economy goes well. We must resolutely improve our economic structure through technology development and expanded investment," Sin Hyon-hwak said. Former Prime Minister Nam Tok-u and ex-Deputy Premiers Sin Pyong-hyon and Cho Sun were also invited, but they failed to attend due to their overseas trips and other personal reasons.
