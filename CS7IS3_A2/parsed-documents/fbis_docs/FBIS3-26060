Present at the closing ceremony were Wang Qun, Wu Liji, Qian Fenyong, Bai Enpei, Wang Zhan, Geriletu, Yang Enbo, and Wuyunqimuge. Wu Liji made a summing-up speech. Wang Zhan chaired the session. The session approved the report entitled "Expand the Extent of Reform, Accelerate the Economic Development, and Strive To Create a New Situation in Setting Up the Socialist Market Economic System" made by Comrade Wang Qun on behalf of the standing committee of the regional party committee. The session called on the party organizations and the broad masses of Communist Party members across the region to firmly remember the purpose of serving the people, regard the task of ceaselessly liberating and developing productive forces and making the people of various nationalities rich and happy as their own duty, further strengthen the sense of responsibility to history and the sense of urgency for the times under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th Party Congress, unite with and guide the people of various nationalities across the region, emancipate the mind, keep forging ahead, work with one heart and soul, conduct pioneering work arduously, and fight to create a new situation in setting up the socialist market economic system and promoting sustained, rapid, and sound development of the economy. Wu Liji said in his speech: "This is a policy-making session to comprehensively implement the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, to set up new systems, and to create a new situation and set up a mobilization meeting to emancipate the mind, seek unity of thought, promote reform, accelerate the pace of development, and welcome the key year. After analyzing the development situation ahead of the region, Wu Liji said: At present, our region is confronted with five favorable opportunities. First, the international environment has brought extremely good advantages to us in regards to further expanding the scale of opening up and accelerating the development pace. Second, the state cancels, in a step-by-step manner, the dual-pricing system and decontrols the prices of the majority of energy resources and raw materials. The region's long-term phenomena in which the value of raw materials deviates from their prices tend to have been alleviated. A large number of enterprises engaged in the production of the products of these kinds will create better economic results through market competition. Third, through the readjustment of the product mix and the reform of the old investment system, the central and western parts of the region have increased their input in the development of energy resources and raw materials. All this has created a favorable environment for realizing the strategy of transforming natural resources. Fourth, along with the implementation of the tax distribution system, the state will gradually enhance its financial resources. This has created prerequisite conditions for increasing the input to the undeveloped areas through the implementation of the system wherein the central fiscal authority returns and transfers payments to local authorities. Fifth, through the efforts made over the past 40 years or so, our region has had good foundations in materials, technology, and development. Therefore, our region should abide by the following guiding ideology for economic development in 1994: Comprehensively implement the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee and the eighth (enlarged) plenary session of the fifth regional party committee, persist in the basic line of the party, expand the extent of reform, vigorously readjust the industrial structure and the product mix, and increase economic results. On the premise of continuously grasping the basic industries and the pillar industries, we should positively cultivate and develop new economic growth points and promote better and faster development of the national economy. Wu Liji pointed out: According to this guiding ideology, the region has tentatively set 1994's major economic and social development targets as follows: We should guarantee a 10 percent increase of GNP and strive to increase 12 percent. The total agricultural output value should increase by 6 percent, the total industrial output value should increase by 14 percent, and the investment in fixed assets should reach 20.25 billion yuan. We should guarantee an increase of $1.4 billion in total export and import trade volume and strive to create $1.5 billion. We should strive to create 5.5 billion yuan in revenues. The index of retail sales of commodities should be controlled within 10 percent, the per capita income of the peasants and the herdsmen should increase by more than 100 yuan, and the population natural growth rate should be controlled within 13.5 per thousand. Wu Liji said: Through full discussions, the delegates maintained that we must pay attention to and embody the following principles in order to realize the 1994 economic and social development targets: That development is an essential criterion should be persisted in. We should try every possible means to accelerate the pace of development. We should persistently take the increase in economic results as a key link, persist in the principle of taking the overall situation into consideration and ensuring key projects, adhere to the "three-conducive" standards, and persist in the idea of self-reliance and arduous struggle. Focusing on the general target of setting up the socialist market economic system and comprehensively promoting the progress of reform according to the arrangements of the central authorities and in line with the provincial actual conditions is the important subject discussed at this session. Wu Liji pointed out: The 1994 reform priorities are as follows: In regard to the reform of the financial and tax system, we should carry out the tax assignment system on the basis of a rational division of power between central and local authorities. In regard to the reform of the banking system, we should separate policy-lending banking from commercial banking. In regard to the reform of the investment system, we should gradually establish risk liabilities for corporate investment and bank credits. In regard to the reform of the export trade system, we should cancel the mandatory planning of the foreign trade enterprises and further decontrol, in a well-planned manner, the import and export commodity managerial rights. The prices of the majority of production factors should be decontrolled in a step-by-step manner; and the grain and cotton purchasing prices should rise. Enterprises should set up a modern enterprise system characterized by clearly defined property rights, rights, and responsibility, separating the government administration from enterprise management; and scientific management. In regard to the reform of the social guaranteeing system, we should perfect the system of providing for the aged staff and workers and the system of medical insurance for staff and workers. In regard to the reform of the urban housing system, we should focus on marketing public houses; pay equal attention to sales, rent, and construction; and accelerate the commercialization and socialization of houses. According to the guidelines of Comrade Wang Qun's report and the discussion situation of session, Wu Liji stressed the necessity to attend to the 1994 work. First, we should focus on changing the enterprise mechanisms and win the general war of reform. Due to the fact that the focal and difficult point of the 1994 economic structural reform is to blaze a new trails in the enterprise system, we must adopt major measures, go into mass action, and strive to make a big breakthrough in this regard. At the time of grasping the enterprise reform, we should continue to regard the increase in the industrial production as the focal point of the region's economic work and positively readjust the industrial structure and the product mix according to the market demands. Second, we should vigorously develop the economy of the rural and pastoral areas and strive to increase the income of the peasants and the herdsmen. The focus of the work of agriculture, animal husbandry, the rural and pastoral areas, and the peasants and the herdsmen is to increase the income of the peasants and the herdsmen. According to the requirements of the two-stage fighting targets, the per capita net income of the peasants and the herdsmen must increase by more than 200 yuan in the next two years. The party committees and governments at various levels should continue to persist in the idea that agriculture and animal husbandry are the foundation of the national economy, put agriculture and animal husbandry in the primary position of the economic work, stabilize the party's basic policies toward the rural and pastoral areas, deepen the rural and pastoral areas, and promote the overall development of the rural and pastoral economy. All leagues, cities, banners, and counties should focus the work toward banners and counties on grasping town and township enterprises and ensure that town and township enterprises really play a key role in developing the banner and county economy. He also urged to conscientiously attend to the financial and tax reform, realistically improve and strengthen the financial and tax work, further expand the scale of opening to the outside world and developing the lateral economic cooperation, conscientiously implement the strategy of relying on science and technology to rejuvenate Shandong, realistically grasp various social undertakings, and conscientiously arrange the people's livelihood. Wu Liji concluded: The reform and development tasks in the next year and in the foreseeable future are extremely arduous. The party and government leaders at various levels across the region should hold themselves responsible to the party and the people; further strengthen and improve the leadership over reform, opening up, and economic construction; greatly change and improve their ideas, work style, and work methods; and regard the year of 1994 as one to emancipate the mind, change work style, and implement tasks.
