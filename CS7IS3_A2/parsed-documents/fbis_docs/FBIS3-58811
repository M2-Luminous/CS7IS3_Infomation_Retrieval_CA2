A new, joint proposal by Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands for the entry negotiations is making greater concessions to Vienna's requests than the Commission's former position, which wanted to limit the system of ecological points to sensitive alpine regions. The new initiative, the complete written version of which should be presented as a new EU "joint position" next week, provides, however, for a shorter period -- three years have been mentioned -- for the ecological-points system, which was concluded to last until 2004. Three years have been mentioned as the EU's position for the negotiations, while Germany would even accept a longer period. In the case of an eight-year transition period starting in 1995, the agreed reduction of exhausts to 40 percent would be achieved by the year 2002 according to the transit agreement that came into force in 1993. In the Council's enlargement group last Wednesday [19 January] there seemed to be a clear majority in favor of the proposal offered by the three countries most affected by the transit agreement. Some countries such as France or Spain have not yet commented but do not reject the initiative on principle. "Our proposal is certainly more interesting for Austria than the former one, because it sticks to those points of the transit agreement that are important for you, such as its nationwide applicability," an Italian diplomat told DIE PRESSE. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, the transit issue is also straining ongoing negotiations between the five EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries that participate in the European Economic Area [EEA] and the EU on adopting over 400 EU legal regulations, which have came into force in the EU since August 1991 -- the date set for the EEA Agreement. Austria rejects some of the new EU regulations regarding road-use fees or the transportation of dangerous goods as incompatible with the transit agreement.
