Lula voiced concern over the redemocratization of the Armed Forces. He said he intends to set up rules based on constitutional provisions in coordination with military commanders. Lula expressed his concern about redemocratizing the Armed Forces when Naidoo alluded to the extreme care with which the South African Government is addressing the issue, taking into account that security in South Africa continues to remain exclusively in the hands of the white minority. Lula acknowledged that the situation in the Brazilian Armed Forces is different, because they have fewer resources than the South African military, whose budget will have to be streamlined to allow the government to increase investments in social areas. Lula said: In our case, our military even have financial problems in procuring polish for their boots. Yet we share the same concern about democratizing the Armed Forces. Before having dinner with Naidoo -- a former president of COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions], a trade union organization similar to CUT [Sole Workers Center] in Brazil -- Lula said he hopes to have the support of trade union organizations, especially CUT, to give greater dynamics to government-labor-management committees if he is elected president. Lula said: Government-labor-management committees are important tools in relieving unions from merely channeling wage demands to addressing issues such as economic growth goals in our talks with the government and employers.
