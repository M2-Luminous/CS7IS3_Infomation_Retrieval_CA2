The statement, announced after the meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors in Vienna that day, noted that the IAEA is concerned with the fact that DPRK has been delaying the date of nuclear inspection, and warned that if Pyongyang fails to designate the date of nuclear inspection by the end of this month, the Board of Governors would convene a plenary meeting and would demand that the IAEA Secretary- General comprehensively (?reexamine) the issue of North Korea's nuclear inspection. According to a report, the DPRK will not yield to pressure. The DPRK representative to the IAEA said that only on the condition that the United States make certain concessions [iljonghan yangbo] including the cancellation of the Team Spirit joint military exercise with the ROK, can the DPRK declare an inspection date for the seven nuclear facilities in the DPRK.
