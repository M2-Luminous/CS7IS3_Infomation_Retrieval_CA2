He will issue a brief message on the topics he had discussed recently, when he had no contact with you. Then we will have a question and answer segment. Kindly identify yourselves and the media you represent, as is the custom in this conference room, whenever you ask your questions. Here is President Carlos Roberto Reina. [Reina] Dear Juan Ramon Duran and dear friends of the press and the different media. I fulfill my word of being in constant contact with you. I have come to briefly tell you about the latest events -- they are not momentous news but they reveal the progress achieved by our thesis of the moral revolution. Today I had the great satisfaction of talking with members of the Armed Forces, at the highest level, about an issue that has caused great interest in the Honduran nation: military service. During our campaign we defined military service as a voluntary and educational service, and there is a proposal from the Armed Forces, at the highest level, for a constitutional and educational military service. I have heard an excellent exposition by Colonel [Jose Luis] Nunez Bennet and I think his conclusions convey the great historical moment which currently prevails in Honduras. In other words, this is part of what we called a consultation, which begins with a great dialogue, an open dialogue, a dialogue among equals, a fraternal dialogue, and which leads to conclusions and recommendations from either side on the way we will understand ourselves, meaning all the Hondurans. If Honduras wins prestige, all its institutions win prestige. If Honduras' image deteriorates, all its institutions are harmed; it is that simple, and if we improve it, we all improve. I think one of the conclusions that were reached is excellent: that the forceful recruitment used by the Armed Forces until April 1993 was negative and harmful for the image of the armed institution. I think this is a classy act that reflects high awareness. What young men and their mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters thought about the way in which people were taken away, in a somewhat unusual manner, to render military service was detrimental to the Armed Forces' prestige. We said this during our campaign and they fully recognize it. I also recognize the fact there has been no political will to organize institutions in Honduras because their organization entails starting a different period in the country's history. That is why I believe this consultation is part of what we have called the moral revolution, meaning a dialogue that will lead us to a consensus and will allow us to advance on the road toward the human development we have proposed. The new Armed Forces' role in times of peace. We have to consult on that; we have to discuss that; we have to review the theory of the Honduran people's safety. Regarding problems with the police, there will be no discrepancy about creating a technical, scientific police that guarantees rights and procedures to find the truth, instead of the procedures that resulted in so much negative publicity about Honduras. The Armed Forces say its members are aware that mistakes were made in the past and this discouraged the citizens from fulfilling their patriotic duty of rendering military service. Those are beautiful words stated by the corps, which should bring prestige to Honduras by fulfilling its constitutional duties. One of the recommendations is that the political will be expressed. I have already expressed the political will in my status as president of the Republic in order to establish an Army for peace, development, and the well-being of our people. I think it is an excellent recommendation that the Education Ministry provide its full support to the Armed Forces to provide education there too. I reiterate their recommendations, which I have praised very much. That moral and civic education be included in the study plans and programs for elementary and secondary schools. These classes were eliminated as a result of suggestions from abroad, but today all Hondurans without exception realize that this hurts the solidarity of the national identity. Furthermore, that discipline be instilled in citizens at schools at all levels because discipline is a basic factor for the development of the society. With this, and proposing to them that we form a joint commission of the Armed Forces and the government of the Republic to discuss compulsory military service, I have received their proposal and will appoint a commission to begin discussing the compulsory military service, in a conscious manner and with full competence. This is one of the points that I wanted to mention to you. There are other points that have been mentioned, which are still being studied, in regard to the so-called Trifinio Project which is located near Ocotepeque, the Armed Forces Budget, the reorganization of the Armed Forces, and the police. I am, thus, very satisfied with the dialogue we have held and I am convinced that we are on the right path to reaching a concerted agreement that will produce national theses that we will all defend. I am at your disposal for any question or any concern. If there is no air conditioning, it is the fault of KNEE [National Enterprise for Electric Power] and not of the presidency. [Laughter] But, we will try to provide you with all the comforts, as I told you before. [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] however, there is something that currently concerns the Honduran people in the economic field. There is an IMF mission in Honduras and it logically causes concern among the Honduran people. Could you tell us anything about the topics that have been discussed with the mission? And, is it true that the Honduran Government has already agreed to increase the electricity rates, tolls, and other services? Is there any truth in the rumors circulating this morning? [Reina] The arrival of the IMF representatives must be taken as it is, and not as a ghost that comes to threaten or impose on us. We are a sovereign country, but 40 percent of our budget is dedicated to paying the foreign debt -- immense amounts of money that disappeared during very regrettable periods in our history. I believe this is the first discussion, there is still no letter of intent. But, what I do guarantee to the Honduran people and to the majorities of this people, is that we will not accept, under any circumstance, that sales taxes be increased because those deeply hurt the poor majorities of Honduras. Other things are being discussed, other possibilities, but I have still not received the report from the economic cabinet. I met with them this morning, but to discuss a topic that I find to be passionate: solidarity -- this is a contribution from Mexico. To implement what in that country has been called the Solidarity [Program]. What does it consist of? That the people cooperate for their own benefit, for their own well-being. Honduran boards of trustees are organizations that have not functioned too well. They become sectarian, fight each other, neutralize each other. We have to have neighborhood residents improve their own living conditions with government and international aid. This approach has yielded good results in Mexico. I studied it this morning with the Economic Cabinet and feel very optimistic about it. The fare issue has not yet been decided. The Honduran poor majorities should not be taxed. The possibility of taxing either the poor or other social sectors is what is being debated. The final decision, however, will be made by the Honduran Government. The IMF, as an international organization, is not as tough as before. I can say this because I have talked with them in Washington and Honduras. Their purpose is similar to ours: to favor the majority of the people. Together, we will be able to face the foreign debt without hurting the Honduran people. [Reporter] The people want to know whether taxes will be increased and when a decision will be made regarding raising electricity rates and those of other public services. [Reina] The matter is under discussion, and there will soon be a solution, and this government's philosophy is to avoid hurting the poor majority of Honduras. I think this is a very clear and truthful idea. [Reporter] A list of three candidates for Social Security Fund director has been presented to you. It has been reported that you turned down this first list. What can you tell us about this? [Reina] I tell you frankly, Walter, such a list has not been presented to me, although I have been told it would be brought to me. When it is indeed sent to me, I will study it and appoint someone who can understand the true nature of social security. I will appoint the most capable person. For the time being, we have designated Dr. Ogden Rodriguez in the position. It was said a number of times that he had been discriminated against, that he was unpopular, things like that. It is impossible for all capable men to be appointed. Nevertheless, we will gradually correct the situation. Early in March, I will present a report to the Honduran people. It is necessary that I sum up thoroughly the condition of the country when I receive it. This will be done early in March. Many things will be clarified, things that have been touched upon only slightly in an effort to keep in touch with you journalists constantly. [Reporter] Much was said about privatization during the previous administration. This is my first question. Will you privatize the National Enterprise for Electric Power and Hondutel [Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise]? My second question is this: The National Party has already accused your administration of nepotism. Does nepotism exist here? How will you handle the pressure from liberal activists regarding job applications? [Reina] I will answer your questions with pleasure, Ms. Diaz. First of all, privatization as such is neither good nor bad. It depends on what is privatized and how it is done. A privatization process that is not clear, that is not absolutely honest, ends up being a disaster, because it would turn out to be a huge swindle against our people. The sale of assets worth many millions [currency not specified] would be mishandled, and the people would pay the consequences. If we were to privatize, we would do so under local and foreign audits to ensure absolute purity and to the defend the interest of the workers of the companies involved. Two factors would have to be considered: absolute honesty and respect for the rights of those who work in the enterprises. But those are issues that will be discussed in the future. What are we going to do if half of the Honduran budget is destined to pay a debt and the other half to pay employees? It is a country that cannot continue to function that way. We must defend our stability and identity with our assets. This is one of the areas that must be tackled. Nepotism is a vice of politics. But what can I do if I have many distant relatives who worked hard during the campaign. Am I going to stigmatize them or deprive them of some rights? The fact that Jorge Arturo Reina, my brother, could become and became Congress vice president has nothing to do with Carlos Roberto Reina. He has his own image, his own leadership. That cannot be considered nepotism. Nepotism is when one person appoints his relatives to exclude those persons with merits. Some people said a relative of mine -- a very distant relative I should note -- would be education minister. However, some people said he was a very close relative of mine. I am not going to commit those mistakes. However, I am not going to deprive someone who has worked and has merit and solvency to be a soldier of the moral revolution of the right to a position because they [words indistinct] I am not going to deprive that person of that right. Regarding influence peddling, I call on my fellow party members.... [pauses] How long did I wait to get to this post? Half a century. Can't they wait a few days? They said all government appointments have been made. I have just appointed the ministers. Other people are telling party members they have been left out. They say: Do you see how they used you? They just used you to get there. And that person becomes nervous. I ask you for patience. I am asking for nothing I did not have. I was very patient in putting up with injustices, humiliations, [word indistinct] I ask you to wait for some time while we solve the problems of giving some compensation to Liberal Party of Honduras [PLH] members who were dismissed from the government by the previous administration for their political party affiliation. I think this is logical. The government must not be sectarian. It must be for all Hondurans who will choose the best persons for public office. [Villanueva] Armando Villanueva of EL HERALDO. [Words indistinct] not to approve new direct taxes against the people. But what will happen with indirect taxes? For instance, it has been said a new toll collection system will be implemented and also [words indistinct]. In the end, industrialists and businessmen pass these increases on to consumers and it is ultimately the people who suffer the consequences. On the other hand, I would like to know if your government will reactivate this commission to oversee [words indistinct] last administration, whatever it's called, to oversee public officials? [Reina] A highway toll system operates in many countries. It is in place in San Pedro Sula and there is no problem. The thing is that people must have alternatives. If you want to travel on a paved road, then pay for it. If you don't want to pay, then use the dirt road. This gives people an alternative and is in place in many countries of the world. We all pay it because no one [words indistinct] because he has to pay one lempira. Regarding the other issue, the customs value factor is another topic currently being discussed. But if we permit taxes to be passed on to the poor, we would not be doing anything. We are working to prevent that from happening. This would permit us to really protect the poor majorities of this country. Regarding fares, this is a very broad issue. I ask you [words indistinct] is it fair for a person who lives in Las Lomas del Guifarro neighborhood to pay the same as someone who lives in Alemania neighborhood? There was a time when both the multimillionaire and worker paid 12 lempiras to the municipality. Is this fair? This is what we are discussing. The same holds true for water and electricity service. These are issues that are still under discussion, which involve the social justice we have always talked about. The easier thing to do would be to increase prices of basic market basket products and medicines for the defenseless. But we are not going to do that. [Words indistinct] this and many other intervention commissions so that they find out what is happening or happened in such state institutions as Cohdefor [Honduran Forest Development Corporation], Conadi [National Investment Corporation], and Banasupro [National Supply Agency for Basic Products]. In an article for EL HERALDO, I called what happened in the said companies the blank books. The people should know what happened in each of these institutions. [Boza] Mr. President, Ramuel [name indistinct] Boza of Radio Tegucigalpa. I want to know if you [words indistinct] governments have had a difficult situation regarding the increase in urban transportation fares, which have been maintained. Will you allow an increase in transportation fares that will affect the Honduran people, especially in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula? On the other hand, pharmacists have said they have no alternative but to increase the price of medicine because each day the price of the dollar continues to increase with regard to the lempira. These are my two questions, Mr. President. [Reina] Both questions concern the entire population. I will never authorize an increase in the price of medicines or transportation fares, because that can topple a government. That is what made the Venezuelan people explode, when new taxes were implemented. The challenge we have ahead of us is finding ways to increase our revenues quickly without affecting the majority; that is what we are doing. We are intensively seeking those measures, which the economic cabinet will announce at a news conference in due time. [Unidentified reporter] Dr. Reina, public employees are afraid of the possibility of mass dismissals. A few minutes ago, you said that the activists of the PLH must be patient. In this regard, how will your government fill some vacancies without engaging in the famous mass dismissals, on one hand? On the other hand, how far will your government go in the investigation of some transactions made in the past, one of them called the big car [el carrazo] scandal, so that those responsible will be punished and do not escape the arm of the law, as is customary? [Reina] We are going to appoint you to the commission that will investigate this affair. [laughter] We have already appointed a commission that will investigate those cases so that those who looted this country are punished. This is a firm decision by our government. The other thing is a problem. Can we continue to have sinecures in many offices, where 50 percent of the employees don't do anything because they got their jobs thanks to past administrations? We must review this situation and pay them compensation, but there is no money. We are seeking a solution to this situation. We must get the money and keep the employees. We will not fire anyone out of sectarianism. Sectarianism is a vice, it is a disease. A good employee must not be dismissed. How much did the state pay to train that employee? But if he is a sinecure and this phenomenon is widespread, how are we going to advance with such heavy bureaucratic burdens. To me, the most appropriate thing is to evaluate the personnel, respect the abilities of public employees, and apply justice at the bureaucratic level. If someone was dismissed as a result of sectarianism by previous administrations, it is necessary to reinstate that person, provided that he fulfills the requirements of the post. With respect to the big car incident, it is already being investigated. You have already heard statements by the deputy finance minister and he is very committed to solving this issue. [Reporter] In reference to decisions involving the selective military service which I believe will bring relief to our youth, will there be a government commission? What are your intentions in this respect? [Passage indistinct] Do you have any names? [Reina] I still do not have any names. We first have to consult with some of the candidates to see if they agree since they might have to resign afterwards due to lack of time. However, I believe that we must meet with them sometime between today and tomorrow. We will announce the decision afterwards. I thank you for being here today and I am at your disposal.
