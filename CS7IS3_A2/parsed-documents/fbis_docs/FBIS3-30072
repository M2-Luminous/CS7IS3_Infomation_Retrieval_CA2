Speaking to reporters afterward, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said this is the first visit to Thailand by such a high-ranking Mongolian official. He said there were broad discussions on political, economic, and social issues between the Thai and Mongolian leaders, who agreed that those issues have progressed well: [Begin Prasong recording, in progress] ...called on our prime minister. They discussed political, economic, social, and trade issues. They agreed that Thai-Mongolian relations have proceeded well and will improve further. He asked us to consider Mongolia's wish to join ASEAN or APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] activities. The prime minister informed him that he has no objection in principle. Because those organizations include other countries, though, they will have to be consulted. On economic and trade issues, both sides agreed to increase the trade volume. Although the two countries are located far away from each other, communication between them is good. If the private sectors of both countries meet, there will be good prospects for greater trade. Thailand offered scholarships for Mongolian students and invited Mongolian monks to study Buddhism in Thailand. A few Mongolian students and monks are already studying here. We offered several scholarships for Mongolian students, particularly in the field of public health. [end recording]
