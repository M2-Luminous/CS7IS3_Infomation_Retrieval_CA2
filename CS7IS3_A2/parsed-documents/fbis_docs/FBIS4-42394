On Tuesday [31 May] Udo Boesch, the Republikaner's federal organization manager, became the second leading member to leave the party within a brief period. In his letter of resignation, which has been obtained by DPA, Boesch justified his break with the Republikaner by pointing out that Chairman Franz Schoenhuber's public distancing from "neo-Nazi ideas" proves to be just empty words in internal party life. Following the resignation of Federal Secretary Martina Rosenberger, Boesch is the second high-ranking Republikaner functionary who publicly refuses to follow Schoenhuber. In his letter of resignation Boesch adds that Schoenhuber is participating "in a masterly way in intrigues that are solely intended to consolidate his own power" instead of showing the will to shape policy. Furthermore, the Republikaner have not taken the step toward a democratic program party, the retired lieutenant colonel wrote to Schoenhuber. After about two years as organization manager, security adviser, and member of the federal election campaign leadership, he had realized that Schoenhuber uses the party only as a "stage for his very own presentation and thus satisfies an almost pathological obsession with the media." On Tuesday [31 May] Boesch told the ZDF [Second German TV Channel] magazine program "Frontal": "I have come to the end of my road -- I do not want to be responsible any further." In the television cast Boesch also accuses the party leadership of not having prevented anti-Semitic agitation.
