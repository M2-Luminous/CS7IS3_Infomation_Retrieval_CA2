You may not find this news relaxing: According to a new Ministry of Health report, the pub-going life is the main reason the average Czech dies earlier than just about anyone else in Europe. According to the report, released Feb. 28, the fatty diet, smoking, excessive drinking, stress and physical lethargy common to most Czechs also cause up to 60 percent of the illnesses and syndromes that kill them prematurely. Environmental hazards and inefficient medical care were each deemed to be 20 percent responsible for the Czechs' short life expectancies. Czech men, on average, live to an age of 68.5 years, and Czech women to 76.1 years. In neighboring Austria, by comparison, the average life expectancy is 74 years for men and 81 for women. In the United States it is 72.3 years for men and 79 for women. Standing outside a central Prague cafeteria where he had just finished off a lunch of boiled pork and mashed potatoes, Milan Novak said he is aware of the statistics, but that they wouldn't necessarily make him change his habits. "Everything is to blame here: the air, the water, the poor hospitals and the food," said the 30-year-old businessman. "But lunch is a break from work, so I'm not going to worry about my health when I'm eating." According to Rudolf Poledne, head of a laboratory conducting arteriosclerosis research at Prague's Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, the biggest problem is the widespread attitude of people like Novak that one's health is largely beyond one's control. "It's easy to blame the environment or the stress caused by your work," said Poledne. "We were taught for years by the totalitarian system that everything can be planned and directed, so people didn't feel responsible for anything, including their own health." Instead, Poledne said, many have simply become accustomed to fatal indulgences. Czechs guzzle more beer than anyone else in the world--more than 150 liters (39.75 gallons) per person every year. The average Czech also smokes around 1,900 cigarettes yearly, down slightly from an all-time high of over 2,100 four years ago. One of the organizations attempting to curb this lethal overconsumption is the National Center for Health Promotion. Zdenek Kucera, the director of the center, said he is developing several programs to educate people about such unhealthy consumption. One campaign, called "Quit to Win," rewards those who stop smoking with chances at $5,000 and a trip to the Canary Islands. Kucera acknowledged that while it seems contradictory for the Czech government to encourage the development of the alcohol and tobacco industries and fund his center at the same time, "similar situations exist in every country. There is a very strong wish to organize educational campaigns, but they are very careful not to violate the overall policy of the cabinet, which is to be as economically liberal as possible." It is unlikely that the government will do much more to encourage people to change their ways. Jan Sorf, director of physical education for the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, said that no one had the funding to maintain, let alone build, public athletic facilities. These initiatives, he said, have to come from volunteer organizations such as the YMCA, or entrepreneurs who have discovered that money can be made from fitness centers and squash courts. So far, economics has proven more successful than government planning in changing unhealthy habits. Researchers have noted that the amount of cholesterol coursing through the arteries of the average Czech has dropped 5 percent since 1988. This is thanks not to education, but to the skyrocketing prices of meat and cheese--a consequence they jokingly refer to as "the Klaus effect," after Czech Prime Minister and economic reformer Vaclav Klaus. It may only be a matter of time until Czechs adopt the Western pursuit of immortality. But at least one believes there also should be room for people to indulge their life-threatening appetites. Back at the cafeteria, Mirslav Bunat, a retired engineer, reported that he had just enjoyed a "fantastic" parek (hot dog). "I think about how unhealthy it is sometimes," he said, "but I still love Czech food. I live in Switzerland now, and you can't get this kind of food there, so when I come back here I eat it all the time."
