As it has already been known, our side resumed the working-level contact for the exchange of North-South special envoys in accordance with the agreements reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, and thus made a series of progress in realizing the envoy exchange. Out of the position to realize the exchange of North-South special envoys at the earliest possible date in a good atmosphere, our side took a magnanimous and momentous step at the sixth working- level contact, taking note of the fact that the South side has expressed understanding of the feasibility of the four just demands our side raised, even though on the whole is short of our expectations. As a result, a bright prospect for the exchange of special envoys was opened for the North and South. Since then, our side again called on the South side at the recent contact to return to the position of reconciliation and unity and accept our side's just proposal on announcing a joint communique. In addition, our side urged that the two sides should wind up the discussion of working procedures and conclude an agreement on the basis of the North-tabled agreement on the exchange of North-South presidential envoys. The reason we insisted on announcing the joint communique is because it would be a chance for the two sides to confirm that special envoys would certainly be exchanged. Thus, this would give hope to the fellow countrymen and mark a turning point for North-South relations. Announcing the joint communique would give an opportunity for the two sides to wind up the discussion of working procedures on the envoy exchange at an early date. At a time when people at home and abroad express concern over the prospect for the envoy exchange, the fact that the North and South, the parties concerned, reaffirm their will for the envoy exchange and agree to exchange special envoys at the earliest possible date would be a good thing, seen from every point of view. If the South side truly wants to exchange special envoys with us, it is reasonable to show its intention by welcoming and responding to our claim on announcing a joint communique regarding the issue of the exchange of special envoys. Nevertheless, the South side repeatedly made the same old remarks again and opposed our side's proposal. It recklessly failed to agree with our proposal without a reasonable basis. This proves that it has no will for the exchange of special envoys, and that for it to come forth to the working-level delegates' contact for the exchange of special envoys is only to give the impression it is holding talks with the North. Even in the discussion of the working procedures, the South side insisted on an unreasonable position, and did not accept principle and important issues such as the issue of defending the principle of national independence, of concluding the method for the fatherland's reunification, and of promoting great national unity, which is related to the duties of the special envoys. The principle and important issues that our side put forth in connection with the duties of the special envoys of both sides all embody the three principles of the fatherland's reunification and guarantee the improvement of North-South relations. The fact the South side did not accept the issue of defending the national independence shows that it will continue to prevent the fatherland's reunification by currying favor with outside forces. Also, not accepting the issue of concluding the method for the fatherland's reunification means to continue division. Moreover, opposing the issue of promoting great national unity is to continue to move toward the road of confrontation, not national reconciliation and unity. On 15 March, a fellow called the puppet minister of the National Unification Board officially babbled that the working-level delegates' contact would end in failure. This is by no means a coincidence. Ultimately, this clearly shows that the South Korean authorities do not have the intention to exchange special envoys nor the will to resolve the fatherland's reunification issue through the method of dialogue and negotiations. The dark intention of the South side not accepting our principle issue was to delay the exchange of special envoys so as to cast a shadow in the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and plot to harm the fellow countrymen. The people of the world came to correctly know who wants to achieve the exchange of special envoys and who opposes it, through the betrayal act of the South side, which is moving backward when the exchange of special envoys is at an important occasion of being realized. It will be good for the South side to contemplate over the grave consequence the maneuver to delay the exchange of special envoys will bring about. Having regrets is always too late. The South side must not play a double game to prevent the exchange of special envoys, but should sincerely come forth at the next contact. We will carefully watch over the South side's attitude.
