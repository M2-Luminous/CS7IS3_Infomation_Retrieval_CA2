Following the failed attempt to register the party with the Czech Interior Ministry, he indicated in the press his suspicion of deliberate obstruction on the part of the ministry. [Verner] Do you really believe that it is someone's deliberate wish not to register your party? [Hulik] I do not expect a direct intention in this sense. The registration has probably failed because of the character of our statutes that are extraordinary, creative, and not copied from other political entities. In particular, it is our way of election and appointment. The ministry asked for more details. We will comply. [Verner] As far as I know, you also had applications that were not completely filled out and that does not correspond to the registration rules.... [Hulik] We gathered 1,000 signatures in two days. After our appeal, the people came again to add the missing data; so, that is all in order. [Verner] Are the secrets regarding the program objectives of the DEU necessary? [Hulik] We have published them in outline. Regarding detailed information, certain individual actions--for instance, our forged statutes are circulating in Prague--force us to be careful. [Verner] Whose individual actions? [Hulik] Messrs. Kulhavy for the Conservative Party and Samek for the Entrepreneurs and Tradesmen's Party, for example, who expected that they would join the DEU in some official capacity. They were bringing radicalism into our program; they founded a shadow government, and, when they did not meet with understanding, they began to set up the so-called New Right Wing. [Verner] What about the relationship between the DEU and the KAN [Club of Nonaligned Activists]? [Hulik] If you have the leadership of the KAN in mind, their relations toward us are based on sad envy. They reproach us for stealing the program, the principles of which existed long before KAN; they are general and cannot be the property of a single political party.
