FR940928-2-00150 FR940928-2-00079 Federal Highway Administration Environmental Impact Statement: Clatsop County, Oregon agency: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of intent. summary: The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for a proposed highway project in Clatsop County, Oregon. The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) prepared and published a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) in September 1993 and held a Public Hearing in October 1993. Originally, this project was planned for Access Oregon Highway funding. Because of an unanticipated shortage of State funds, ODOT is now requesting federal-aid participation in the proposed project. As a result, FHWA is reviewing the DEIS, public hearing testimony and comments received on the DEIS to determine if all federal requirements have been met to allow us to approve the DEIS for circulation in accordance with requirements in 23 CFR 771. for further information contact: Elton Chang, Environmental Engineer, Federal Highway Administration, Equitable Center, Suite 100, 530 Center Street NE., Salem, Oregon 97301, Telephone (503) 399&hyph;5749, FAX (503) 399&hyph;5838. supplementary information: The FHWA is currently reviewing the DEIS, public hearing testimony and written comments. FHWA, in cooperation with the ODOT, will prepare a Draft 4(f) evaluation which will accompany the DEIS. FHWA and ODOT will determine whether a supplemental environmental document is necessary and prepare a Final Environmental Impact Statement for the project. The proposed project would realign about a 9.66 kilometer (6 mile) segment of the Lower Columbia River Highway (US 30) from the John Day River Bridge, over new alignment through the Clatsop State Forest, to connect with the existing Nehalem Highway (OR 202) at Williamsport Road, and then to join US 101 on the west side of Astoria near the north end of the Youngs Bay bridge. The improvements would include an interchange at the existing Williamsport Road-Nehalem Highway intersection, upgrading of the US 101/OR 202 intersection, improving access to the Port of Astoria, and widening of the existing OR 202 and US 101 segments of the project. The purpose of the proposed project is to provide an improved and safe route for traffic to and from the Port of Astoria, to reduce the truck traffic, improve safety and overall congestion in downtown Astoria, and provide a second east-west route in and out of Astoria. The No-Build and the one Build Alternative are under consideration. The ODOT DEIS indicates that approximately 31.6 hectares (78 acres) of additional right-of-way would be required for the project. This includes 23.1 ha (57 acres) of forest land, 3.2 ha (8 acres) of residential land, 2.8 ha (7 acres) of undeveloped land, and 2.4 ha (6 acres) of various other uses. The project would displace an estimated 35&hyph;40 residences in which about 75&hyph;90 persons lived in late 1992. In addition, it would displace approximately 6 businesses which employ about 25 workers. The project will affect and use right-of-way from four historic properties. It is estimated that the project may impact about 6.5 ha (16 acres) of wetlands. Threatened and endangered species have been identified in the project corridor as well as a great blue heron rookery and habitat used by Roosevelt elk and blacktail deer. Information describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate federal, state, and local agencies. Public meetings and a public hearing have been held on the proposed project. Additional public meetings will be held if needed. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.
