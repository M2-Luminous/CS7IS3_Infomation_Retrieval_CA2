FR941130-0-00134 FR941130-0-00020 The ANPRM solicited comment on whether the rule should include procedures to protect the tour operator from having to refund the total tour price to participants who don't receive promised admission to an ``event'' like a welcoming cocktail party. Most commenters who addressed this issue were opposed to requiring a refund of the entire tour price in these circumstances. Some suggested that participants so affected simply be entitled to a refund of the value of that ancillary event. Two commenters urged that a tour operator's failure to deliver admission to ancillary events that are integral to the experience for which the tour was organized (e.g., the Tournament of Roses parade on a Rose Bowl tour) should entitle the participant to a refund of the total tour price. In raising this issue in the ANPRM, the Department had intended to focus on the situation of a tour that would not normally be thought of as a Special Event Tour but which held out admission to an ``event'' as one of its features, e.g., a welcoming cocktail party on a 5-day package to the Bahamas. If the definition of ``special event'' had been broad, we were concerned that the rule might have the effect of requiring refunds of the entire price on such tours after failure to deliver a relatively minor and low-value component. The comments on the ANPRM shed light on another issue: multiple ``events'' on a true Special Event Tour. We stated in the NPRM that we agreed with the commenters that failure to deliver a relatively minor feature should not result in a refund of the total tour price. We also felt that this rule should be limited to tours that are organized around an event, not to events that occur in the normal course of the typical vacation tour. Accordingly, in the NPRM we limited the scope of the proposed rule in two ways. First, there was a definition of ``Special Event Tour'' in proposed ยง381.5 which was broad yet specific; it limited the applicability of the rule to tours to sporting, social, religious, educational, cultural, political or other event of a special nature and limited duration, which exist for reasons apart from the tour itself. Second, the ``money back guarantee'' in proposed ยง381.11 would apply only to the primary event for which a Special Event Tour is organized. In the ANPRM, the Department solicited comment on whether the rule should ban last-minute or post-departure price increases, something which occurred on certain tours to the 1994 Rose Bowl. The great majority of the comments on this subject favored banning such increases. Some commenters said no price increase should be permitted unless the tour operator has reserved this right in writing and allows participants to cancel and receive a full refund in the event of a price increase. We stated in the NPRM that we had decided to incorporate into the proposed rule the price increase provisions of the Department's Public Charter rule (14 CFR 380.33). While it is not our intent in this proceeding to address all potential sources of consumer harm on Special Event Tours, the issue of price increases is directly related to the issue of ticket availability. Almost any event ticket is procurable if the price is right; if we do not regulate price increases in the Special Event Tour rule, tour operators would always be able to acquire event tickets at greatly inflated prices and then simply increase the price to the participant to cover it. Since a ticket has been offered in this situation, the ``money back guarantee'' would not come into play. The proposed provisions on price increases, modeled on similar provisions in the charter rule, state that if a given participant is assessed price increases for the tour that in the aggregate are more than 10 percent above his or her original tour price, the participant shall have the right to cancel and receive a full refund (i.e., no cancellation penalties would apply). No price increases in any amount would be permitted less than 5 days before departure (as opposed to 10 days in the charter rule, recognizing the fact that Special Event Tours often have shorter lead times than the typical charter). This would eliminate both last-minute and post-departure price hikes. Finally, proposed ยง381.11 specifies that the promised event ticket must be furnished at the price that was agreed to before departure or else the operator is subject to the ``money back guarantee'' just as if he had not provided the ticket at all. In its comments on the ANPRM the NHL stated that for events with short lead times such as the Stanley Cup playoffs, the rule should permit tours on which participants are required to agree to purchase event tickets at the yet-unknown face price plus a service fee, as long as the consumer is given prominent notice of this fact. We replied in the NPRM that as an initial matter, a tour would not be covered under this rule at all if the event ticket were simply held out as an option rather than as a mandatory feature. However, where the participant must agree to buy the event ticket, such tours are clearly Special Event Tours since the tour operator is representing that admission to the event is included in the tour (even if the price of that admission is not yet known and consequently any price that is advertised for that tour is not the full tour price).
