They Are Scooping Up Our Fish With Their Nets, Taking Advantage of the Fever Russia Is Running: The Public Demands That the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Immediately and Resolutely Put an End to Foreign Fishing Piracy in the Sea of Okhotsk"] [Text] Magadan--For three years now foreign fishermen have played the master in the neutral section of the Sea of Okhotsk. Nature has preordained it that the migration routes of schools of pollock in the Sea of Okhotsk run through the "neutral zone." So, the newcomers engage in uncontrolled, quota-free fishing here, undercutting the fishing resources of the entire basin. How did last year end there? Alas, it is hardly reassuring. Dozens of foreign supertrawlers continue to operate in the "neutral zone." According to estimates by scientists, they caught about 1 million tonnes of pollock last year. The Russian Government has taken some measures to solve the problem. Two conferences with the participation of all interested parties have been convened. Unfortunately, their effectiveness proved to be low. South Korea was the only one to promise to completely discontinue operations in neutral waters and kept its word, having been granted in return the right to catch 32,000 tonnes of pollock in our zone. Undoubtedly, this is a more civilized way to settle issues in dispute. The position of the South Koreans was strongly influenced by their participation in many contracts with Russians which could otherwise have been canceled. We do not have such contracts with other countries, hence the consequences. At first, the Poles announced that they will cut back operations by 25 percent, but did not withdraw a single vessel. Our specialists believe that their promise is hollow, all the more so because at the second meeting the Polish side did not even mention it. The Chinese refused to discuss this issue at all. Fishermen from these two countries still constitute the shock "poaching" force. The moratorium on fishing in the neutral section of the Sea of Okhotsk announced by Russia accomplished nothing. Our fishermen withdrew, but foreigners do not give a damn about the Russian moratorium. After all, present-day Russia is neither the USSR nor America, which, after detecting a threat to the pollock population in the Bering Sea, instantly found ways to influence Poland, China, and Korea. As a result, their moratorium is very strictly complied with, and vessels which operated in the "neutral zone" of the Bering Sea have migrated to the Sea of Okhotsk, thus augmenting the already powerful pressure on it. At present 30-35 Polish trawlers and 15-20 Chinese trawlers continuously operate in the ill-fated region. Vessels flying the Panamanian flag have appeared. A supertrawler from the Baltic area fished for a period of time, but left quickly. As far as the Ukrainian refrigerator ships the Bukhta Omega and the Sevastopolskaya Bukhta are concerned, they have apparently been coming here for a long time. They pick up fish from the Poles and take it to the West. Perhaps this is way Ukraine is "thanking" Russia for the oil and gas delivered to it. Recently, even an American tanker was spotted here, which is also symbolic because previously the Americans behaved properly. Fishing inspectorate organs closely monitor the situation in the Sea of Okhotsk. Last year four specialized fishing-inspection vessels of the Commodore class took turns spending about 200 days in the neutral waters. Surveillance was also conducted from the air. Fifteen violations of the Russian economic zone were detected; five Polish and Chinese vessels were seized. In the process, fishing inspectors note that violators are aware of our weakness and for this reason are "raiding" the economic zone increasingly often and behaving ever more arrogantly. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA has reported on the case of the Chinese trawler Geng Hai in which its crew, which was caught red-handed, refused to proceed to a Russian port. A patrol ship of the border guard that was called in to assist arrived at the site of the event as late as the sixth day: Fuel had to be collected from the vessels of the entire brigade for the patrol ship to be able to put out to sea. The episode with the Polish supertrawler Amaryl proved even more instructive. Having seen that the unarmed fishing inspectors were getting no reinforcement from the border guard, the captain reported this to his company, and got the following response: "The fishing inspectors shall be put on a skiff and sent to their vessel, with safety rules observed," which was done immediately. There is food for thought for the government here. If it is not in a position to provide fuel for the ships of the border guard, which has so far been officially responsible for protecting the economic zone, should we perhaps take the path that the Americans and the Japanese took and arm the fishing inspectorate, granting it the relevant status? After all, it is clear that emergency measures must be taken; otherwise, poachers will very soon begin to penetrate not only the economic zone but the territorial waters of Russia. Funding for the services of the fishing inspectorate is still the weak element. Under our conditions, a combination of seaborne and airborne surveillance in which airborne observers quickly pass on the coordinates of violators to inspectorate vessels is the most efficient. However, the number of aircraft sorties fell by a factor of 10 last year compared to 1990 because of lack of funds. The Russian Federation Committee on Fishing allocated for these purposes insignificant fishing quotas, with the fish earmarked for sale. These actions caused furious criticism from the Ministry of Ecology and its local divisions which, instead of coordinating efforts to protect natural resources, continue the course of harsh confrontation with the Committee on Fishing. Could the fact that the allocation of such quotas has now been approved by the head of the government bring the prolonged debate to closure now? Incidentally, the quotas for "keeping up the pants" of the fishing inspectorate and fisheries research do not cause unfavorable emotions among fish producers. They fully understand that by yielding a little, they stand to win much more from the actions of these services. In general, resolution of the fishing piracy issue comes down to the question of whether Russia will be a strong state which nearby and faraway neighbors will begin to reckon with. For now, the reverse process is underway here.
