In a statement after the meeting, which took place at the Foreign Ministry, Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis said that Arsenis' visit shows that the political decisions of the Greek and Cypriot governments are being implemented. Arsenis did not make a statement. This morning the Greek minister of national defense visited the National Guard General Staff [YEEF], where with Cypriot Defense Minister Konstandinos Iliadhis, he chaired a meeting. The meeting was attended by the Greek ambassador, members of Arsenis' entourage, the National Guard chief and high-ranking officers of the National Guard. Before the meeting at the YEEF, Arsenis and Iliadhis had a private meeting. Speaking at the Defense Ministry, Arsenis stressed that the joint defense doctrine is not new. He said that it was used even by Kimon [ancient Greek general] and this proves that even in the days of the trireme Hellenism was projected in the creation of Greek wonders. He also said that today, with modern means of communications, distance has disappeared and we are close, very close. Hellenism's soul, he stressed, is one. Arsenis said that serious preparations have been made, and expressed the conviction that by the end of the day we will achieve everything we desire.
