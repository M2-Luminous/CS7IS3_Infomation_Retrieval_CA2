FR940304-1-00159 FR940304-1-00014 Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO 2 reduction would be 39 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of CO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by powerplants in the United States is 0.09 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;5, the reductions are 48 million tons; 56 million tons; 65 million tons; and 71 million tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.12 percent. Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 12.74 million barrels over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2&hyph;5, the reductions in oil imports are estimated to be 21.33, 32.68, 51.88, and 63.07 million barrels, respectively. 5. Conclusion Conventional ovens . Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard level 5 for amended conventional oven standards. Of the standard levels analyzed, level 5 will save the most energy (3.88 quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the Department assumes that all conventional ovens will not have an oven door window and will incorporate improved door seals, reduced venting, reflective surfaces, increased and improved insulation, convection and an oven separator, and reduced thermal mass and conduction losses. Additionally, electric ovens would be biradiant, and gas ovens would incorporate an electronic ignition. However, the payback at this standard level of 18.9 years and 15.7 years for the gas and electric representative classes is roughly equal to the 19-year product life and ranges up to 55 years for other classes. At this standard level, all classes have increased life-cycle costs. The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 5 for conventional ovens outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level. After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for the conventional oven portion of kitchen ranges and ovens with standard level 4 for conventional ovens. The Department concludes that standard level 4 for conventional ovens saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically feasible and economically justified. There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. During the period 1996&hyph;2030, these savings are calculated to be 2.69 quads of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on the environment by reducing the emissions of NO 2 and SO 2 by 287,000 tons and 239,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 0.15 and 0.12 percent, respectively, by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce emissions of CO 2 by 187 million tons, or 0.20 percent, over the forecast period. The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The consumer payback of this standard level is 7.5 years and 4.9 years for the representative gas and electric classes, respectively, with a payback no higher than 10.4 years, or roughly half of the 19-year product life, for any class. This standard has the lowest life-cycle cost for the electric representative class and is expected to result in a reduction in life-cycle cost of approximately $53 for that class. Life-cycle cost savings are $26 for the gas representative class and are positive for all other classes. Additionally, the standard is expected to have almost no impact on the prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of 8.6 percent. Since this standard does not involve substantial redesign or retooling, the Department expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller competitors.
