While no real progress was made, there was evidence of a final burst of speed down the homestretch. "Now we are starting to move! It has taken a long time to obtain the EU's feedback on agriculture, for one thing. Now we know a little bit more about its negotiating positions, although, in the case of agriculture, it is couched in very general terms. Still, the EU understands the need for having northern agriculture and for transitional arrangements. What form these arrangements will take is something we must tackle in the upcoming negotiations," said Trade Minister Grete Knudsen after her maiden speech yesterday at the EU in Brussels. Nothing new emerged from the positions meeting yesterday. Conventional Norwegian arguments on behalf of our agriculture and foodstuffs industry were repeated. In contrast to the Finns and the Swedes, the Norwegian team has put the best possible interpretation on the EU positions. "What we got today were positions that make it possible for us to begin in much greater earnest to respond to this portion of the negotiations. But it could also be that I approach this with a feminine cunning the others lack," said the trade minister. Knudsen was even able to find loopholes that would make it possible to evade EU farm prices in Norway from day one of membership, a circumstance that Norway has rejected as wholly unacceptable. Knudsen saw the potential for a gradual, product by product reduction of import protections. Nothing Is Forever "A loophole for avoiding price adaptations? That is possibly Norway's opinion, but within the EU there is not a vestige of doubt that we require full compliance on price adaptations from day one," said Theodoros Pangalos, the EU Council chairman and Greece's European minister. But he added philosophically: "Nothing in life is forever. There is no final `yes' or `no.' We have only begun the negotiations." "We are determined to keep to the schedule and work hard in the coming weeks," said Knudsen. "To emphasize crisis at this stage would not be very wise." On 17 February, Norway and the other candidate countries -- Sweden, Finland, and Austria -- will meet for deliberation in Oslo before the next ministerial round with the EU in Brussels on 21 and 22 February. Then there will be some tough, realistic negotiations that will go directly into an uninterrupted "final push" beginning on Friday, 25 February. District Policy An internal EU conflict over what Norway and Finland should be offered in terms of district policy for their northern districts was responsible for the fact that the EU did not have any negotiation posture ready for presentation yesterday. A long night of tug-of-war led to a statement in which the EU nations attempted unsuccessfully to camouflage their discord. The disagreement is chiefly due to the fact that Spain feels that Norway and Finland have been offered too much in the EU negotiation draft paper. Norway will not be treated any less well than the EU nations themselves have been treated, the statement said. Intense Annoyance Yesterday's negotiations left the Finns fuming with annoyance. The Swedes also employed very tough, precise language with the EU ministers. Austria hewed more to the Norwegian position and said that they were optimists. But in head-to-head conversation with colleagues from other applicant nations their tone was quite different. A source in the Swedish negotiations delegation remarked that "this is serious" after the EU had rejected Norrbotten as a "target one area" in district policy terms. The hope is that the EU can consent to the evaluation of other criteria besides just the level of income. "Deeply Concerned" "We are deeply concerned about the EU's negotiation posture on agriculture," said Heikko Haavisto, Finland's foreign affairs minister. The Finns did not receive an offer of a permanent price support arrangement for agriculture, despite their efforts to get it. Both the Finnish and Swedish team admitted that time is beginning to run out, as 1 March is the target date for ending the negotiations. Norway is in a worse position than the other applicant nations and in the corridors of the EU, the talk is increasingly that "the three" -- and that does not include Norway -- may conceivably meet the deadline.
