The representative of the Angolan Embassy in London has expressed concern that more than 20 tanks with artillery pieces on board were for rebel UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] forces. The UNITA rebels are currently waging war to oust the elected government of Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos. On Wednesday customs officials making a routine check of the freighter (Nora Hiren) discovered the arms hidden under tarpaulin. The ship's cargo was declared as farm equipment. The Angolan representative says he will be making a full report to brief the Angolan Government on the situation. A British Foreign Office spokesman says there is no embargo on the export of arms to the Angolan government, but one is in effect on UNITA forces. Officials, however, say it is unclear if the weapons are for UNITA or the Angolan Government army.
