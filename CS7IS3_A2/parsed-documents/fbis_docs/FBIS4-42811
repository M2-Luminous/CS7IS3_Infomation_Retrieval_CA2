[Kohl] It would be a mistake to expect personal friendships to remedy real political problems. But, if the chemistry is right, if you get on with each other right away, if you have walked a common path, and if a personal relationship has developed, everything gets much easier. Then you can say: "Listen, there is no way I will do that. I could not make my people at home understand that." [Diekmann] Who among the heads of state do you count as your friends? [Kohl] Francois Mitterrand of course, and certainly Felipe Gonzalez; also Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton. But there is a number of others as well. [Diekmann] How did French President Mitterrand become your friend? [Kohl] What is important in our relationship is that, like me, Francois Mitterrand tends to break through the rigid framework of protocol. When I am in Paris and the official part is over, we sometimes get away, go for a meal together. To ordinary places, restaurants where students go. We talk to each other on the phone frequently, even if it is not about politics. I will never forget how he immediately called me at the hospital when my son Peter had a serious accident. They called me out of the intensive care unit, because Francois Mitterrand was on the phone next door, comforting me. [Diekmann] What was it like with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is a whole generation younger than you? [Kohl] The ice was broken during our first meeting. I simply told him: Before talking about politics we should talk a little about ourselves, who we are, what our family backgrounds are. He told me about his parents, I told him about mine. My father worked for the inland revenue, we were not wealthy. I paid for most of my university education myself. With Bill Clinton things were very similar. We obviously got along, for, as the official talks ended he went for his mother. And the three of us sat together talking for a long time. In my experience, the relationships with their wives, but also with their mothers, are among the most important things in men's lives. [Diekmann] What was your reaction when Russian President Boris Yeltsin first suggested that you go to the sauna together? [Kohl] We found out on an earlier occasion that we both like going to the sauna. When I was in Moscow last time I did not have much time, I was only passing through. No way did I want to go to the sauna. It was a very, very chilly evening, we met at a chalet near the airport. Boris Yeltsin was already there saying: "Let us go to the sauna right away." I replied: "Just a moment, I am not at all in the mood for that." But he was determined to go. So we went to the sauna, went swimming, and talked about all our affairs. [Diekmann] Boris Yeltsin also visited you at your home at Oggersheim.... [Kohl] In private life it is quite normal to invite colleagues, who are also friends, to your home. In world politics it is the greatest gesture you can make. Boris Yeltsin enjoyed very much seeing what my home country, my home, is like. Boris Yeltsin and I have a very friendly relationship. He is a very sensitive man. The great big frame must not blind you to that. He has a distinct feeling for moods. There is another thing, which also goes for Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin, and Francois Mitterrand: We all like our food, myself maybe most. [Diekmann] Do you sometimes phone up Yeltsin and Clinton even if you do not have any important business to discuss? [Kohl] Yes. It is the same as in private life: When I see that the other person has problems I call them and say: I just wanted to tell you, keep your chin up, I will keep my fingers crossed.... My mother always told us: When people are doing fine you need not go and see them, because then everyone is going there. But it is when they are having problems that you need to go.
