FR940720-2-00101 FR940720-2-00068 Public Service Electric & Gas Company, Docket Nos. 50&hyph;272 and 50&hyph;311, Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Salem County, New Jersey Date of amendment requests: February 18, 1994, as supplemented by letter dated April 6, 1994 for Salem Unit 1; and March 28, 1994 for Salem Unit 2. Description of amendment request: The proposed change to Salem Unit 1 Technical Specifications (TS) replaces the main feedwater control and control bypass valves with the main feedwater stop check valves for the Containment Isolation Function. The proposed change to Salem Unit 2 TS adds a footnote to the 21&hyph;24 BF22 (main feedwater stop check valves) on Table 3.6&hyph;1, ``Containment Isolation valves.'' This note identifies those containment isolation valves that are not subject to 10 CFR 50 Appendix J, Type C leakage testing. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC staff's review is presented below. 1. Do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated. The Salem Unit 1 main feedwater stop check valves provide the same isolation function presently accomplished by the main feedwater control and control bypass valves, without reliance on an actuation signal. Positive closure is assured during all postulated accident scenarios, through remote-manual controls in the main control room. These valves satisfy the requirements of GDC 57 for Containment Isolation. A previous amendment request for Salem Unit 2 neglected to designate the main feedwater stop check valves as exempt from Type C leakage testing. That request was subsequently approved as Salem Unit 2 Amendment 128. The amended Technical Specifications are now inconsistent with the Salem Updated Final Safety Analysis Report, which correctly shows that these valves are exempt from Type C leakage testing. Valve functionality and operation are not affected by this change. Therefore, it may be concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. Do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The Salem Unit 1 main feedwater stop check valves were originally intended to perform the Containment Isolation Function. The only changes to the original plant design were the addition of motor operators and the upgrading of associated controls to safety-related. These changes bring the stop check valves into compliances with GDC 57 requirements, and ensure positive valve closure during all postulated accident scenarios. As stated above, a previous amendment request for Salem Unit 2 neglected to designate the main feedwater stop check valves as exempt from Type C leakage testing. The Salem Updated Final Safety Analysis Report correctly shows that these valves are exempt from Type C leakage testing. Valve functionality and operation are not affected by these changes. The changes do not involve modifications to plant equipment or operation. Therefore, no new or different accident can be created by these changes. 3. Do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Check valves provide inherent isolation from reverse flow conditions. Stop check valves provide increased safety due to the positive closure feature. Motor operators with remote-manual closure capability, allow positive closure from the main control room during all postulated accident scenarios. These features ensure that an adequate margin of safety is maintained. Additionally, feedwater isolation, utilizing the main feedwater control and control bypass valves, occurs through Reactor Trip and/or Engineered Safety Features actuation. This feature is unaffected by the proposed changes and redundant to the stop check valves for Containment Isolation. There are no modifications to plant equipment or operation involved. Feedwater system operation during normal and accident conditions remains the same. Therefore, it may be concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration.
