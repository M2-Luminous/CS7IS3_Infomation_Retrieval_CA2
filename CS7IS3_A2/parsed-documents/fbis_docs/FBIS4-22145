Sergiyevskiy, candidate of military sciences] [Text] A result of rapid scientific and technical progress is the involvement of increasingly new fields of scientific knowledge in improving weapons. These fields include those which earlier had practically no military application. Thus, research in the field of the environment has intensified foreign armies recently. An important goal in improving weapons and military equipment is to make them independent of climate and weather conditions, time of day, or time of year. The effectiveness of automated target search and identification systems and high-precision weapons, which have become widespread, depends on proper consideration of the characteristics of the environment and increases the importance of this factor for success in conducting combat operations. Decreasing the visibility of objects in the primary physical fields entails studying the fine, previously insignificant mechanisms of their interaction with the environment -- characteristics of the vapor and turbulence trail in the atmosphere and changes in its chemical and physical properties on the flight route of airborne vehicles, characteristics of the fine structure of surface wave action of an ocean wave and its temperature characteristics, background noise of the ocean and its bioluminescence, characteristics of passage of acoustic signals in sediment layers of the ocean bed and shelf, and so forth. Work in these directions should lead to the creation of new, nontraditional systems for detecting low-observable and camouflaged objects. Knowing the characteristics of the environment makes it possible to create secretive jamming of signal and electro-optical intelligence gathering, communications, navigation, and weapons guidance equipment that is perceived as the effect of natural geophysical factors. Promising directions include the use of artificial or natural phenomena as elements of military systems. Thus, the property of the ionosphere to reflect a radio wave of a certain band has found application for organizing long-range HF communications and over-the-horizon detection. Nonuniformity of the troposphere also plays an important role. The task of using artificially created disturbed areas in the ionosphere for military purposes is on the agenda. Such areas with an increased concentration of electrons could serve as sort of mirrors that can be used to increase the range of reconnaissance, communications, and electronic warfare. The area of ionosphere excited by an electromagnetic field of an HF band on two nearby frequencies can be a very effective source of radio waves of a band of extremely low frequencies (1-20 Hz) necessary for communicating with submerged submarines. Other artificially modified areas of the earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere -- for example, artificial northern lights -- are also promising for electronic warfare. The importance of military applications of astronomy has increased again. The U.S. Air Force is studying, on a conceptual level, a system of navigation-time support using radio-frequency emission of quasars. In 1990, environmental research in the interests of optimizing the characteristics and methods of combat employment of means of warfare (weapon system environics) was recognized for the first time as a "critical military technology" of the U.S. Department of Defense. It became one of 20 (later 21) such technologies and was given the name "Weapon System Environment." Thus, the importance of this research was noted for achieving long-term goals of U.S. military-technical policy and its ability to radically (three-fold or more) improve the functional characteristics of weapons systems. With the adoption of the new "national defense" policy in 1992 and the new principles of creating weapons and military equipment, changes were made to the methodology of structuring and evaluating advanced military technologies. The latter began to be called "key" technologies. The new list includes 11 such technologies, but more capacious ones, since each combines three to five "critical technologies." "Weapon System Environment" was included on that list without changes, having a high priority for all potential areas of scientific and technical breakthrough.[.sup]1[/] In connection with the increase in the sensitivity of each new generation of sensors, weapon systems and methods of their combat employment increasingly depend on accurate knowledge of the conditions of the environment (weather, time of year, terrain relief). Bringing to light the dependence and potential opportunities for more effective use of armament on these conditions will help accomplish the task of optimizing the specifications and performance characteristics of existing and new systems. Elements of the technology include a whole network of remote sensors with a wide field of view and high resolution and new systems for obtaining information. The technology of taking into account the properties of the environment of weapons employment differs from other "key technologies" by the fact that, as a rule, it does not require development of special equipment. Its inclusion on the list of priority military scientific research and development is the result of the fact that it is necessary for the selection, development, and employment of preferable weapon systems when accomplishing such tasks as antisubmarine defense, battlefield reconnaissance, communications, and others. The basic directions of development of this technology include: Forecasting the condition of the atmosphere, modeling ocean conditions, underwater acoustics, environment scenarios, and remote sounding. The importance of the environment in employing weapons and military equipment should increase for three main reasons: A future military conflict will not be long -- success in the first battle may be decisive; countering quiet enemy submarines and stealth aircraft and missiles requires the most accurate information about the environment; low-intensity local conflicts increase the demand for information about the environment on a real-time basis. Modeling shows that using reliable information about the environment will make it possible to increase the probability of acoustic detection of submarines by 30-40 percent, the range of first detection by 20-80 percent, and the duration of maintaining contact with the submarine by 20-40 percent. This will be a decisive factor for repelling an attack by low-noise enemy submarines and restoring the level of superiority achieved by the United States in antisubmarine warfare. Modern high-precision weapons demonstrate an unacceptably high level of false actuations during testing in various meteorological conditions. Consideration of environmental factors already in the weapon designing stage may significantly decrease this shortcoming. Electromagnetic disturbances of the ionosphere cause disruptions in work and errors in target coordinates determined by over-the-horizon radars. They cause disruptions in communications (especially HF communications in high latitudes) and also decrease the probability of detecting stealth targets (especially at night). At the same time, artificial changing of the parameters of the ionosphere and its modification (creating local areas with an increased degree of ionization) can be used to increase the range of communications and over-the-horizon detection and position finding, and increase the range of signals intelligence and electronic intelligence collection and conducting electronic warfare. Disturbances of the ionosphere also affect the work of magnetometric instruments for submarine search and magnetic sensors for minesweepers. Assigning targets and planning missions, including selecting weapon systems and tactics, to a large degree depend on the condition of the environment in which the systems will be used. Methods of weather forecasting were developed to evaluate target signatures, background signatures, and atmospheric effects. The information obtained enables a tactical echelon commander to select the weapon system and tactics of engaging a target in the expected weather conditions. Forecasting the State of the Atmosphere. The physical processes occurring in the mesosphere at altitudes of 500-800 km have generally been studied well enough to begin creating forecasting systems designed for supporting tactical decisions about the combat employment of weapon systems. Experiments on modeling atmospheric processes on the scale of a combat operations area confirm the sufficiency of computer capacities and numerical methods for obtaining the data necessary for developing forecast models. It is planned to develop models of the atmosphere on a tactical scale with high resolution in order to combine data obtained in an individual combat operations area with regional and global data. This will provide tactical echelon commanders with forecasts of weather conditions on the battlefield for a period of three to 48 hours. Highly accurate forecasts of precipitation and visibility conditions and propagation of IR-band emissions will be combined directly with terrain relief models, which will make it possible to compile forecasts of mobility conditions in the interests of tactical planning, forecasts of infrared, visual, and electro-optical signatures of possible targets, and also the condition of the background for optimum selection of weapon systems. Modeling of Ocean Conditions and Underwater Acoustics. Rapid progress is observed in the development of models of ocean structures and circulation of its masses, which, however, is significantly complicated by the huge expanses and the need to have available means of collecting data about the underwater and surface situation. Hydroacoustics comprises the bulk of modeling of ocean processes, the purpose of which is the successful creation and employment of means of observing the underwater situation, combat weapon systems, and countermeasures that are part of antisubmarine warfare [ASW] systems. The missions accomplished by this technology include increasing the effectiveness of detecting, determining the location, and tracking enemy submarines possessing high technical characteristics. In doing so, main efforts are concentrated on developing systems of active sensors, systems designed for use in the Arctic, and seismic sensors. Models of acoustic beam dispersion and reverberation are the main components of active systems associated with hydroacoustics. They are to support both multipositional hydroacoustic systems of warship groups and low-frequency active acoustic complexes. Determining the characteristics of directed acoustic vibrations in the ocean with a high resolution is of great importance for the functioning of high-precision active and passive hydroacoustic systems. New methods of registering data about large expanses and dynamic statistics are being used in developing modern hydroacoustic systems. Environment Scenarios. Measurements and modeling of dynamic electromagnetic and seismoacoustic processes taking place on the earth's surface and in the layer of atmosphere adjacent to it make it possible to simulate the real situation, which is necessary for evaluation of the characteristics of prototypes of guided weapon systems and automatic target identification. Simulation makes it possible in the development stage, based on a small amount of experimental data, to formulate additional requirements for weapons systems and possible scenarios of their use. Remote Sounding. Today, main efforts in the area of remote sounding are concentrated on studying the changes in individual parameters of the environment (for example, wind velocity and direction, temperature, and humidity) using lidars and radars, as well as such passive sensors as infrared devices. Underwater sensors that do not generate a target image make it possible to obtain additional information necessary for developing and supporting the operations of future weapon systems. However, until acoustic technology is successfully used, the effect of the environment on propagation of acoustic waves and the "noise-to-signal" ratio must be studied. The "key technology" in question relates virtually to all aspects of the U.S. Defense Department's investment strategy, since all armament and combat operations with its employment depend on factors of the environment. It has been noted repeatedly that systems designed without taking into account the conditions of their employment have demonstrated major shortcomings. Today, the following major programs are being implemented within the framework of the "Weapon System Environment" technology: --supporting studies of acoustic factors of the environment in the interests of antisubmarine warfare (obtaining more complete operational and design data for close and long-range acoustic surveillance systems); --forecasting the acoustic situation (improving acoustic tactical and technical characteristics of ASW systems based on forecast models of the ocean state); --forecasting the interaction of the atmosphere with the ocean (improving weather forecasting at sea by recording data about the mutual effect of these means); --developing new shipborne equipment designed to collect and disseminate data about the state of the atmosphere and ocean; --developing tactical-level auxiliary weather support systems (increasing the capabilities of individual weather stations thanks to a more complete combination of regional data with data coming in from central institutions in accordance with developed forecasting models). Navy systems being developed in accordance with these programs include a highly sensitive hydroacoustic antenna array and an active low-frequency hydroacoustic system for antisubmarine warfare. Data about the atmosphere, space, and the earth's surface are taken into account when creating automatic target identification devices and high-precision weapons for the U.S. Army and Air Force (appropriations in the amount of about $100 are million planned for them in the next few years), and also in developments within the framework of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization under plans for deployment of the first-phase ABM system. To ensure successful collection of data from many sensors and expansion of the capabilities for making independent decisions, consideration of environment factors in the early stages of designing these devices and optimization and study of the results of their testing take on special importance. American specialists are developing a weather station for providing tactical echelon commanders forecasts and information making it easier to plan combat operations and select the appropriate weapon systems. When they enter service, models of weather forecasts in the combat operations areas for a period of three to 48 hours will be used. They are necessary for taking into account weather factors during daily planning of combat activities. These stations will operate in various command and control echelons and be operated by subunits and meteorology specialists from the Air Force. The Defense Department is cooperating closely with other U.S. government departments in developing this technology. The National Agency for Meteorology and Oceanology bears primary responsibility for conducting observations and disseminating weather reports and weather forecasts in the United States. It also finances the program for creating a prototype of a regional meteorological system designed for studying environment factors in the areas of armed conflicts. Studies of atmospheric and oceanic processes are being conducted under the aegis of NASA, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Agriculture (Forest Service). NASA and the National Science Foundation organize limited oceanographic research, and the NASA program in the area of remote sounding evokes much interest in the U.S. Defense Department. Scientific research and development in industry is quite limited in nature and is basically concentrated on construction and monitoring of polluted environment. It should be noted that the technology base of means of monitoring the atmosphere and ocean in the United States is basically dependent on federal appropriations. For example, investments of industrial firms in independent research and development on geophysics are less than five percent of the appropriations allotted to the Air Force for this purpose. (By comparison, appropriations of firms for research and development in the area of electronics exceed 500 percent of the level of similar appropriations to the Air Force). Agreements concluded by the United States with NATO and other western countries are normal in environmental research. The global nature of the atmosphere and oceans predetermines the need for international cooperation. For example, there is an agreement with the FRG on interpretation of synthetic aperture radar signals reflected from the sea surface. The experience gained makes it possible to understand the essence and build a model of complex conditions of a tactical situation and its dynamics. Today, scientific research and development being conducted in other countries is aimed at accomplishing the following tasks: Underwater acoustic research, primarily associated with collecting bathymetric data; accurate weather forecasts for individual regions; effective integration of remote sounding data; improved modeling and simulation of the dynamics of environmental conditions. The European Center for Medium-Term Weather Forecasts is the world's most authoritative institution providing highly reliable and accurate weather forecasts for a period of 3 to 5 days. However, little-studied phenomena and subtle changes in the layers of the atmosphere, which are critically important for 3 and 48-hour forecasts, particularly over oceans where data collection is limited, continue to pose a serious problem even for this center. NATO has a large scientific laboratory (La Spezia, Italy) which conducts work in the field of oceanography in the interests of improving antisubmarine defense. In the research that has been conducted, emphasis was placed on antisubmarine defense in shallow-water basins, which is of exceptional importance for NATO allies of the United States. The U.S. Defense Department has an agreement with Canada on exchanging data on atmospheric phenomena. It also cooperates with other NATO countries in conducting full-scale testing of optico-electronic and infrared sensors in various weather conditions. As the role of remote sounding using satellites increases, data collection and processing systems will improve and expand. India, China, Brazil, and other countries are actively developing technologies of various levels in connection with this. Several scientific research groups that are part of the NATO Military Research Committee (especially groups for optics and infrared technology) are forming a potential mechanism for sharing the results of fundamental research on problems of oceanography, the atmosphere, and meteorology. The program of cooperation on technology issues creates conditions for accomplishing a number of tasks associated with underwater systems and radio wave propagation in the atmosphere. The branches of the U.S. Armed Forces are sharing with other friendly countries problems concerning them within the framework of NATO. Main emphasis is on oceanography, underwater acoustics, the effect of the atmosphere on infrared sensors, and radio wave propagation. Programs being carried out by the United States jointly with France and Great Britain are aimed at studying atmospheric electricity and the electromagnetic effect on flying vehicles. Various aspects of base problems of the physics of the atmosphere and functioning of sensors are included in an exchange agreement signed between the U.S. Air Force and NATO and also in a program of cooperation on technology issues.
