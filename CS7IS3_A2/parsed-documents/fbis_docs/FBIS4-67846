Pyongyang, in a telegram sent Wednesday to the UN nuclear watchdog, said it will exchange the fuel rods at the reactor soon and permit IAEA inspectors to monitor the process, according to KBS. North Korea, however, stopped short of mentioning the possibility of complying with nuclear safeguard obligations by accepting additional inspections of its nuclear installations by the IAEA, KBS said. The IAEA is reportedly expected to convey its position on the North Korean offer at an early date, the report said. KBS said that the North Korean proposal seems to aim at breaking the nuclear impasse by making a counterproposal at a time when they are obligated to allow additional international inspections of the radiochemical laboratory. U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry told a press conference Thursday that North Korea is close to removing the spent fuel from the 5,000-kilowatt nuclear reactor, enabling it to extract enough plutonium to make four or five nuclear bombs. Perry pointed to the need to monitor the removal of the fuel, saying, ``We believe it is critical that this operation is supervised by the International Atomic Energy Agency.'' A six-member IAEA inspection team went to North Korea in early March but was denied access to the radiochemical laboratory. The agency said the tests it wanted to carry out at the laboratory were necessary to determine whether Pyongyang has diverted nuclear materials. The IAEA referred the matter on March 22 to the UN Security Council, which issued a presidential statement on March 31 urging North Korea to allow the nuclear watchdog to complete the inspections. North Korea denies western assertions that it is developing a nuclear arsenal, but refuses to allow international inspectors into some of its nuclear facilities.
