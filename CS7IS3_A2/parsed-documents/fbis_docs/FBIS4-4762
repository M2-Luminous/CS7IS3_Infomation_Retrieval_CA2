He made the disclosure after emerging from an hour-long discussion with visiting Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan. The two ministers discussed a wide range of issues in both bilateral and regional aspects. Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong reaffirmed to the Chinese envoy that Thailand would not invite Taiwan to the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) as Thailand strictly followed the "one China policy". "I told the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister that China should not be worried about a report that Taiwan would join the ARF meeting because Taiwan is not regarded as a sovereign state," he said. Thailand is scheduled in July to host the ARF where the six ASEAN countries and their seven dialogue partners, two consultative partners and three observers would talk about regional security issues. China holds a consultative status with ASEAN. During yesterday's talk, Mr Jiaxuan mentioned that China did not think that any economic sanctions against North Korea would solve the problem on the Korean peninsula, a senior foreign minister official said. Mr Jiaxuan earlier in the morning held the annual bilateral meeting with Permanent-Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pracha Khunakasem.
