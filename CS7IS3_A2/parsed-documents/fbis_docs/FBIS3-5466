Speaking before a special meeting of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) at Basel, Switzerland, in which major European central bank heads are participating, Kim said, "Entry barriers will be dismantled to promote competition among financial institutions, apart from minimum established conditions required to ensure the stability of the financial system." Kim said foreign banks will be able to "diversify their presence in Korea, establishing joint-ventures or subsidiaries." He cited two policy tasks which must be tackled successfully in order for Korea to attain the status of a truly advanced economy. One is to promote the efficiency of the Korean economy, especially the financial sector, by a heightened reliance on market mechanisms rather than government initiatives. The other is to participate ever more positively as a responsible member in the concert of nations, he said. "In the light of these realities, there is no viable option for Korea but to press boldly ahead with financial liberalization and the opening of its financial market," he noted. The BOK governor told the BIS special session that business boundaries will be readjusted so as to enhance competition, and increase benefits to clients as well as to mesh with the worldwide trend toward universal banking. He also said the ceiling on foreigners' portfolio investment will be progressively raised and the criteria for the opening branches by foreign securities companies will also be relaxed this year. In addition, Kim made it clear that the extent of foreign exchange liberalization will be broadened in the near future. "Restrictions on the foreign exchange position of banks and the underlying documentation requirements for foreign exchange transactions will be progressively relaxed," he said. Touching upon capital account liberalization, Kim said Korea will take a cautious and gradualistic approach to capital market opening. But he added that Korea has now acquired sufficient confidence to allow the process to move into high gear and it will be further accelerated as the country plans to seek full membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) by 1996. Stressing the most crucial step in liberalizing is to deregulate interest rates, he said the third stage of interest rate deregulation, which will take place in 1996 and will liberalize all deposit interest rates except those on demand deposits, "may well be implemented ahead of schedule as long as financial market and macroeconomic conditions permit." Kim said policy-based loans, which have become an obstacle to indirect control of the money supply as well as to the managerial autonomy of financial institutions, are being progressively pared back. He pointed out that stability is one of the most important prerequisites for Korea's financial market liberalization. "A stability-focused macroeconomic policy is an important element favoring the success of financial liberalization. Liberalization carried out in an unstable macroeconomic environment may well worsen pre-existing instability." In order to maintain macroeconomic stability under financial deregulation, he said, the BOK will make utmost efforts to keep the money supply at a proper level to ensure price stability. In addition, he emphasized the importance of adequate prudential regulations in accordance with the progress of financial liberalization. "It is important for the BOK to induce financial institutions to strengthened their risk management systems and to maintain capital adequacy. In this respect, Korea will apply in full the capital adequacy standards set by the Basel Accord from 1995," he said. The BOK is in broad agreement with the new proposals of the Basel Committee on banking supervision which take into account market risks concerning derivatives transactions and interest rate risks.
