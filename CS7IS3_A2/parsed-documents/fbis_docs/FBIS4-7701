A column of T54 tanks, 130mm guns, light mortars and military trucks loaded with ammunition pulled away from the front line in clouds of black exhaust smoke on the road between Benkovac and Knin, in southern Croatia. Smiling young Serb soldiers sat astride their hardware next to the red, white and blue flags of Krajina, waving the victory sign. Crowds of local people came out to greet them in the town of Kistanje and its neighbouring villages, hailed in return by a loud chorus of honking horns. The withdrawal was supervised by the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) at several control points, in accordance with the Russian-brokered peace accord signed last Wednesday. According to the agreement, which took effect Monday morning, Croatian army forces and secessionist Serbs have until 0700 GMT on Tuesday to withdraw all their heavy weapons from an agreed demarcation line. Mortar and anti-aircraft guns must be withdrawn 10 kilometres (six miles) and artillery and tanks by 20 kilometres (12 miles) although some are to be redeployed at specified locations. At one UN control point on the edges of Benkovac, by 1100 GMT Canadian troops had counted 10 T55 tanks, eight T34s, eight 105mm guns, nine 152mm guns and other weapons. The checkpoint was visited by the commander of the 92nd Serb Brigade of Benkovac, Lieutenant-Colonel Uzelac, and the commander of the Canadian UNPROFOR unit stationed here, Major Andre Lefebvre, who confirmed that the withdrawal was going as planned. They were both mindful of the Croatian offensive of January 22 last year, which broke the first UN-backed ceasefire between the two sides. After repeated demands by Uzelac for confirmation of the Croatian withdrawal, the Canadian commander contacted his counterpart on the other side by radio and reported, "They're at exactly the same point as here." People living in the mountain town of Knin, the capital of the self-proclaimed Krajina republic, said they hoped the ceasefire would bring them peace and better supplies. "Perhaps we'll have chocolate at last for the children," said one young woman in the main street. The leaders of Knin, which wants to join with Serbia proper, refuse to see the military agreement as a political concession to Croat sovereignty as Zagreb seems to think, a senior interior ministry official who wished to remain anonymous told AFP. In Zagreb, UNPROFOR said the troop withdrawal included in the military accord would begin Monday afternoon. Troops from both sides -- at some points only a few metres (yards) apart -- are to withdraw one kilometre (just over half a mile) from the confrontation line, forming a two-kilometer buffer zone to be controlled by UN forces. The buffer zone line was drawn on a series of 35 maps during painstaking negotiations at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb. The overall operation is to be completed by 0700 GMT Friday. The UN Protection Force deputy commander General John MacInnis said last Thursday that the first task, "difficult if not impossible," would be "transforming what was written on the map to precise locations on the ground, the establishment of (...) joint (Serb-Croatian) commissions which will have the task of confirming precisely where those lines of separation are to be." The commissions will also determine the number of Serb and Croatian police who are to be deployed in limited numbers between the two separation lines, said MacInnis, who hinted that the stated deadline might not be met. To enable UNPROFOR troops to move into the buffer zone, the Croatian and Serb separatist adversaries are to provide maps setting out the location of mine fields between the separation lines. They are to clear the mines themselves, under UNPROFOR supervision, removing several thousand mines that have been placed in the zone since the conflict erupted in June 1991.
