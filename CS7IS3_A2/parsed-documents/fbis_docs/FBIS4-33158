In a lengthy commentary entitled "Public Letter to a President" (Clinton), GRANMA said the alleged 20 May message by the U.S. President to Cuba is also a good example of the ignorance of realities that have characterized Cuba's history and its relations with the United States. After highlighting the negative aspects of the significance of 20 May 1902 for Cuba and clarifying the pro-independence ideas of national hero Jose Marti, the author considered it profane to manipulate Marti's figure and name after radio stations that pursue objectives against those for which he fought. Commenting on the White House's position of repeatedly denying visas to nationals who meet all the requirements and, on the contrary, promoting illegal departures, the commentary warns that "cynical and opportunistic" policies always turn against those who create them. "Today, they tighten the blockade to promote emigration; they promote emigration but your Interests Section denies thousands of visas. They deny visas but have no problems receiving those who are able to reach the coasts of Florida in flimsy boats or are able to seize one," the commentary stated. And the commentary asks: "How long do you think this winding circle will last without exploding and turning against you?" For the commentator, when the U.S. middle class, which allowed Clinton to reach the presidency, learns and understands, among other things, that Washington defines its policy toward Cuba following the interests of the meager community of immigrants, the Cuban American Foundation (terrorist group founded by the CIA), the blockade, and 20 May messages will end. According to the article [as published], the hour of honor for the United States will come that day "because that powerful nation, which is trying to starve those who have committed the sole crime of struggling for their ideas and their right to be free and independent into submission, will never be considered complete or just."
