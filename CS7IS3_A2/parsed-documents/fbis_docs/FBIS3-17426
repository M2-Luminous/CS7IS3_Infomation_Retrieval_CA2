The press service of the Russian Navy qualified the incident as "a contact" of two U-boats. Nobody was injured, the armaments and equipment of the submarines are in due order and the radioactive situation is normal, the press service said on Thursday, adding that the subs returned to their base independently. It was earlier reported that the "contact" resulted in "inconsiderable damage" which poses no danger to either the personnel or the environment. A source in the Northern Fleet headquarters told TASS that both subs were submerged when one of them, on her way to the surface, "touched" the other sub. The source described the damage as "minor", adding that both vessels were returning to the base without surfacing.
