The contradictory information about the transit route through Bulgarian territory and the hour at which the train will depart from Ruse prompted us to contact our reporter in Ruse, Natasha Dimitrova. [Begin Dimitrova recording] The UN convoy, which arrived yesterday night at Ruse central train station, departed this morning at 0148. The reason for the delay in the departure was related to 25 wagons being unsealed and the accompanying documents missing. According to the Bulgarian railroad authorities, receiving the convoy in this form from the Romanian colleagues was irregular. After a long dispute and clarifications, the two sides signed a protocol and prior to the departure the equipment was sealed with Romanian seals. No information about the precise amount of missing contents has been published. [end recording]
