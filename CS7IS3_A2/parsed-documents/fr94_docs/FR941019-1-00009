FR941019-1-00009 FR941019-1-00001 Expected Achievement The NRC notes that, based on the available evidence, no undue public risk exists without the promulgation of the rule for shutdown and low-power operations. The proposed rule would strengthen safety by preventing accidents and mitigating accidents, and thereby reduce the likelihood of a core-damage accident and the offsite releases due to loss of a key safety function during shutdown or low-power operations. Significant improvements have already been achieved in this regard through the implementation of the NUMARC guidelines; however, the proposed rule would place a regulatory ``footprint'' on outage safety and codify improvements made by industry to ensure that (1) reductions in risk already achieved are not eroded in the future and (2) consistency and uniform achievement of the safety improvements is realized throughout the industry. The proposed rule would also set minimum standards for all plants and further reduce risk by improving safety in the areas of fire protection for shutdown decay heat removal and effective reactor vessel water level instrumentation for PWRs in midloop operation. Moreover, the overall risk may also be reduced by additional improvements in severe accident management, given the assumption that core damage occurs, whether from an event during an outage or during power operations. Therefore, the proposed rule should be viewed as being in the same accident prevention context as the ATWS rule (10 CFR 50.62) and the station blackout rule (10 CFR 50.63) in that it recognizes, as the other two rules recognize, multiple failure possibilities resulting from common cause effects that should be addressed. Comments Requested Section 50.67(c)(3)(i) of the proposed rule calls for the identification of equipment necessary to (a) make the reactor subcritical or critical in a controlled manner and maintain the reactor subcritical in a shutdown condition, (b) maintain RCS inventory and capability to add makeup water to the reactor vessel, (c) remove decay heat from the reactor, (d) monitor water level in the reactor vessel, and (e) maintain or reestablish containment integrity when the plant is in a shutdown or low-power condition. Further, Section 50.67(c)(3)(ii) of the proposed rule requires licensees to establish controls for the equipment identified such that they will perform their safety function when the plant is in a shutdown or low power condition. The controls must reflect sufficient redundancy in systems, subsystems, components, and features to ensure that, for the onsite electric power system in operation (assuming offsite power is not available), safety functions can be accomplished, assuming a single failure, for all conditions except refueling operations (with water level above the reactor in excess of a lower limit established in applicable technical specifications or plant procedures). Section 50.67(c)(3)(iii) of the proposed rule specifies that the controls required by paragraph (c)(3)(ii) be included in technical specifications limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.36(c)(2) and (3), or plant procedures required by technical specifications administrative controls pursuant to 10 CFR 50.36(c)(5). The NRC would like to receive comments describing the possible alternate methods for equipment controls. Additionally, the current regulatory analysis only addresses LCO and SR changes within the technical specifications, and does not reflect the risk reduction already achieved by industry through voluntary actions. The Commission requests information as to steps that licensees have already taken to reduce risk during shutdown and low-power operations. Finally, the NRC would like to receive comments on the use of probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) information and the calculation of the value of offsite dose (accident consequence) in the cost/benefit analysis.
