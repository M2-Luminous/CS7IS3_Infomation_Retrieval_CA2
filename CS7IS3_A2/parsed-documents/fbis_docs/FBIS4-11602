Vladimir Terceros, one of the leaders, stated that the workers have the right to stage demonstrations in order to get the government to pay more attention to their demands. [Terceros] As we see it, the workers are taking steps to compel the administration to heed their requests. Meanwhile the peasants are also on the move and will stage their own demonstrations because we believe that in a state of law we are entitled to express our opinions and positions, especially since we are enjoying a democracy which is an achievement of Bolivian workers and people, not of the individuals who now claim credit for it without having done anything to bring it about. [Reporter] COB Executive Secretary Oscar Salas asked the government not to pit police and military forces against the workers and to prevent bloodshed. [Salas] The Army must not be pitted at the people, nor should it be allowed to become an instrument of repression of the people. We are asking the Army not to do this. [Reporter] The union leaders are perfectly aware of all the problems that the demonstrations can cause, but they also know that the workers need a sizable salary hike.
