The anticorruption promotion meeting was presided over by Cai Zhulin, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee. Present were more than 1,000 people, including leading comrades Doba, Wang Hanmin, Yao Xiangcheng, Huanjue Cenam, Han Yingxuan, La Bingli, Bai Ma, Liu Guanghe, Bainma Dandzin, Han Shenggui, (Ajia Luosang Tudan), (Ma Jinxiao), and (Hu Decai), as well as cadres from organs directly under the provincial authorities. During the meeting, the participants were briefed on the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and on the important speech by Comrade Jiang Zemin on the anticorruption operation. On behalf of the provincial party committee and government, Tian Chengping delivered a speech to mobilize the participants to engage in the operation. He first reviewed the development of the anticorruption operation in the province over the previous period. He pointed out: The anticorruption operation has been progressing in a wholesome manner and has basically met the requirements and expectations of the central authorities and the provincial party committee. Thanks to the concerted efforts by all the people -- from the leadership to the grass-roots level -- all the targets have been fulfilled with regard to the three major tasks for the current stage, as assigned by the central authorities. [passage omitted] Tian Chengping noted: Although some results have been scored in the anticorruption operation in our province, what we have achieved already still falls short of the actual demand and the public's expectations. Therefore, we must view the anticorruption struggle from a strategic point of view and treat it as a long-term, complicated, and arduous task. [passage omitted] Party committees and governments, as well as discipline inspection and supervisory organs at all levels, must further strengthen leadership over the anticorruption operation. While studying and planning their working procedures to deepen the reform, carry on economic construction, and safeguard stability, they must set requirements on the anticorruption operation, map out the plan, and devote great efforts to implementing the plan. [passage omitted] To conclude his speech, Tian Chengping stressed that discipline inspection and supervisory organs, while focusing their attention on specific tasks in the anticorruption operation, must more strictly supervise the enforcement of laws, with the stress on implementing major policy decisions and measures adopted by the state, and thus make sure that democratic centralism is implemented properly, political discipline is enforced strictly, and government orders are carried out smoothly. Whenever problems are discovered, they should give timely guidance, thus ensuring that the anticorruption operation will be developing in a more deep-going, effective, and lasting manner.
