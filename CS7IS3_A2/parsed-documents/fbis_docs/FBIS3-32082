This was announced at the enterprise's annual assessment meeting. To achieve this, the enterprise will increase ship-repair services at tourist hubs in Cayo Largo del Sur and the Colony Hotel, and will charge for any type of assistance to organizations and individuals. The participants in the assessment meeting discussed measures to ensure passenger transportation, which has been effected by the shortage of spare parts, primarily for Cometa hovercrafts. Despite these shortages and additional ferry trips between Batabano and Nueva Gerona, over 1.3 million people were transported by this enterprise in 1993.
