They also underscore the importance of continuing coordination, consultation, and cooperation between Jordan and the PLO. President 'Arafat's working visit yesterday came in the wake of important political developments regarding the various aspects of the Palestine question. This situation necessitated discussing these developments with the Jordanian leadership as is customary in accordance with the firmly-established traditions and characteristics marking the fraternal Jordanian-Palestinian relations. The two political leaderships and peoples are aware of the need to intensify bilateral relations of coordination and cooperation out of their awareness of the difficulties facing the Palestinian action at this stage. These difficulties require entrenching unity of the Arab fold and fostering Jordanian-Palestinian relations in order to face the developments of this stage. No Arab country is more concerned with or affected by the Palestine question than Jordan. Therefore, Jordan has always given Palestine--land, cause, and people--constant attention and sincere effort out of its eagerness to restore rights and lands to their legitimate owners and rescue the shrines, headed by holy Jerusalem, from impending dangers. While watching the current developments of the Palestine question and while witnessing a turning point in the efforts to activate the first article of the Declaration of Principles, we, along with the brothers in Palestine, look forward optimistically to the day, which we hope is imminent, when the occupation ends and our brothers regain their freedom and right to self-determination.
