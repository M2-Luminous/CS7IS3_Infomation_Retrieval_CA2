In this context, military experts suppose that in the very near future the question of separating the Defense Ministry from the General Staff will be raised again. There are also indications that the plan provides for the creation of a powerful ideological body like the old Main Personnel Directorate [Glavpur]. Former presidential military adviser Gen. Volkogonov and Gen. Vladimirov, the Yeltsin team's main analyst on military affairs, are cited among the document's authors. The new plan has been attributed such a high security classification (a stamp saying, "Burn before reading" [as published] that even some members of the Security Council do not know about it yet. Still, signs are that many do not know how current reforms are proceeding in the army either. Even people in the Defense Ministry itself do not know. Generals from the Defense Ministry, who only a month ago were talking about a "phased" reform plan, are now reminiscent of hedgehogs wandering in the fog [reference to a popular animated cartoon]. Now the Defense Ministry discusses the disbandment of the Baltic Fleet, ruling to preserve it. Now they effectively abolish the Air Defense Force, having the public believe that the troops will remain. It is also reported that the main commands will be abolished, for instance the Main Ground Force Command. In brief, as has always been the case with military strategists, "tanks advance by two to three men." Gen. Vladimirov, whom we asked to comment on the rumor about the new reform plan, confirmed that "conceptually, no one understands which reform the Defense Ministry is now pursuing." He is convinced that the ministry should be separated from the General Staff. In Russia, frequent changes of government and therefore defense ministers are simply inevitable. According to Aleksandr Vladimirov, the army must be safeguarded from this leapfrog approach, and the General Staff given the right to issue orders directly to the troops.
