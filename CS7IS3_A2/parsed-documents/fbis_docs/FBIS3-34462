In the communique issued Tuesday in Khartoum in response to the U.S. accusations, the Sudanese Foreign Ministry stressed the United States double standards, noting that while the United States was referring to imaginary military operations in southern Sudan, it maintained total silence on Israel's deadly operations in the occupied territories. The communique stressed that the military operations in southern Sudan were nothing but fighting between rebel factions and that the people's armed forces only fired in cases of legitimate defense. The communique also confirmed the commitment of the Sudanese Government to all the agreements on humanitarian aid, including those signed with the United Nations, which stipulate the facilitation of the transport of relief material to war victims in southern Sudan. The United States' support for the rebel movement and for its springboard and these unfounded accusations were phenomena which could encourage the rebel movement to escalate the war and to reject all initiatives designed to achieve a peaceful solution to the problem in southern Sudan, the communique said.
