A spokesman of the SADF, Colonel John Rolf, said it was being alleged that in cases where South African soldiers were acting as mercenaries in violation of the defense law, justice had to take its course. After the police have completed their investigation, the attorney general will have to decide whether prosecution will be instituted. Col. Rolf denied that the South African soldiers were involved in Angola with the full knowledge and consent of the SADF; also that the companies responsible for sending soldiers to Angola, Executive Outcomes, were a front for the SADF. The police spokesman in turn said that there has been a police investigation into the allegations after the commissioner of police had requested the investigation. According to reports, there are still about 500 South African soldiers in Angola. These soldiers are fighting on the side of the Marxist MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] troops.
