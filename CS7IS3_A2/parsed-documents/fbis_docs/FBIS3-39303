Papoulias expressed reservations about the stabilizing role that Skopje can play, a view supported by Serreqi. Specifically, using the word "Macedonia," Serreqi described Skopje as a factor of stability in the region. Papoulias stressed: With its constitution, symbols, and unceasing propaganda, Skopje is strengthening those circles that do not want peace and stability in the region. He noted: If Skopje does not accept Greece's conditions, the dialogue will be suspended, as the prime minister has said. The Greek position cannot be misinterpreted. The Albanian foreign minister is visiting Athens within the framework of political dialogue between the European Union [EU] and Albania. During their meeting, Papoulias and Serreqi discussed Albania's relations with the EU, its accession to various programs, and support for its effort to democratize and change institutions. The two ministers also discussed the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, especially the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Serreqi said the Albanian Government supports NATO's decision on air strikes against Bosnia-Herzegovina and added that Tirana disagrees with dividing that country into three parts. Asked of the Albanian Government's draft bill on education, which is expected to include provisions for the teaching of the Greek language, Serreqi said the provisions of international treaties and the CSCE will be considered.
