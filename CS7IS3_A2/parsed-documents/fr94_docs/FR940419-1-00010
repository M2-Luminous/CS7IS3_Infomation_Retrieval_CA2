The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to alter VOR Federal Airways V&hyph;172 and V&hyph;177 located in Wisconsin and Illinois. To expedite the flow of traffic, direct routings are desirable for aircraft arriving at satellite airports in the Chicago metropolitan area. V&hyph;172 would be realigned from the newly relocated ELGIN, IL, intersection direct to the Du Page, IL, (DPA) Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Distance Measuring Equipment facility. V&hyph;177, heading southeast from the Janesville, WI, (JVL) Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) facility toward the Joliet, IL, (JOT) VORTAC currently doglegs over the Rockford, IL, (RFD) VORTAC. Realigning V&hyph;177 would provide a direct route between the Janesville and Joliet VORTACs and eliminate the dogleg over the Rockford VORTAC. Domestic VOR Federal airways are published in paragraph 6010(a) of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The airways listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.
