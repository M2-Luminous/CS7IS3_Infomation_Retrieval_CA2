An equalization payment in that amount was made to the United States by Olympic Land Corporation. The purpose of the exchange was for the United States to acquire non-Federal lands with high value for recreation and riparian habitat. At 10 a.m. on November 28, 1994 the lands acquired by the United States will be open to the operation of the public land laws generally, subject to valid existing rights, the provisions of existing withdrawals, other segregations of record and the requirements of applicable law.

Those received thereafter shall be considered in the order of filing. At 10 a.m. on November 28, 1994 the land acquired by the United States will be open to location under the mining laws. Appropriation of the land under the general mining laws prior to the date and time of restoration is unauthorized. Any such attempted appropriation, including attempted adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 38, shall vest no rights against the United States. Acts required to establish a location and to initiate a right of possession are governed by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in disputes between rival locators over possessory rights since Congress has provided for such determinations in local courts. At 10 a.m. on November 28, 1994 the land acquired by the United States will also be open to applications/offers under the mineral leasing laws, the material sale laws, and the Geothermal Steam Act.
