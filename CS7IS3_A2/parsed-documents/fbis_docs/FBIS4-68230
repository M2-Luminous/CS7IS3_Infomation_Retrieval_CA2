The center's program will focus on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, as well as the consideration, approval, and financing of projects that will employ scientists who previously worked in the armaments sector in peaceful, civilian scientific-technical fields. The founding parties are planning to submit their proposals to the executive council in the very near future. All the countries that signed the agreement on founding this scientific-technical center have pledged substantial sums in U.S. dollars to help finance the center: the U.S.--10 million, Sweden--1.5 million, and Canada--2 million dollars. Ukraine has pledged to do everything necessary to prepare the center, allocate a building and equipment, and provide services.
