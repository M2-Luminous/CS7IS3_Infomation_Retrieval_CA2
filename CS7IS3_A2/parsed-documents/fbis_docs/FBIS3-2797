C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, March 12 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan said on Saturday [12 March] that the implementation of the Fair Trade Law has opened a new era of law and ethics for the Taiwan economy. Addressing the opening ceremony of a three-day international seminar on fair trade at the Taipei International Convention Center, Lien noted that the Fair Trade Law has become an important part of Taiwan's strategy to promote economic liberalization and internationalization. Fair competition will help ensure that all walks of life benefit from the results of economic development, and fair rules, which are the basis of economic ethics, will pave the way for fair competition, he stressed. The premier expressed the hope that discussions at the international forum will help promote the planning and enforcement of Taiwan's fair trade policies, thereby effectively safeguarding a fair trade order for domestic enterprises. Wang Chih-kang, chairman of the cabinet-level Fair Trade Commission, said that Taiwan's Fair Trade Law has had positive impact on regulating the domestic trading order since it took effect in February 1992. The commission is sponsoring the seminar. Guests present at the opening ceremony included Finance Minister Lin Chen-kuo and legislators C.C. Lin, Y.C. Hung, C.C. Lo, and W.P. Chiang. Gerhard Schricker, director of Germany's Max Planck Institute, delivered the keynote speech on "maintaining competition" following the ceremony. Twenty officials, scholars, and experts from the United States, Germany, Britain, Italy, Sweden, Japan, Australia, and the European Union are joining 200 of their Taiwan counterparts at the forum. Participants will focus on such topics as monopolies, unfair competition, international conciliation, and enforcement cooperation.
