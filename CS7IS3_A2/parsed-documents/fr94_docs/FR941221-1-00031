FR941221-1-00031 FR941221-1-00012 The January 3 preamble also discussed the relationship of Docket HM&hyph;142A to Docket HM&hyph;181. Docket HM&hyph;181, entitled ``Performance-Oriented Packaging Standards; Miscellaneous Amendments,'' comprehensively revised the HMR by eliminating 350 pages of regulation and harmonizing HMR requirements for classification, hazard communication and packaging with standards in the UN Recommendations. In the preamble discussion, RSPA stated that HM&hyph;181 had proposed to replace the term ``etiologic agent'' with ``infectious substance'' for consistency with international regulations. However, RSPA noted that the scope of changes proposed under HM&hyph;181 was so extensive that RSPA was unsure when that proposal would be adopted as final. As a result, RSPA proceeded with a separate rulemaking under Docket HM&hyph;142A (an abbreviated version of the infectious substance provisions in HM&hyph;181) to ensure that the risks posed by etiologic agents were adequately regulated under the HMR. RSPA intended the provisions under HM&hyph;142A to serve as a transition until the provisions of HM&hyph;181 became effective. Both final rules were published at approximately the same time. However, the initial effective date for HM&hyph;142A was February 19, 1991, and the effective date for HM&hyph;181 was October 1, 1991. Although HM&hyph;142A was to become effective before HM&hyph;181, RSPA encouraged shippers to implement the HM&hyph;181 provisions as soon as practicable. D. Performance-oriented packaging standards_HM&hyph;181 In 1987, RSPA proposed to align the classification, packaging, and hazard communications provisions in the HMR with the UN Recommendations and the ICAO Technical Instructions. The May 5, 1987 NPRM (Docket HM&hyph;181, 52 FR 16482) proposed to replace the term ``etiologic agent'' with the term ``infectious substance'' and adopt the INFECTIOUS SUBSTANCE label (52 FR 16700). RSPA proposed to include ``infectious substance'' in UN classification Class 6, Division 6.2. ``Infectious substance'' was proposed to mean a viable microorganism, or its toxin, which causes or may cause human disease, and is limited to those agents listed in 42 CFR 72.3 of the regulations of the [CDC]. The terms ``infectious substance'' and ``etiologic agent'' are synonymous. (52 FR 16700). On December 21, 1990, RSPA issued a final rule under Docket HM&hyph;181 (55 FR 52402) which comprehensively revised the HMR with respect to hazard communication, classification, and packaging requirements. ``Infectious substance'' was defined in 49 CFR 173.134(a)(1) to mean a viable microorganism, or its toxin, which causes or may cause disease in humans or animals, and includes those agents listed in 42 CFR 72.3 of the regulations of the [CDC] or any other agent that has the potential to cause severe, disabling or fatal disease. The terms ``infectious substance'' and ``etiologic agent'' are synonymous. RSPA had planned to issue a final rule under Docket HM&hyph;142A (etiologic agents) before issuing the final rule under Docket HM&hyph;181. However, the final rule under HM&hyph;181 was issued on December 21, 1990, and the final rule under HM&hyph;142A was not issued until January 3, 1991. As explained in the preamble to the January 3, 1991 rule, the comments on HM&hyph;142A were considered in the decisionmaking process for HM&hyph;181, and reflected in the December 21, 1990 rule. For example, not only did the December 1990 definition of ``infectious substance'' adopt the broader definition of etiologic agent proposed in 1988, it also reflected RSPA's consideration of comments suggesting that the language be modified to better define agents that may pose an unreasonable risk to health and safety during transportation. A document incorporating editorial and substantive revisions to the December 1990 final rule was published on December 20, 1991 [56 FR 66124]. (These final rules are referred to jointly herein as Docket HM&hyph;181.) The revisions contained in the December 1991 rule were primarily in response to petitions for reconsideration received on the December 1990 final rule. The December 1991 rule also made editorial and technical corrections to the December 21, 1990 final rule, and to the January 3, 1991 final rule. E. Petition for reconsideration on the January 3, 1991 rule A petition for reconsideration filed by the National Solid Wastes Management Association (NSWMA) recommended that RSPA revise the definition of infectious substances (etiologic agents) to exclude solid waste or medical waste as defined in 40 CFR 259.10 of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. To allow adequate time to evaluate the petition, RSPA delayed the effective date of the January 3 rule to September 30, 1991 (February 22, 1991, 56 FR 7312). In a meeting to obtain clarification of the petition, NSWMA urged RSPA to reestablish the 50 ml exception for infectious substances. The NSWMA stated that RSPA's regulation was inconsistent with the approach taken by EPA, and would increase the costs of transporting medical waste for the regulated community. The NSWMA stated that, contrary to RSPA's preamble discussion that most medical waste did not contain etiologic agents or was treated on-site to destroy the agent before being transported for disposal, substantial quantities of untreated medical waste are transported off-site. This information was the first indication RSPA had received from any commenter that removal of the 50 ml exception would affect a larger segment of the industry than had previously been indicated. On September 18, 1991 (56 FR 47158), RSPA incorporated HM&hyph;142A into HM&hyph;181 and, in partial response to NSWMA's request, extended the 50 ml exception from October 1, 1991, to October 1, 1992. (The September 1991 rule also required that packages exceeding the 50 ml exception comply on October 1, 1991, with the revised hazard communication (shipping paper, marking, and labeling) and classification requirements in Docket HM&hyph;181). RSPA anticipated that this extension would provide enough time to fully respond to NSWMA's comments in the final correction document to HM&hyph;181 that was being prepared. However, NSWMA submitted a September 26, 1991 letter asking that RSPA clarify that the January 3, 1991 and September 18, 1991 final rules ``apply to only isolated cultures or stocks such as clinical laboratory specimens and not to 'medical waste' as defined in 40 CFR 259.30(a) and 'mixtures' as defined in 40 CFR 259.31.'' In essence, NSWMA was requesting clarification that the HMR did not apply to medical waste containing any amount of an infectious substance. In order to allow RSPA additional time to carefully review NSWMA's substantive concerns, RSPA again extended the compliance date for all new requirements for infectious substances until October 1, 1992 (October 1, 1991, 56 FR 49830).
