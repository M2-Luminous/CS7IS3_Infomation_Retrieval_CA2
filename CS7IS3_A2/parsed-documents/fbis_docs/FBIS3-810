The alliance strongly attacked the South African Government for taking over control of Bophuthatswana. [Begin recording] [Inkatha Freedom Party President Mangosuthu Buthelezi, in English] We feel what has happened to President Mangope in Bophuthatswana is a disgrace. We believe that what has happened to President Mangope is in fact unchristian. We feel that President Mangope has been betrayed, has been double-crossed, and we feel that it strengthens our resolve never to take the word of President de Klerk or his government. [Correspondent Andries van Zyl] The meeting decided that General Viljoen, who has submitted a list of candidates for his Freedom Front, should withdraw from the alliance. [Viljoen] Our participation in the election depends on a complete accord -- there are actually two accords to be fulfilled. The first accord has been entered into with the ANC [African National Congress] and the government. [Van Zyl] Dr. Hartzenberg said that the CP [Conservative Party] is working hard to prevent a split after rumors that certain CP members support General Viljoen. [Hartzenberg, in English] We do not promote splits. We are not in favor of splits, and we try to prevent it. Therefore, we talk to each other, and we see whether we can come to a solution. [Van Zyl] General Viljoen admitted that the tug of war concerning participation in the election could lead to a split in Afrikaner ranks. [Viljoen] I am very worried about this. It is not a good situation and I have tried to bring about Afrikaner unity, but one reaches a stage where you have to make such a decision. If I do reach a certain decision, then I want to state very clearly that this is not as a result of personal interest. The only factor I consider is what is in the best interest of my people, and I am there to give the strategic guidance. [end recording]
