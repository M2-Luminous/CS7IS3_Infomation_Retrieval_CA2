Kurt Vonnegut, "Slaughterhouse Five, or The Children's Crusade" A cool front has blown in from the West. That is, it is not so much that there has been a bone-chilling draft, but the cold spell has dragged on for quite some time. Calls for a freezing of aid to Russia--for 60 days--such being, evidently, the initial auction price of the damage done to America's security by the Ames spies--have been heard in the U.S. Congress from Republicans and Democrats alike. The White House is giving assurances as yet that it will resist in every possible way a winding down of assistance to Russia. But judging by the fact that the row in connection with this business is becoming louder by the hour--despite Moscow's more than limp response, Washington is working the bellows with enviable persistence--the bargaining will continue. Not only the Americans, but other Western "auction attendees" would like to take part in it, most likely, also. And accord here is the sure way to success. Bill Clinton was recently paid a call by John Major, who attempted with might and main to reassure the president. He even spent a night at the White House (which, prior to him, had not been the case with any foreign visitor). The prime minister and the president agreed that the intelligence services of Britain and the United States would cooperate (as has not been the case since the times of World War II) to nullify the damage from the "Ames case." What its final price will be, Russia will soon find out--Moscow will resume negotiations with the West after the government reshuffle, which has finally been completed. New consultations with the European Union on a partnership agreement, casuistical procedures for Russia's affiliation to the GATT, and the completion of negotiations with the IMF and creditors are in the offing. Some visible outlines of the relations with the potential "auction attendees" will be manifested tomorrow, even--on the completion of the meeting of the finance ministers of the Seven. They will now be dealing with a somewhat different Russia, for that matter. The term "great power," which had been farmed out to historians, is being enshrined officially in the Russian political vocabulary, evidently--to judge by Boris Yeltsin's report to parliament, at least. And the West's delay in expressing some in any way definite response to it may be seen as a timeout for reflection. But some UN wits have already let fall: "The Russian bear has awoken." Not original, of course, but it is, in fact, impossible to sleep permanently. Just some six months ago, relations between Russia and the West seemed all but idyllic. And pure, as in any idyll, that is, clouded by virtually no mercantilism. The partners were true to one another: They promised us assistance, we, them, a constant intensification of the reforms. And what promises these were! Moscow literally became muddled over these billions--now $24 billion, now $43.4 billion. The West, on the other hand, was exultant at the prospects of so-called "shock therapy," which, as has now transpired, has simply not occurred. And all would have gone splendidly had it not been for Russia's Higher Destiny--the October crisis had once again shown the world "how not to live." According to the observations of certain Russian participants in the negotiations, embarrassment flickered in the eyes of their Western colleagues even then: How can this happen--firing from tanks at the parliament building. But the tension--at the level of the former promises, at least--was lifted: Moscow even managed to "squeeze through" preliminary arrangements with the European Union, which were greatly to its advantage. The situation was complicated somewhat by the subsequent mass foray of Russia's ministers among the ranks of members of parliament, which fairly set them at odds. This dirty Russian linen was quite often washed before Western eyes, which did little to strengthen the positions of Moscow officialdom there. And as a result of the enervating process of formation of the new cabinet, which culminated in the departure from it of persons sympathetic to the West, a pregnant pause arose in the East-West dialogue. Russia's neighbors hastened to fill it--in the wake of the former Warsaw Pact allies, the Baltic countries and fraternal Ukraine got in line for NATO admittance, and no less fraternal Kazakhstan expressed a preference for the United States when it came to use of the Baykonur Cosmodrome--symbol of the sovereign pride of the USSR. The change in the Western participants' attitude toward the negotiations with Russia could until recently have been judged only by individual nuances. The London Club of creditor-banks, which had consented at the end of last year to all of Moscow's conditions, for example, recently notified its Russian colleagues that it would insist on its former demands--renunciation of "sovereign immunity," which is disadvantageous to Russia. In the event of its violating the payments' format, this threatened pretrial investigations and the attachment of all assets of Russia and the Central Bank. The Paris Club, on the other hand, has confined itself thus far merely to a hint of a possible tightening of the rules of the game. Reefs show through in its offer to extend the agreement with Russia for 1993 a further four months: Moscow would have to pay for the restructuring of the debt not 40 percent, as earlier, but all 100 percent. The negotiations with the European Union are clearly being dragged out also--to flashing smiles and toasts to partnership. Although in the course of the November Russian-European summit Boris Yeltsin and Jacques Delors affirmed that all obstacles to the signing of a broad-based agreement on partnership had been removed and that it remained merely to work out purely technical trifles, pronounced progress in the working-out process is not in sight as yet--and the mutual hope of initialing an agreement "in the very near future" had been expressed at the summit. Nor are things any better with the GATT, the desire to join which Russia officially stated in July 1993, obtaining at that time the warmest assurances from the head thereof, Peter Sutherland, that all the procedures connected with this would be completed by the end of the year, just about. The same Mr. Sutherland, who recently no less warmly greeted Russian minister Oleg Davydov (see the material on page 3), is still promising a speed-up in the same fashion. The essence of the change, which had only just become apparent, was summed up by FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In the process of preparation of the meeting of ministers of finance of the Seven, which opened today in Frankfurt, Herr Kohl observed while the debate on the subject of whether to invite representatives of Russia was still under way that it would be far better to draw a demarcation line between the political and economic spheres of cooperation with Russia. That is, as a political partner (as long as there is the infamous nuclear button), Moscow could perfectly well become the "eighth," but in the economic plane it would have to rest content with the role of "manservant." Not forcing as yet the development of economic topics, it was on the political front that Moscow dealt the West a powerful diplomatic blow--right in the "soft underbelly of Europe"--Bosnia--forcing the world to recall that it was the Balkan question that in the 19th century had raised Russia without any of your tedious economics to the level of Great Power. And judging by the fact that Boris Yeltsin's proposal concerning the convening of a summit on the Bosnia issue has yet to meet with a response in a single Western capital, the irritation with "upstart Russia" can no longer be concealed there. How are we not to surmise here that the United States timed the premiere of the drama of the Ames spy couple, which according to certain information had been rehearsed in Washington for several months (and Clinton knew about everything), to coincide with the moment when it was necessary to apply the "brakes" to Moscow in earnest. There have been many rows between the special services of Russia and the United States--they are commonplace--but they have assumed a political nature when the parties have categorically wanted to play a dirty trick on each other manifestly unrelated to the field of espionage. At this time, on the eve of a new round of negotiations on questions of assistance to the Russian reforms, the United States evidently deemed it convenient to "correct" the Russian image somewhat. And, as a matter of fact: The West is striving with might and main to render Moscow assistance, but it is paying spies and, yes, murderers (they have betrayed CIA agents, who in Russia are usually executed) and traitors. Quite an idea. It is put thus far at the $2.5 billion promised Russia this year by the United States. Who else is there? What is striking at first glance is the dissonance of the speeches on both sides of the ocean. With us everyone, to a man, is saying that there is nothing so bad about this--we have spied, we are spying now, and we will continue to spy. But Clinton pouted, hinting that his grievance was sincere--there had been hints given to him of something or other in Moscow in January, but they had not kept their word. The bear generally is, as we all know, a phlegmatic creature, albeit powerful. It does not react to trifling matters. Specifically, the CIA delegation that came to Moscow, although having attempted to discuss the subject of espionage at the highest level, has received no response as yet. This response may, evidently, be read between the lines of Boris Yeltsin's report to parliament. It is, meanwhile, being read.
