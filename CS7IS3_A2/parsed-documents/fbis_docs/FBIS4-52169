Mr. Goh Chok Tong said the decision has been taken, Fay has been caned, the matter will be left behind us. He believed Singapore-U.S. relations are robust enough to withstand whatever action the U.S. may take against Singapore. Mr. Goh said the reaction of Singaporeans was not unexpected. He noted it was a rebuff attitude because Singaporeans believe in caning as a deterrent. He was responding to questions raised by reporters at the istana [palace] garden party this evening.
