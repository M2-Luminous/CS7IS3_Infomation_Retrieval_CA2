Greenpeace is the organization which has by actions shown its dislike for the Japanese Government over issues of plutonium shipment and whaling. MOFA in the past has even avoided coming into contact with the organization. But having been beaten completely by Greenpeace in the collection of information on Russia's dumping of radioactive wastes into the sea, MOFA, while admitting its exchanges with the group will have limitations, wants to hold active exchanges with it as a source of information on such matters as Russia's disposal of nuclear wastes. Russia dumped nuclear wastes into the Sea of Japan last October. The first report of this shocking news came from Greenpeace, and pictures of Greenpeace's ship pursuing waste dumping ships came on television screens across Japan. For the MOFA which had had no information on the dumping at all, it was a loss of face and a chance to be reminded of the group's "capabilities." Yoshitaka Kawamura, counselor (in charge of arms control and science) of the MOFA Foreign Policy Bureau, and Naoki Ohara, chief secretary of Greenpeace Japan, came to know each other in an international conference on marine pollution prevention in November. Ohara phoned the former in February. Counselor Kawamura recalled, "I was not quite happy because of the experiences of the past, but I thought we had the common purpose of wanting to prevent the dumping." Thus the two came to exchange views on the validity of information in reports that "dumping would be resumed." Since then, MOFA and Greenpeace have continued to exchange information, MOFA asking for information that Greenpeace alone possessed and Greenpeace asking for information MOFA possessed on Russia. Shocked by the experience in October, the MOFA has increased the number of officials handling the nuclear waste dumping issue from two to four. The officials have made many trips to Moscow and Vladivostok, thus expanding connections with the officials of the central government as well as officials concerned in the Far East area. The MOFA late last year established a consulate general in Vladivostok, and has put in efforts on information collection. A ministry official was full of confidence saying, "Now, European countries and the United States come to us to ask about the situation in the Russian Far East." Yoshiji Nogami, a councilor of MOFA's Foreign Policy Bureau, insisted, "It is not a bad idea to actively exchange views and information with organizations which hold views different from us." Greenpeace Japan's Chief Secretary Ohara on his part said about the information of exchange, "We will cooperate as long as it helps environmental protection." Within MOFA, however, the Economic Affairs Bureau, which is in charge of the whaling issue, is of a different mind. The bureau continues to confront the group squarely from front.
