The decision was reached during a one-day meeting attended by presidents Sir Ketumile Masire, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, F.W. de Klerk of South Africa, ANC leader Nelson Mandela, and Lesotho's deputy prime minister, Selometsi Boholo, at the president's office today. Addressing a news conference after the meeting, President Mugabe, who is the chairman of the Frontline States, said the task force will meet in South Africa tomorrow to discuss the modalities of their work. Mr. Mugabe explained that the task force, consisting of representatives of Governments of Botswana, South Africa, and Zimbabwe will work out the possibility of a program of action to be taken by the three countries. He declined to discuss the composition of the task force but stressed that it was to assess the situation in Lesotho, which may mean the task force could visit Lesotho as it will be based in South Africa. Lesotho's deputy prime minister, Mr. Boholo, briefed the three heads of state and Mr. Mandela about the situation in Lesotho. President Mugabe described the situation in Lesotho as a disturbance that threatened the democratic process in that country. President Mugabe said Lesotho's prime minister, Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle, had asked the secretary general of the Commonwealth, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, to approach the Frontline States to assist in resolving the crisis. He said Chief Anyaoku approached him as the chairman of the Frontline States about the matter, and he in turn approached President Masire as SADC [Southern African Development Community] chairman, and the two invited the two South African leaders.
