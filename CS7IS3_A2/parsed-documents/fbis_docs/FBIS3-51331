The president said that the drug trafficker, who was deported from Colombia, was one of the leading drug traffickers in Alto Huallaga and his capture is comparable to Abimael Guzman's. [Begin recording] [Fujimori] Chavez Penaherrera moved approximately 30 tons of drugs monthly and had his own airport in Campanilla. Every month he made approximately 40 flights and collected a total of $30 million. He was the main cocaine supplier for the Cali Cartel, which, in turn, exported almost 90 percent of that cocaine to the (?United States). In short, this has truly been a harsh blow to the drug trade. [Unidentified reporter] What sentence will he get? [Fujimori] We have passed very timely legislation on drug trafficking. Now we can give El Vaticano the maximum sentence: life in prison. There can be no doubt of that. I believe that for narcoterrorism, El Vaticano's capture is comparable to that of Abimael Guzman. [Reporter] [question indistinct] [Fujimori] I repeat, two. (?Lacalinia and Caloveda) are brothers who have already been captured. There is an entire network of people who are involved and they have either been captured or are being investigated. This capture constitutes a terrible setback for narcoterrorism. [end recording] This is what President Fujimori said at the closing of the academic year at the National Fine Arts School. The president announced that a new fine arts institute is going to be built.
