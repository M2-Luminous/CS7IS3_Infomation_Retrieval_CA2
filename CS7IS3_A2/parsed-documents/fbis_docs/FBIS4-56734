German Sotillo, a 16-year-old student, died after he was shot three times. According to students and professors of the Fermin Toro Secondary School, Sotillo was shot by a police officer who was riding on a water cannon that was being used to disperse the demonstrators. The students were protesting against bus drivers who have been ignoring their right to preferential fares. The bus drivers, meanwhile, argue that since last year the government has failed to adequately subsidize the students' reduced fares.
