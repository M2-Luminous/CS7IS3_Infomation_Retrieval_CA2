This statement is a response to his opponents who held a press conference on 18 March at which they maintained that serious voting violations were allowed to occur, and in favor of just one candidate, Oleg Morozov. The statement is being published in full. Esteemed fellow citizens! On the evening of 18 March many of you had an opportunity to watch a TV report on a press conference in which my former opponents in the Moskovskiy Electoral District participated most vigorously [line(s) missing in the original]. The essence of their presentations boiled down to the fact that various violations occurred during the elections which place in doubt the very outcome of the elections. It is the prerogative of the district electoral commission to comment on the specific claims put forth by the participants in the press conference. I am no less interested than my opponents in getting exhaustive answers to all the questions. However, I certainly cannot fail to acknowledge some, to put it mildly, improper pronouncements which affect me personally. Let us begin with one participant in the press conference, M. Rameyev, who said approximately the following in support of his thesis that I was supported by the administrations of a number of rayons: People were forced to vote for Morozov, and for the sake of this they were paid wages they had not been paid since November. I assert with the full weight of responsibility that, alas, I had nothing to do with an event as wonderful for many of my fellow residents as the payment of back wages. Moreover, I know that many labor collectives still have not received what is due to them. However, if we imagine for a minute that people were given the money they had earned on account of a modest individual like myself, this means that you, esteemed voters, have made a correct choice. Another participant in the press conference, V. Belyayev, stated that it was allegedly indicated on the ballots in some polling stations that I am a resident of the city of Kazan. First, I would very much like to look at these ballots: I believe that they do not really exist. Second, I have never concealed the fact that I have resided in Moscow for the last four years--not in the official consent to run, not in interviews to newspapers, not at meetings with voters. As far as I know, the city of Kazan was erroneously indicated as my domicile by the newspaper VECHERNYAYA KAZAN, and then on the eve of the elections and in the context of a direct appeal to vote for V. Belyayev. I will recall that a sample ballot was published in which an appropriate mark was placed against Belyayev's name. Likewise, Belyayev stated that his observers were not allowed access to polling stations; their work was allegedly interfered with, and their rights were not explained to them. I would not venture to maintain anything concerning all the observers of Vladimir Aleksandrovich. However, by a strange coincidence, at many of the city polling stations at which his comrades-in-arms were [line(s) missing in the original]. By an equally strange coincidence, both engaged in their activities without any hindrance and even cooperated quite peaceably, helping each other. Esteemed voters, M. Rameyev also misleads you by maintaining that Morozov allegedly came fourth in virtually all the electoral precincts of Kirovskiy Rayon, but in total came in second. I cannot speak about all the polling stations of the rayon; however, according to the data obtained at precinct commissions, at the polling stations attended by my observers I came in first in two cases with a considerable lead, third in one case, and fourth with an insignificant lag behind the second and third positions in three cases. As you have already guessed, in total I came in second. I will not refer to other "trifles." However, I cannot remain silent concerning one fundamental aspect reflecting the spirit of the press conference. As I see it, openly insulting intonations with regard to voters, especially those in rural rayons, were heard in the presentations of almost all of my opponents. Some, as they put it, "old Tatars," forcibly herded people into the polling stations and made them vote for the candidate they indicated. I will not comment on these statements, I am simply ashamed for those who think and talk about people, about their fellow residents, so pejoratively. [Signed] With sincere respect, Oleg Morozov, political commentator of RESPUBLIKA TATARSTAN
