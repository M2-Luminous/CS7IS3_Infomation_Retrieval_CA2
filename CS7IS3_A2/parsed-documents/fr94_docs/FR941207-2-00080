General Description Chicago Match is an electronic order matching system that will cross orders entered by users during regular trading hours for securities that are listed on the CHX or for which the CHX has unlisted trading privileges. The match will occur once a day at mid-day. Users may be CHX members or non-members, and will likely include institutional customers, broker-dealers, and Chicago Match market makers. Users will be able to enter orders directly into Chicago Match through personal computers and modems. A CHX member must be responsible for controlling and clearing the orders entered by non-members. 14 14 When a non-member is given access to the Chicago Match it must enter into several agreements to ensure that a member has responsibility and control over the non-member's activities. In addition, non-member users of the Chicago Match will be required to have $10 million for investment purposes. See discussion infra . The Chicago Match will electronically match users' orders in an allocation procedure described below. If an electronic match occurs, the trade will be priced at the market price 15 at a random time within a pre-determined ten minute period and will be executed at that time. If a match does not occur, users will still have the opportunity to find the other side of their orders through participating brokers. 16 15 The market price is equal to the mid-point between the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer. 16 Users may take advantage of the ``near match'' function discussed infra . The Chicago Match will primarily operate off the Exchange floor, but CHX market makers may enter guarantees through their regular terminals on the Exchange floor. Other users will be able to place buy and sell orders directly and anonymously into the electronic system through off-floor terminals. Quotations from the CHX trading floor will automatically be fed into the Chicago Match on a real time basis. 17 The system will not otherwise directly interact with the Exchange's regular auction process. 17 Quotations will be updated until the time of the match. All Chicago Match users will enter into a user agreement 18 with the Exchange to be bound by the Exchange's rules governing the Chicago Match. Prior to the time a non-member user enters an order into the system, it will be required to submit to the Exchange the name of the Midwest Clearing Corporation (``MCC'') member through which the user will clear its trades and provide the Exchange with a copy of a ``Give-Up Agreement'' with such member. CHX clearing members will clear Chicago Match transactions through their existing clearing arrangements. 19 18 The user agreement will provide, inter alia , that the user has entered into a ``Give-Up Agreement'' with a CHX clearing member or already clears through the Midwest Clearing Corp.; that the CHX clearing member agrees to be jointly or severally liable for all actions of the user; that the user agrees to be bound by the policies of the Board of Governors of the Exchange that are applicable to Chicago Match; and that the Exchange reserves the right to terminate the user's access to the Chicago Match. 19 The clearing agreements set the user's daily credit limits. Prior to the cross, users will enter the following information for each order: 20 20 Users will be able to enter orders from the time the Exchange opens for trading until the match time. •stock ticker symbol; •number of shares to be bought or sold; •capacity (buy, sell or sell short); •limit price (optional); •minimum trade size (optional); •excluded category of contra parties; •names of individual excluded users (optional); 21 21 An excluded user is defined under CHX Rule 2(l) as a user whose order cannot be matched with another user because the match might result in a prohibited transaction as that term is defined in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA''), 29 U.S.C. §§1001_1461 (1988). This function will not be available immediately. •liquidity fee or credit (optional); •linked order conditions (optional);
