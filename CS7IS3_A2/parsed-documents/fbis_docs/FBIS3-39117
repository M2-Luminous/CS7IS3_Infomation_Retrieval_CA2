In an address to the German-Russian Forum in Bonn, Kinkel said that Germany wants a Russia that is open to the world, stable, and democratic, a country that can be a competitive economic partner and a reliable pillar in an all-European peace system. "This would be the best security guarantee for our entire continent." However, it cannot be ignored that there are forces in Russia whose ideas of their country's role are fundamentally different. "Those people in Russia who believe they could improve their rating at home by falling back to behavioral patterns in foreign policy from the Soviet era that everybody thought were part of the past, must know that they risk new isolation and confrontation." Germany is taking seriously the spirit and letter of the UN Charter, the Final Act of Helsinki, and the Paris Charter: "We expect Russia to do the same." Germany wants to extend cooperation, but remains determined in its defense of fundamental behavioral standards for European security: "In the new Europe there is no room for so-called spheres of vital interests." Germany's policy toward the other countries in Central and East Europe and on the territory of the former Soviet Union pursues independent objectives, Kinkel said. He referred to the worries of those countries: "It would be fundamentally wrong to see them as tools for our Russia policy." Germany was aspiring toward ever-closer integration of its Eastern neighbors into the Euro- Atlantic forms of stability, "which will finally also include full membership." Russia should be integrated into these "security structures." If the smaller Eastern neighbors were to grow into the security structures, then the relations with the other countries in the East must be intensified at the same time. For Russia the growing together of Europe does not constitute a threat but an increase in stability, security, and economic opportunities. Kinkel warned Moscow against taking steps of its own in the conflicts in the Caucasus or other bordering areas: "When it comes to settling bloody conflicts in the CIS, we have to ensure that peacekeeping missions are carried out under the auspices and the principles of the CSCE; this requires the agreement of all parties involved." Ambiguous terms such as "immediate neighborhood" do not fit into our time: "As Europe is growing together we are all becoming the immediate neighborhood for one another; Russia does not constitute a special case here." Besides, the term "immediate neighborhood" was blurring the differences between individual CIS states. For all states on the area of the former Soviet Union the following must apply without any restrictions: "Full respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, and inviolability of existing borders." Kinkel said that it was the task of Russian diplomacy to build up relations with Moscow's new neighbors that are based on trust and mutual respect: "That is a crucial issue for Europe." Nowhere were people reacting more sensibly to Russia's position toward Europe than in the Baltics and in Ukraine. Kinkel requested: "The remaining Russian forces must leave Latvia and Estonia by the end of August 1994." The Baltics could constitute the first proof that openness toward the world and cooperation in partnership are superior to a way of thinking that is guided by spheres of influence and hegemonic privileges. Kinkel added: "Therefore, I am in favor of consistently connecting the Baltic states to the European Union." Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania need associated membership agreements including the same "entry prospects" that are contained in the existing Europe agreement with Poland and Hungary. "No threat but a lasting impulse for parallel developments in the neighboring Russia will emanate from the Baltics that feel safe and begin to prosper." However, Russia does have a legitimate interest in preventing discrimination against Russian minorities. Germany has advocated reasonable conciliation consistent with the CSCE rules; the efforts by the CSCE's minority commissioner have been "quite successful." Kinkel recommended Russia and Ukraine to conclude a comprehensive agreement on good neighborly relations, border guarantees, and minority protection to ease tense relations. "Russia is of vital importance for European security," Kinkel said. Russia remains the most important country in Europe and Asia. "Ecological problems and disasters in this part of our continent will not leave us unaffected." Like every other country, Russia is pursuing interests of its own that are not always and everywhere identical with Germany's: "A self-assured Russia is not necessarily a threat; conversely, a Russia that is cooperative is not necessarily an easy partner." What is necessary is a business-like policy of accommodation of interests and continuously growing confidence. The resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Gaydar and Finance Minister Fedorov created doubts about the new government's reform course and its will to carry on with the reforms: "There is now a threat of a loss of confidence, not only at the level of international financial institutions but also that of foreign investors and the population at home." Since the beginning of the year, the ruble lost one-quarter of its value abroad. The flight of capital from Russia is assessed at more than $1 billion per month. Unless Russian economic policy manages to create investment opportunities at home, it cannot expect too much from foreign capital. Kinkel said that one must hope that the statements by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin that the reforms would continue will be decisive for the course of the new government. The G7 stand by their financial support, but these alone are not enough to create the necessary structural changes in Russia. Kinkel added: "But there will not be more money for less reform." The federal foreign minister argued: "Regarding our support for the reforms we have to keep a balance between our own fundamental convictions and what can be expected from the people in Russia." Apart from stabilizing the national economy a system of social security independent of enterprises is recommended. Only then can the course of reform gain wide support. Yet, without reforms lasting improvement of social conditions will not be possible. With almost 90 billion German marks [DM], Germany has contributed most for Russia and more than half of the entire international aid. Germany is in favor of Russia's getting closer to the OECD. "We would welcome it if Russia were to become a member of the Council of Europe." Russia should become a partner with equal rights in the G7. Germany was also supporting the efforts for early conclusion of negotiations on a cooperation agreement between the EU and Russia. In 1994, Germany will open consulates in Kaliningrad (former Koenigsberg), Saratov, and Novosibirsk and is anxious to increase exchange in all spheres.
