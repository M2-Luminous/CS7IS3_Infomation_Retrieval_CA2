Khasbulatov, who was recently regarded as persona non grata in the republic. Surrounded by bodyguards, the former Lefortovo prisoner is traveling around Groznyy accompanied by a motorcade of foreign cars to be welcomed by machine-gun and assault-rifle salutes from his fellow tribesmen. There was an enthusiastic welcome in his native village, where horse races involving the most daredevil and skillful horsemen were timed specially for his arrival. Reporters from local, Russian, and international news agencies were present in abundance. Khasbulatov's trip to his homeland with the avowed aim of visiting his elderly mother took on major political significance for the republic the moment his aircraft touched down at Groznyy airport. The guest was met at the ramp not just by his brothers, close relatives, and representatives of the Kharachoy clan, which, incidentally, is one of the many distinguished clans in Chechnya. (A village bearing this name survives to this day in the mountainous area of the republic. One representative of this clan -- the bandit avenger Zelimkhan Kharacheyevskiy, who devoted his life to struggling against the czarist forces -- was well known in prerevolutionary Russia). Many inhabitants of Chechnya considered it their duty to meet with their distinguished compatriot. However, the present enthusiasm in the republic is not quite as instinctive as it was two-and-a-half years ago, when Ruslan Imranovich assumed the office of chairman of the Russian Supreme Soviet. At that time he was the republic's national hero. But his neutrality over attempting to impose order in Chechnya by strong-arm methods came as an unpleasant surprise to his enraptured fellow citizens. So the current rejoicing is mingled with wariness: What plans does this man have in Chechnya? His possible opposition to the present regime in Groznyy and the possibility of his making a bid for power in the republic would, by the admission of a staffer at the Chechen Republic Department for Information and the Press who wished to remain anonymous in the newspaper, constitute an extremely dangerous threat to Dudayev. This is apparently why official Groznyy is trying to be markedly attentive to its distinguished guest, who has regained the sympathy of thousands of his compatriots during his period of disfavor. President Dudayev took the first steps towards reconciliation with his arch-opponent in good time: He returned to Khasbulatov the Chechen citizenship of which he had been stripped, and immediately before his release from Lefortovo he stated his belief that the Chechen prisoner was innocent. He attempted to display honor befitting this lofty statesman at Groznyy airport as well, where the president's secretary of state and aide greeted the guest. But the exultant crowd pushed aside the senior officials and prevented them from getting close to their idol, whom they mobbed in a fit of enthusiasm. On the third day of his stay in Chechnya, Khasbulatov visited the memorial built to honor the victims of the deportation of the Chechen people, whom the president's supporters call "Dzhokhar's children," and spoke at a small rally there. Whatever happens in Chechnya, official Groznyy is currently hoping for something else -- that the Chechen celebrity, whose popularity at a time when the republic is in a state of collapse represents a real danger for President Dudayev, will depart as soon as possible for the Russian capital.
