The cocaine was seized in Aparecida do Rio Doce on highway 364 linking Goias with Sao Paulo. This road is considered by the Federal Police to be the cocaine road, one of the main routes for distributing drugs coming from Bolivia. The 198 kg of pure cocaine, wrapped in plastic bags, were hidden in two trucks used for carrying cattle. To carry the cocaine the drug traffickers had built a false bottom into the truck's body. The pressed cocaine was hidden inside the steel and wooden frames and covered with a mixture of cow's manure and rice husks to cover up the smell of cocaine. According to the Federal Police, who have been chasing the drug traffickers for 20 days, the cocaine load, valued at about 600 million real cruzeiros, came from Alto Araguaia in Mato Grosso and was being taken to Uberaba and Uberlandia in the triangle region of Minas Gerais.
