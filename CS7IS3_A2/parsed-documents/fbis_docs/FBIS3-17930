This was not out of their own disloyalty but owing to the slowness of presidential messengers. The edict signed by Boris Yeltsin the night before reached the polling stations only by the second half of the polling day. The people of Krasnoyarsk were supposed to either approve or reject during their plebiscite the draft law crafted by the local administration "On the Foundations of Direct Sovereignty of the People and State Power." One of the kray's well-known politicians told your SEGODNYA correspondent that the law "was needed in order to bind up the legislative assembly once and for all," where, as things stand now, only five out of the 34 deputies would constantly work there. For example, it had been planned to grant the administration's head the right to push the discussion of any awkward matter one month back merely by his directive (that is to "filibuster" it, considering that the session only takes place four times a year). Notably, all the governor's legislative initiatives would be entitled to be considered out of turn. The referendum, however, was not canceled because of Boris Yeltsin's suddenly revived love for institutions of representative power. Local observers maintain that the main reason was the long-standing tensions between Governor Valeriy Zubov and Yuriy Moskvich, the president's representative in the kray. Knowing that the center mistrusts local referendums (especially in the Urals and Siberia), the latter was prompt to "present materials") to the president's staff. They say around the city that the edict that followed dealt an appreciable blow at Mr. Zubov. The edict refers to the constitutional ban on putting to referendums regional charters and -- unless they have been agreed on in Moscow--questions on the status of a federation component. They point out in Krasnoyarsk that no charter was put to the plebiscite (only an individual law), and the changing of the kray's status (for example to that of a republic) was totally out of the question. In the opinion of Vyacheslav Novikov, head of the local Center for Strategic Projections, "the kray's authorities would surely win their case at the Constitutional Court, only the court does not work now."
