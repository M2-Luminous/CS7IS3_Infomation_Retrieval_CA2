High-level sources at the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said these disguised barriers include human rights and environmental issues which are being incorporated by the United States and other Western powers into the mainstream of their foreign trade policies. A DFA official said that developed countries went 'overboard' on using such barriers under the new world trade order after the Uruguay Round was signed last April. "So now we have issues on environment, human rights, sanitary requirements and wildlife being invoked by the United States, the European Union and other rich countries," the official said. The DFA, meanwhile, said the Philippines will push for the inclusion of its serious concern over trade issues in the agenda of the U.S.- ASEAN conference in Washington next month. Describing it as "ridiculous," DFA officials took notice of trade sanctions recently imposed by the United States against Taiwan for its failure to close down the illegal trade in wildlife, specifically the poaching of wild cats or tigers. Taipei has protested the trade sanctions, asking why the Clinton administration spared the mainland China despite reports from environmental experts that it is even a bigger market for wildlife products than Taiwan. "This is what I call as a form of disguised non-tariff barriers which we view with serious concern," a DFA source, asking for anonymity, said, "hindi na [no longer] tariff, hindi na quota dahil bawal na 'yan sa [because that's prohibited in] GATT (meaning the new world trade order or WTO)." It must also be noted that Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo earlier assailed the United States for linking China's record of human rights violations in its renewal assessment of the most-favored-nation status to that country. Romulo has also expressed relief over failed attempts by the United States to include "social clauses" into the GATT which involve the protection of the workers' rights and other labor standards. He said that labor and human rights issues be separated from trade accords. Under the GATT, developed countries will cut industrial tariffs by 38 percent and farm tariffs by 37 percent over the next 10 years. The developing countries have no tariff slashing figures but they agreed to "bind" or not to add extra fees and payments to their tariff rates. DFA officials said the United States and its allies are looking for ways to cushion negative effects of the GATT to Western market, which will have to compete against the influx of Asian export to the world economy. Asia is said to benefit the most out of GATT since it has the fastest growing and most trade oriented economies. Asia will generate more than 50 percent of the new trade by developing countries, which will bring in more jobs, higher incomes and in- demand products.
