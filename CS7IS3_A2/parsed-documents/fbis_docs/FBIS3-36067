Seven other people were injured and hospitalized in critical condition, after the explosion shattered tens of railway wagons. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known. The train, in which one of the cars exploded when passengers were getting into it, arrived earlier from Kislovodsk, southern Russia. It was duly inspected in the local depot and put into service again because of the rolling stock shortage. Competent sources close to the investigation of the accident do not rule out an act of subversion as the cause of the blast.
