On 3 March, Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), urged opposition candidates not to use their campaigns to divide Mexicans. During a visit to Nayarit, Colosio stated: "I want to be president of Mexico to lead the change and transformation of social conditions in our motherland." (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 3 March 94) Colosio officially has registered his presidential candidacy with the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE). Commenting on rumors Peace Commissioner Camacho Solis might run as the PVEM candidate, he has said: "I have great respect for Manuel Camacho. We are members of a party committed to democracy. I have great respect for him, and I support his actions in the Chiapas peace talks. I believe the pluralistic nature of our modern political parties is a product of Mexican society." (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 5 March 94) Members of the Permanent Indian Council, a group that comprises almost half of the 56 ethnic groups in Mexico and has no affiliation with the PRI, visited Luis Colosio on 7 March.

(Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 8 Mar 94) Colosio promised on 7 March if elected he will "establish a new pact between the state and 56 ethnic communities to guarantee respect for human dignity, autonomous rights, legal and social justice, and democracy for 10 million Indians, who are part of the poorest of the poor." Colosio also said: "It is time to do justice to our Indians, to grow and share the fruits of that growth more equitably in our motherland, because progress makes no sense if it does not imply more income for the peasants, workers, and the Indian families of all and each one of our communities."

(Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 4 March 94) In Campeche, Fernandez has said: "We will never favor violence. We understand the Chiapas guerrilla movement has justifiable causes, but violence will never give us the peace, prosperity, and justice Mexico wants and deserves." He has also said: "The big challenge this country is facing, the big project to which all Mexicans should commit is so simple and deep that it can be expressed in a few words: The challenge modern-day Mexico faces is to comply with the law." (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 7 Mar 94) In Quintana Roo, Fernandez has praised the results of the peace talks in Chiapas, saying: "Other countries have not achieved over many years what Mexico has now accomplished, thanks to the government's prudence."

The party's national council decided during a closed-door meeting the positions in question would first be decided by state councils and executive committees. If disputes arise, the national council will have the final word. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 7 March 94 p 11)
