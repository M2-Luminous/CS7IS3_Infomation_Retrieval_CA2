He clearly stated why he was resigning because he had made a serious effort here." This is how Subcommander Marcos appraised Manuel Camacho's resignation as commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas during an interview he granted in the jungle. He also talked about the National Democratic Convention, elections within EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army]-controlled areas, and reactions to the Zapatists' rejection of the peace accords. [Morquecho] What is the EZLN's reaction to Camacho's resignation as peace commissioner? [Marcos] As we see it, on one hand, Mr. Camacho's resignation shows a lack of understanding by one of the presidential candidates -- namely, Mr. Zedillo --to the significance of a dialogue and the negotiations process. "In his blindness, he does not see the advances made, such as the postponement of the cease-fire, the assurances that it will be respected and that one side will not attack the other, that the electoral process has gotten under way, and that elections can be held nationwide. All of these are achievements reached at the negotiating table in San Cristobal, and merit must definitely be given to the mediator and the commissioner. "When Mr. Zedillo invalidates, diminishes, or underrates the work done by the commissioner, he is really undermining his position and is taking the position of demanding a surrender. "Mr. Zedillo sees the lack of a surrender as a failure. How can we trust this candidate? If he wins the presidency, how can he be open to negotiations or have a conciliatory attitude in resolving the Chiapas conflict or, more specifically, the EZLN conflict? "It is definitely a low blow by the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] to the efforts made to advance the dialogue and the negotiations, and it reflects a historic blindness to see the advances that were made. "What we also see is that when Camacho made the proposals in response to the EZLN demands, he made an honest effort and acted responsibly. He worked to get responses that would satisfy our demands during the consultations, especially after Colosio's murder. An interest group somewhere or a power group within the federal government started to block all of the initiatives geared to supporting those proposals, forcing us to notice that no promises were going to be kept, and giving the impression that Mr. Camacho had failed to obtain the EZLN's unconditional surrender. The idea was to keep him busy so he would not overshadow the PRI candidate in the middle of a campaign which, everyone knows, is extremely weak. "It seems to me that Camacho is courageous. He is clear when he says why he is quitting because he made a serious effort and we have acknowledged this. His efforts have been invalidated by a man who is attempting to become the president of the republic for the government party. The fact that he quit and said why he was doing so shows that Camacho is a brave man." [Morquecho] What can you tell us about the National Democratic Convention the EZLN has called for? [Marcos] From the outset, the Chiapas civilian sectors' response was very perceptive because they were able to clearly see, I imagine, the problems of a civil war, as well as the need to find a solution, because, in one way or another, they are the ones who will have to endure the brunt of a war. "Chiapas civilian society understands that a convention is the only chance worth taking in the process to achieve change. A national-level response to this proposal is still lacking. Several sectors have already taken a stand, but still very few have done so. "We want to clearly state that the National Democratic Convention is not an EZLN convention, that is to say; it is not a convention to vindicate the armed struggle but, rather, a convention to search for a peaceful change and for a political path to democracy. "There is the fear that it will be a Zapatist convention which could result in the vindication of the armed struggle -- the vindication of the EZLN, led by the EZLN. "We are not proposing that the convention declare itself in support of the armed struggle. Just the opposite is true. We are saying the convention must declare that it will do something. It must not sit and wait for 22 August but, instead, do something before then and make an effort that is worth making. We have nothing to lose by trying to determine whether it is still possible to push for a peaceful transition to democracy. "I am interested in clarifying this because I have read that it might be interpreted that the convention would be the political arm of the EZLN. "The National Convention will be the political arm of the democratic struggle, just as the EZLN is the military arm of the democratic struggle. In terms political experts like to use a lot nowadays, the hard line comprises the EZLN, and the conciliatory or peaceful line comprises civilian society. "We are asking civilian society to organize more and not to be divided. It could be through the convention, or it could be through something else. By convening the convention, we are responding to people who tell us: I want to do something; I do not agree with the armed struggle, but I do agree with democracy. Therefore, we are telling them: Well then, meet. "We are offering them territory, support, protection, and an idea of what could be. We are also offering an explanation of what led us to take up arms, and which might take you to the ballots. That would be the convention, and it would be good if this were clear, right now, before it is held." [Morquecho] Talking about elections, what does it mean not to hinder the electoral process in the zone under Zapatist control? [Marcos] "We are willing to permit the entry of candidates who want to campaign, the entry of ballot boxes, the holding of the vote, and we are willing to give guarantees so there will be no interference from our forces in this entire process. We are appealing to the International Red Cross [IRC] to verify that there is no aggression on our part, foreseeing there might be provocations that might be blamed on us. "That is one of the achievements of the negotiations, the opening of the door by the most radical sector of democracy -- the hard democratic line, which is the EZLN -- so the peaceful transition that civilian society demands so much will take place. "We are yielding the ground won by civilian society, the ground on which it can conduct its work, which, in this case, is the electoral process in August. We will offer every assistance, even decidedly standing back, if there are guarantees that this will go down on record. "This is why we are appealing to nongovernmental organizations [NGO's], mainly those being organized in Chiapas, to monitor this process, ensuring it is held normally within our guidelines. "This does not mean we are now calling on people to vote; it simply means we are not going to interfere and we are going to be consistent with the position we expressed in January when we said we were not planning to interfere in the electoral process in August." [Morquecho] This means there will be polling officials and representatives of the parties. The intervention of the IRC and NGO's is being requested. This would involve voting tables at polls in the areas under Zapatist control. [Marcos] "Yes, but the difference is that these elections will be the first ones organized by civilian society in national territory. In other words, we are turning over to the NGO's the organization of everything that must be done here in Zapatist territory. "We think it is an interesting barometer for the rest of the country and the rest of civilian society to see elections that are organized neither by the government nor an armed organization in rebellion, and instead are organized by that third force, whose belligerence we recognize and which is civilian society itself. "It would be a great nonbellicose advance -- I mean, an unarmed and nonviolent advance, a peaceful advance. Civilian society would organize those elections in our territories. That would be the big difference." [Morquecho] Then, there is an open invitation to all candidates from every political party, in this case the government party? [Marcos] An open invitation? No, because there are some people for whom we feel nothing but contempt. We will simply not oppose to their doing whatever they have to do, but we will not welcome them with open arms, especially those who would seem to have suddenly forgotten what their elections record is in a state in which fraud was so notorious that they even got elected as senators with the so-called people's support. "Let us not forget. We know what history is, and we must acknowledge it. We will not prevent them from campaigning, but the population of those regions under Zapatista control are quite aware of who's who. We guarantee that there will be no attack or interference of any sort. We are definitely not inviting everyone, but if they want to come, we will not prevent them." [Morquecho] What were the reactions in Chiapas with respect to the Zapatist opposition to the signing of a peace agreement? Is there any apprehension as a result of some of the reactions? I am referring now to opposition from the cattle ranchers, the government, and the Army. [Marcos] Once again, the Army is using phrases like "transgressors of the law" and "violence professionals." These are expressions it had discarded. The important issue here is that they had agreed to respect the cease-fire, but now they are leaving it open to the decision of their commander in chief who, in this case, is Mr. Salinas de Gortari. "While the EZLN is guaranteeing that it will respect the cease-fire and is making every effort for it not to be broken, so far, the Army is honoring it, but it is not giving any assurances that it will last. It is also making the military climate somewhat unstable and is blocking the elbow room we were trying create -- the elbow room of a peaceful transition. "On the other hand, the ranchers' reaction is contradictory because what they wanted was our surrender, which would have brought about peace. Now they are criticizing the government for not to adopting a hard-line position. They do not want negotiations. They want the Zapatists broken once and for all, if they fail to accept what they are offered. "This reaction is understandable. It unmasks, once and for all, the alleged mediating position adopted by those ranchers who were seeking public office, already negotiating, involved in a dialogue, and who knows what. The masks they wore have finally been removed, and once again they have returned to the position they have always held. "All of this is aimed at misleading the voters into not believing that the so-called Indian -- Mestizo, or Ejido -- cattle owners formula can fool someone. [sentence as published] "On the other hand, the PRI, which has always been very insightful in implementing the best possible policies in this state -- evidence of this lies in the fact that we decided to take up arms -- chose to name as candidates to public office people who have always been widely unpopular. Several of these people are not even known, have always adopted a middle-of-the-road position, and have never been to the districts they say they represent. There are others who undoubtedly represent a repressive tradition, such as that of the cattle ranchers. "The election climate throughout the state clearly shows that the PRI's permanence is also the continuation of the same conditions that forced the EZLN to take up arms and remain armed. It has been clearly demonstrated that the PRI, at the state level -- and we still have the national level to consider -- is the party that understood the war the least, as well as the fact that it is the party that is responsible for determining if this continues or comes to an end. "The PRI has not understood or assessed the situation. It still believes that things can remain the way they were before by simply changing its speeches, by discussing the masses more, or by supporting the rights and interests of the Indian population. Even the ranchers have resorted to this, as if it were possible to erase the track record they have accumulated. "No candidate running for public office has ever come here to the Zapatist territories. Neither have the municipal presidents of Ocosingo or Las Margaritas gone any further than those communities. The municipal president of Las Margaritas never went any further than Las Margaritas. The Ocosingo municipal president never went any further than the brewery located at El Jatate crossing. "The only candidate running for public office that has entered Zapatist territory, but when it was not yet a Zapatist region, was Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who is candidate for the presidency of the republic -- but not one deputy or replacement, whether on a slate or a single ticket, or anything. Not even one candidate running for municipal president ever came to this region to request votes from places where they supposedly won with 100 percent support."
