ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In this final rule implementing the Anti Car Theft Act of 1992, NHTSA defines ``light duty truck'' (``LDT'') and ``multipurpose passenger vehicle'' (``MPV'') for purposes of the Theft Prevention Standard, specifies the LDT and MPV parts considered major parts for the purpose of parts marking, and specifies the LDT and MPV lines that are to be marked. NHTSA also specifies marking of selected lines with below-median theft rates. DATES: Effective date: This final rule takes effect on October 25, 1995. The changes made in this final rule apply beginning with model year 1997. Petitions for Reconsideration: Any petitions for reconsideration of this rule must be received by NHTSA no later than January 12, 1995. ADDRESSES: Petitions for reconsideration of this rule must refer to the docket number and notice number cited in the heading of this final rule and be submitted to: Administrator, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, D.C. 20590. It is requested, but not required, that 10 copies be submitted. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Barbara A. Gray, Office of Market Incentives, NHTSA, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, D.C. 20590. Ms. Gray's telephone number is (202) 366&hyph;1740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Table of Contents I.

Civil Justice Reform I. Anti Car Theft Act of 1992 The ``Anti Car Theft Act of 1992'' (ACTA) amended the law relating to the labelling of major parts on high theft and other motor vehicles that is now codified as 49 U.S.C. chapter 331 Theft Prevention. At 49 U.S.C. 33101(10), ``passenger motor vehicle'' is defined to include ``a multipurpose passenger vehicle or light duty truck when that vehicle or truck is rated at not more than 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight.'' Since ``passenger motor vehicle'' was previously defined to include passenger cars only, the effect of ACTA is that certain multipurpose passenger vehicle (MPV) and light-duty truck (LDT) lines may be determined to be high theft vehicles, subject to the Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard (49 CFR part 541). The purpose of the Theft Prevention Standard is to reduce the incidence of motor vehicle theft by facilitating the tracing and recovery of parts from stolen vehicles. The standard seeks to facilitate such tracing by requiring that vehicle identification numbers (VINs), VIN derivative numbers, or other symbols be placed on major motor vehicle parts. Each vehicle in a high theft line must have its major parts and major replacement parts marked unless the line is exempted from parts marking pursuant to 49 CFR part 543. To conform the Theft Prevention Standard to ACTA, NHTSA issued on July 7, 1993, an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) (58 FR 36376). NHTSA sought comments on definitions of multipurpose passenger vehicles (MPVs) and light-duty trucks (LDTs) for the Theft Prevention Standard, and on which parts of these vehicles should be considered major parts and therefore subject to parts marking. After considering the public comments on the ANPRM, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on July 8, 1994 (59 FR 35082), to amend the Theft Prevention Standard. The issues that were raised in the NPRM, and the public comments addressing them are discussed below. II. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 1. Definitions of ``Light Duty Truck'' and ``Multipurpose Passenger Vehicle'' In the NPRM, NHTSA noted that since the statutory requirements for ``multipurpose passenger vehicles'' differ from those for ``light duty trucks,'' these two terms must be clearly defined to make it possible to determine whether a particular vehicle is an MPV or an LDT. Under ACTA, since NHTSA must require some MPV's with below-median theft rates to be marked, but the Act exempts LDTs with below-median theft rates from coverage, NHTSA must ensure that a distinction between LDTs and MPVs is made. ACTA limits ``multipurpose passenger vehicles'' to those vehicles rated at 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight or less. Thus, NHTSA's proposed definition of ``multipurpose passenger vehicle'' was: A passenger motor vehicle which is constructed either on a truck chassis or with special features for occasional off-road operation and which is rated at 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight or less.
