FR941013-0-00003 FR941013-0-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;06&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9044; AD 94&hyph;21&hyph;01] Airworthiness Directives; de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 series airplanes, that requires modification of the potentiometer lever stops on the nose wheel steering. This amendment is prompted by a report that the potentiometer stops installed currently on these airplanes are too short to limit excessive uncontrolled potentiometer movement in the event of a mechanical link failure. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent the airplane from departing the runway during takeoff or landing in the event of the failure of the mechanical link between the rudder pedals and the potentiometer. DATES: Effective November 14, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of November 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Bombardier Inc., Bombardier Regional Aircraft Division, Garratt Boulevard, Downsview, Ontario M3K 1Y5, Canada. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, New York Aircraft Certification Office, 181 South Franklin Avenue, Valley Stream, New York; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bradford Chin, Electronics Engineer, Systems and Equipment Branch, ANE&hyph;173, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, New York Aircraft Certification Office, 181 South Franklin Avenue, Room 202, Valley Stream, New York 11581; telephone (516) 791&hyph;6427; fax (516) 791&hyph;9024. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on April 7, 1994 (59 FR 16574). That action proposed to require modification of the potentiometer lever stops on the nose wheel steering. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the single comment received. The commenter supports the rule. After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. The FAA estimates that 48 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. The cost for required parts will be minimal. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $7,920, or $165 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.

To prevent the airplane from departing the runway during takeoff or landing, accomplish the following: (a) Within 6 months after the effective date of this AD, modify the potentiometer lever stops on the nose wheel steering in accordance with de Havilland Service Bulletin S.B. 8&hyph;32&hyph;99, Revision `A,' dated July 26, 1993. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, New York Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, New York ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the New York ACO. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.
