Now the opposition is calling for civil disobedience. Andre Salifou, the former speaker of the interim National Assembly and leader of the opposition Union of Progressive Patriots and Democrats, explains their demands. [Begin Salifou recording] The (?UCI) [expansion unknown] is ailing. Democracy has been twisted for a year now, and the negative result is that our freedom of movement is not respected. What can we do in the face of such a situation? After a year of various attempts, I repeat, various attempts, to solve the issue, because we condemned the way things were being conducted in Parliament and I myself am a parliamentarian, nobody listened. We issued press communiques, most of which were censored, asking the authorities to change their methods. We also held rallies and organized demonstrations. We petitioned and sent motions to the head of state, the prime minister. We sent a number of letters without receiving a single response. The only recourse left to us is the use of an article contained in our Constitution. Article 6 stipulates that the Niger people can call the state to order. The second point of this article further describes any power, any regime that deliberately violates the present Constitution, as oppressive. That is why we will launch a campaign of civil disobedience, because Niger is stifled and threatened with chaos. We should stop this devilish machine that could crush the country and its citizens. [end recording] The Niger head of state, President Mahamane Ousmane, believes that the opposition should return to the negotiating table. To Mr. Ousmane, this call for civil disobedience is merely an emotional reaction from the opposition. [Begin Ousmane recording] The opposition is expressing its fears. This is absolutely normal in the context of freedom of speech, of democracy, and political pluralism. Everybody has the right to express himself, express what they think, their views and conception on what is going on in the world. However, we have a framework that is the Constitution, the parties' manifestos, the laws and regulations of the Republic. As far as I am concerned, the opposition is not questioning these fundamental elements. I also think that until now, the opposition publicized their intention to use Article 6 of the Constitution and call for civil disobedience. Therefore, I believe this is an emotional expression. With consultations and dialogue, everything will be fine. [end recording]
