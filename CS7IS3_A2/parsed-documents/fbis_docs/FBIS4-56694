It will not be easy to achieve results similar to those obtained in '93. Last year was a good year for the economy, but the positive trend did not extend to all sectors. The foreign trade trend, inadequate saving, and declining production profits were the sore spots. Nor are prospects for 1994 clear. Not only will the aforementioned factors persist, but the main forces driving growth are already beginning to flag. That being the case, it will not be easy to equal last year's results this year, whether in terms of growth, the industrial effort, price trends, or the exchange rate. 1. Economic growth: According to the DNP [National Department of Planning], the Colombian economy grew at a rate of 5.16 percent in 1993. If one excludes coffee, the figure rises to 6.46 percent. This is unquestionably a good effort, given the fact that it is the highest of the past five years. Furthermore, it was achieved in a context of low growth rates for the world economy and three years into the process of opening up the nation's economy. The pattern is uniform if one proceeds by sector. Financial and personal services rose over 6 percent, electricity, gas, and water by 12.6 percent, and construction by 9.3 percent. Agriculture, industry, and mining were below the general average (2.7, 1.9, and .1 percent respectively). Measures were recently adopted to restrict credit for the purpose of reducing liquidity and forcing a decline in overall demand. While this alternative does contribute to the anti-inflationary policy, it is disturbing in short-range terms that one would opt to limit demand instead of stimulating productive activity, given the existing productive capacity. 2. Manufacturing industry: According to figures supplied by DANE [National Administrative Department of Statistics], growth including coffee was 4.1 percent at the close of 1993 and 6.03 percent without it. The trend was not uniform throughout all sectors, however. In fact, roughly 44 percent of our industrial production, which generates 36 percent of all manufacturing jobs, is currently at a standstill or deteriorating. It is important to stress the extraordinary effort of the equipment and transport sector (45.9 percent), which was largely responsible for driving industrial growth. If we exclude this sector from the total including coffee, growth falls from 4.11 to a fairly unsatisfactory 1.8 percent. Nor did sectors linked to construction activity have a strong showing. In 1993, problems of profitability arose related to the process of opening up the market. On the one hand, sectors that ship a large share of their production to the foreign market were affected by the slow rate of devaluation. On the other hand, other sectors that focus more on the domestic market face competition from imports, both legal and illegal, competition that has prevented them from adjusting their prices based on cost trends. This is the case of tobacco, paper, rubber and rubber products, chemical substances, and professional and scientific equipment. Industry's prospects for 1994 are uncertain, although there is good reason to be optimistic about certain sectors. In its Macroeconomic Plan, the DNP predicts growth of 4 to 4.5 percent in the industrial GDP, explained by the increase in the amount of capital accumulated and expansion in overall demand. Factors that may stimulate industrial activity include the following: the foreseeable recovery of the world economy; moderation of inflationary trends; investments in development of the hydrocarbon sector; the vigor of public spending; growth in the construction industry, although at a slower rate than in the past; the anticipated expansion of regional markets as a result of integration; improved competitiveness resulting from decisions to convert and modernize production; and the availability of credit. The uncertainty in question results from: rising production costs associated with social security; the drop in real wages and increasing difficulties faced by regional economies, particularly Venezuela; the expectation of a larger revaluation; the persistent replacement of national production by imports; and the declining vigor of the automotive sector. 3. Inflation: One has to recognize that the current administration managed to check the upward trend of prices since the latter half of the 1980's. Industrial prices have demonstrated behavior consistent with the goal of reducing inflation. This situation is in contrast with the evolution in goods and services provided by the government, which have stayed at a level far above the general average. The reduction in the general level of prices was achieved at the expense of agriculture. For 1994, the government has proposed consumer inflation of around 19 percent. While this is a desirable goal, one does perceive any number of factors that could compromise its achievement. Topping the list is the fact that the agricultural sector will not continue to make a significant contribution to any reduction in the general level of prices. It is a fact to be taken into account when one considers that without the agricultural sector, the consumer price index has fluctuated about 25 percent over the past two years. At the same time, fiscal management and the control of those prices which the government does regulate will be fundamental if the goal is to be achieved. In this connection, one must recognize the government's commitment to adjusting rates to the anticipated rate of inflation. In other words, the major responsibility for meeting the goal of inflation set clearly falls on the government's shoulders. This is particularly so when one considers the fact that in industry and agriculture as well, the margin left for raising prices has been cut, among other reasons, by exposure to foreign competition.
