This was contained in a statement issued by the Egyptian Foreign Ministry today. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry's statement said that halting the fighting in Yemen has become an urgent necessity, which Egypt demands anew. The statement called on all Yemeni parties to refrain from attempting to impose a fait accompli by force, to give a chance to the efforts aimed at putting an end to the bloody clashes, and to spare the Yemeni people untold dangers. The statement stressed that a wise and responsible dialogue is the correct way to settle differences and safeguard the interests of the fraternal Yemeni people. The statement explained that since the beginning of the crisis in Yemen, Egypt, led by President Husni Mubarak, has exerted intensive efforts to prevent the differences from worsening and to avert the impending dangers to Yemen's unity and its people's unity. The statement said that in view of the deteriorating situation in Yemen in the past few hours, and that situation despite the mediation efforts, Egypt appeals to the warring factions to fully shoulder their responsibility before their people and nation, to stop the clashes immediately, and to realize that there will be no victors or vanquished. The statement said the Yemeni people will be the ultimate losers who will suffer from the unleashing of the forces of confrontation and aggression and from the destruction that will befall Yemen.
