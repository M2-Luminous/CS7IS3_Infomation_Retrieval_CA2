Are you going to fill these posts, or will the new ministers abolish the decision made by former ministers? [Moravcik] This decision made by the government is very unusual and is very strange. I think that our people could and should assess this measure and form their own opinions on the matter. We have not decided yet to rectify this decision made by the government. We want to have proposals this week so that we can fill the posts of state secretaries and heads of offices. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] From the citizens' point of view, the content of government activity will be the priority. What will be the priorities of the government? [Moravcik] The government will have only a limited period for its activity. The basic trends of its activity are already clear to us. The order in which I am going to list them does not necessarily mean what priority they are given. The new government will have to secure political stabilization and the calming down of the political scene. It will have to secure the normal operation of state administration and to stop the deterioration in some aspects of its activity. The government will have to focus on the economy because that is important for all other areas. I have said several times already that it is important to stop the negative trends that are becoming clearly visible in the economy, and to lay foundations for the new government to build on these foundations after elections. [Correspondent] The tasks that you have listed indicate that they will include measures that will be not very attractive to voters. Hence, from the point of view of a voter, this government may become less interesting. How do you view your role? Is it really going to be only until the next elections? [Moravcik] We believe that a realistic picture of Slovakia and especially of its economy should be presented. I think that, when a citizen gets such a true view of the reality, he or she will understand measures that are inevitable to secure a certain positive development of society after new elections.
