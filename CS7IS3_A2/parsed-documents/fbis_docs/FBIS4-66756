If only a quarter of these crimes are usually reported, this means that every year there are more than 250,000 people who take bribes and embezzle. This dangerous phenomenon has recently spread, with the number of bribe-takers and embezzlers growing daily. And it is not stopping: every day one finds several stories about bribery or embezzlement in the newspapers. The number is frightening and terrifying, and we do not know how big it will be in a few years. Why has the phenomenon spread? How can it be stopped, so that the hemorrhaging of public money stops and government employees regain their senses, their values, the teachings of their religion, and their loyalty to their country? There are so many examples that it is difficult to count and list them. They begin with a minor government employee who asks for a few pounds as a bribe; they end with a powerful and influential senior government employee who also asks for a bribe and exploits his power to get it. It is the same with embezzlement. It begins with a simple factory worker who embezzles a small amount of money; it ends with major embezzlers who embezzle thousands and millions. As just one example, none of us can forget the "big fish" of Nasr City and what he did with a large number of weak-spirited government employees, who wronged innocents, broke the laws, and wasted millions of pounds of these people's money. After him came "the little fish" (in comparison with the size of the big fish's misdeeds), and they also cost the people of Egypt millions in losses through bribery and embezzlement. A few days ago, the newspapers published two embezzlement stories on a single page. The first was "the arrest of the administrative head of Central al-Jizah District on a charge of bribery and misuse of influence." The second story was "a bank employee squanders 1.25 million pounds." When will the phenomenon end? Who will stop the hemorrhaging of public money. Who will prevent the loss of millions and of values and principles? Who? Bribery has become endemic in government agencies in our country. It is a phenomenon that constitutes a chronic disease--thus states the lawyer Ahmad 'Awdah. He adds: "It is an intractable disease, a malady that spreads and worsens every day. The situation now pleases no one. Those in need or requesting a service--the interested parties--get no results without somehow paying a bribe to 'Zayd or 'Amr.' There is no longer any business done anywhere without bribery or at least favoritism or influence peddling. In all cases the Egyptian citizen is the victim. Having admitted the existence of this sickness and vicious malady, legislation has not succeeded in eliminating it. In the past, bribery was a misdemeanor. Now it has become a felony with a deterrent punishment. Yet despite the increased penalty, the unfortunate phenomenon is becoming more and more common and the disease unfortunately is spreading. Toughening or increasing the penalty won't accomplish anything. Watching and oversight have accomplished nothing, because the watchdog or oversight agencies cannot hire a guard or policeman to stand next to every employee. What one can say is that the source of the problem is lack of integrity, ethical corruption, collapse of social values, and a weak religious conscience. Moreover, complaints against a government employee receive no attention. Complaints no longer avail because the official's superior does not side with the aggrieved citizen, but flatters the employee at the expense of the truth. In the end the citizen finds himself forced to pay." As for crimes of embezzlement, Ahmad 'Awdah points out that they are a betrayal of trust by an employee who is in charge of a public work or holds a deposit of money or goods in trust. "The betrayal in this case is considered a crime in the eyes of the law. Its punishment in government agencies is that of a felony. In nongovernment agencies it is a misdemeanor. Nevertheless, increasing the punishment will not succeed. Instead, we need to awaken the conscience, which in some people has died, in others has gone to sleep, and in yet others has become shaky. Can we awaken consciences and again stimulate the religious sense, the fear of God, and awareness of God's oversight in matters private and public? I hope so, though I think it will be hard to accomplish." Chief appeals court judge Khalifah al-Juyushi says: "Section 103 of the Penal Code stipulates that any public employee who asks for himself or another, or who accepts or takes a promise or the offer of a gift for the performance of any part of his duty, shall be considered to have taken a bribe and shall be punished by hard labor for life and a fine not under 1,000 pounds or over the amount he was given or promised. The criminal law concerning this item is not in need of change. The causes of bribery can be traced basically to weakness of the religious conscience, as well as the country's economic crisis and inflation. The bribe-taker is someone psychologically prepared to do so. The government needs to hold training courses for employees before they take up their duties. The information media has a large role to play in the phenomenon--television, radio, and newspapers. In this way, public employees will be ready to carry out the responsibilities of their positions. An attempt also must be made to solve our economic problems, especially unemployment." As for the law and punishment for bribery, they are quite sufficient and do not need to be increased or made more stringent. Section 102 of the Penal Code stipulates that any public employee who embezzles funds, papers, or anything else found in his possession by virtue of his position shall be punished by a term at hard labor. The punishment is hard labor for life in the following cases: 1. If the offending official is a local tax collector, his representative, a trustee for deposits, or a cashier who has been entrusted with money in that capacity. 2. If the crime of embezzlement is intrinsically connected to the crime of falsification or using a falsified document. 3. If the crime is committed in wartime and entails damage to the country's economic position or national interest. In my opinion, the problem is deficient religious conscience, as well as the grinding economic crisis. Also, there are the offender's own tendencies or psychological disposition before he commits the crime of bribery or embezzlement. Major General Faruq Hafiz, director of the department that investigates the implementation of sentences, says: "This problem and these figures do not constitute a phenomenon and should not disturb us. This is because the number of people who accept bribes or embezzle is insignificant in comparison with the population--about four per thousand. Human beings have produced crime since Cain and Abel. It diminishes or increases depending on apprehension and combat. Embezzlers have existed in every age and time at home and abroad. If there really is any phenomenon, it is the increased apprehension of crimes. This is a healthy phenomenon in the fight and a sure sign that the agencies are combatting crime. Moreover, crime is connected to social factors. The social factors in turn are connected to the conscience and an ethical revival. Embezzling is not related to the question of riches and poverty. A rich man is one who is rich in spirit, not rich in money. The large number of apprehensions should be credited to the government's oversight and regulatory agencies, which have indeed engaged in apprehension." Major General Faruq Hafiz added: "The crime of accepting bribes or embezzling has its causes. Sometimes it is the citizen who pays the government employee and presents bribery or embezzlement to him in a favorable light. We must not forget to emphasize that values have changed with the passage of time. Crime in all its forms will surely continue as long as there are human beings. The important thing is to fight it. Thank God the fight is going on and is strong!" Assistant interior minister Major General 'Adil al-Nahhas emphasizes that these numbers do not constitute a significant phenomenon compared to the population. It is an individual phenomenon involving certain weak-spirited employees. One cannot generalize from them to the great majority of honest government employees. We hear and read about the exceptions. There are employees who hold sensitive leadership posts, and we have heard nothing to cast opprobrium on them. Cases of embezzlement occur not only in Egypt; individual cases of corruption come to light in all countries of the world.
