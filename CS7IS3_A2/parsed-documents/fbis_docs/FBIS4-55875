Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) -- which led the field in the first round of voting -- declared that on the whole the "tone" of the electoral campaign was "acceptable" (MAGYAR NEMZET, 6 May), while National Electoral Committee Chairman Janos Nemeth said that "the campaign was less rough than expected" (NEPSZABADSAG, 9 May). Duncan Schiels, a spokesman for the foreign journalists accredited to Budapest, said that the campaign was so "calm" that it was "boring" (NEPSZABADSAG, 6 May), while a delegation of ethnic Hungarians from Romania who toured the country to monitor the elections stated that the election process was "incredibly civilized" compared to Romanian elections (HETI MAGYARORSZAG, 13 May). A "moderate tone" characterized the debate of prime ministerial candidates and party leaders, according to MAGYAR NEMZET on 6 May, and the voting itself was apparently considered fair in most quarters; no reports of violations had been observed in the media as of 11 May. Biased Television Coverage Alleged Although the election process was deemed satisfactory in general, some sources indicated that it was marred by a serious flaw -- Hungarian Television's biased coverage, which purportedly discriminated against opponents of the main government party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF). NEPSZABADSAG reported on 4 May that "the majority" of the parties were "dissatisfied with the behavior of Hungarian Television." According to the paper's 5 May issue, an MSZP spokesman declared that his party could show "proof" that the state television system was conducting a "negative campaign against the Socialists" and was "not neutral in its program policies." Similarly, Gabor Kuncze, prime ministerial candidate of the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), charged that although he expected the voting and the counting of ballots to be "legal," the lack of fair television campaign coverage compromised the election. "The fact that evening after evening the television drums the same opinions into the viewer without publicizing the other parties' programs is not only unethical, but also dangerous," because it prevents voters from making an informed choice, Kuncze said (NEPSZABADSAG, 4 May). The Independent Smallholders Party also filed a complaint saying that the main television news program gave no information about the party's program (MAGYAR HIRLAP, 22 April). Charges Against MDF Hungary's high court ruled invalid the charges that the MDF had abused access to government information for campaign purposes. After the SZDSZ accused the MDF of using government data to identify first-time voters and people who had benefited from the government's compensation program to send them campaign letters, the National Electoral Committee decided that the MDF had acted "against the law," but the decision was struck down by the Supreme Court. The Court said that the Electoral Committee had "no authority to condemn anyone" and that its accusation was also "faulty in its content" because the electoral law gives parties access to lists of citizens in specified groups "under certain circumstances." Saying that it had been vindicated, the MDF charged that the National Electoral Committee had lost its neutrality because the representatives of some parties on the multiparty committee, "especially the SZDSZ," were using the National Electoral Committee meetings to conduct a "political campaign" (MAGYAR HIRLAP, 22 April). Defaced Posters The campaign irregularity reported most frequently by the media was the defacement of campaign posters, but reports disagreed on the extent of the damage. NEPSZABADSAG on 5 May charged that campaign posters "nationwide" were pasted over with rival posters and that MSZP, SZDSZ, and Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz) posters were defaced with "slanderous slogans," including anti-Semitic graffiti. Other sources confirmed that defacement had occurred but suggested that it was confined to certain areas. Members of the ethnic Hungarian delegation touring Hungary before the election said that the posters they saw throughout the country were defaced only "in a very few places" (HETI MAGYAR0RSZAG, 13 May), while a "citizens network" that monitored the election indicated that anti-Semitic slogans and other graffiti were a problem in Budapest, including in the capital's 20th District (MAGYAR HIRLAP, 4 May). Other Alleged Irregularities According to the "citizens network," the defacement of posters was just one of "countless refined and crude" attempts to "consciously mislead" voters. Some parties and candidates, said the group, were guilty of "cheating" in the process of gathering nomination slips and of making verbal attacks that violated electoral ethics. In some cases, the group alleged, nomination slips were stolen from mailboxes and sold "in large numbers" for 300 forints, while in the city of Vac, representatives of the far right Hungarian Justice and Life Party -- which ended up with less than 2 percent of the vote nationwide in the first round of balloting -- toured gypsy neighborhoods by car and illegally collected "masses of nomination slips" for their candidate. In addition, said the group, although the election ethical codex stipulated that the parties were not allowed to "denigrate" each other, there were "plenty of examples" of insulting behavior. One such example, the group said, was a campaign letter sent out by the MDF candidate in Budapest's third district which charged his MSZP opponent with "demagogy," with making "unfounded and unfulfillable promises," and with trying to "create false nostalgia, which can lead to the strengthening of the left" (MAGYAR HIRLAP, 4 May). Little Violence The media reported few violent incidents during the campaign. The SZDSZ charged that in the city of Gyongyos on two occasions its campaigners were beaten up by members of the MDF's youth organization (NEPSZABADSAG, 6 May). In another incident, Fidesz activists were attacked by unknown assailants in Budapest, but the victims were not certain that the attack was politically motivated (BESZELO, 28 April).
