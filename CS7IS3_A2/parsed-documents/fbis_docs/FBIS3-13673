This transpires from Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's letter to Rabbi 'Ovadya Yosef. Our party affairs correspondent Yaron Deqel obtained a version of the letter, which paved the way for SHAS' [Torah Observing Sephardim] return to the government. These are the four points that Rabin promised SHAS: The Declaration of Principles with the Palestinians and the Cairo agreement will not be reopened for negotiations; Jerusalem will remain the united capital of Israel and under complete Israeli sovereignty. Rabin also promised Rabbi Yosef not to compromise with the Palestinians on the right of return, except for cases of family reunification, and that any peace agreement involving a return of territory will be brought for a public decision by means of a referendum or elections. Rafi Edri, who is directing the negotiations with SHAS on behalf of Labor, submitted the coalition agreement with SHAS as well as the letter to Rabbi 'Ovadya Yosef to the Knesset's table.
