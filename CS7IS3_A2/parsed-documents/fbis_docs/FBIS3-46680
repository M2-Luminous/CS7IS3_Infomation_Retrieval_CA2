Airlines are experiencing delays of over an hour to their scheduled departures from Narita Airport, the air gate to Tokyo some 70 kilometers to the east. Two or three JAL flights a day are being delayed for more than an hour each day. JAL officials said they are resorting to emergency measures to ensure passengers are able to transfer to other flights at their destinations despite the delays. Russia says the flight restrictions, sent as a formal "notice to airmen" on December 28, are a safety measure following a deterioration in the reliability of radio communications equipment and will last until March 27. The restrictions limit the number of civilian flights out of Japan and passing near Khabarovsk to a maximum of six per hour, one third of the previous frequency. Between 40 and 50 flights use this route into and out of Narita each day but each must now await clearance from Russian authorities even if all passengers have boarded and they have completed departure procedures. Aviation experts in Japan said the deterioration in the radio link could be due to cracking in equipment because of freezing.
