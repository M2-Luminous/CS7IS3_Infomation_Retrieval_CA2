The National Assembly belongs to all strata of the population. Unlike in Vietnam, other countries do not have superior monks and bishops in their national assemblies. Vietnam's National Assembly brings together representatives of all strata of the working population in society. The national assemblies of other countries assemble political forces in society, which include rightist, leftist, and communist parties. For instance, there are no representatives of Buddhists in their national assemblies. Our National Assembly now must decide things for itself, for nobody else makes these decisions for it. Whether its decisions are right or wrong, it must be responsible for them to the people. The budget is insufficient. Whereas in other countries the national assemblies will be removed if they fail to fulfill their responsibilities to the constituents, this does not happen in our country yet. However, as it represents all strata of the masses in society, Vietnam's National Assembly has the foundation on which it can make sure that its decisions serve the interests of society as a whole. The National Assembly contributes to foreign policy successes. In late October 1993, a delegation of the National Assembly visited many countries in eastern and northwestern Europe. National assemblies are the organs that ratify the agreements of governments. Through contacts, legislators understand one another better and create favorable conditions for the implementation of the agreements that have been signed. The bilateral and multilateral activities that our National Assembly has taken part in would facilitate the implementation of the agreements among governments. The timing of the delegation's tour -- the end of October 1993 -- was also very beneficial. That was the time when the national assemblies of those countries discussed their budget and the major policies for 1994. Through exchanges of views, the national assemblies of other countries seemed to have a good understanding of Vietnam's renovation and to lend their support and encouragement to increasing investment in Vietnam. To apply the experiences of other countries' national assemblies. In our recent visit in a number of countries, we exchanged with their national assemblies our experience in the legislative process. We have just begun to do legislative work, which other countries have been doing for a long time. The question that was raised was how to make laws and how to organize the supporting machinery in order to allow it to work effectively. In all other countries, legislators are professional people, but they are not in Vietnam. This is why when we apply other countries' experiences, we must consider Vietnam's actual conditions. We will step by step improve the activities of specialized committees. Right in the current session, the evaluating reports of our committees are judged as being of very good quality. Our committees will be strengthened and given more specialized work. The supporting component must be made better and stronger so as to carry on its work of assisting the National Assembly sessions and preparing documents for the deputies to read and study in advance. We will also reorganize the Office of the National Assembly; improve the ways to organize offices, committees, and scientific research libraries in regard to jurisdictional issues; and provide the Office of the National Assembly with additional modern means.
