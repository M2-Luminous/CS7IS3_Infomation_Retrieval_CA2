Snisarenko; date and place not given; also excerpts from Tyulkin's statements first published in VECHERNIY LENINGRAD] [Text] Although central Russian newspapers wrote not a line about this, the first secretary of the Russian Communist Workers' Party (RKRP), V. Tyulkin, made a short working visit to Tyumen during these last few days. Possibly it is because the number of RKRP members is now equal to the number of subscribers to TYUMENSKAYA PRAVDA, but all the same it was to the editorial office of TYUMENSKAYA PRAVDA that Viktor Arkadyevich made a visit in the first hours after his arrival in the Tyumen region, and he answered the questions of the newspaper's political commentator, V. Snisarenko, openly and completely frankly. Anticipating the above-mentioned conversation, TP [TYUMENKSAYA PRAVDA] offers readers excerpts from recent statements by V. Tyulkin, the texts of which were published on the pages of the January issues of the newspaper VECHERNIY LENINGRAD. On the work of the current State Duma: "The opposition represented by the party called the RF Communist Party, the Agrarian Party, and others will not play a fundamental role for two reasons: a) because the inefficiency of the Duma is laid in its very mechanism (not one decision will be adopted without the president's approval); and b) because in themselves the opposition parties are essentially unable to fight for the fundamental interests of working people and are at best focused on passive defense." From the statement of the organizational bureau of the RKRP Central Committee, signed by V. Tyulkin: "In violation of the Law `On the RF Referendum' and generally accepted norms of civilized states, Boris Yeltsin conducted a kind of population poll. Defending the people's right to independently decide their fate and relying on current legislation, the RKRP cannot recognize the diktat of the minority which has seized power in the country and is appealing the results of the poll to the Supreme Court of Russia (in accordance with Article 35 of the Law `On the Referendum')." On the predictions for a radiant future: "... We should expect maximum reinforcement of all components of the repressive apparatus: the police, the procurator's office, the courts, the political police, political investigation, and censorship... I very much regret having to predict the appearance of something like political terrorism in 1994. The regime has overstepped the line of legality too far, and too many people no longer believe in any possibility of civilized, reasonable talk, accusing the communists and the patriots of speech making, naivete, and constraining the energy of the masses. Unfortunately, these forces of resistance may appear." And here is what we were able to learn on a number of other questions during our in-person talk with him. On the lack of unity between the RKRP and the RF Communist Party: In the opinion of V. Tyulkin, the leadership of the present RF Communist Party consists of those people whom "Boris Nikolayevich classifies as sensible communists, people with whom he is prepared to sit down and has already sat down at the negotiations table." In practice only the RF CP leadership, in V. Tyulkin's opinion, has to a certain extent betrayed the ideals of the communist movement, in fact redirecting it onto the opportunistic footing of social democracy. And we should not talk about disagreements between the concepts and views of the situation among ordinary members based on their related parties. Ultimately this internal unity will still make itself known. On immediate plans: To actively participate in the local election campaign for the organs of representative power. The final goal is the Councils of Working People (although V. Tyulkin even acknowledged that "Yeltsin's people managed to make great progress along the path of totally destroying the `labor unity' which even yesterday was powerful. To work toward increasing the number of local party members. Let us assume that tomorrow the RKRP wins the elections and takes power in the RF into its hands. What will the first steps of its authority be?: To immediately suspend present-day privatization. Present-day millionaires and billionaires will have to report on the legitimacy of their wealth. To take the present structure of commercial banks under strict control, restoring the controlling monopoly of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation in this sphere. In addition, to immediately take steps to fight corruption and crime. In light of this, V. Tyulkin explained that abandoning the privatization now being conducted by the present regime does not mean taking any repressive steps against those who are honestly engaged in business on the level of private property or joint stock forms of commodity production. To summarize the RKRP position overall, it may be defined as total opposition to the present authorities and to the course of economic reforms they are conducting. V. Tyulkin said the purpose of his present trip through the regions of Russia is to familiarize himself with the situation locally and with the sentiments in labor collectives, as well as to make the activity of the basic organizations of the RKRP more concrete. He confirmed that in protecting the interests of the working masses, the party stands and will continue to stand on the cornerstone principles of the Leninist RSDRP [Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party]. That is what he said.
