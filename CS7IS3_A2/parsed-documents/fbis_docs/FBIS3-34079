In a meeting with Deputy Majlis Speaker, Hojjat ol-Eslam Dr. Hasan Rowhani, he criticized international forums for keeping silent towards the five year-old Armenian aggression against the republic and accused them of adopting impractical measures. He described Iran's Majlis as a "democratic, free and independent parliament" and said Azerbaijan could well benefit from Iran's experiences in the legislative field. He appreciated Iran's assistance to the peoples of Azerbaijan and Nakhichevan and hoped for expansion of mutual relations in all areas. Rowhani said that Iran condemns any aggression against the Azerbaijan Republic and believes that any change of borders will put regional security and stability in jeopardy. Iran believes that military confrontations cannot bring any permanent settlement to the Karabakh conflict and that the dispute should be resolved through political and peaceful means, he added. Rowhani stressed that Iran and Azerbaijan should promote bilateral cooperation especially in the economic, parliamentary, scientific and cultural fields. He also expressed Iran's readiness to participate in economic projects in Azerbaijan especially in agriculture, industry, oil and joint operation in the Caspian Sea.
