In this connection the remark made by the British Prime Minister John Major yesterday did not come out very optimistically; in connection with the Partnership for Peace program as well as in connection with our possible entry into NATO, he mentioned only Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. This was, however, not the first time that Slovakia has been somewhat forgotten. What do you see as the main reason for western countries adopting such an attitude? [Meciar] In the case of Mr. Major, this did not amount to a fundamental political attitude. He was merely citing countries as an example. What was decisive for us were the discussions which we had with the U.S. delegation last Sunday, and those discussions were positive. They involved several important areas. The first one was that the question is no longer of who will join NATO. The question is only when and how. The second fundamental question is that the United States has an interest in the security of the Slovak Republic. It belongs to its sphere of immediate interests and we also discussed ways of what kind of guarantees should be given to that security. The third important area is that the Slovak government accepts without any reservations and comments the Partnership for Peace in the form it has been proposed. Already today the government has instructed ministers to set up a working commission to enable us to be among the first ones to conclude that agreement. We are not concerned to be the first in respect of wanting to compete against time, or in terms of prestige. We merely want this matter to be resolved as soon as possible. The contractual principle will enable contractual adjustments to all relations which are of interest to both sides. They involve both our interest and the interest of NATO. Furthermore, in Prague tomorrow, apart from this question, we will also discuss bilateral questions of Slovak-U.S. relations. Here, too, we are interested in intensifying them. The message Mrs Albright read out to me as the message from President Clinton was more than encouraging. [Reporter] Would it be possible to say at this moment that after the recent talks with Mrs Albright our chances for gaining entry to NATO are good? [Meciar] They are at least as certain as Polish, Hungarian, and the Czech Republic. They are not worse. [Reporter] Prime Minister, this is in effect your first interview for the media this year. I would therefore like to ask you what the government's working program will look like this year. [Meciar] The government will devote itself to fundamental problems in 1994. [passage omitted] It is necessary to focus on practical problems and not on questions of who is against whom and who will triumph over whom. The outcome then will be commensurate with what we want to achieve. Parties which will want to cooperate with us will find partners in us. [Reporter] Another meeting of the parliament is approaching. It is rumored that apart from the proposal to dismiss Minister Hofbauer, the opposition is again gathering support to force a vote of no confidence in the government. It has been even reported in the press today that Mr. Cernak [chairman of the Slovak National Party] has been having talks with some representatives of the Hungarian political parties in this connection. Are you aware of these attempts, and how do you assess them? [Meciar] To force a vote of no confidence in the government, it is necessary to secure 76 votes in the parliament. If they are gathered, then the vote of no confidence will succeed. I regard this, however, as hardly probable. Talks between political parties about when and how to overthrow the government have been going on for several months even in the highest places. This is borne out by the call made by Mr. President on 1 January 1994 which I regard as very unfortunate and inappropriate. As regard circumstances determining political peace -- everyone has to know what he or she wants to provoke. There is no other alternative to the government. It would be simple to drive the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia into opposition but who would then form a constructive government? To provoke elections may mean for those who are sowing the wind at present that they will not be in the next parliament. Decision making in this respect is therefore relatively complicated. I regard privatization issue as being the key problem that will face the January plenary session of the parliament. The Party of the Democratic Left has made certain proposals that would lead to a system that would be akin to Treuhand used by the Federal Republic of Germany, in its eastern part, which I regard as rather unfortunate and inappropriate for the Slovak economy and economic policy. We shall therefore have to discuss it to ensure that the matter is resolved if possible before the parliament meets. [Reporter] It has been rumored that a certain tension is prevailing in the government. It has been specifically rumored that Vice Premier Roman Kovac and minister Moravcik may be dismissed. Can you either confirm or reject these reports? [Meciar] Two conditions must be met if they are to be dismissed from their posts, either the parliament forces a vote of no confidence in them and I know nothing about it, or the premier will propose their dismissal and I also know nothing about it. [Reporter] The recent Saturday meeting in Komarno is still, so to say, a hot issue. What is the government's stance to the results of this meeting? [Meciar] Roman Kovac, as the first deputy premier in charge of minorities issues, is authorized to take stance on behalf of the government. As for the Komarno meeting, it has to be perceived from several points of views, and the possibility of assessing it varies accordingly. It begins by assessing the declaration which continues in a pressure system calling for a certain arrangement that would eventually stop, and ends by assessing the definitive goal, the secession [sentence as received]. This is already an area where such statements and political interests come into conflict with the constitution. The territorial set-up must be perceived from a broader perspective, not merely as a set-up determined by the language. [passage omitted] We need to build the republic on the principle of civic solidarity and not on the language principle. [passage omitted] It is important that citizens of Hungarian origin distanced themselves from those who think that they can speak on behalf of all. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Does it mean that you consider the results of the Komarno meeting to be legitimate and that you are going to discuss this issue or that you are going to deal with it in a more systematic way? [Meciar] I am not going to discuss the integrity of the Slovak Republic's territory and its division, or steps that could lead to the violation of this territory, with anybody. There is nothing to discuss. This is a topic that will not be discussed with me. As for the demands that are related to some of the requirements regarding the state administration, there can be an opinion on small districts [obvod] that are to be be defined within the territorial set-up. However, no ethnic principle will be applied in Slovakia. It is not possible for us to force somebody from Medzibrodie to travel to Komarno to get his planning permission, and lose two days just because of that. That is absolutely unworkable. There are also a number of other activities that cannot be carried out in this way. To summarize, the territorial set-up being drafted by the government reflects the historical development of Slovakia. It reflects either the large counties [zupa] after Czechoslovakia was established or the territorial set-up that was in force here until 1960-61, or -- in the event that they are not satisfied, there is the danger of returning to three large regions [sentence as heard]. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Thank you for the interview.
