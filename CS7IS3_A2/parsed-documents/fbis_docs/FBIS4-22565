Some Results of the Economy's Performance for Two Months"] [Text] According to the State Committee for Statistics, the republic's economic situation has worsened. In January and February, compared with the same period last year, the national income dropped by 33 percent. The volume of industrial output stood at 63.5 percent. Mutual indebtedness rose sharply, and large stocks of unsold goods accumulated. In many enterprises, indebtedness for shipped goods and stocks exceed monthly and even two-month volumes of production. As of 1 January, the volume of finished goods stood at 30.7 percent of all goods produced in December; as of 1 March, that figure was 47.2 percent of the total in February. As of 1 March, enterprises were overstocked in the amount of 2.114 billion rubles. The assembly line producing goods "for the warehouse" is busier than ever. At the Belshyna Combine, remainders of finished goods at the beginning of this month amounted to 76.3 percent of the total February volume (almost everything they produced went to the warehouse); in the Minskbudmateryyaly Association such goods exceeded that volume by 22.3 percent; in Palimir the figure was 1.9 percent. A total of 1,642 enterprises and organizations--21.3 percent of the total number--started 1994 with losses. In January, total losses stood at 268.9 billion rubles. Industry's profitability was 12 percent in January (versus 22 percent in January of last year). In February, 21 enterprises did not operate at all, and many only worked part time. In the two months, the production of consumer goods stood at 70.3 percent, with food accounting for 69.4 percent. Hence, their availability to the trade declined. Supplies of meat and meat products in January and February stood at only 49 percent of last year's level (supplies to inter-state stocks increased to 131 percent). Retail trade turnover declined by 52 percent in January and February. The State Committee for Statistics explains that the drop in sales of goods in the domestic market is due to declining production of them, to rising prices, and to the further decline in people's real income. The level of real income (income minus obligatory payments and contributions, taking account of consumer price index adjustments) in February was 73 percent of last December's level, which in turn was much lower than the previous year. According to data of the State Committee for Statistics, the consumer price index for February was 118.7 percent of January's; compared to December, prices on goods and services rose by 1.7 times. The State Committee for Statistics believes that the main reason for the higher rates of inflation in recent months is the rising cost of energy and the increased exchange rate of the Russian ruble in the Inter-Bank Currency Exchange. At the same time, the State Committee for Statistics draws the following categorical conclusion: "The disarray in the financial and credit system is also due to the unjustified setting of the exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble compared to the Russian, which is many times greater than the actual purchasing power of the Belarusian and Russian rubles" (?!). The Committee says that it and Russia's State Committee for Statistics ran the calculation "using a methodology that is most like the one used in the international comparisons of the UN." What was the outcome? "On the basis of a comparison of the cost of a standard array of 97 basic food and nonfood items in the prices of each of the two countries, a parity of purchasing power was determined; in September it stood at 1.16 Belarusian rubles (whereas the currency exchange rate in September was 1.5); in October it was 1.4 (from 1.5 to 3.0); in November it was 1.72 (6.10 to 4.15); in December, 2.22 (4.15-4.51); in January--2.63 (4.51-4.00); and in February--2.85 (3.95-6.19)." In other words, the exchange rate is to blame.... All we have to do is set the "correct" course and everything will go fine.... It's too bad the market exchange rate, which promptly reacts to daily realities--and market laws in general as well--is not susceptible to the methods of the State Committee for Statistics (by the way, wasn't it the introduction of these methods that launched the attempt to close the currency exchange?). It's too bad that the exchange rate is set not by calculations but by the urgent, momentary, pressing need for Russian rubles (incidentally, this momentariness has become constant), that it is influenced by enormous unsecured credit emissions which also encourage production "for the warehouse," the extremely negative balance of payments (the indebtedness of the republic's enterprises to enterprises in other countries as of 1 February exceeded 487.9 billion rubles. The greatest share of the total indebtedness--88.9 percent--was owed to Russian enterprises). Isn't it the reverse? Isn't the current exchange rate a product of our economic reality? Although actually, it isn't even a matter of whether the exchange rate is low or high--it's a matter of its stability, and of course it would be a good idea to influence that as actively as possible.
