The former Army or security services officers will be joined by a further 30 Israeli recruits at the end of the month to "train specialists in urban guerrilla warfare," according to Israeli newspaper YEDI'OT AHARONOT. Aged between 21 and 27, the mercenaries have been lured to the West African troublespot by wages of between 2,000 and 2,500 dollars a month. Their job description is "advisers" whose role will be to "protect democracy." The Congo has entered the second week of a fragile peace following a ceasefire between armed factions supporting Lissouba and main opposition leader Bernard Kolelas at the end of January. The Israeli mercenaries were recruited on the strength of a 50-million-dollar military accord between the Israeli arms firm Levdan and the Congo Government. YEDI'OT AHARONOT has named Levdan chairman Reserve General Ze'ev Zakharin, 45, who trained the pro-Israeli militia in southern Lebanon, and two of his aides, reserve colonels Yisra'el Ramot and Hayim Boru, as the chief recruiting officers. Eli, a 26-year-old former commando, told the daily that Boru, his one-time superior in Lebanon, contacted him two months ago. "We agreed to meet in a Tel Aviv cafe where he explained the details of the mission after offering a salary of 2,000 dollars a month. Living conditions are very tough in the Congo." "The mercenaries live under canvas under military discipline, but Colonel Boru told us we could make a lot of money," Eli added. Volunteers signed a one-year contract before being vaccinated against a range of tropical diseases, YEDI'OT AHARONOT said. One clause in the contract obliges the mercenaries to keep quiet about Levdan's activities. Last week YEDI'OT AHARONOT reported that opponents of Lissouba had contacted Israeli officers and businessmen trying to recruit 500 soldiers to mount a coup in Brazzaville. The opponents described themselves as the "Liberal Party" and promised to grant oil and mining concessions to Israel once they seized power. Bloody clashes, in which more than 200 were killed, erupted between Congo's Government and opposition factions last year after October elections in which the president's supporters won a majority in parliament. The Congo renewed diplomatic relations with Israel in 1991 and the Levdan contract is considered by the government in Jerusalem as one of the biggest military assistance deals of recent years.
