The president spoke about of ways of strengthening Kazakhstan's statehood, and its domestic and foreign policy for the near and distant future. Touching upon the causes that led to the current situation in the Republic, which is characterized mainly by negative processes and instability, economic crisis, decline in production, and growing inflation, the head of state then continued to dwell upon the best ways of developing market reforms and democratizing society. This path has been deliberately chosen by the people. We should focus our attention on monetary and credit policy and bank reforms, and should take into account the needs of a sovereign state and of the market economy. Its main task is to combat the galloping inflation and strengthen the national currency. "We should," the president said, "strengthen financial discipline both in the budget and in the sphere of activities of banks and enterprises. Otherwise, it will result in uncontrolled hyperinflation, the last [words indistinct]." He thinks that all the country's spending, except for the most important, should be cut down--such as allocations for paying wages, pensions, and social benefits [words indistinct]. Limited credits should be granted only under efficient programs and projects. Enterprises operating in the red should be made bankrupt in the near future. All benefits with regard to taxes and dues should be cancelled. The government should not pay any dubious debts and nonpayments of enterprises and banks, and minimize spending on maintenance of the state bodies. Along with this [words indistinct] of the major foreign investors to participate in reforming the basic branches by means of holding international tenders. Prices should be released for all types of goods and services, including bread prices. The low income families would be paid the difference. The Finance Ministry should exercise tough control over the revenue and expenditure parts of the budget. Any kind of lobbying should be excluded. The National Bank should be freed from supervision by the legislative and executive bodies, [word indistinct] aimed at stabilizing the tenge. "It will not be easy," the president said, "a great number of enterprises will come to a standstill, the number of unemployed will increase, as well as a number of unhappy people, who will call for demonstrations and blame [words indistinct]. We will have to withstand all this. There in no turning back." In addition to all these, we will have to address new issues in the area of privatization and developing the private sector and competition, he said. We should encourage production and labor [as received] and create an efficient and powerful mechanism for social protection of the population. Legal reform should support economic reforms. Of great importance is the creation of [words indistinct], the atmosphere of stability in the Republic, and national and civil accord. If we do not achieve all this "then we will be on the verge of disaster." In connection with this, the head of state [words indistinct] "those who are trying to rub people the wrong way, disrupt national accord and civil peace, should bear responsibility for this in strict compliance with the law of our country." He criticized [word indistinct] approach to migration processes, which have to be studied and managed so as not loose a skilled and active part of the population, and suggested adoption of a new law on languages and to abandon discrimination of the Russian language. [passage indistinct] Nazarbayev paid a good deal of attention to the issues of citizenship. He reminded of the decree that was adopted this year in February on making amends to the relevant decree on simplifying the procedure for acquiring citizenship and reducing the time needed for this. Apart from this, a memorandum on citizenship was signed at the end of March during the visit to the Russian Federation by the head of our state. Now, "the settlement of this issue depends on Kazakhstan and Russian parliamentarians," Kazakhstan is unique in terms of the number of ethnic groups that are living here. The president said that a unique cultural space exists in Kazakhstan -- Russians and Kazakhs being the main groups. Therefore, we should pay equal attention to the development of the two but, at the same time, we should not ignore the others. According to Nazarbayev, we can achieve this if only "a legal basis is [words indistinct] for the development of culture. We should eradicate race discrimination and create equal opportunities for all Kazakhstanis." The leader of Kazakhstan urged parliamentarians to adopt a package of documents that will take into consideration the interests of every ethnic group and national interests. Only by doing this can we strengthen and build interethnic accord and ensure civil peace. Nazarbayev put forward a number of other proposals aimed at achieving consensus between [words indistinct]. Two of them exclude each other. "All parties, movements, and mass media should reach an accord on strengthening peace, friendship, and stability in the Republic, especially at this difficult transitional time, and second, to legalize and introduce tough sanctions against those who encroach on sociopolitical stability, be it citizens, political, public movements, or the mass media." According to the president the first one is more advantageous. The president also spoke about the Euroasian union, further reforms in legal, executive, and juridical branches of power, deepening market reforms, cutting inflation, and raising the living standards of people. He also spoke in favor of the two-chamber parliament that will oust the discredited practice of adopting laws. Nazarbayev thinks that it is necessary to carry out comprehensive reforms in the Judicial Branch of power already this year. In particular, he thinks that it is necessary to abandon the division between arbitrate courts and [word indistinct], to legalize the principles of unchangeability of judges, and to introduce the norms [word indistinct]. With regard to the recent Supreme Council session which expressed a vote of no-confidence in the socioeconomic and legal policies of the government, the head of state urged parliamentarians not to rush [passage indistinct] At the same time, we should exercise tough control over its activities, and if need be we should render it relevant support and correct its mistakes.
