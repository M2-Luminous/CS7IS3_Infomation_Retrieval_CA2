"After checking out with all of our units, I positively state that no shell whatsoever has been fired for days from our positions on the broader area of Alipasino Polje," Gvero told TANJUG. "Judging by reports in the Moslem media and the media which indiscriminately pick up such reports, the Moslem propaganda machinery has again staged another anti-Serb performance," he said. Moslem reports say that the shell fired on Alipasino Polje on Saturday killed six children and one Moslem soldier but "give no names of the victims, which may be significant," said Gvero. "If the incident actually took place, and I very much fear that it did, then it was nothing but a repetition of the breadline massacre in Sarajevo's Vaso Miskin Street in 1992 when Moslem criminals and warmongers murdered 16 innocent civilians," he said. The speed with which Moslem Premier Haris Silajdzic urged Butrus-Ghali to approve air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions is indicative of this scenario, said Gvero. "The Moslem propaganda machine has deliberately disregarded the opinion of U.N. officials that the perpetrators of the incident could not be established, and has been quick to tell the world that the deadly shell had come from Serb-held nedzarici." "We are sure that the world has woken up to the transparent set-ups of the Moslem war propaganda," said Gvero. "This time we have every right to expect the world to condemn the Moslem leadership for its evidently stage-managed attack on its own citizens, who were children in this case which makes matters worse, and who were sacrificed to the higher interests of war." "We expect protests and condemnation to come also from the Moslem people who are being made the collective victim of the blind irrationality of their religious leaders," said Gvero.
