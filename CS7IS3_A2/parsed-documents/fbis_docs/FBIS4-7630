I must also say that he smokes a little and, as it appears, is overdoing it a little. How are you, Mr. President? Are you a good patient? [Havel] I have a feeling that I am a perfect patient because I take all of the medication prescribed, I am in bed as I am supposed to be, and I am even smoking less. But I really do not like talking about my health or physical problems, and, if I remember correctly, I talked about my viruses extensively in "Conversations at Lany" three weeks ago, so I would very much not like to talk about it now. I should only like to add that the viruses are very unremitting. Simply, we have not been successful in destroying them. That is why I am undergoing a cure again, and I hope I will finish my cure once and for all soon. [Hulkova] How do you feel mentally? It is known that it very much influences the curative process. [Havel] I have been completely alone here for a few days. Admittedly, I am being guarded by my bodyguards, but they keep a fair distance from our house, and I like the loneliness very much because, when I am in Prague, naturally, I am surrounded by people from morning until night and have little time for this kind of concentration and contemplation, for reading. It is from this viewpoint that the treatment suits me. [Hulkova] Let us return to when you were still healthy. You met at one of your regular quarterly meetings representatives of the parliamentary clubs. On such occasions, topical issues are usually discussed. It seems to me that one of the most topical is the method of elections to the senate. Was this issue discussed? [Havel] Yes, you are right. It is a subject discussed a lot in our media, and, at the moment, it is very topical so we could not avoid it, either. However, it was not the main point of our talks. [Hulkova] You are often accused of changing your mind on this issue. How do you look at it? [Havel] I noticed that I was being suspected of this...[pauses] I am a bit surprised because I have always had the same opinion on this matter. Perhaps it will not do any harm if I repeat it. First, I have never been particularly partial to a two-chamber system. However, the opposite view won--namely, that we should have the senate. This issue was organically incorporated into the Constitution and is an integral part of it. I think we should honor the Constitution, and, therefore, the senate should be elected this year. In my opinion, we would be making a strong attack on the common legal consciousness if we treated the Constitution according to our whims, if we incorporated into it an institution with a firm standing, and, then, because of negligence or failure to agree on the election procedures, if we did not establish this institution. [passage omitted] I welcomed the constitutional undertaking that the senate would have to be elected on the basis of a majority voting system. I am a champion of the majority voting system or at least, of a combined voting system. [passage omitted] [Hulkova] According to my information, you talked about non-profit-making organizations with the deputies. Why is this such a problematic subject all the time? [Havel] Much to my pleasure, I learned that all, but really all, of the parliamentary clubs agreed with me on the enormous importance of this whole sphere of non-profit-making organizations, about which I already talked in these conversations some time ago and intend to go on talking about. They consider it to be extremely important that the law regulates this sphere and agree that there is a need for more laws on this to be passed by the end of this year so that they could start being enforced by 1 January [1995]. The present situation is very bad. It was inherited from the communist era, which has divided organizations into so-called budgetary and contributory organizations. These are, in effect, bodies controlled by the state by means incompatible with democratic conditions. All democratic countries have different structures [in this field]. The whole sphere of educational, health, cultural, and many other undertakings are regulated by special laws. [passage omitted] You asked why there was such resistance against [regulating] this area. I am not quite sure who is resisting, but I was pleased to acknowledge that it was not parliament. Transformation of this whole non-profit-making area will require, at the same time, the restructuring of this area, and it is a process comparable, for example, to the whole process of privatization. [passage omitted] [Hulkova] Is the idea of power part of this problem? [Havel] Of course, it is connected with power because the issue here is related to decentralization of power. [passage omitted] Imagine, for example, that, in a highly charged, very dramatic situation, the citizens would be entranced, lulled by a political tempter who gains a lot of votes and wins, and then it transpires that he is a madman. The point is that the state must be able to continue, to flourish, to function, even if it is temporarily headed by this madman, until he is replaced by somebody else. This is one of the reasons I have undertaken to draw attention to this sphere of non-profit-making organizations because they are a joint part of decentralized, structured, civic society, in which everybody takes a share of responsibility for public affairs. [Hulkova] Because we have come to this point, can I ask, as editor of Czech radio. which is a public body, about an issue of direct concern. You may know that the guardian of our treasures, Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, does not agree to radio license fees being increased. However, because we do not have laws that would punish those who do not pay, Czech Radio finds itself in a sad situation. What is your opinion? [Havel] It is narrowly connected to what we discussed before with the non-profit-making organizations. After all, radio is such a non-profit-making organization. This is very difficult. On the one hand, it is obvious how important it is for this type of public body to exist. Look at radio or television. If they are going to be purely profit-making, they would not be able to fulfill to such an extent their aim of reflecting independently the world as it is. The same applies if they are exclusively state-controlled because then they are dependent on the state. [passage omitted]
