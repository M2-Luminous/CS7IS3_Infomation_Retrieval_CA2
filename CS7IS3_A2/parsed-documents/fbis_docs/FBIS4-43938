It can now play the role of a medium-sized power focusing mainly on Europe. The author of this article is a professor of international relations at the University of Milan's Department of Political Science. Foreign policy is back in the news after a long hiatus. Immersed as we have been in the collective psychodrama of the change of political system, the elections, and the new government, the external world seems to have disappeared. When a political system collapses and a new coalition is formed, with new political forces, it is natural for attention to be focused on domestic policy. This is so true that the sole controversy to arise during the brief period of the forming of the Berlusconi government concerned the designation of the minister of interior rather than that of the foreign minister. On the other hand, the tendency to neglect its foreign policy and concentrate on its domestic policy is part of the Italian tradition dating back to the postwar era. During that period, however, there was the bipolar international system, which marginalized the role of the weaker players and in any case guaranteed Italy's security. But today, things are radically different, and for at least two fundamental reasons. First, because Italy has a government made up of a new political elite that has yet to demonstrate its ability to project itself to the outside world. And second, because the others are watching us, and frequently voice criticism. Regarding the first point, there is nothing to say or do but await the testing of the new government, then evaluate its performance. On the second point, however, there is much to be said. It seems to us, in fact, that the reactions of some of our allies and friends, in Europe and even across the Atlantic, have been at the same time lively, somewhat conformist, but above all, exceedingly of alarm. The prime minister did well in Rome, as did the foreign minister in Brussels and Washington, to reassure them and emphasize the continuity of and the government's adherence to Italy's alliances. Even so, it is evident that the new government will have to change some things in foreign policy as well. Not so much in substance, which seems to be the fear of some abroad, as in style, which does not mean a nation's external manners, but rather the synthesis of its political behavior, or more precisely the image presented to the outside world by a nation. The style of Italy's foreign policy during the postwar period was essentially characterized by a low-profile approach; that is, an approach lacking initiative or imagination. In substance, its style expressed a way of being on the scene that was conformist and flatly aligned with the decisions of its major allies. This approach, rooted in ideology, translated frequently into imitative decisions, and sometimes into flights from reality. Europe, for example, as an institutional plan of unification, is and remains, together with NATO, one of the two cornerstones of Italian foreign policy. No thinking person today could make a case for being against this concept of Europe, just as, for years now, no political party except Communist Renewal has been opposed to NATO. Indeed, the polls indicate that Italians are the most Europe-minded of all. Why, then, should anyone be worried? To succeed in changing for the better, it is probably necessary to revisit some key concepts that have been buried in oblivion by the dominant ideologies. The first of these should be that of national interest, an indispensable prerequisite for any European policy. Then there is the international role of a country that has always confused its role with rank; that is, settled for second best. And lastly, there is need to reflect on the concept of Italy as a medium-sized power; that is, as a national player operating in a geopolitical and regional economic context in which, by the force of things, it will be compelled to take a position. By habit, dating back to a distant past, Italian foreign policy has been characterized alternatively by either the frustrated and fanciful ambitions of a great power, or the fears and excessive bashfulness of a small power. To update its foreign policy, therefore, Italy needs to recognize the fact that it is a medium-sized power, that it is a player operating within a grid of international alliances made up of autonomous actors, just as France, Great Britain, or Spain are. In other words, Italian foreign policy must recognize the fact that, with the United States in the process of disengagement, Germany aiming at a political rebirth, and a Europe partly in trouble, Italy cannot once again decline to be present in those areas in which none of its allies are interested. It is therefore neither a question of contesting alliances or revising boundaries, nor one of continuing the old way of choosing ideologies, whereby political adversaries are by definition mortal enemies to be demonized. If these premises are taken as a basis, the principal lines of Italy's future foreign policy can already be outlined. If its style is made more incisive, and if the compass indicating the direction of Italy's foreign policy points, as it always should have, toward our national interest and recognition of our role as a medium-sized power operating in a predetermined context of alliances, it will no longer be necessary to respond to the captious questions of our allies, and to the less elegant caveats of our neighbors to our east and south.
