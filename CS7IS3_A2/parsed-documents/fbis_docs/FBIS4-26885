Today, June 28, is the 40th anniversary of the proclamation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, namely, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence. The five principles, co-initiated by China, India and Myanmar (Burma), were born at a time of rising national independence, the editorial says. "The five principles, following the new trend of international relations after the Second World War, reflected the newly-independent countries' common aspirations, which were to preserve sovereignty, oppose aggression and maintain peace." The past 40 years have shown that the five principles, summarizing the fundamental tenets in world affairs in simple, clear language and in line with the United Nations Charter, embodied the basic features of the new international relations, the article explains. As noted by Deng Xiaoping, observing the five principles is the best way to handle state-to-state relations, the article says. The five principles have stronger vitality than "big family", political grouping and sphere of influence ideas among all norms directing international ties. Now, with the end of the Cold War, a new international pattern is emerging, featuring multi-polarization. The world is undergoing profound changes and great adjustments, so all countries have an urgent need to establish new international political and economic order which is fair and reasonable. Mutual respect of sovereignty and non-interference in each other's internal affairs are at the core of setting up the new international order. Every country's people have the right to choose their own social system and life style. Only the five principles, not hegemonism and power politics, can stand trials and work to build the new world order, the article stresses. Equality and mutual benefit are important parts of the five principles, and are of major realistic significance in concerting international economic relations. At present, each country, in order to formulate the new international order, should adhere to the five principles to strengthen co-operation, as the world economy coalesces and economic factors play an even more important role in international ties. China, initiator and loyal observer and defender of the five principles, has enormously enriched the spirit of the five principles by pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace, the article points out. From norms regulating relations between countries with different social systems, China has developed the five principles into standards guiding and dealing with affairs concerning all other countries. In conclusion, the article says, the five principles will be honored in the future for their contribution to constructing a better world. The Chinese people have made up their mind, it notes, to continue their efforts together with other peoples to carry forward the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.
