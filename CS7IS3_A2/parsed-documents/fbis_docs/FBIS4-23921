The property it is now planning to sell will not be able to cover its total debt, which means it is technically bankrupt. These developments naturally place a serious question mark over the ANC's ability to control the country's economy. According to sources within the ANC the movement has a huge debt to settle. In selling its foreign assets, the value of which is estimated at 20 million rands, only part of that debt will be paid. In order to lighten that debt burden even further the ANC will possibly have to lease some of its office space at its headquarters, Shell House, in Johannesburg. Some members even suggested putting the entire building on the market and then leasing space in the building for the organization. One of the projects to which the ANC is paying attention is the compulsory payment of levies by their officials. An ordinary ANC MP will apparently have to pay 750 rands per month to the ANC, while a minister will be asked to pay 2,000 rands. This technical bankruptcy explains why it was decided to give such high salaries to politicians. Before the election Mr. Mandela said that the time for "fat pigs" [preceding two words in English] was over, while it now appears that that time has only just arrived. If the politicians do not receive those high salaries then they will not be able to help the ANC out of its misery. These salaries are paid by the taxpayer, which means that the ANC is indirectly being lifted out of its bankruptcy by the taxpayer. This is the first scandal to confront the Mandela government. Meanwhile, a second scandal has also come to light. Minister of Land Affairs Mr. Derek Hanekom initially indicated that he was not interested in one of the expensive official cars because his portfolio only requires a pickup truck for the dirt roads of the rural areas. Now it appears that his truck is an expensive imported model costing as much as the official cars, if not more. With this sort of financial discipline (or rather the lack of it) the fears of economists for the future of the country are not unfounded.
