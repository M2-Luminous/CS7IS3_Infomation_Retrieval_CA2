The document includes recommendations, and it reviews issues that range from exerting financial control over decentralized institutions to eliminating the Finance Police. The document, which bears the number 96-94/SCN, is dated 22 February, and a copy of it was provided to TIEMPO in Congress. The document contains the text of a motion approved by the legislative body regarding a total of 41 recommendations on various issues. The document also conveys claims being made by National Congress President Carlos Flores Facusse regarding a government plan. The official note was sent to the members of the economic cabinet and the Government Secretariat to enable its recommendations "to be considered in the Economic and Administrative Action Plan that will be prepared by the executive branch and be presented to the National Congress." The recommendations include resuming the practice of verifying all invoices in the Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula offices; extending the practice to La Ceiba, Puerto Cortes, Santa Rosa de Copan, Danli, and Choluteca; and gradually establishing this practice in cities with a slower commercial pace. The reestablishment of the fiscal lottery also has been suggested. Another proposal involves "placing more emphasis on recovering pending debts to the state by clamping down on defaulters by way of lawsuits; not handing over goods without prior payment of import duties; and suspending vehicle permits for Hondurans and alien residents who fail to pay import duties and license fees, with the exception of tourists who can prove their transient status." Other recommendations include effectively preventing the underpricing of imports and exports, establishing administrative and criminal sanctions for offenders, and maintaining special control over the smuggling of goods and the introduction of tax-exempt vehicles, as well as the obvious underpricing of shrimp exports to the United States. It is also recommended that a modern computer system be created in combination with the Honduran Central Bank to control the authorization and use of foreign exchange and prices on exports and imports to guarantee the correct settlement of customs papers. The installation of electronic guages to keep a tangible record of the production of fuels as well as the production of alcohol and spirits, and to establish a computerized system to estimate the oil differential [diferencial petrolero]. Another suggestion is to conduct administrative audits of the current transactions involved in exporting coffee to determine the extent of compliance and to protect fiscal interests in accordance with current laws and regulations. Although Liberal Party deputies are killing themselves to find supporters in customs, in the document they urge "the recruitment of capable and qualified personnel into the country's Customs Division to bring under control the high degree of tax evasion resulting from the underpricing of goods and excessive appraisals at the moment the settlement of papers takes place." The document adds, "a law against contraband and tax evasion should be approved with harsher penalties than the current ones for offenders, the Finance Police should be eliminated, and a computerized accounting system to verify the entry and exit of consumer goods in the country should be sought." Another suggestion is to exercise control over revenues earned by the national press and similar organizations, such as agricultural schools that earn money through sales related to agricultural-livestock services. Additional recommendations include exerting financial control over the Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise, the Honduran Corporation for Forest Development, and the National Children's Board to determine the amount of revenues, expenditures, and investments; examine the financial situation of the National Agricultural Development Bank; and issue strong measures with the cooperation of the judicial branch to ban games of chance.
