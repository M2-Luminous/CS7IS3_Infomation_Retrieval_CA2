FBIS4-56428 "drlat086_b_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-086 Daily Report 3 May 1994 Haiti Civilian Mission Report on Raboteau Slaughter Civilian Mission Report on Raboteau Slaughter FL0305225094 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in French 1030 GMT 3 May 94 FL0305225094 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio French BFN [Excerpts] The international civilian mission sent a team of observers to Gonaives on 27 and 28 April to investigate the claim that numerous people had been killed by the Army in the Raboteau neighborhood. According to the military authorities in the city, the events were caused by a group of terrorists led by Arnault Mtayer, also known as "The Cuban" and an Aristide sympathizer. He was reported to have attacked the Raboteau outpost on 22 April to rouse the population to solidarity with the rebels of Borgne. These attacks reportedly forced the Armed to retaliate and to pursue the group of terrorists who were attempting to escape by sea aboard small craft. Military authorities pointed out that six persons died during the operation. The mission has not been able to collect convincing testimony or evidence to corroborate the Armed Forces officials' version of the story. According to numerous pieces of information that agree, it seems that, to the contrary, Army members were at the root of the problem. As early as 18 April, two military personnel, accompanied by a local leader of the Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, fired shots at Mr. Mtayer's home, which they subsequently ransacked. They arrested his father, Ludovic Mtayer, 65. On 22 April, soldiers in greater numbers invaded Raboteau early in the morning. They attacked and plundered about 10 houses and assaulted their inhabitants before summarily executing numerous people, whom they had driven out of their homes, onshore and offshore in small boats. The victims included travelers. [passage omitted] The mission determined that at least 12 persons had been shot to death by soldiers wearing tactical unit uniforms. At least one witness showed the observers mounds where six to eight persons were reportedly buried. According to concurring reports, bodies floating in the sea had been washed ashore. Members of the Haitian Armed Forces had prevented the families from burying them. The observers reported that several people had been injured during the military operation and that most of them had gone into hiding, preferring to avoid hospital treatment for fear of recognition. Finally, it appears that the Roboteau neighborhood, especially lower Raboteau, has experienced a massive exodus following these events. The civilian mission very energetically condemns the slaughter of innocent civilians in Raboteau, the extent of which surpasses all other indiscriminate attacks committed by elements of the Armed Forces since the arrival of the mission in Haiti. It therefore requests that the High Command begin a thorough inquiry to establish who was responsible for this horrible slaughter.
