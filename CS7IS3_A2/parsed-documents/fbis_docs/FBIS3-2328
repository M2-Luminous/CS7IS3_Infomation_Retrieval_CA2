It is learned that the nuclear plant will house six 600,000- kilowatt nuclear power units, and that upon completion, it will become a key point for electric networks in central and eastern China. At present, the Ministry of Power Industry has officially confirmed and approved this nuclear power project and preliminary stage preparatory work is already underway. Upon completion, the nuclear plant will be able to thoroughly resolve the electricity shortage of Jiangxi province.
