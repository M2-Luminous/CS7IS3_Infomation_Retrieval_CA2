In its end of year message, the NNLC has warned the government to stop threatening political parties in the country. The party said government must realise that without political parties, the British Government would never have granted independence to Swaziland. The statement signed by the NNLC President Dr Ambrose Zwane and the secretary general, Mr Africa Mhlanga, said both the Prime Minister and his deputy should not pretend to be ignorant of this as they are witnesses. "Both Mbilini and Sishayi Nxumalo were on the side of political parties when all this took place, they must not pretend to have forgotten so quickly. There can be no democracy without political parties. The international community is pressuring non-democratic countries like Swaziland and Malawi to change their government and parliaments towards the direction of multi-party democracy." The NNLC says South Africa has accepted the challenge, Malawi is in the process of changing, Mozambique has accepted multiparty democracy, and both Lesotho and Botswana have also accepted it. "Why should people think Swaziland should be alone -- no man is an island, and therefore, our country Ngwane -- Swaziland -- cannot afford to be the only country in Southern Africa that has not accepted democracy. The Swaziland Government now calls itself a new democracy, they have not yet fullfilled the big question mark, who opposes them in parliament?" The NNLC said this is a question the masses were asking them during the Tinkhundla review issue and are still asking in 1994. "This is a ten thousand dollar question for Prince Mbilini and his cabinet." The party claimed that the 1993 elections were a minority affair not an event involving the entire nation. It claimed that statistics have proven that 25 percent of the people entitled to vote participated in the elections. The NNLC also cited a number of contradictions to what is going on, different to the recommendations of the Prince Mahlal'engangeni Tinkhundla Review Commission. It said page 45 of the report states clear that the House of Assembly should be a wholly elected house, i.e., none of its members are to be appointed. NNLC says the aim of the recommendation was to retain as far as possible, the democratic composition of the house based on the direct election of the house by not diluting the house with appointed members. "The NNLC has always recommended that parliament should consist of 60 members elected on a basis of single member constituencies on a basis of one man, one vote and one woman, one vote. We decry the tendency to mix the meaning of the word constituency with Inkhundla [traditional community council]. Inkhundla in our opinion is a conglomeration of chieftancies gathered for evil political purpose." The NNLC said paragraph 48 of Prince Mahlal'engangeni's report states that the majority of speakers at the Mbabane Inkhundla did not want the Tinkhundla system altogether.
