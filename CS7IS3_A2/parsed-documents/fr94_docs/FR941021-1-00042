FR941021-1-00042 FR941021-1-00009 The FAA agrees that the existing standard relating to blood pressure is outmoded and does not reflect current medical knowledge or practice. It also finds that current §67.13(e)(5) is medically vague and does not serve a useful purpose. Accordingly, it proposes that the provisions of §67.13(e) (4) and (5) of the FAR, including the table, be deleted and replaced by new standards (proposed §§67.111(b), 67.211(b), and 67.311(b)) applicable to all classes of medical certificates. It proposes that average blood pressure while seated not exceed 150 mm Hg, systolic, or 95 mm Hg, diastolic. For ease of application, the agency will not introduce into the standard the additional suggestion that the systolic pressure never exceed 160 mm Hg. The proposed standard would require more extensive assessment of airmen who require or use antihypertensive medication. To maintain first-class certification, the assessment will be required at least at annual intervals, usually with every other application. For second- and third-class certification, valid for 1 year and 2 years, respectively, the assessment will be required with each application. Unless otherwise determined by the FAA under the special issuance provisions of the FAR, certificates will be valid for the normal periods and, in most cases, issued by the designated AME if there are no adverse findings. These procedures are included in current FAA guidelines. This proposed amendment would clarify the FAA's concern for the cardiovascular risk represented by hypertension and the agency's position that persons who are undergoing therapy for hypertension should be evaluated to assess the degree of risk. Though these standards are being codified for the first time, this evaluation does not represent a new practice. Cholesterol Currently no cholesterol standards exist in the regulations. In consideration of the responsibility for public safety held by airmen exercising pilot privileges in air transport operations, the FAA has partially accepted the recommendations of the AMA Report that the level of blood cholesterol be determined as part of the examination for medical certification. The Risk Factor Committee of the AMA that considered risk factors and qualifications for flying suggested that serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels be determined for all applicants initially and at 50 years of age. The Cardiovascular Committee of the AMA, however, recommended that a determination of serum cholesterol be made only for 50-year old applicants for first- and second-class medical certificates who exercise airman duties in single-pilot commercial operations. Both committees recommended further evaluation if a level greater than 300 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) of total cholesterol is found. The FAA proposes (proposed §67.111(f)) that total serum cholesterol be tested annually as part of the examination of all applicants for first-class medical certification who have reached their 50th birthday. Unlike a single determination, an annual requirement will assist the FAA in the identification of adverse trends in cardiovascular risk factors as airmen age. Applicants whose cholesterol level is determined to exceed 300 mg/dl would be required to undergo an additional cardiovascular evaluation to determine if significant disease is present, but issuance of a medical certificate would not be withheld solely on the basis of the cholesterol level. The FAA agrees with the AMA Report and with the National Institutes of Health regarding the importance of this risk factor for disease and believes that the additional cost to the holders of first-class airman medical certificates is justified by the more effective identification of disease. By limiting this requirement to first-class certificate holders 50 years of age and older, public benefits are enhanced with minimum costs by targeting the population having the greatest risk and greatest public responsibility. The FAA does not consider feasible the AMA Report recommendation that the serum cholesterol level requirement be limited to persons who exercise airman duties in single-pilot commercial operations. Individual airmen frequently perform in a variety of commercial operations or change from one type of operation to another. There are no regulatory controls for limiting applicability of such a requirement to single-pilot commercial operations.
