FBIS3-11990 "drlat060_m_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-060 Document Type:Daily Report 24 Mar 1994 Brazil Brazil, PRC To Share Tracking of Satellites PY2803133294 Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 24 Mar 94 p 11 PY2803133294 Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL Language: Portuguese Article Type:BFN [Article by Luiza Pastor] [Text] Science and Technology Minister Jose Israel Vargas and Shen Rongjun, Chinese National Defense, Science, Technology, and Industry Commission vice chairman, on 23 March signed an additional memorandum to the agreement currently in force between Brazil and the PRC for the launching of two remote sensoring satellites. The document establishes rules for sharing the task of the two satellites' telemetry and route control, as well as the responsibility of each country in this supervisory process. According to the agreement's terms, during the first 12 months after the launching of the first satellite -- the SSR-1, which is scheduled to go up in October 1996 -- tracking and control will be conducted by PRC experts. Brazil will be responsible for the control for the next six months, and then the PRC experts will resume their duties for two more months. A decision on who will control the satellite during the approximately two more years of its useful life will be made later by the two parties. As to the second satellite -- the SSR-2, whose launch date still has not been decided yet because it depends on the first satellite's performance -- PRC experts will monitor the satellite's first eight months in orbit, Brazil will control the next six months, and the PRC experts the six months after that. The agreement also officially established that any damage to the satellite while under the responsibility of either of the two parties will have to be paid for by the country controlling the satellite at the time. The formula for this payment, however, still has to be studied and the decrease in the satellite's value will be taken into account. Funds to finance the Brazilian part of the agreement total $50 million, while the overall cost totals $150 million. Oscar Klingel, chief of staff for the Science and Technology Ministry, said these funds are guaranteed by President Itamar Franco's political decision. This decision was confirmed to the PRC experts last year, when the Brazilian Government decided to assign resources from the privatization of state-owned companies to the program. According to Klingel, the Brazilian Government already has disbursed 50 percent of the overall cost, and $16 million from last year's transfers are in the hands of the INPE [National Institute of Space Research]. According to the negotiated terms, the satellites will be launched from the Tai Yuan base, Shanxi Province. The satellite will be put in orbit by a "Long March" rocket from the PRC "Great Wall" company. Throughout their useful lives the satellites will transmit information on climate and the subsoil, which will be analyzed by Brazilian and PRC experts.
