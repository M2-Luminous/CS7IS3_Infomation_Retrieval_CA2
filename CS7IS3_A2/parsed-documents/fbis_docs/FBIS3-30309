There is no alternative to this process, which became possible only after the change in regime. "This agreemeent provides a favorable framework for the acceleration of economic and social modernization. "Hungary's integration into Europe is one of the most efficient safeguards for the country's security. "Accordingly, joining the European Union as a full member is a strategic objective, and a foreign, security, and economic policy priority for the Hungarian government. "Attaining this aim is a national program which determines Hungary's internal development and the country's place and role in Europe. "To realize this national program, the government strives to exploit all the possibilities offered by the European Agreement, and develop constructive cooperation with the European Union member countries and other associate countries in Eastern and Central Europe. "The Hungarian Government is aware that reaching the level of development required for integration is a complex task which necessitates further significant steps in economic transformation and the related social care. "Fulfilling the economic policy tasks aimed at meeting the requirements of integration is a precondition for the modernization of the Hungarian national economy and the country's long-term stability amd social peace. "In this effort of historic importance, the government reckons with the creative contribution and support of all citizens. "The government expresses the conviction that Hungary will strengthen and enrich the process of European unification with its political, historical and cultural heritage forming an integral part of European heritage, national characteristics, internal development since the change in regime, and contribution to stability in Europe."
