Later it turns out that no specific decisions are made after those announcements are made. What exactly is going on? [Wilecki] All declarations should be evaluated wisely, without unnecessary emotions. Military officers and politicians differ their way of evaluating certain phenomena. Western commanders are pragmatic; they really are supporters of fast integration of Poland with the NATO structures. Politicians, however, act in the context of current configurations and political situations. I am an optimist. Contrary to the views expressed by some people, the "Partnership for Peace" program is not a subterfuge of the West. It has drawn us closer to NATO. [Cielemecki] Perhaps politicians are looking at the problem of extending NATO to Poland as some kind of a stick against Russia? [Wilecki] I do not think so. Compared to Russia, Poland is too small and weak to be used as a stick, as a bargaining chip. I do not think that NATO politicians had such intentions. Placing Poland opposite Russia would not serve stabilization in our part of Europe -- either on the political or on the military platform. [Cielemecki] Janusz Onyszkiewicz evaluates that the changes recently taking place in the Army management structures, which limit civilian control over it, will prolong the Polish road to NATO. [Wilecki] I am able to understand the reaction of Deputy Onyszkiewicz. Right now he is a politician of an oppositional party. He is also the author of organizational changes which he introduced when he was the defense minister. I must admit that in many areas they were justified and rational. However, one must also understand the needs of the Armed Forces, which must be allowed a certain autonomy in its activities. In Western systems these issues are not explained unequivocally as well. Generally, I am a supporter of civilian control over the Army. However, not only control, but also duties toward it. Civilian politicians may display their skills and capabilities, among other things, by constructing a broadly-understood defense system. [Cielemecki] What are the limits of the Army's autonomy, do you think? [Wilecki] They must allow it to be efficiently steered and managed. Control over the Army must not mean tying its hands and prolonging the decisionmaking process. [Cielemecki] However, oppositional politicians voice the opinion that Minister Kolodziejczyk has broadened this autonomy too much, that he simply subordinated the Ministry of National Defense [MON] to the General Staff. Is it true that the future general inspector of the Armed Forces will be beyond any control? [Wilecki] The Polish Army needs a commander for peace time as well. Right now it practically does not have a commander -- the commander is neither a minister nor a head of the General Staff. Such a function might be fulfilled by the general inspector of the Armed Forces. At this point I would like to explain one thing: I really am not "dying" to fill that post, as some people think. The recent changes do not mean MON's capitulation. Please note that the previous civilian minister wielded enormous power over the Army; he took advantage of the old legal regulations, in line with which this function was fulfilled by the top-ranking general. Now, can a civilian politician, who often does not even have the elementary military education, command the Army? I do not think that we should lament over the recently-imposed limitations of the role of the so-called civilian section. They do not mean that the Army is getting out of control. MON is managing, steering, and exercising political supervision over the Army. Besides, there is also the parliament, the president, as well as the Supreme Control Chamber and the spokesman for civil rights. The area of civilian power over the Army is still vast. One must say, however, that this supervision is not always sufficiently coherent. [Cielemecki] What, then, should it look like? [Wilecki] A debate on the defense system is being prepared in the Sejm. If it is a substantive and constructive debate, if all the problems related to the defense system are noticed, then it will certainly be possible to agree on a coherent control system. Its shape should be decided by politicians; they should bear in mind the broadly-understood political and state interest. [Cielemecki] Still, you and Minister Kolodziejczyk probably do not think very highly of the competence of the Sejm deputies who decide defense issues? [Wilecki] Let us not generalize things. In the Sejm, in the Defense Committee, there are many parliamentarians who know a lot about the problems of the Army. There are also others -- for example those who have not done their stint in the Army and their contacts with the defense system have been next to none. [Cielemecki] When the fight for the budget money is going on, the military men warn that the Army has found itself in a critical situation, that it is simply dying. However, when the context of the discussion changes -- when the subject of the discussion is our rapid integration with NATO, which does not need weaklings, it turns out that the situation of the Polish Army is not all that bad at all. General, what is your evaluation of the force and combat efficiency of the Polish Army? [Wilecki] I am embittered that the civilian decisionmakers, who should take good care of the financial condition of the Army, are not fulfilling their tasks. We heard promises that as soon as a civilian ministry was established, it would be a guarantee of greater funds for the defense system. This is not what actually happened. A modern army cannot be built without money. [Cielemecki] However, you have not answered my question fully. [Wilecki] It is not possible to make an unequivocal, synthesized evaluation. The Army has not only good segments, but it also has many weaknesses. Generally, it possesses modern combat technology; however, there is too much old equipment. An additional problem is that even though the limitations of Cocom [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] have been abolished, our arms industry is not able to immediately manufacture equipment that would meet world standards. We also cannot afford to import much armament. Such a situation -- before the industry adjusts itself to new requirements -- will last several years. NATO has armies with great potential; we cannot match them. However, there are also weaker and smaller armies. I believe that our Army might already today be placed among the medium-sized armies of the organization, perhaps even a little higher. [Cielemecki] Integration with NATO means first of all convergent standards, technical compatibility, uniform command systems, similar norms, and so on and so forth. However, it also entails "compatibility" of a different kind -- of the people, first of all of the generals and high-ranking commanders. Most of them come from a different epoch, they are saturated with different models of thinking, they cherish different values. [Wilecki] I agree that not all the people in our Army are top-flight aces. However, the same is true of the West; in the West there are weaknesses as well. I can assure you that we have no reason to be ashamed of our command cadres. Now, as for their mentality and habits, the art of war is the same both here and there. Already now in many areas of a general nature our Army is compatible with the Western Armies. [Cielemecki] During exercises, on staff maps our own troops and the troops of our allies are marked red and those of the enemy are marked blue. As recently as a few years ago NATO Armies were blue on our maps. Who is now playing the role of "the blue"? [Wilecki] Now we do not define our enemy that specifically. During exercises, our own units fight against each other; they are assigned appropriate roles. This is the best way to resolve political dilemmas: Who is the ally and who the enemy. [Cielemecki] However, any armed conflict has a defined, political undercurrent. Is it not an oversimplification of the art of war to eliminate this factor in exercises? [Wilecki] The best art of war consists of the following: Being strong, well-organized, and literally prepared for everything. We adhere to this principle in building and organizing our Armed Forces. We do not do this with a concrete enemy in mind. We are rather interested in certain canons which are binding in a given period. [Cielemecki] President Walesa has often pointed at the concentration of the Russian troops in the Kaliningrad Oblast and called it a threat to Poland. How do you -- as a military officer -- evaluate this threat? [Wilecki] In line with the recently-concluded international resolutions, Central Europe should be a zone without excessively concentrated military units. The situation in the Kaliningrad Oblast is really disconcerting and it should be thought over. One cannot help asking the question: Does such a far-flung military point serve only the military interests of Russia? Well, but this is a dilemma not for the military, but for politicians. In my opinion, there should not be such highly militarized areas in the new Europe. [Cielemecki] Two years ago a document called the "Polish martial doctrine" was drawn up. Today it is mentioned increasingly more seldom; its shortcomings are stressed. What, do you think, the main defects of our doctrine are? [Wilecki] It has partially lost its political validity. In the substantive section, however, it is still valid and we are taking advantage of it in the transformation of our Armed Forces. [Cielemecki] Both Polish and Western commanders -- especially Americans -- have already several times said that joint military exercises would be organized. Next there came a rumble from Russia and the issue of joint military undertakings was always moved to an indefinite future. Will they ever be held? [Wilecki] This moment is drawing near very quickly. Appropriate decisions have already been made. This year joint exercises will be held -- for the time being at lower levels. These will be maneuvers with German, Danish, and French units. The idea of joint exercises of aircraft and naval formations is being entertained. I would not like to list any dates and the scale of these undertakings, because detailed agreements are still being discussed. It looks like we are also going to participate in joint Polish-American exercises. We are conducting an exchange at the staff level with the most important ally armies. It is the requirement of the nature of military cooperation that before the units of Poland and NATO stand side by side on a training field, all factors be thought over, including the training factors.
