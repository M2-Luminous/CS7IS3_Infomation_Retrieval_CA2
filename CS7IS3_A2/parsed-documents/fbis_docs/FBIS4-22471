MVD Workers Are Confident That Only Professionals Can"] [Text] The Analytical Center for Socioeconomic Policy under the Administration of the President of Russia, headed by Petr Filippov, has prepared and submitted to Boris Yeltsin a document titled: "Organized Crime and the Prospect of Nationalists Taking Over Power in Russia." A number of the media have published it. In the opinion of the Center, the growth of organized crime, which has infiltrated organs of the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and local executive authority, jeopardizes Russia's economic and political development. Professionals from law enforcement organs are not indifferent to this information either, but they have their own attitude toward the conclusions of the analysts. Today we offer the reader an opportunity to become familiar with two of these opinions. Vladimir Rushaylo--chief of the regional Administration for Fighting Organized Crime (RUOP) of the Moscow GUVD [City Internal Affairs Administration], militia colonel: "As a practical worker responsible for the situation in Moscow, first of all I have doubts about many of the figures and generalizations presented in the document. For example, the thesis that `70-80 percent of privatized enterprises and commercial banks are forced to pay extortion money.' It would be stupid to deny it--such things exist, but to say that the absolute majority of enterprises are under the heel of criminal groupings is irresponsible at best. We know that this kind of information used to be disseminated by the criminal groupings themselves so that potential victims would reconcile themselves to paying them off without making a fuss. "Incidentally, the criminals are also interested in disseminating the information that `all the militia is corrupt, there is no one to place our hopes in.' This is a kind of shocking-paralyzing statement for the victim: To resist, to defend your independence--is pointless, the power of the mafia is boundless, it is better to pay the money. From the same category comes the assertion that gangster formations everywhere have informers in organs of the militia, and state automotive inspection. I think that here too they have been laying it on too thick. There are informers, of course, but only a few. We regularly `round them up.' During the past year the Moscow RUOP has discovered 29 militia workers who have committed various kinds of official crimes. We do not deny this, just as we do not intend to tolerate traitors, and we will fight fiercely against them. "The analysts advised the president to put together new formations consisting of people who have never before served either in the militia or in the Ministry of Security. And they suggest using in operations for suppressing organized crime workers temporarily assigned from other cities. As a practical worker I can say that for Moscow, for example, this method is not very acceptable. Operationally, the capital is such a complicated city that even native Muscovites usually adapt fully to the normal professional standard only after three to five years of working under the conditions of the capital. What about when it comes to work in the militia? "The document's authors are under the impression that almost all the activity of subdivisions for fighting organized crime can be reduced basically to conducting raids and rounding up criminals, which affects only the small fry. But how is it then that in Moscow alone recently we have managed to bring criminal charges against seven thieves operating within the law? The professionals understand that the leaders of criminal groupings are unmasked only as a result of in-depth operational developments and penetration into the criminal environment. "But if it did come down to raids, police lines, inspections, and ambushes, these too are absolutely necessary in daily militia work. Here is a summary of the results of one of the recent Moscow operations: 225 crimes uncovered, more than 30 units of firearms and 53 bladed weapons confiscated, 49 stolen motor vehicles found. In one day! "There are suggestions that simply need work. Take just the idea of granting law enforcement organs the right to preventive detention for up to three months without charging individuals who are suspected of organized crime. In Tatarstan, for example, they introduced such a rule, the territory was purged of gangsters, and...they immediately moved to Moscow. Such decisions must be made at the state and not the regional level. "Subdivisions created relatively recently for fighting organized crime are quite capable of fighting it today, but this requires well-considered legal instruments as well. And the dissemination in the press of documents like the note from the Analytical Center does more to advertise organized crime than help fight against it. It is necessary to begin with a serious reformation of the investigatory apparatus, with the introduction of an alternative form of investigation in keeping with the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation entitled `Gangsterism,' whereby the courts, when examining such cases with clear indications of gangsterism but without the necessary proof, will return the materials for further investigation. And when the people arrested have been caught red-handed--the question of the convictions should be decided in the shortest possible periods of time, without reducing liability or punitive measures." Azaliya Dolgova--president of the International Criminological Association, doctor of jurisprudence, professor: "From the standpoint of the problem raised in the materials of the Analytical Center, there is nothing basically new. Except for one thing: In the subdivisions that will be fighting organized crime there should not be...workers of the MVD or the former Ministry of Security. Where did this kind of disrespect for organizations on the leading edge of crime-fighting come from? If there are complaints--they should be concretized. Each case should be investigated legally--and only after this procedure should those who have been penalized be prohibited from working in the new subdivisions. "Look at the position in which law enforcement organs have been placed today. The criminals are becoming more brazen with each passing day, they are arming themselves, and they are strengthening their ties with corrupt bureaucrats of the higher echelons of power. And no legal base has been created for fighting against them. So in the absence of legal instruments the workers have had to use force that is sometimes unjustified. We are coming closer to a real danger of punishment of criminals on the spot. Those who are objecting to the adoption of the appropriate laws today are also provoking this. "Another question for the analysts: Where do they intend to gather up these professionals? Invite them from the West? Or call in scholars from academic institutions who provide theoretical knowledge for practical workers? We are now engaged in a persistent war against crime and the enemy is taking the offensive. And instead of introducing fresh professional forces, even after achieving success they want to begin to settle scores with everyone left in the trenches--the authors of the document are proposing: `All for the state!' What is the enemy doing during this time? Naturally, he is continuing to attack. And what are the `people in the trenches' doing? Of course, they are starting to philosophize: Is it worth the struggle? "The idea itself of creating special services, of course, is productive. It is worth considering from all angles. But it cannot be embodied without resolving the key problems of the organization of the fight against crime as a whole. Without reforming criminal procedure and operational investigatory activity. "We must not arbitrarily change units in a system--this will necessarily warp other of its elements. As a result of serious work, the analysts have come to extremely sore spots in society. But instead of turning to professionals they simply deny them the right to work. And our esteemed workers from the Analytical Center have forgotten about many essential elements without which a persistent struggle is simply impossible, or else they have considered them to be of less importance. For example, the fact that our legislators have not yet adopted a law on corruption in combination with a law on organized crime--new deputies of the State Duma are even lobbying for this unified mechanism for fighting the mafia." From the dossier of the Main Administration for Combating Organized Crime of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation--the results of 1993: "Promising signs of stabilization of the dynamic of the growth of crime have appeared. In spite of predictions of certain specialists, in 1993 this indicator rose by only 1.4 percent, while in 1992 the dynamic growth amounted to 26 percent. A significant decline in the dynamic was brought about by the initiative of internal affairs organs. The number of organized crime groupings disclosed increased by 30.8 percent (5,681 groups, including 87 of a gangster inclination). They have confiscated 11,737 units of firearms from the criminals, which is 2.6 times more than during the preceding year. They have confiscated nine times more bladed weapons. RUOP subdivisions have confiscated 4.4 tonnes of narcotics. Twice as many corrupt bureaucrats have been taken to court. While in 1992 throughout Russia only nine cases were reported under the article of the Criminal Code `Gangsterism,' last year there were 44 of these cases. Convictions were handed down against 20 thieves operating within the law, and there are now 62 of these thieves in prison." We share the bewilderment of representatives of law enforcement organs regarding the evaluation of professionals. Indeed, it is unfitting to run roughshod over specialists who have accumulated experience in fighting organized crime. But you cannot get away from the facts: In terms of the number of murders per capita we are almost ahead of everyone else on the planet. When will we be delivered from fear? The government today is discussing a nationwide crime fighting program that is unprecedented in history. But if we do not feel its results tomorrow, we will have a right to draw a tragic conclusion: The mafia is immortal, and there is no one who can fight it. It is getting late...Listen: Tomorrow!
