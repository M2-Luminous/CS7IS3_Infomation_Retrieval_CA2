He added that he firmly believes that the Meretz Movement and its ministers are no less extreme than Rabin. They are all gripped by ideological rather than security fears. He said that at this time the Israeli Government wants to distort the image of the National Authority in Gaza and Jericho around the world and to portray it as being unable to shoulder its responsibilities in order to block the possibility of spreading Palestinian self-rule to the other parts of the West Bank. He expressed surprise at Israel's claims that the Palestinian security forces are unable to control the situation in the Gaza Strip. This is despite the Israeli Government's knowledge that the donor states have so far not fulfilled their promises to equip the Palestinian police forces. For example, the Palestinian security forces have no radio equipment. They also have no suitable logistical means. The military vehicles they are using now are large and old and unsuitable for the task. Abu-Middayn asked: How could any police force in the world carry out its duties successfully without such necessary equipment? He noted that the Israeli Army with all its might could not prevent operations against Israeli targets for the past 27 years, whereas now the Israelis are demanding that the Palestinian security forces control the situation in the self-rule areas within a few days. He said that if the purpose is to show that the Palestinians have failed the test and to involve them in a civil war, we say clearly that intra-Palestinian fighting is prohibited, and the Palestinians will frustrate the hopes of those who are wagering on such war. Regarding the National Authority's efforts to collect the weapons in the Gaza Strip, Abu-Middayn said that there are about 20,000 weapons, 80 percent of which are in the possession regular citizens. These must be collected. Those who wish to keep their weapons must get a license from the appropriate Palestinian authority. Regarding the remaining 20 percent of weapons, they are in the possession of factions, and we must discuss the issue with them in order to maintain purity of arms. He added that in its bid to collect the weapons, the authority will not raid houses and search them. It will ban people from carrying weapons in the streets and public places. Abu-Middayn expressed the view that the Rabin Administration's refusal to evacuate the settlements in the Gaza Strip will perpetuate the friction, complicating matters on the scene and prompting some people to hold on to their weapons for self-defense against attacks by the settlers. He said: Despite limited resources, we have started building legislative and judicial systems, and we will prove to the world that we can establish an independent Palestinian state.
