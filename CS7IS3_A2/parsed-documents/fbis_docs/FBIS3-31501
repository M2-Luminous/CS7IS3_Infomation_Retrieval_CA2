In the opinion of the Polish president, the security of this part of the European continent depended in a considerable degree on the economic cooperation in the region. "Societies want to live better and more peacefully. The point is to add to these values, and not to go back or avoid problems of the regional economic cooperation. It is necessary to make use of all the possibilities," Walesa said, adding that "we were living in a different epoch, in times of pluralism, freedom and free market where there existed neither a frontal threat nor confrontation." Minister Botnaru stressed Lech Walesa's achievements in the process of dismantling communism. He thanked the Polish president for such a prompt recognition of the sovereignty of the republics of the former Soviet Union. The Moldovan minister assured Lech Walesa that Moldova would not depart from the road of reforms which would be continued irrespective of the election results. The foreign ministers of Poland and Moldova, Andrzej Olechowski and Ion Botnaru, respectively, presented to the president plans of future cooperation between the two countries. While speaking about the Polish minority in Moldova, Botnaru said that soon there would be new legal solutions which would make it possible for Poles to get back some buildings where they would be able to conduct educational and cultural work.
