Chief Editor Makram Muhammad Ahmad published a copy of the medical report on Madani's death. The report said: An examination of the body of 'Abd-al-Harith Muhammad Madani has revealed that he died of an acute collapse [hubut had] of the respiratory system and a failure of his lung capacity resulting from acute asthma. No traces of injuries or visible fractures or bruises were found on the body. Dr. Suhayr 'Abd-al-Fattah, who conducted the examination of the deceased lawyer's body, stressed to Makram Muhammad Ahmad in a telephone interview that her signature on the medical report reflects the true reasons and accounts leading to Madani's death. She expressed concern about seeing her statement published for fear that she "may be a target of the terrorist groups," as she told AL-MUSAWWAR's chief editor. She added: I have a father whose medical condition cannot tolerate the state of anxiety he is going through out of concern for my life. In his editorial, Ahmad says that after being arrested in his office in al-Haram neighborhood, Madani was being taken to his home in the Warraq al-'Arab district of al-Jizah to be searched when he experienced acute difficulty in breathing with convulsions and then fainted. The accompanying officer radioed his superiors to inform them of the situation. Their answer was: There is no need to go to Warraq al-'Arab. Take him immediately to al-Manyal Hospital for treatment. If necessary, put him in the detainees' ward for treatment. Ahmad emphasized that the internists made tremendous efforts to save Madani's life, but he took his last breath at 1400 on 27 April; that is, 24 hours after being admitted to the hospital.
