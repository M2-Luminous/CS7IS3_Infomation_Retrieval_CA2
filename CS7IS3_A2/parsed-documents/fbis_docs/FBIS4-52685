FBIS4-52685 "dreas092__a94003" FBIS-EAS-94-092-A Daily Report 11 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Framework Talks `Likely' Focus of Hata Cabinet Framework Talks `Likely' Focus of Hata Cabinet OW1105144194 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 11 May 94 Morning Edition p 5--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1105144194 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Unattributed article] [Text] The Hata government has made a full-fledged start after Prime Minister Hata delivered his policy speech to the Diet on 10 May. In handling the economy, the Hata government is likely to focus on resuming the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks in May and reforming the current tax system in June. The fragile Hata government, which abruptly finds itself standing at a crucial juncture, is frantically looking for a breakthrough. The prime minister and other officials are making full contacts with U.S. Government officials in an effort to resume the stalled framework talks, and they intend to resume the stalled framework talks during May, at the earliest. Moves are afoot within the government to study the possibility of reforming the current tax system in a way that is acceptable to the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. What holds the key is whether the Hata government can coax the SDPJ and other political parties into supporting its reform program for the current tax system in line with the prime minister's "cooperative" policy that attaches importance to dialogue with opposition parties. The government is committed to mapping out a package of concrete measures in June to open the Japanese market, and key elements of the package will be the tax system reform, addition to the planned amount for public works projects, and deregulation. The government will have to map out the package just prior to the summit talks of industrialized nations (Naples summit) in July. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry believes that if the government maps out a halfway package, "it would undercut Japan's effort to patch up relations with the United States and adversely affect the Naples summit." The Finance Ministry says with a strong sense of crisis, "If the package falls short of meeting U.S. demands, it would worsen Japan- U.S. relations and the United States would increase pressure on Japan to further appreciate the yen, throwing cold water on Japan's economy." In his policy speech to the Diet, Prime Minister Hata stressed that he would work on mapping out the package. With regard to the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the prime minister conversed by telephone with President Clinton on 9 May and an idea is abruptly surfacing within the government to send a vice ministerial official to the United States. The government intends to study how to respond to the U.S.-proposed objective criteria after confirming the real intent behind the U.S. proposal. The government plans to resume the stalled framework talks after Foreign Minister Kakizawa meets with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor during the ministerial talks of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) scheduled for June. In the tax system reform, the government calls cutting the income tax and raising the consumption tax a "national task," and there are moves to explore ways for holding tax system reform discussion with the government, ruling coalition parties, the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], and the SDPJ participating. The idea is surfacing within the government's Tax System Research Council to study the possibility of adopting a plural tax rate system that holds down the consumption tax rate on food, which the SDPJ has long advocated. The government is revealing its posture to get the LDP and the SDPJ participate in the tax system reform discussion. Some are saying in whispers that once a budget bill for the fiscal 1994 is enacted, the mood for dissolving the House of Representatives and holding general elections would grow, thus destabilizing the political situation. If the general elections are set to held, there would be moves to defer the tax system reform. Therefore, it fears that the Hata government would face an impasse in handling the economy.
