FR940711-0-00039 FR940711-0-00007 Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;27.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;14&hyph;16␣Pratt & Whitney: Amendment 39&hyph;8964. Docket 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;27. Applicability: Pratt & Whitney (PW) Model JT8D&hyph;209, &hyph;217, &hyph;217A, &hyph;217C, &hyph;219 turbofan engines; and JT8D&hyph;1, &hyph;1A, &hyph;1B, &hyph;7, &hyph;7A, &hyph;7B, &hyph;9, &hyph;9A, &hyph;11, &hyph;15, &hyph;15A, &hyph;17, &hyph;17A, &hyph;17R, and &hyph;17AR turbofan engines incorporating the original issue or any revision of Pratt & Whitney Service Bulletin No. 5650; and any PW Model JT8D engine with low emissions fuel nozzles, Part Numbers 775485, 809137&hyph;01, 802965, and 5004308&hyph;02 installed. These engines are installed on but not limited to Boeing 727 and 737 series, and McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;9 and MD&hyph;80 series aircraft. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent fuel leakage from the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly and melting of the oil pressure and scavenge tube fittings, which can result in an uncontained engine fire and damage to the aircraft, accomplish the following: (a) Inspect Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assemblies in accordance with PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. A6153, Revision 1, dated June 8, 1994, as follows: (1) For Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assemblies that have accumulated more than 2,500 hours time in service (TIS) since last fuel nozzle and support assembly overhaul on the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD), initially inspect for fuel leakage within 700 hours TIS after the effective date of this AD. (2) For engines with Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assemblies with 2,500 or less hours TIS since fuel nozzle and support assembly overhaul on the effective date of this AD, initially inspect prior to accumulating 3,200 hours TIS since overhaul. (3) Thereafter, inspect for fuel leakage in accordance with PW ASB A6153, Revision 1, dated June 8, 1994, at intervals not to exceed 700 hours TIS since last inspection. (4) Remove from service Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assemblies that exhibit evidence of fuel leakage as described in PW ASB No. A6153, Revision 1, dated June 8, 1994, and replace with the improved sealing configuration nozzle in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD, as follows: (i) Within 25 hours TIS, or 25 cycles in service (CIS), whichever occurs first, after the inspection performed in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) for aircraft with only one engine exhibiting Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly leakage. (ii) Prior to further flight, on aircraft with two engines exhibiting Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly leakage, remove and replace at least one of the leaking Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assemblies. The remaining Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly that exhibits leakage shall be removed and replaced in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this AD. (iii) Prior to further flight, on Boeing 727 aircraft, with three engines exhibiting Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly leakage, remove and replace at least two of the leaking Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assemblies. The remaining Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly that exhibits leakage shall be removed and replaced in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this AD. Note: Fuel nozzles that have not undergone overhaul do not require inspection in accordance with paragraph (a) of this AD. (b) At the next accessibility of the diffuser build group after the effective date of this AD, but no later than July 31, 1999, accomplish the following: (1) Replace the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly with the improved sealing configuration in accordance with Part 1 of PW ASB No. A6169, Revision 1, dated June 15, 1994. (2) Replace the aluminum pressure and scavenge oil tube fittings with steel fittings in accordance with PW ASB No. A6170, dated May 13, 1994. Note: Replacement of the following oil tubes with corresponding oil tubes that incorporate steel fittings constitutes compliance with paragraph (b)(2) of this AD:
