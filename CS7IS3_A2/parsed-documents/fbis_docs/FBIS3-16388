Despite numerous difficult to explain statements made by Russian leaders regarding the breaking off of talks and the postponing of the agreed-upon date for final withdrawal, Estonia decided yesterday to accept the April date offered by Russia for the 18th round of talks. At the last round, held March 1-2 outside Tallinn, Russia backed away from August 31, 1994, the agreed upon date for final withdrawal of the 2,600 ex-Soviet troops remaining in Estonia. In addition, Russia demanded further conditions for withdrawal and did not propose a date for the next round. International reaction to Russia's moves was swift and strong, unanimously supporting Estonia's contention that Russian troops must leave, unconditionally, by August 31. Western reaction played an important role in Russia's current decision to continue the talks and to abide by the withdrawal date. Estonian negotiating team leader, Ambassador Vaeino Reinart, began consultations in Brussels today. He will call upon the European Union to help mediate Estonian-Russian negotiations within the framework of the European Stability Pact.
