FBIS3-31657 "dreeu036__a94025" FBIS-EEU-94-036-A Document Type:Daily Report 23 February 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Klaus Rejects Criticism of Interview on Sudeten AU2302101494 Prague CTK in English 2223 GMT 22 Feb 94 AU2302101494 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague Feb 22 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus said today that in an interview published in the German daily FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG on Monday [21 February], he had only explained the Czech stance toward individual and collective rights regarding the Sudeten German question, and pointed to a collective solution being impossible. Speaking to journalists after a ministerial session, Klaus said that the Sudeten German question could be solved only on the individual level. He was reacting to Monday's statement by Christian Schmidt, foreign political spokesman of the parliamentary group of Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU), in which Schmidt criticised Klaus over the interview. Klaus said that each German had the right to apply for permanent residence in any country of the world, including the Czech Republic. "Individual access on the part of the Czech Republic is nothing new," he stressed. In the interview for FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG, Klaus called the Sudeten German problems "individually solvable," but rejected any "collective settlement" of the question. He said the Sudeten German problem was an "unfortunate complication" in Czech-German relations, inherited by the Czech Government from the past. "Today we cannot settle all the problems we inherited," Klaus said in the paper. In his press statement on Monday, headlined "Not Like This, Mr. Klaus" Schmidt welcomed Klaus's "evident effort at reviving and pushing forward Czech-German relations, which have been cool for a while." But at the same time he stressed that, regarding the sensitive question of post-war German expellees, it was not possible simply to "offer nice sounding sentences which pop in the air upon closer inspection." Schmidt said he considered Klaus's proposal to settle individually Sudeten German problems, which Germany views as open, a similar "soap bubble."
