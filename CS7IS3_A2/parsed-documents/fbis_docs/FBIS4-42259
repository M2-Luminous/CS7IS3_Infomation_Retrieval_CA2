Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias today reiterated that Greece has never rejected any proposals for a dialogue, but noted that, if necessary, it is determined to take very drastic measures to deal with the Albanian provocations. Correspondent Mirella Kalostipi reports: [Begin recording] [Kalostipi] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias harshly warned the Albanian Government that Greece has the capability to hinder any brutal attacks against the Greek minority and stressed that Tirana's credibility will be judged according to its behavior on human rights. He suggested that the Albanian authorities stay calm and criticized the ease with which they make slanderous accusations against Greece. [Papoulias] Tirana must be particularly calm. It is very easy to make various slanderous accusations against Greece, but these are unacceptable. Of course, the Greek side has made its demarches at all the international forums, particularly the European Union. I believe the EU will soon undertake an initiative in the direction of protecting the Greek minority's human rights. [Kalostipi] Answering a question, Papoulias clarified that the Greek Government does not intend to deport Albanians who live in Greece. However, he called upon the Albanian president to consider the financial benefits from the work of thousands of illegal Albanian immigrants in Greece. The foreign minister implied that control at the Greek-Albanian border will become much stricter. Papoulias also stressed that the issue of EU financial aid to Albania depends completely on its stance on human rights. Referring to the charges against Omonoia Chairman Sotirios Kiriazatis and to his interrogation, Papoulias stressed that violent charges during supposed interrogations that aim to terrorize members of the Greek minority cannot continue. [Papoulias] Once again I must warn Tirana that Greece has the capability to hinder any brutal attacks against the Greek minority. [Kalostipi] The foreign minister expressed concern at the recent number of attacks against the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul, but added that Greece is carefully and calmly following the events. He said he intends to meet his Turkish counterpart, Hikmet Cetin, on the sidelines of the NATO summit that will be held in Istanbul in a few days. Papoulias will express the Greek Government's dissatisfaction with the slanderous campaign against our country, alleging the training of Kurdish guerrillas on Greek territory. Papoulias described these accusations as unfounded, adding that they hinder Greek-Turkish relations.
