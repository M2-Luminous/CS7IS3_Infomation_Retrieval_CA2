Reporter (Ilia Sardina) reports further details: [Begin recording] [(Sardina)] The Palestinian ambassador said the decisive factor and the final objective in his people's struggle is represented by the national unity which seeks reconstruction, and also the alleviation of the pain the Palestinian people have been suffering over the past 45 years of struggle. He added that the difficulties have not ended and that everyone's efforts are required for this new stage. [Jad'a] This is the first time in the history of the Palestinian people that we will be able to begin building our sovereignty ourselves. To achieve this, we need everyone's cooperation, primarily from the Palestinian people, to work as hard as possible for Palestine. Today we have a good chance to work for Palestine because we have always lived in pain and we have always had to work for the unity of Palestine, as a facade, while it was really for the Arab reconciliation. [(Sardina)] The ambassador also referred to the difficulties they will have to face. [Jad'a] It was relatively easy for Palestinian guerrillas to put on their ammunition belts and [words indistinct] a tank. But today it is more difficult to unite those Palestinians to build a school, where those little boys who have spent eight years of the intifada on the streets, will study. This is what I mean by difficulties. It means the need for serious work, for help from our true friends. And speaking of our true friends, I can never forget the role Cuba has always played in supporting the rights of the Palestinian people. Today, I can also extend the good news to all: We have signed some agreements for economic and political cooperation in the future. We are also preparing for an exchange of visits by Palestinian delegations to Cuba, and vice versa, to see how we can develop and improve, and how to channel Palestinian-Cuban relations.
