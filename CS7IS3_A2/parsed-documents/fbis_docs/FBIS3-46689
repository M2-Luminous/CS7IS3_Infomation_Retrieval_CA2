The interview was recorded on 29 December. At 0001 GMT, Yamamoto begins interviewing LDP President Kono by asking his evaluation of the Hosokawa government. Kono states: "The people warmly welcomed the Hosokawa government, which replaced the LDP, a party which had been in power for a long time. But when I think about the Hosokawa government's achievements, there have been no admirable political achievements." Asked by Yamada why the LDP delayed deliberations of the political reform bills in the House of Councillors, Kono replies: "During the past month, the LDP joined Diet deliberations on the supplementary budget for fiscal 1993. As for the political reform bills, deliberations were also conducted in both the Political Reform Committee and the plenary session of the House of Councillors. I do not want the people to misunderstand." Asked by Yamamoto if his party makes no contentions about passing the political reform bills during the current Diet session, Kono says: "No, our party strongly hopes to put an end to the issue of political reform. Frankly speaking, if we should carry over this issue to the next ordinary Diet session, it will be difficult to settle the other issues which have to be solved. Therefore, I hope to conclude the issue of political reform during the current extraordinary Diet session." He then stresses that the ruling parties should make concessions to have the political reform bills passed. He also explains major points of difference between the ruling parties and the LDP on political reform. Asked by Yamamoto if Prime Minister Hosokawa should hold himself responsible if he fails to have the political reform bills passed during the current Diet session, Kono states: "In a press conference, he apologized for failing to carry out political reform. But as you know, Hosokawa also pledged to the Diet that he would pass the bills by the end of 1993. He needs to make clear to the Diet whether he will take responsibility. Our party plans to take up this issue at the Budget Committee session early in the new year." Asked if the LDP plans to call for the resignation of the cabinet en masse, Kono replies: "We first need to hear his present state of mind." As regards the possible dissolution of the House of Representatives, Kono notes: "We are not in the position to refer to the dissolution of the House of Representatives because the right to dissolve the Diet is held by the prime minister. But we are in a situation wherein the government is required to give priority to protecting the people's living. When I think of the current economic condition, I find the people are in a serious economic situation. What politicians have to do first is to protect the people's standards of living. However, if the prime minister, who has the power to dissolve the Diet, should decide to dissolve the House of Representatives, we cannot do anything about it." In this way, Kono indicates the party is ready to accept the prime minister's challenge. Asked if he intends to hold talks with Prime Minister Hosokawa to narrow gaps between the ruling parties and the LDP on political reform, Kono responds in the negative, saying holding such talks will devalue the importance of Diet deliberations. Yamada discusses economic issues, asking Kono to comment on the Hosokawa government's economic policy. Kono replies the government lacks a sense of crisis about the current economic situation, saying: "We are in the worst economic condition since the end of the war, and I don't think the government's coming economic measures based on past experiences will help overcome the situation." Asked by Yamamoto how he views the idea of cutting the income tax in order to boost the economy, Kono stresses that the 10 trillion-yen in income tax cuts is necessary, adding "other stimulus measures also have to be taken." As regards the issue of how to secure revenue sources to make up for a fiscal budget shortfall resulting from the income tax decrease, Kono says: "Raising the consumption tax will not help boost the economy. What is most important for us is to restore the economy." Yamamoto then asks Kono: "Do you think the government should boost the economy even by issuing deficit-covering bonds?" Kono answers: "Yes." Yamamoto turns the subject to reform of the LDP. Asked how he would change the LDP, Kono says underlying the party's loss of power is the people's distrust of the LDP's money-power politics; he intends to regain the people's confidence. Asked about a move toward realigning the political parties, Kono rules out a possible split in the LDP. The interview ends at 0040 GMT.
