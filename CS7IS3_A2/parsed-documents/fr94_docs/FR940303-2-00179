FR940303-2-00179 FR940303-2-00093 Domestic and imported passenger car fleet average fuel economies improved since MY 1978. In MY 1993, the domestic and imported passenger car fleet average fuel economies increased to 27.7 mpg and 29.5 mpg, respectively. This reflects an increase of 9.0 mpg since MY 1978 for domestic cars. For imported cars, the MY 1993 average fuel economy is only 2.2 mpg higher than that of MY 1978. Domestic and imported light truck fleet average fuel economies improved since MY 1980. The domestic manufacturers continued to dominate the light truck market. Domestic light trucks comprised 85.1 percent of the total light truck fleet. For MY 1993, the domestic light truck fleet has an average fuel economy of 2.3 mpg lower than the imported light truck fleet. The imported light truck fleet fuel economy improved rapidly between MYs 1980 and 1981, but has been lower since then. For MY 1993, the imported light truck fleet fuel economy increased 0.3 mpg over MY 1992 to 22.8 mpg. A comparison of MYs 1993 to 1980 was done to avoid comparing the performance of the 0-6,000 pounds GVWR light truck fleet covered by the MY 1979 fuel economy standard to the performance of the 0&hyph;8,500 pounds GVWR fleets to which the standards apply for MY 1980 and beyond. The gap between the average CAFEs of the imported and domestic manufacturers is smaller than in earlier years as domestic manufacturers maintain relatively stable CAFE values while the import manufacturers move to larger, higher performance vehicles and more four-wheel drive light trucks. Based on a comparative analysis, since the enactment of CAFE standards for passenger cars for MY 1978, the total annual fleet fuel consumption, for both passenger cars and light trucks, has grown from 105.7 billion gallons (81.7 billion gallons for passenger cars + 24.1 billion gallons for 2-axle, 4-tire light trucks) in 1978 (Highway Statistics Summary to 1985, Table VM&hyph;201A) to 107 billion gallons (73.9 billion gallons for passenger cars + 33.1 billion gallons for light trucks) in 1992, the most current data (Highway Statistics Summary to 1992, Table VM&hyph;1). Over a 14-year period, total fuel consumption increased only 1.2 percent. Improvements in fuel economy have offset growth in the total number of light duty vehicles and in miles traveled per vehicle. Both vehicle registrations and vehicle miles traveled increased from 1978 to 1992. The total fleet registration increased 27.7 percent from 143,904,787 (118,428,730 for passenger cars + 25,476,057 for light trucks) in 1978 to 183,746,571 (144,213,429 for passenger cars + 39,533,142 for light trucks) in MY 1992. Vehicle miles traveled increased during this period. In 1978, vehicle miles traveled totaled 1.426 trillion (1.147 for passenger cars + 0.279 for light trucks). It increased to 2.072 trillion for the total fleet (1.595 for passenger cars + 0.477 for light trucks) in 1992. This is an increase of over 45.3 percent. In conclusion, although more vehicles are traveling more miles, fuel consumption by this total fleet (both passenger cars and light trucks) has increased only slightly.
