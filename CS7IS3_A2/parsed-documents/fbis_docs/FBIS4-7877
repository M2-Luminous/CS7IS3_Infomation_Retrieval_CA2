He announced that the figures given in the mass media on cuts in the army's strength are incorrect and imprecise. Aleksandrov also signed an order transferring 87 officers from the Defense Ministry and the economic sector to the reserve. The officers in question are over 57 years old and have completed 20 years of service. The minister explicitly stressed that no cuts will take place in the Bulgarian Army, but only retirements.
