It has, however, met with less understanding when the information of the governmental Office for the Hungarian National Minorities Abroad misinterprets a resolution of the Slovak parliament--the parliament of a neighboring country--on the basis of which doubts could be cast about whether the Slovak Republic really wants to observe the pledges it adopted when joining the Council of Europe. In this statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs again informs its partners, including the government bodies of the Hungarian Republic, that the Slovak Republic will gradually fulfill all of the pledges it took in connection with joining the Council of Europe. As is known, the implementation of these pledges is being assessed by the Council of Europe. At the same time, the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejects any general and unsubstantiated accusations that the Slovak Republic is not observing the obligations following from the CSCE documents. Journalists also wanted to know why Minister Moravcik did not take part in the Slovak delegation's visit to Poland. This was agreed with the Polish partner due to the fact that the Polish foreign minister was on a visit to the United States. The two foreign ministers are to meet at a different date. In connection with the alleged letter from [former FRY Prime Minister] Milan Panic to Prime Minister Meciar, the representatives of the Foreign Ministry confirmed the statement by Jozef Moravcik yesterday. They said that, in connection with the possible export of weapons, the ministry is publishing its view on the aspects of this with regard to international law and that no export can take place without a decision by the ministry.
