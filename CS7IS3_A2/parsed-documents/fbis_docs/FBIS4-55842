At its opening on 21 May German and Austrian politicians called on the Czech Republic to enter into a dialogue with the Sudeten Germans. Theo Waigel, German finance minister and leader of the Bavarian Christian Social Union, welcomed and expressed his support for the progress of the Czech Republic toward joining the European Union. However, he also said that the Czech Government should officially distance itself from the Benes decrees of 1945 [ordering confiscation of Sudeten Germans' property] and declare them invalid. As he did in a recent article in the weekly newspaper SUDETENDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock again drew an indirect parallel between the postwar expulsion of Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia and ethnic cleansing in the present Balkan war.
