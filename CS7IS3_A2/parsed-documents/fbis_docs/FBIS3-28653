Wismoyo Arismunandar said here Tuesday that Bali and East Timor because of their "uniqueness" need a special attention regarding the aspect of security. "Bali, as a major tourist attraction is an international gate to Indonesia, while East Timor as the country's youngest province still has a lot to catch up with the progress of other provinces," he said in an address to mark the transfer of post of the chief of Udayana Military Command. The post of the commander of the Udayana Military Command (supervising Bali, East Timor, and Lesser Sunda Islands) was handed over from Maj. Gen Theo Syafei to Maj. Gen R. Adang Rukhiatna Puradireja. Wismoyo further said that the Udayana Military Command has a heavy task because aside from supervsing Bali and East Timor and all their uniqueness, it must also look after Lesser Sunda Islands which are prone to natural disasters. "This obviously calls for a high spirit of dedication among the Udayana Military Command members," he said adding that the command's main task is maintaining security and stability so that development activities can take place smoothly. About development programs, Wismoyo, however, also said that they must be conducted in such a way that not only economic growth is achieved, but also even distribution of welfare.
