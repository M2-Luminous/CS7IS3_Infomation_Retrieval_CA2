"I'm surprised at Slovakia's unlimited cooperative approach towards colleagues from the Czech Republic, because a cooperative approach in trade relations ought to be mutual," former Economics Minister Jan Ducky told a press conference. He was referring to the recent Czech-Slovak preliminary agreement on the mutual recognition of certificates for food products and consumer goods. Ducky criticized the amended Czech law on value-added tax, saying that the new calculation of the tax on goods imported from the Czech Republic would have a more severe effect on Slovak exports than the Slovak-imposed import surcharge had on imports from the Czech Republic. Ducky also said that Slovak food exports to the Czech Republic were only a fraction of Czech exports to Slovakia and that the mutual recognition of certificates would harm Slovakia. Former Vice-Premier Sergej Kozlik said the Meciar government had succeeded in reducing the deficit on the new clearing account for trade with the Czech Republic from 127 million ECU [European Currency Unit] to the present 19 million. Kozlik said that while Slovakia's deficit on the old account (for payments before the currency separation on February 8, 1993) amounted to 470 million crowns at the end of February, now it was two billion crowns.
