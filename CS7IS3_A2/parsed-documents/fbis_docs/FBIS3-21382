Addressing newspersons on the roles of the Coast Guard, which celebrates its 17th raising day on February 1, he said there has been "constant friction" between the Coast Guard and Pakistan's maritime security agency on account of this. While India has well-demarcated IBL with other countries like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia, no settlement has been reached with Pakistan, he said. "The issue has remained unresolved for over a decade with India suggesting to adopt the internationally accepted median line principle which is not acceptable to Pakistan," Admiral Kohli said. The Coast Guard chief said even though there were many discussions with Pakistan on the matter, the dispute continues and Pakistan earlier suggested the "mid-stream principle." Vice-Admiral Kohli said the Coast Guard, which has over 6,800-km of the Indian coastline to police, has faced threats but has maintained dominance. He said apart from threats there have been attempts by the Pakistan maritime security agency to ram into other boats but there have been no incidents of opening fire. The Coast Guard has projected a futuristic requirement of 50 ships, 42 helicopters and 45 planes including half-a-dozen medium range surveillance aircraft to augment its present fleet in order to ensure proper vigil.
