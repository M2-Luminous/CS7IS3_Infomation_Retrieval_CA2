FR940202-0-00008 FR940202-0-00002 Six commenters requested that the definition of ``person'' explicitly include an entity organized outside the U.S., thereby assuring that foreign banks and other foreign market participants could qualify as financial institutions. Another commenter asked that the definition explicitly include trusts and that ``similar entity'' be changed to the more general ``other entity.'' The Board intends that ``person'' be defined broadly to include all entities, foreign and domestic, and has revised the definition in ยง231.2(f) to incorporate both of these comments. One commenter suggested that the Board include a comprehensive description of the financial institutions defined by the Act as well as those defined by the regulation. However, to keep the rule as simple as possible, the Board has not included the Act's definitions. Section 231.1(b) of the rule specifically states that the rule does not affect the status of those financial institutions defined by the Act. One commenter suggested that the Act's definition of netting contract also be used in the regulation, rather than the proposed ``financial contract'' definition, which is based on the Federal Deposit Insurance Act's (FDIA's) definition of qualified financial contract. The commenter believed that using a common definition would reduce confusion and avoid litigation. The final rule retains the concept of a financial contract based on the FDIA. The concept of a financial contract narrows the focus of the rule to participants in the financial markets and is relevant only to the determination of whether a particular institution qualifies as a financial institution under the rule. Once an institution qualifies, the Act's netting provisions would apply to all of that institution's netting contracts, as defined by the Act. The Board has expanded upon the FDIA to include spot forward contracts (contracts with maturities of two days or less) as financial contracts for purposes of the qualitative and quantitative tests. Arguably, the FDIA definition of swap agreement already includes spot forward contracts, however, for purposes of clarity, the Board has included spot contracts expressly in the forward contract definition. Timing Issues Many commenters raised timing-related issues regarding the rule's coverage. Eight commenters requested that the Board clarify that the Act's netting provisions will apply for the life of a contract as long as the parties qualify as financial institutions at the time they enter into the contract. The Board has revised the rule to clarify that a person will continue to be considered a financial institution for the purposes of any contract entered into during the period it qualifies, even if the person subsequently fails to qualify. (See ยง231.3(b).) Four commenters suggested that the Board clarify that an institution's status as a financial institution will be determined at the time it enters into a netting contract because that is when the counterparty will evaluate the institution's creditworthiness. On the other hand, two commenters suggested that the netting provisions should be applied retroactively to an institution's existing contracts once it qualifies as a financial institution. One commenter requested clarification as to whether existing contracts will be grandfathered when the rule takes effect. Under the final rule, the Act's netting provisions will apply only to those netting contracts entered into after a person qualifies as a financial institution. However, the Board has revised the rule to grandfather those contracts in existence on the effective date of the final rule for entities qualifying under the rule at that time. (See ยง231.3(c).)
