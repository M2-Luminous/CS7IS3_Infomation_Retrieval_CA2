Although the sides have claimed that they are heeding the latest cease-fire agreement, an official of the National Congress of Iraq, which is made up of several groups that are opposed to Saddam Husayn, has said that uninterrupted clashes are continuing in Halabjah. The official, who prefers to remain anonymous, has said that at least 600 persons have been killed in the clashes thus far, the great majority of whom supported the PUK. Meanwhile, it has been reported that DPK Leader Mas'ud Barzani and PUK leader Jalal Talabani have been unable to draw up an agreement to end the fighting. The Western countries headed by the United States established an autonomous region in northern Iraq when Saddam Husayn moved against the Kurds after the Gulf War ended. The DPK and PUK took part in the parliament of the Kurdish administration with equal strength after the elections in 1992. The dispute between the two sides broke out on 1 May. An international effort has been made to establish a basis for peace between the two sides. Turkey has contributed toward that effort. However, the initiatives that have been made have failed to yield results thus far.
