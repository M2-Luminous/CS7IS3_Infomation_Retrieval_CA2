The Russian parliament members met with the President of Azerbaijan Gaydar Aliyev and other high-ranking officials of the republic. Members of the Russian parliament visited the camps of Azerbaijan refuges from the regions of Azerbaijan that had been occupied by Armenian armed formations. As of today, Armenia has occupied around 20% of the territory of the Azerbaijan Republic (including 7 regions outside the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh proper: Agdam, Fizulin, Lachin, Kelbajar, Jebrail, Kubatlin, and Zangelan). According to official data of the Azerbaijan side, more than 700 populated areas of Azerbaijan have been captured, and the majority of them burned and looted. The area of the territories occupied by the Armenian armed formations at present amounts to more than 17 thousand square kilometers. The advance of the Armenian expeditionary corps continues, including active attempts to "cut through" Tertery-Barda (Azerbaijan populated areas) and capture the Tbilisi-Baku route. The problem of refugees and forced emigrants, whose numbers at present exceed 1 million (every seventh resident of Azerbaijan), including 200 thousand refugee Azeris from Armenia, is growing urgent. They are being accommodated in tent camps set up by the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Turkish Republic, and Arab charitable associations. As of today, 360 of the refugees are Russian. Iran has undertaken to maintain 100 thousand refugees and conducting a propaganda campaign about it. The tent camps are in the steppe regions of Azerbaijan, where extremely high temperatures will set in within 1 to 1.5 months and may result in deaths, particular of children. The deputies note that after the hasty withdrawal of Russian troops, and the virtual break in economic and cultural ties of the Russian Federation with the Azerbaijan Republic, trust in Russia on the part of the populace of Azerbaijan, including the Russians, is steadily falling. In the opinion of the parliament members, the region of vital Russian interests has gone without due attention from the leadership of the Russian Federation and the public, and this cannot continue. They demand investigations into the statements of citizens of Azerbaijan that fighters are being recruited for the Armenian armed formations on the territory of the Stavropol and Krasnodar krays and the Rostov oblast of the Russian Federation. Among the proposals of the members of the State Duma are: immediate provision of material, financial and other assistance (including the creation of a "cultural corridor") to the Russian community in Azerbaijan, intensificaton of peace-making efforts in the conflict zone, immediate withdrawal of Armenian troops from occupied territories, creation of a Consultative Council for Nagorno-Karabakh made up of representatives of sides with an interest in a peaceful settlement, and provision of effective assistance to refugees and forced emigrants from occupied regions of Azerbaijan, including the establishment and furnishing of a Russian tent camp, and delivery of medicines.
