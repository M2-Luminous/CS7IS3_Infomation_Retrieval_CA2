The basic principles concerning the chapter entitled The State are: 1. Myanmar is a sovereign independent state; 2. The state shall be called the Union of Myanmar; 3. The sovereign power of the state which stems from the citizens shall reside in the entire state; 4. The territory of the state is the territory on the day the constitution is adopted. These basic principles will be included in the chapter The State. Moreover, if there are any other suitable fundamental principles to be added, the delegates are encouraged to present their suggestions. Mr. Chairman, the basic principles concerning the chapter State Structure are: 1. The state shall be established as a union system; 2. The existing seven divisions shall be prescribed as seven regions [preceding word in English] and the existing seven states will remain as states [preceding word in English]. The said seven regions and seven states are equal in status; 3. The seven regions and seven states shall retain their current names; 4. If a region or a state wishes to change its name, a law shall be promulgated on a name change after the wishes of the citizens of the region or state concerned are obtained; 5. Self-administered areas [three preceding words in English] are to be prescribed for national races other than those who already have state status as either a region or state, if they have the appropriate population and have existed as a united group in a continuous territory; 6. Self-administered divisions [three preceding words in English] or self-administered zones [three preceding words in English] shall be prescribed as appropriate based on the population and the extent of the territory, and the state shall form a commission to prescribe such divisions and zones; 7. The territory of the state in the regions, states, and self- administered areas shall never secede from the state. These fundamental principles constitute the main essence concerning the state constitution. In discussing the chapter State Structure, if any other suitable detailed principles lying within the fundamental principles are to be added, the delegates should present their suggestions. Mr. Chairman: In the principles concerning state structure it has been prescribed that the existing seven divisions will be prescribed as seven regions and the existing seven states will remain as states. The said seven regions and seven states are equal in status. The seven regions and seven states will retain their current names. In accordance with the basic principles, a fundamental principle should be adopted in naming the regions and the states as follows; 1. The state is divided into seven regions [preceding word in English] and seven states [preceding word in English]: Kachin State, Kayah State, Karen State, Chin State, Sagaing Region, Tenasserim Region, Pegu Region, Magwe Region, Mandalay Region, Mon State, Arakan State, Rangoon Region, Shan State, and Irrawaddy Region. 2. The various regions and states are equal in status. Mr. Chairman: Regarding the principles concerning state structure that I presented earlier, the following fundamental principles for self-administered areas have been prescribed; Self-administered areas [three preceding words in English] are to be prescribed for national races other than those who already have state status as either a region or state, if they have the appropriate population and have existed as a united group in a continuous territory; Self-administered divisions [three preceding words rendered in English] or self-administered zones [three preceding words rendered in English] will be prescribed as appropriate based on the population and the extent of the territory and the state shall form a commission to prescribe such divisions and zones. Mr. Chairman: In accordance with the prescribed fundamental principles on self-administered divisions and self-administered zones, conditions exist for the formation of such divisions and zones. In the regions and states, there are national races other than those who already have state status as either a region or state. Some national races have the appropriate population and have existed as a united group in a continuous territory. The national convention has already adopted a fundamental principle prescribing self-administered divisions or self-administered zones as appropriate for those national races based on the population and the extent of the territory. Mr. Chairman: The national convention delegates should present suggestions on how to determine the self-administered divisions and self-administered zones. Since the self-administered divisions will have the legislative, administrative, and judicial powers in accordance with the constitution, they should include districts and townships. Although the status of a self-administered division is not as high as a region or state, it is higher than the districts from the regions or states. A self-administered zone should be prescribed for the national races that have resided in unity in that zone. A fundamental principle that the state should form a commission has been adopted to determine a self-administered division or a self-administered zone, if conditions exist, and the formation of a commission concerns procedural matters. The intention for brother national races to quickly receive due privileges is unanimous in the minds of convention delegates. Instead of the state forming a commission to determine which deserving national races should be granted either self-administered divisions or self-administered zones and to determine the places and zones, it will delight the concerned national races and will further strengthen national unity if the delegates prescribe them after discussions and deliberations. The delegates should present their proposals on whether it is feasible to prescribe outright the self- administered divisions or self-administered zones for national races other than those who already have either a region or state that meet all the requirements of the fundamental principles. Mr. Chairman: There will be a need to prescribe the basic principle for the chapter on state structure for the structure of the Union of Myanmar including the self-administered divisions or self-administered areas. In accordance with the 1974 constitution, villages are combined into village tracts; wards are classed together as towns; village tracts, wards, and towns are put together as townships; townships are combined into divisions or states; and divisions and states are organized as the state. Since the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] took the responsibilities of the country, there are ward and village level, township level, district level, and state or division level state organizations for easy and speedy communications and effective administration. A fundamental principle should be prescribed regarding state structure where villages are combined into village tracts; wards are classed together as a town or township; village tracts, wards or towns are put together as a township; townships are combined into a district; districts are organized into a region or a state; in a self-administered zone, self-administered townships are combined as a self-administered zone; in a self-administered division, self-administered townships are combined as a district and these districts are organized as a self-administered division; if there is a self-administered division or self-administered zone in a region or state, the self-administered division or self-administered zone and the districts are organized as a region or a state; and the regions and states are organized as the state. The basic principle on territory of the state in the regions, states, and self- administered areas will never secede from the state has already been adopted and these must be presented in the chapter concerning state structure. Mr. Chairman: The fundamental principles to be prescribed in the chapter on state structure are: 1. How will it be done when the need arises to change the national territorial boundary? 2. How will it be done when the need arises to change a region or state boundary? 3. How will it be done when the need arises to change or form boundaries, or change the name of a village, village tract, ward, town, and township in a region, state, self-administered division, or self-administered zone? These must also be put into consideration and discussed. Delegates should present suggestions in view of the country's benefit, on how to solve above mentioned boundary matters if the need arises. The National Convention Convening Work Committee [NCCWC] based on the overall study would like to present some suggestions. Mr. Chairman: If the need arises to solve boundary matters in view of the country's benefit, suggestions will also include some legislative matters. So, some principles concerning legislative affairs will also be included in the suggestions. In prescribing fundamental principles for legislature, there will be a bicameral Union Parliament with one elected chamber based on population representation and another chamber with equal representation from the regions and the states. There will also be persons to head those parliaments. Mr. Chairman: When the need arises to change the national territorial boundary, the president should first inform the head of the Union Parliament to get the approval of the Union Parliament. The Union Parliament should then take the vote of the members of parliament as follows to change the national territorial boundary: 1. More than half the vote of representatives of the parliament made up of equal number of representatives from regions and states; 2. More than half the vote of representatives of the [Union] parliament elected on the basis of population; 3. More than half the vote of representatives of the two parliaments in the concerned region or state. The convention is to discuss and suggest on whether a basic principle should be prescribed to enable the president to alter the national territorial boundary after receiving the stipulated support vote. If either one of the parliaments or representatives of the two parliaments in the concerned region or state decide to disagree to change the national territorial boundary according to the methods mentioned above, the president can change the national territorial boundary if the matter received more than three fourth of the vote in the Union Parliament. The convention is to discuss whether such a basic principle should be prescribed. Mr. Chairman: I will explain measures to be taken when it becomes necessary to alter the territorial boundary of a region or a state. When the need arises to change the territorial boundary of a region or a state, the consent of the voters residing in the region or state should first be obtained. The changing of territorial boundary is not to be carried out if it does not receive more than half of the vote of the eligible voters in the concerned region. If more than half of the voters vote to change the territorial boundary, the vote of the representatives of the region or state concerned is to be obtained. If more than three-fourths of the vote of the representatives of the region or state concerned vote to change the territorial boundary of a region or a state, the president, with the consent of the Union Parliament, can change the territorial boundary of a region or state. The convention is to discuss whether such a basic principle should be prescribed. If either the regional or state parliament decide to disagree to change the boundary, the decision of the Union Parliament should be obtained. If more than three-fourths of the total representatives of the Union Parliament vote to change the boundary of a region or a state, the president can change the territorial boundary of a region or state. The convention is to discuss whether such a basic principle should be prescribed. Mr. Chairman: There is an indication for reasons to appear to change or form boundaries, or change the name of a village, village tract, ward, town, township, and district in a region, state, self-administered division, or self-administered zone. The convention should present suggestions on how to act when the need arises for such a change. This matter to change or form boundaries, or a name change, is solely a regional concern. If a need occurs, the administrative authority of the region or state concern should recommend to the president and the president should take action as needed. The convention is to discuss whether such a basic principle should be prescribed. Mr. Chairman: A basic principle has been adopted if the need arises to change the name of a region or state by passing legislation with the consent of the citizens residing in the region or state. This basic principle should be included and prescribed in the chapter concerning state structure. The convention is to discuss whether a basic principle should be prescribed if the need arises to change legislation of self-administered divisions or self- administered zones by using similar methods as outlined above. Mr. Chairman: During the panel discussions by national convention delegate groups, a delegate group suggested a basic principle that the state capital be put under a separate administrative zone and not under the administration of a region or a state. This suggestion should be seriously considered in the discussions concerning the chapter on state structure. Since the basic principle has been adopted regarding the seven regions and seven states in the state structure, if the state capital is to be considered as a separate administrative union zone, then there is a need for it to be included in the basic principles. Although matters relating to the state capital are to be discussed in the state flag, state seal, national anthem, and state capital chapter, there is a need to discuss it in the chapter on state structure. According to international practice, the seat of the central government is considered as the state capital and in some countries, those capitals are directly governed by either the president or the central government. In Myanmar [Burma], if Yangon [Rangoon], where the central government resides, is considered as the state capital, the delegates should discuss and decide whether to adopt a basic principle to have the administration of the state capital, Yangon, directly under the president as a union zone rather than having it under the administration of the Yangon Region. If the administration of the state capital, Yangon, is put directly under the administration of the president, then there will be basic principles to be discussed in the concerned chapters on legislative, administrative, and judicial powers regarding the capital, Yangon. Moreover, special places like the Cocos Islands Township should be considered as union zones and should be put under the direct control of the president. The convention is to discuss whether such a basic principle should be prescribed. In future, zones with special conditions concerning state defense and security, administration, and economics, should by legislation be put under the direct supervision of the president and should be considered as union zones. The convention is also to discuss whether such a principle should be adopted. Mr. Chairman: I have presented detailed explanations of basic principles on the chapters on the state and the state structure. Continuing, I would like to present the basic principles on the chapter on the Head of State as prescribed by the National Convention Plenary Session. They are: 1. The president is the head of state; 2. The president will be elected through the Electoral College. Based on the prescribed principle that the president is the head of state, detailed discussions on the status, qualities, duties, responsibilities, election by electoral college, term of presidency, and (?accusations and blame), should be made whether such principles should be prescribed. Based on the prescribed principle that the president will be elected through the Electoral College, detailed discussions should be made on the formation of the electoral college, who should be included, and how the president should be elected, whether such principles should be prescribed. I will continue to present some points for discussions concerning the president. Mr. Chairman: The president, who is the head of state, is a figurehead in some countries while he is just an administrative head in others. In accordance with the basic principles concerning the head of state, the state president of our country will have full administrative powers. The state president, who is like a shining star for the country, should also be a national leader whom the people rely upon. There is a need to fully and precisely specify the qualifications of the president to elect the person who is going to take a very important position in the country. That is why, apart from prescribing the basic principle that the president is the head of state, the convention is also to discuss whether principles should be adopted on the president representing the state, the president as the national leader of all national races, and the president assuming the paramount position of all national races in the entire Union of Myanmar. Next, I would like to present some suggestions regarding the qualifications of the president. Since the state president is a national leader, the president should be the person who can diligently work for the nondisintegration of the union, nondisintegration of national solidarity, perpetuation of national sovereignty, and the wellbeing and development of the country. The president should also be well versed in state matters like politics, administration, economics, and military and be able to make experienced, effective, and concise decisions. Therefore, the basic qualifications of the president should be prescribed as another basic principle. Moreover, the president, who will be leading the country, should be especially loyal to the state and the people. Thus, another basic principle should be adopted citing the president to be loyal to the country and the people. Mr. Chairman: Studies show that constitutions of most countries clearly state that the person who is to be president should be born of two parents who are citizens of that country. The Constitution of the United States of America requires that the U.S. president be born to two parents who are U.S. citizens, must attain a minimum age of 35 years, and reside in the United States for at least 14 years. The Constitution of the Philippines states that those running election as president of the Philippines should be a Philippine citizen born of two parents who are Philippine citizens. The Constitution of Indonesia that those running for election as president of Indonesia should be an Indonesian citizen born of two parents who are Indonesian citizens. Mr. Chairman: The constitutions of some countries clearly state that the place of birth of the person running for president should be within the concerned country. In our country, too, the basic principle on the citizenship of the president should be adopted such that the person running for president and their parents should be citizens born within the legal boundaries of the country. Regarding age limits of presidents, the Constitution of Bangladesh stipulates that the minimum age of the president should be 35 years old, according to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China the president should be more than 45 years old, according to the Constitution of Egypt the age of the president should not be less than 40 years old, the Constitution of India stipulates that the president must be older than 35 years, and the Constitution of Pakistan requires the president to be at least 45 years old. The president should have rich experience in the political, adminsitrative, economic, and military affairs of the country. The person elected as president should be at least 45 years old. Therefore, the delegates are to discuss whether to lay down a basic principle prescribing that the president should be at least 45 years old. Furthermore, in addition to meeting the requirements for running in the parliamentary elections, the president should meet separate qualifications set for the president. Similar provisions can bee seen in the state constitutions of Bangladesh, the PRC, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. Article 49-B of the 1947 State Constitution of the Union of Myanmar stipulates that no person is be eligible for election to the office of president unless he or she is qualified for election to the Parliament. Therefore, discussions should be held to prescribe separate qualifications in addition to qualifications for contesting in parliamentary elections. The constitutions of some countries contain provisions on continuous length of residence in the country. As the president is the national leader and the head of state, it is necessary for the president to be well-informed on political, administrative, economic, social, and indigenous national affairs to provide effective leadership to the nation. Therefore, a basic rule should be made to stipulate that the president should have continuous residence for at least 20 years prior to the time of election as president. Mr. Chairman: Myanmar was under the servitude of the British imperialists for over 100 years because of traitors, and the people suffered a bitter experience. Furthermore, there were instances after independence when the nation's independence and sovereignty were almost lost because of these traitors and the Defense Services had to defend the nation in time. Therefore, the president, who is to serve as the national leader and the head of state, should have allegiance to the nation and citizens. To ensure that the people have full trust in the president without any suspicion, it is especially necessary for members of the president's family to have allegiance to the nation and citizens. Therefore, the president himself, one of the president's parents, the spouse of the president, any one of the president's legal children, and the spouse of any one of the president's children must not owe allegiance to a foreign power, not be the subject of a foreign power nor be a foreign citizen. Especially, they must not be entitled to the rights and privileges of a subject of a foreign power or foreign citizen. Mr. Chairman: Section 1-A of Article 74 of the 1947 State Constitution contains the provision to prevent foreign interference in our internal affairs. It states that any person who is under any acknowledgment of allegiance or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or citizen or entitled to the rights and privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power shall be disqualified for being chosen as and for being a member of either chamber of Parliament. Similar provision is included in Article 10-E of the 1989 Parliamentary Election Law. Therefore, a basic principle should be laid down on qualifications for the president as I have presented above. Other qualifications can be also added. Mr. Chairman: All tasks, other than legislative and judicial affairs, concern administration. The president is to carry the heavy burden as the national leader, head of state, and chief executive. A basic principle has been laid down to elect the president through an electoral college. Therefore, discussions should be held on organization of the electoral college and procedure for electing the president. It is found that when an electoral college is formed the country's history, political affairs, and other conditions are taken into consideration. Among the countries that practised the election of a president through an electoral college are the United States, Indonesia, India, and Pakistan. These countries elect their presidents through the electoral college, which was formed under the constitution according to the concrete conditions in their countries. Mr. Chairman: We are to elect a president according to our country's course of history and political and other conditions and the six objectives of the National Convention. The electoral college does not have to be elected separately, but it can be prescribed that all members of the Union Parliament are members of the electoral college, which should be divided into three groups. The first group will be formed with representatives of the parliament made up of equal number of representatives from regions and states. The second group will be formed with representatives of the parliament elected on the basis of population. The third group will be formed with representatives from the Defense Services from the two parliaments mentioned above and who are nominated by the commander in chief of the Defense Services. As our president will be a national leader as well as the chief executive, the responsibility of the president is huge. Many countries elect deputy chief executives to assist the chief executive in his work. Likewise, we should appoint vice presidents to assist the president in our country. Therefore, the three groups in charge of electing the president should first select vice presidents from among the members of parliament or those who are not members of parliament. The vice president is a potential president. Therefore, a body composed of the heads and deputy heads of the Union Parliament and the two parliaments will clear candidates to see if they meet the qualifications set for president. Members of the electoral college or members of the Union Parliament are to cast a vote to elect the president out of the three vice presidents. The person who receives the most votes becomes the president. Suggestions should be made on whether this method should be adopted. If this system is practiced, we will have a president and two vice presidents in our country, and they will be able to effectively carry out their duties. It will be also necessary to lay down a basic principle to enact a law necessary for election of the president. After the president and vice presidents are elected, matters concerning these persons, such as tenure of office, oath of allegiance, salary and privileges, responsibilities, liaison with the Union Parliament, and impeachment of president and vice presidents should be considered. Mr. Chairman: Our country plans to practice the administrative system with president as chief executive. Hence, it will be necessary to stipulate the suitable term of office for the president and vice presidents to enable them to discharge their duties effectively. Limitations on terms of office should be also considered. I would like to present constitutional provisions in some countries that stipulate limitations on term of office for the president. Under the PRC Constitution, the term of office for the president is five years and only two consecutive terms of office are allowed. The term of office for president in Egypt is six years, and there is no limit for right to reelection. The term of office for president in Indonesia is five years, and there is no limite for right to reelection. The term of office for president in India is five years, and there is no stipulation on reelection. The term of office for president in Pakistan is five years, and there is no more than two consecutive terms of office. The term of office for president in the Philippines is six years, and reelection is not allowed. The term of office for president in Sri Lanka is six years, and the term of office is limited to two consecutive terms. The term of office for president in the U.S. is four years, and reelection is limited to two terms. We are to consider the suitable term of office for the presidency in our country. We are to work very hard for the country's economic, administrative, and social affairs to catch up with other countries. Therefore, term of office of president and vice presidents should be five years to allow time to carry out the tasks that benefit the nation and the people. Discussions should be held to consider whether a basic principle should be laid to allow the president and vice presidents to serve until the new president is elected and to limit the term of presidency to two terms. Furthermore, discussions should be held to consider whether to lay down a basic principle stipulating that the person replacing the vacant position of the president or vice president is to serve until the end of the original term of office. Mr. Chairman, I have already explained the election of the president and vice presidents by the electoral college, as well as the requirements for the offices of president and vice president. One point should be taken into consideration in electing a member of parliament as president or vice president: the convention put forward a principle on the separation of executive, legislative, and judicial powers. Therefore, if a member of parliament were to be elected president or vice president by the electoral college, it would contravene the principle of separation of the three state powers. Furthermore, the president and vice presidents are national leaders who should work for the national interest rather than political parties. They should not have to be involved in the affairs of their political party. Section 1, Article 47 of the 1947 Constitution states that the president cannot be a member of either chamber of parliament. Section 2 states that if a member of either chamber of parliament is elected president, they will be deemed to have vacated their seat in that chamber. Therefore, neither the president nor the vice presidents will be members of parliament. If the president or vice presidents are either members of parliament or public servants, they will be deemed to have resigned or retired from that position upon the date of their election to office. If the president or vice presidents are members of a political party, they will cease their involvement in the affairs of that political party upon their election to office. A basic principle to this effect will have to be discussed. Mr. Chairman, the president and vice presidents have to take the oath of office before assuming their positions. The president and vice presidents can only perform their duties after they have been sworn in before the members of the Union Parliament. Constitutions usually contain provisions on how the oath of office will be administered to the president and vice presidents. Therefore, discussions should be held and suggestions presented regarding the oath of office for the president and vice presidents. The president and vice presidents have to shoulder the heavy burdens of the state. As such, they wield power. There should be a prohibition against organizations influencing the president or vice presidents by giving them salaries or positions. Therefore, discussions should be held on whether there should be a basic principle forbidding the president and vice presidents from accepting salaries and positions from outside organizations. Mr. Chairman, the president is fully empowered as chief executive. The vice presidents will have to discharge heavy duties. As such, they should have the respect of the people. Discussions should be held on a basic principle requiring the president and vice presidents to declare their family assets -- such as land, houses, buildings, economic enterprises, savings, and other valuables -- to the head of the Union Parliament. The president and vice presidents should be entitled to salaries, allowances, and privileges as prescribed by law. Furthermore, they should have appropriate official residences. Therefore, discussions should be held on whether to lay down a basic principle outlining the salary, allowances, privileges, and official residences of president and vice presidents. The rights and responsibilities of the president and vice presidents will be included in the constitutional provisions and other laws. Therefore, a basic principle should be laid down on the rights and responsibilities prescribed by the constitution and other laws for the president and vice presidents. Mr. Chairman, so far I have explained the election of the president and vice presidents as well as some of the president's responsibilities. Although executive, legislative, and judicial powers will be exercised separately, there should be legal provisions for checks and balances. It is necessary for the president -- who is the chief executive -- and the vice presidents to conduct themselves in a manner befitting their positions. Basic principles should be laid down for impeachment procedures against the president and vice presidents if they commit a breach of conduct. Under the U.S. Constitution, the president and vice president can be impeached for betraying their country, corruption, and other serious offenses, as well as a breach of conduct. The Bangladesh Constitution provides for the impeachment of the president for violating the Constitution or misconduct. Impeachment requires that a minimum of three quarters of the signatures of the members of parliament be submitted to the parliamentary president. The Egyptian Constitution provides for an impeachment motion against the president for betraying the country or any other offense. Such a motion requires the support of a minimum of one third of the members of parliament. Impeachment cannot proceed if the motion is not approved by two thirds of the members of parliament. Discussions should be held on laying down a basic principle providing for the impeachment of our president and vice presidents for any of the following offenses: betraying the country; violating constitutional provisions; or misconduct. Procedures for impeaching the president and vice presidents should also be considered. In order to bring impeach proceedings against the president or vice presidents for one or all of the offenses I have mentioned, the signatures of at least one quarter of the members of one of the chambers of the Union Parliament must be obtained and submitted to the head of the parliamentary chamber concerned. The impeachment procedure can continue only if it is supported by at least two-thirds of the members of the parliamentary chamber concerned. An impeachment motion submitted by one parliamentary chamber will be investigated by a team from the other. The president, vice presidents, or their representatives will have the right to make a defense. Once the charges have been investigated, if at least two-thirds of the members of the parliamentary chamber that investigated the charges or that caused the investigation decide that the charges are correct and that the offense makes the president or vice president unsuitable to carry out their duties, the parliamentary chamber will make a submission to the head of the Union Parliament to terminate the accused president or vice president's term of office. As soon as the submission is received, the head of the Union Parliament will announce the accused president or vice president's termination from office. Basic principles to this effect should be discussed. The president and vice presidents are national leaders as well as heads of state. Other than impeachment conducted according to constitutional provisions, the president and vice presidents should be protected from being sued during their terms of office. Only if such protection is given will the president and vice presidents be able to discharge their duties courageously. Therefore, other than the president and vice presidents being impeached according to constitutional provisions, they should be protected from being sued during their terms of office, and a basic principle to that effect should be discussed. Mr. Chairman, the president and vice presidents should be allowed to resign before their term of office expires if they so wish. A basic principle should be laid down to deal with a situation whereby the presidency becomes vacant because the president resigns from office, dies, becomes permanently disabled, or any other reason before the term of office expires. If the presidency becomes vacant, an acting president should be chosen to continue the work of the president. The acting president should be whichever one of the two vice presidents received the second highest number of votes in the presidential elections. If there is a vacancy in the presidency, a new president will need to be elected. If a vacancy develops while the Union Parliament is in session, the acting president should inform the head of the Union Parliament as soon as possible so that the vacancy can be filled within seven days. When this information is received, the head of the Union Parliament should take the necessary steps for the electoral panel to choose a new vice president. When the respective electoral panel has chosen a new vice president, the Union Parliament members should elect a new president as they see fit from among the three vice presidents. If a vacancy arises when the Union Parliament is not in session, the head of the Union Parliament should convene a special parliamentary session within 21 days of receiving the information from the acting president and carry out the above-mentioned process of choosing a new president. Therefore, appropriate discussions should be held by the delegates to lay down a basic principle on the election of a new president when a vacancy arises. Mr. Chairman, I would like to make some basic suggestions on electing a new vice president if a vacancy occurs because one of the vice presidents resigns from office, dies, is removed from office before their term of office expires, becomes permanently disabled, or any other reason. If the position of vice president becomes vacant while the Union Parliament is in session, the president should inform the head of the Union Parliament as soon as possible so the electoral panel can fill the vacant office within seven days. If a vacancy arises when the Union Parliament is not in session, the head of the Union Parliament should convene a special parliamentary session within 21 days of receiving the information from the president, so that the electoral panel can elect a new vice president. Thus, the delegates should deliberate on whether to prescribe a basic principle on the election of a new vice president if a vacancy arises. Mr. Chairman and National Convention delegates, the presentations I have made on the chapters concerning the state, the structure of the state, and the head of state are just some suggestions for the delegates to consider in trying to prescribe the basic principles. When presenting suggestions for adoption as basic principles, the delegates should present them separately in accordance with their respective chapter headings, just as I have done. I have presented some abstracts of the facts the National Convention Convening Work Committee studied concerning the chapters on the state, the structure of the state, and the head of state, so that the delegates will have a wider scope in their discussions on proposing basic principles. If there are any suitable and appropriate additions to be made, the National Convention delegates should do so in accordance with the six National Convention objectives, the previously-prescribed basic principles, and the National Convention convening procedures. The National Convention delegate groups, after studying my suggestions, will begin panel discussions on 21 January regarding the chapters on the state, the structure of the state, and the head of state. It is requested that they present a paper compiling their chapter-by-chapter suggestions to the work committee in accordance with the National Convention convening procedures. I thus conclude my address. [applause]
