FR940720-0-00016 FR940720-0-00001 Sixth, ยง171.19 is amended to credit the quarterly partial payments already made by certain licensees in FY 1994 either toward their total annual fee to be assessed or to make refunds, if necessary. The 10 CFR part 171 annual fees have been determined using the same method used to determine the FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993 annual fees. The amounts to be collected through annual fees in the amendments to 10 CFR part 171 are based on the increased professional hourly rate. The amendments to 10 CFR part 171 do not change the underlying basis for 10 CFR part 171; that is, charging a class of licensees for NRC costs attributable to that class of licensees. The changes are consistent with the Congressional guidance in the Conference Committee Report on OBRA&hyph;90, which states that the ``conferees contemplate that the NRC will continue to allocate generic costs that are attributable to a given class of licensee to such class'' and the ``conferees intend that the NRC assess the annual charge under the principle that licensees who require the greatest expenditures of the agency's resources should pay the greatest annual fee'' (136 Cong. Rec., at H12692&hyph;93). During the past three years, many licensees have indicated that although they held a valid NRC license authorizing the possession and use of special nuclear, source, or byproduct material, they were in fact either not using the material to conduct operations or had disposed of the material and no longer needed the license. In responding to licensees about this matter, the NRC has stated that annual fees are assessed based on whether a licensee holds a valid NRC license that authorizes possession and use of radioactive material. Whether or not a licensee is actually conducting operations using the material is a matter of licensee discretion. The NRC cannot control whether a licensee elects to possess and use radioactive material once it receives a license from the NRC. Therefore, the NRC reemphasizes once again that annual fees will be assessed based on whether a licensee holds a valid license with the NRC that authorizes possession and use of radioactive material. To remove any uncertainties regarding agency policy on this issue, the NRC amended 10 CFR 171.16, footnotes 1 and 7 on July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38666). C. FY 1994 Budgeted Costs The FY 1994 budgeted costs, by major activity, that will be recovered through 10 CFR parts 170 and 171 fees are shown in Table I. Table I._ Recovery of NRC's FY 1994 Budget Authority [Dollars in millions] 1Recovery method 1Estimated amount Nuclear Waste Fund $22.0 Part 170 (license and inspection fees) 120.1 Other receipts .1 Part 171 (annual fees): Power Reactors 302.1 Nonpower Reactors .4 Fuel Facilities 16.8 Spent Fuel Storage 2.2 Uranium Recovery 2.1 Transportation 4.0 Material Users 138.6 n,s Subtotal Part 171 366.2 Costs remaining to be recovered not identified above 26.6 n,d Total 535.0 1Includes $6.3 million that will not be recovered from small materials licensees because of the reduced small entity fees. The $26.6 million identified for those activities which are not identified as either 10 CFR parts 170 or 171 or the NWF in Table I are distributed among the classes of licensees as follows: $24.4 million to operating power reactors; $.7 million to fuel facilities; and $1.5 million to other materials licensees. In addition, approximately $6.3 million must be collected as a result of continuing the $1,800 maximum fee for small entities and the lower tier small entity fee of $400 for certain licensees. In order for the NRC to recover 100 percent of its FY 1994 budget authority in accordance with OBRA&hyph;90, the NRC will recover $5.3 million of the $6.3 million from operating power reactors and the remaining $1.0 million from other nonreactor entities that do not meet NRC small entity size standards.
