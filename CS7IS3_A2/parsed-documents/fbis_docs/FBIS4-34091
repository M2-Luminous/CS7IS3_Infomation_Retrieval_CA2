A motion of no-confidence was passed in Parliament last week against the Barbadian leader, the first of its kind in the Caribbean, the humiliating 14-12 vote, including that of his ministers from his very own cabinet. It was widely speculated that Prime Minister Sandiford would have resigned following this defeat, but the leader, reputed for taking his time when it comes to decisionmaking, has, to date, not indicated what he intends to do. Sandiford is reported to have attacked his opponents and the resolution last week by stating, quote, I will use the last ounce of breath that I have in my body to deal with that question of the resolution that has no basis and no validity in terms of being able to stand up to a truthful record of the situation as far as it relates to me, as prime minister and as head of the government. I will not rest until this is done, end of quote. Sandiford described the outcome of the vote as a miscarriage of justice in the political arena, where, he says, an attempt could be made to hang, draw, and quarter him on the basis of the resolution that, itself, is riddled with lies and untruths.
