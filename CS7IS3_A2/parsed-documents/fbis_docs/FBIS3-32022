The organization denounces the return to the country of the UN/OAS civilian mission. The party led by Louis Jodel Chambelain also asked for the lifting of the embargo: [Begin recording in Creole] There is one group of people making money on the embargo and another team fighting for power. Meanwhile, the population is dying of hunger. There are no health services or education. Haiti is about to become a reservation on which all Haitians are locked. The private sector asserts that it has provided supplies to the people. Watch out for crooked dealers. The black market will stop. Respect yourselves. For two and a half years, the foreigner has realized that there is no worthy, nationalistic Haitian, and who is defending Haiti because Aristide alone is too small to make the foreigners humiliate Haitians and Haiti [as heard]. There are still many more Aristides in Haiti. FRAPH firmly supports Senator Sansaricque's statements regarding the UN and the OAS. They have started coming in in another way. FRAPH, on behalf of the Haitian people, states that it does not want all those foreign settlers from the civilian mission who are the avant-garde of foreign intervention in Haiti. The people are asking the country's authorities if they are not in charge of the country's situation. Who gave the authorization? Haitian people, keep calm, be alert. On 4 or 5 February, FRAPH will stamp its foot, will ask all the country's social classes, the youth, and all Haitians to join together in a revolution. Forward, Haitian people! Forward, Haitian people! [repeats] We are going to tell the foreigners: Down with the embargo, down with hunger, down with misery, down with unemployment! [end recording]
