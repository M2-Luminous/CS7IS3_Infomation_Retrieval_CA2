Both countries are ancient countries, and traditional relations go back several thousands years. After the war, for various reasons, the two countries discontinued exchanges for a long period and official diplomatic relations were only established recently. In recent years, with the common efforts of both sides, PRC-ROK relations have developed rapidly and the scope of exchanges and cooperation has become more and more extensive. China has become the third biggest trading partner of the ROK, and the ROK is also the sixth biggest trading partner for China. Last year, the volume of trade between the two countries amounted to $11 billion. ROK investment in China is nearly $1 billion. China is one of the countries in which the ROK has made the greatest investment. All this has laid a very good foundation for further developing friendly relations and mutually beneficial economic cooperation between the two countries. Friendship and cooperation between China and the ROK are conducive to the stability of the Asia-Pacific region and to world peace. Crisis Can Only Be Resolved Through Talks President Kim Yong-sam has come to China at a time when the situation on the Korean peninsula is extremely tense, and the stances of the two countries on resolving the crisis on the Korean peninsula has naturally attracted the world's attention. Chinese leaders have clearly pointed out that the Chinese Government sincerely hopes that the Korean peninsula can maintain long-term peace and stability and that they support the idea of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. China does not favor the deployment, production, or research of any nuclear weapons either on the northern or southern side of the Korean peninsula. China holds that without peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, there cannot be real peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. The controversial nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula at present should be appropriately resolved through dialogue between the DPRK, the ROK, the United States, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. In addition, this kind of dialogue requires patience. For some time, many countries have issued appeals hoping that China can play a part in resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. President Kim Yong-sam has expressed the same hope. This is understandable because China and the DPRK are close neighbors and the two countries have maintained friendly relations of cooperation. China has indeed made energetic efforts to do what she can in this respect. However, China and the DPRK are two independent sovereign countries after all. China does not have any nuclear cooperation with the DPRK. How to deal with and handle the nuclear issue can only be analyzed, assessed, and decided by the DPRK herself. Therefore, China's role is limited. Threats Are Futile For the sake of peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and to create a favorable atmosphere for dialogue and talks, China is opposed to displays of force and the use of threats. People are aware that the sudden emergence of a tense situation on the Korean peninsula is entirely the result of some countries' vain attempts to exert pressure. The United States has announced the dispatch of "Patriot" missiles to the ROK, Japan wanted to draw up "economic sanctions" against the DPRK, and the ROK announced a "special state of alert" for the three armed services of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. Under such circumstances, threatening words from both sides have also gradually escalated. The DPRK side has said that if war breaks out, Seoul will become "a sea of fire," and the ROK side asserted that it would "take advantage of the opportunity of the north's provocation to reunify the entire peninsula." This can only aggravate confrontation between the two sides. What is gratifying is that during recent talks with Chinese leaders, President Kim Yong-sam said that "the ROK also hopes to settle the nuclear issue through dialogue and talks and does not wish to exert pressure." At the same time, according to information from the DPRK side, "the DPRK is ready to accept a new round of investigations by people from abroad of her nuclear facilities." These are undoubtedly positive developments in the state of affairs and a step in the right direction.
