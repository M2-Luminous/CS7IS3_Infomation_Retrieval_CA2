In statements to ACAN-EFE, Herbruger Asturias indicated that a referendum is based on valid votes and not on the number of people who did not vote and voluntarily excluded themselves from participating in the solution of a national problem. Herbruger Asturias, who prior to holding the vice presidency was the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) president, pointed out that the people's abstention in the referendum "had been anticipated a long time ago" and "nobody said it would weaken the government." "We have to take into account that the electoral system gives people the option to vote as it is only a civic duty," Herbruger argued. He credited the electorate's poor response "to the people's indifference. They do not care what happens politically in their country" and not to the recent terrorist actions. "I don't believe the terrorist actions negatively affected the referendum, although this was their purpose. People vote with or without terrorism," the vice president underscored. Arturo Herbruger cast his yes vote at the Belen Institute, located approximately 600 meters from the government offices, and he showed his ballot to reporters. For this reason, the Union of the National Center requested that his vote be annulled. According to National Prosecutor Sydney Shaw, the vice president violated the electoral and political parties laws because the vote is secret. However, TSE President Fernando Bonilla indicated that the electoral law does not stipulate any penalty for citizens who show their ballots. The Guatemalans were called to a referendum today. They have to approve or reject the constitutional reforms negotiated between the deputies and President Ramiro de Leon Carpio in November 1993. The reforms include the purge of government organizations and an end to the political confrontations between government branches. The first results reported by the media indicate the victory of the "yes" vote. This victory, however, has been minimized by the high abstention rate, which, according to local politicians, could be greater than 60 percent. Important union and civic organizations, as well as the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity -- with which the government will hold peace talks in February -- had requested people to abstain from voting.
