Hirsch-Ballin thanked Germany in particular for the initiative to establish Europol. The initiative was initiated by Chancellor Helmut Kohl a few years ago. However, in an interview with DIE WELT, Europol chief Juergen Storbeck (47) points out that Europol is still in the process of being established. However, the new authority "already functions as an information and data exchange for the 12 European Union members," stresses Storbeck, who was a former head of the Organized Crime Department in the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations in Wiesbaden. This is particularly important and helpful for combating organized drug trafficking. However, it is still unclear whether Europol will, some day, also have executive powers. In the long run, Europol can develop into a real European investigative body, as is set down in the Maastricht Treaty, if the European Union members agree. Question to Storbeck: What can Europol/EDU (drug authority) really do? Storbeck: "If, for instance, the Hamburg police want information about a person who is wanted in Europe, it can get this information from us within an hour. In the past, something like that took days." In addition, Europol is analyzing the development and trends of crime with the help of a computer network, which is already working all over the European Union. "Through this intensive European exchange of data, we can, for instance, see when the Balkan route in drug trafficking is shifting and we can tell our colleagues in the individual countries affected so that corresponding countermeasures can be taken," Storbeck says. "Or we can inform the respective national police authorities, such as the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations, about the emergence of new international criminal gangs."
