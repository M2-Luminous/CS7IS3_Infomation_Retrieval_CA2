He said that a total of $100 million would be granted in the first half of this year for a glass factory project designed to manufacture bottles for dry and vintage wines and champagne meeting European standards. A further $50 million is to spent for the construction of an environmentally safe power station in the town of Beltsy. Other projects under discussion include the refurbishment of wine and canned product factories to help increase Moldova's exports to the West as well as a port facility on the Danube river and fast railway line from Kishinev to Yassy. IF Note: Until recently, Moldova depended on IMF and the World Bank for financial aide now running at more than $300 million. EBRD is expected to open credit lines for direct financing of the country's key economic sectors including vineries and wine industry which account for 45 percent of its annual foreign earnings. The project covers 10 vineries, which can help toward higher wine exports when updated. This year, Moldova is expected to sell a total of 30 million bottles of champagne, dry and vintage wines which makes up 8-10 percent of the total produced (wine exports to Russia run at 55 percent).
