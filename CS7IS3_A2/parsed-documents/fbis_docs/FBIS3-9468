Do you know anything about the source of the rumors, and how do you rate the arguments "for" and "against" such alleged intentions? [Totomirov] Personally, I am convinced that the question is being artificially fanned by the press and is based on various sources. If we accept such rumors as true, they apply in particular to the Ground Forces [SV] personnel. Reflecting on this aspect of the question I can only assume that such ill-intentioned, conspiratorial rumors, conceived "in the dark," serve certain poorly concocted plans that reflect a total lack of patriotic feelings. My conviction is based on the recent meeting between the KSV and members of the parliamentary National Security Commission. At the meeting the commission chairman Mr. Slatinski, himself, and the representatives of the Defense Ministry and Army General Staff confirmed that eliminating the KSV was not on the agenda for the time being. The allegation that the KSV was created by "foreign commission," that is, on the initiative of the Warsaw Pact, also appears outdated. It was clear that such command staffs were established long before us in NATO member-states such as Greece, France, the UK, Italy, and other countries. The most convincing evidence of the absence of a "Soviet connection" in the creation of the KSV within the Bulgarian Army is the establishment of an analogous command staff in the Romanian Army following the disbanding of the Warsaw Pact, rather than during the time it still existed. Thus, I do not believe rumors and allegations, but prefer to trust authoritative institutions. In other words, no arguments "for" and "against" disbanding the KSV exist at all. I would rather say that we are confronted with a poorly concocted "fiction" based on specific, biased intentions. [Lyutskanov] Are you expecting any dismissals among the officers and sergeants in the Ground Forces? [Totomirov] There are constant rumors about imminent dismissals. Not only do they have a negative impact on the self- confidence and enthusiasm of our officers and sergeants, but are a cause of concern for military personnel, for all employees and workers in the military institutions. An officer who has devoted his entire life to the military does not deserve to be confronted with such uncertainty about his future. It is very easy to dismiss officers and sergeants; it is much more difficult to train military cadres. While the first thing, dismissal, is a unilateral act and can be done at a stroke, the second is a very difficult and lengthy process. The Ground Forces are currently suffering from a lack of the necessary officers' corps. Unlike in previous years, however, the lack of well-trained officers not only affects the command staffs, but also the sub-units. Compared with the past, 20 percent of the officers' posts are unoccupied in the KSV today. The reformed Bulgarian Army needs well trained and experienced cadres. Hence, before dismissing cadres, we should know who will replace them. [Lyutskanov] What kind of resources in terms of money and officers are required for the redeployment of the SV in accordance with the new military doctrine? [Totomirov] The SV reform is a complicated and lengthy process involving the following tasks: redeployment of certain units and groups of units, transition to brigade organization and adjusting the combat staff to the established quotas, rearmament with effective and updated armaments and equipment, improvement in the professional training of military cadres and personnel, transition to a system of mixed equipment [komplektuvane] of the troops, and so forth. These tasks require the implementation of a series of measures, but they also call for time and money. So if I mention an amount needed for the redeployment of the SV, it would hardly be accurate. Before redeploying the sub-units, we must build, repair, or adapt the barracks and living quarters for army personnel to the existing infrastructure. We need to provide parking space and storage, and premises and facilities so training can be carried out inside and outside the barracks. In 1993 only 17 million leva out of the 160 million needed were granted for the planned major repairs of storage areas and parking facilities. A total of 2,049 officers in Plovdiv, Sliven, Stara Zagora, Blagoevgrad, and Shumen have no quarters. Considerably fewer motor vehicles than necessary are provided for our units and groups of units today, which means that the number of firing exercises and the amount of tactical training has to be reduced. We are trying to promote certain measures that do not cost much money. As far as the officers' corps of the Ground Forces is concerned, it is well trained and ready to implement the reform. It is now necessary to fulfill the remaining conditions for the reform.
