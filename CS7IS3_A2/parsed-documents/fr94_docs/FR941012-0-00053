OSHA Fatality/Catastrophe Investigations Report (FCI). OSHA regulations require that all workplace fatalities be reported to the nearest OSHA Area Office. Employers are required to complete a Fatality/Catastrophe Event Report Form (OSHA 36), which is reviewed by the OSHA Area Director to determine whether an investigation of the fatality is warranted. In 1989, OSHA published a study of 141 logging fatalities that occurred during the period of 1978&hyph;84 (Ex. 4&hyph;61). These fatalities do not represent all logging industry fatalities during that time period. According to the study, 71 percent of those logging employees killed were out in the cutting area. Only one percent each were killed on skid trails or at landings. The study also indicated that 43 percent of those killed were felling trees at the time. Employees performing yarding and bucking and limbing operations each accounted for 13 percent of the fatalities. The overwhelming majority of employees (72%) were killed when they were struck or crushed by a tree, log or limb, while 17 percent were killed in machine accidents. One percent were killed in chain-saw accidents. Unsafe work practices, misjudgments and lack of training or supervision accounted for 42 percent of the fatalities while less than one percent were due to equipment failure. 6. Maine Bureau of Labor Statistics. The State of Maine Bureau of Labor Statistics (Maine BLS) has compiled various statistics on injuries and fatalities in the logging industry (Ex. 4&hyph;174, 4&hyph;175, 4&hyph;176). Maine BLS conducted a detailed survey of 189 logging employee injuries that occurred between May and July of 1982 (Ex. 4&hyph;175). This number does not represent all logging employees who were injured during that period. According to this survey, 35 percent of employees reporting injuries were struck by trees, logs or limbs. Chain-saw accidents accounted for 26 percent of the reported injuries while 13 percent of the logging employees were injured in slips or falls. According to Maine BLS, the category that showed a significantly higher than average percentage of disabling injuries was chain-saw accidents. Over one-half of all chain-saw accidents involved kickback. In over 70 percent of the kickback accidents, the chain saws were equipped with chain brakes. Maine BLS said that chain brakes had played a significant role in lessening the effects of the injury. Less than 13 percent of chain-saw accidents where chain brakes were present resulted in hospitalization, while nearly 50 percent of the accidents involving other than chain saws resulted in hospitalization. This survey also indicates that two-thirds of all logging accidents resulted in lost workdays and 13 percent of all injuries required at least one overnight in the hospital. The average hospitalization was for five days. Maine BLS has also compiled statistics from 1980&hyph;87 of chain-saw injuries that resulted in a first report of serious injury (Ex. 4&hyph;176). According to this report, average chain-saw injuries for each year was 362. Of those, an average of 237 (65%) were disabling injuries, that is, injuries which result in lost workdays. Maine BLS has also examined disabling logging injuries reported from 1985&hyph;87 that had resulted in lacerations (Ex. 4&hyph;174). During those three years, there were an average of 183 disabling lacerations each year. 7. Washington State Logging Fatalities. A detailed study has been compiled on logging fatalities in the State of Washington from 1977&hyph;83 (Ex. 4&hyph;129). Of the 135 fatalities that occurred during those years, the study analyzed 92 percent of them. Death certificates and reports of investigations by Washington OSHA were used in the analysis. According to this study, the overall annual fatality rate for logging during this period was approximately 2 per 1,000 full-time employees. Those employees who were killed had a mean length of experience in the logging industry of 11.6 years. Less than 10 percent had less than one year's experience. More than 40 percent of all loggers killed were engaged in felling activities, while 23 percent were killed performing yarding operations. Almost 20 percent of the loggers were operating logging machines at the time of their accident. Table 20 shows the jobs employees were performing at the time of their accident.
