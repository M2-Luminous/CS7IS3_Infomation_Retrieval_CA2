A high-ranking Syrian official has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that what President al-Asad proposes at the Geneva summit meeting will be the most important factor for the establishment of full peace in the region and that U.S. President Bill Clinton would not have requested the meeting with President al-Asad had he not been strongly convinced that the Syrian demands representing all Arab rights are just and that the forthcoming peace will not be a fragile peace but a genuine, firm, and strong peace that will provide security and prosperity for the region. The Syrian official said that President al-Asad will carry with him a complete peace document not about liberation of the Golan and Syrian-Israeli peace but about liberation of the accupied Arab territories and restoration of rights. He added that when President al-Asad received U.S. Secretary of State Christopher and in his contacts with President Clinton, he repeated the same position, namely that peace is an indivisible integral whole and cannot be achieved in some parts to the exclusion of other parts, and that the Gaza-Jericho agreement was the best proof exposing Israel's lack of interest in peace except on its own terms and in fulfillment of its own objectives. The Syrian official said that Syria's aim is to preserve the unified Arab position of the frontline states in the face of future challenges because Israel continues to change the realities on the ground, showing no interest in progress that would lead to a just and lasting peace. The Syrian official added that the current Syrian-Jordanian-Lebanese coordination is important in case the bilateral peace negotiations are resumed. The senior Syrian official said that the Geneva summit is a major turning point in U.S.-Syrian relations and that the summit and its results will determine whether or not a just peace is possible. Perhaps the changes in U.S.-Syrian relations and the U.S. emphasis on Syria's central role in the peace process have made Israeli very resentful and aroused its concern because Rabin cannot walk away from the clear concept of peace to be proposed by Syria in Geneva, otherwise he would lose the justification for his continuation in power. Syria, the Syrian official said, insists on complete withdrawal from the Golan and southern Lebanon, and the al-Asad-Clinton summit will witness a Syrian position pressing for a revival of Resolution 425 on Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon. That, he said, confirms the credibility of Syria's position on Lebanon and shows that Syria cannot possibly barter Lebanese territory, not even a single grain of Lebanese soil, in return for the restoration of its own territory whatever its size. By taking that stance, Syria will pave the way for Lebanese diplomacy in the next phase of peace negotiations. Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri has expressed full satisfaction with the results of his talks and consultations in Damascus with President Hafiz al-Asad at a meeting lasting three hours. Lebanese sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the consultation channels between Damascus and Beirut will remain open at the highest levels until the moment President Hafiz al-Asad leaves Damascus on his peace trip to Geneva to submit the Syrian Arab demands in strong terms. The Lebanese sources quoted Prime Minister al-Hariri as saying that President al-Asad reaffirmed Syria's support and backing for Lebanon in all fields to enable it to fully regain its health and liberate its territory from Israeli occupation, emphasizing that Syria will never abandon Lebanon and leave it alone in the arena. President al-Asad also expressed support for the Lebanese Government and continuation of the current political situation with no changes until the processes of peace, accord, and reconstruction are completed. He also stressed that Syria will never abandon its demand and insistence on the implementation of Resolution 425 and Israeli withdrawal. [passage omitted]
