The Deputy Administrator of the DEA hereby certifies that proposed placement of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA into Schedule I of the CSA will have no significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. This action involves the control of a substance with no currently accepted medical use in the United States. This proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 of September 30, 1993. Drug scheduling matters are not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to provisions of E.O. 12866, Section 3(d)(1). This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in E.O. 12612, and it has been determined that this proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
