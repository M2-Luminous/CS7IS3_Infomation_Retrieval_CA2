FBIS4-28755 "dreas114_l_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-114 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 Philippines Military Support for Abu Sayyaf Group Suspected Military Support for Abu Sayyaf Group Suspected BK1306144894 Quezon City GMA-7 Radio-Television Arts Network in Tagalog 0930 GMT 13 Jun 94 BK1306144894 Quezon City GMA-7 Radio-Television Arts Network in Tagalog 0930 GMT 13 Jun 94 Tagalog BFN [Text] Senator Santanina Rasul suspects the terrorist Abu Sayyaf group is being supported by the military. According to Rasul, several persons have told her they saw the military helping some active members of the Abu Sayyaf group. [Begin Rasul recording in English] There are those who feel that the Abu Sayyaf or some people in the Abu Sayyaf are supported by the military. And I think the military should look into this angle -- that one of the leaders was seen being ferried by a PCF [expansion unknown], being ferried by a military chief, and escorted by military personnel in Basilan. So again, this has given rise to suspicion that maybe the Abu Sayyaf are not really what they are. Maybe, it is something more that, [pause] more than meets the eye. But on my part, as a leader of this region -- as a Muslim leader -- I feel that this incident should not be used to project the idea of Muslim-Christian conflict. [end recording] This statement followed information released by Criminal Investigation Service Regional Command 9, which stated that the firearms confiscated from Mujin Aminudin who is allegedly the supply officer of Abu Sayyaf, came from the Logistics Command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines at Camp Aguinaldo. Senator Rasul also said that the root cause of the Abu Sayyaf problem is attributed to the slow pace of the government's peace talks with the Muslim rebels, as well as the military's failure to grant Abu Sayyaf's earlier requests on their previous kidnapping operations. [Begin Rasul recording in English] So, I think we have to fast track this peace process with the Moro National Liberation Front [MNLF]. Otherwise, we will find ourselves on the losing end. The people who should be supporting the government might be incited by this extremist group to join forces with them because they feel that nothing much is happening in the peace talks between the MNLF and the government.
