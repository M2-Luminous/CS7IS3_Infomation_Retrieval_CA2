In his continued efforts to prevent a break in the peace talks, mediator Alioune Blondin Beye decided to move to the last point on the working agenda -- the conclusion of the electoral process, which is viewed as a less polemical topic. All the same, the Black Cockerel's delegation does not seem ready to give its views on the issue. Our correspondent Pedro Manuel reports. Good evening. The conclusion of the electoral process is being examined here in Lusaka. At a plenary session held here this morning, the mediator presented to the negotiating teams his views regarding the conclusion of the electoral process. This afternoon, the government team was examining the mediator's document and it will probably give a reply tomorrow. There are people who say, however, that UNITA is already contesting the mediator's views. It does not want to discuss this issue now, because it says it is not ready to do so. The conclusion of the electoral process is the last point on the working agenda of this round of peace talks. This does not mean, however, that agreements have been reached on all previous points. Alioune Blondin Beye decided to move forward and discuss the issue connected with the electoral process, while a formula is being sought to resolve the issue connected with the country's administration [words indistinct] to discuss all steps to be taken for the holding of the second round of presidential elections. During the debates on the conclusion of the electoral process, the negotiators could reach an agreement on the date of the second round of presidential elections.
