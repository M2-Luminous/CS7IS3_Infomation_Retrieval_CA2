Targulyan; from the ``Vesti'' newscast] [Text] The story of the U.S. vessel, the United States, which arrived in Sevastopol at the beginning of November, is starting to develop in an unexpected way. Its present Turkish bosses are trying to find a town prepared to dismantle and store 300,000 square meters of asbestos roofing. Such work would cost the United States $125 million. Turkey, following numerous protests from the ``Greens,'' banned the dismantling within its territorial waters. A factory in Sevastopol, that would be prepared to do this for $1 million, is being picketed by Greenpeace representatives, together with alarmed members of the public. They are indignant at the intention to bury the asbestos which is causing cancer and other grave illnesses on the southern coast of the Crimea. However, the borders of the CIS are clearly inaccessible to waste products. The United States now plans to take the asbestos to Russia and to bury it in the town of Azbest. A practice whereby rich countries produce waste and the poorer pay for it with their health and lives through burying, processing, or destroying it is absolutely immoral, Greenpeace says. We are demanding the immediate return of this poisonous vessel to its homeland, the United States.
