It was reported that the Balkan developments were discussed in connection with the internal problems of Turkey. In particular, it was concluded that Greece "is intensifying its policy of exploiting the Kurdish problem to weaken Turkey." A diplomat serving at the NSC General Secretariat said: "The public is not aware of it, but Turkey is rapidly being dragged into the Balkans clashes. Turkey is involved in the bargaining over Bosnia. In return for the joint decision to send troops to Bosnia, a promise has been made to Turkey. It certainly does not concern concessions in Bosnia. It may be a promise to help Turkey gain the initiative in the Middle East, or of U.S. support for Turkey against the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Political circles are talking about the wresting of a concession from Ankara during the U.S.-Turkey Joint Defense Council meeting in Ankara. The United States has no dispute with Turkey regarding the Kurdish problem. Though the Bosnian situation has attracted the public's attention, the most important issue for Turkey is the recent tension with Greece." "Tension Could Develop With Greece" Speaking to AYDINLIK, the diplomat continued by indicating that there is a possibility of a small-scale clash in the Aegean, and said: "The tension between Turkey and Greece will reach its climax during the Papandreou administration. A frightening tension has developed in recent days. The Turkish Foreign Ministry is extremely nervous about Greece, and a small-scale clash in the Aegean cannot be ruled out. Greece is doing everything to provoke such a development. Papandreou has launched an intense campaign against Turkey in south Cyprus for the past four months. They have reestablished EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters], and Greece has incorporated Cyprus within its defense zone. The Enosis [union of Cyprus with Greece] initiative, launched by a bloody coup in 1974, is now being promoted with velvet gloves. They have armed the Greek Cypriots excessively, and the army has been put on alert. In the meantime, Greece has stepped up pressure on the Turkish minority in Thrace. With the decision to dispatch Turkish troops to Bosnia, Greece launched an intensive counteroffensive. The dispatch of Greek Cypriot volunteers to Serbia is being organized in Cyprus and Greece. They are being sent there `to kill Turks.' Serious problems will arise if the soldiers of the Turkish contingent in Bosnia come under such attacks." PKK Promised Government in Exile In addition to the international developments, the NSC meeting also discussed Greece's support for the PKK. It reportedly examined allegations that the PKK's anti-tourism bombings in Turkey are being planned in south Cyprus. A report submitted to the NSC states that the PKK has been promised it can open official missions in Athens and south Nicosia, and that they will open soon. The report adds that the Greek government has promised the PKK it can establish "a government in exile" in Athens or Nicosia. Reportedly Turkey will be making preparations to counter these developments in the coming days. The NSC feels that intervention in Greece would not elicit a strong reaction from the West. An NSC expert pointed out that a crisis with Greece would promote national reconciliation inside Turkey.
