FR940106-0-00074 FR940106-0-00019 The second clarification revises the definition of ``exempted gear'' in the implementing regulations. Section 4.2.1 of the FMP states that exempted gear includes all gears other than groundfish trawl, longline, and fishpot (which are limited-entry gears). The FMP points out that shrimp trawl gear, a non-groundfish trawl gear, is an exempt gear. Shrimp trawl gear is not defined in terms of physical attributes, but includes trawl gear used to take pink shrimp, or spot or ridgeback prawns. Two other trawl fisheries, California halibut and California sea cucumber, also have been identified as non-groundfish trawl fisheries, which have traditionally landed small quantities of groundfish as a bycatch. However, the implementing regulations at 50 CFR 663.31 define ``exempted'' gear as all types of fishing gear except trawl, longline, and trap (or pot) gear, thus inadvertently excluding shrimp, California halibut, and California sea cucumber trawl gear from participation in the open-access fishery. This action clarifies that ``exempted'' gear includes all gear other than longline, trap, and groundfish trawl gear. Trawl gear used to take pink shrimp, spot prawns, ridgeback prawns, California halibut, or California sea cucumbers is specifically defined as ``exempted gear.'' ``Limited-entry gear'' is redefined to include ``groundfish trawl gear'' rather than ``all trawl gear.'' A new definition of ``groundfish trawl gear'' is added to include only trawl gear used under the authority of a valid Pacific Coast Groundfish limited-entry permit affixed with an endorsement for trawl gear. The third and fourth clarifications address how trip limits are established for groundfish taken in trawl fisheries for pink shrimp and spot and ridgeback prawn fisheries. Trip limits for groundfish in these fisheries have been fixed in the regulations at 50 CFR 663.24(a) and (b). The trip limits were codified because the Council did not foresee any future need to revise them under the management regime that existed prior to limited entry. Under Amendment 6, however, groundfish bycatch in the shrimp and prawn trawl fisheries is managed as a component of the ``open-access'' fishery because it is taken with ``exempted gear.'' Amendment 6 provides for the establishment of trip limits for bycatch of groundfish with exempted gear in the open-access fishery to make sure that the total catch of each species and species group does not exceed the historical catch proportions during the limited-entry qualifying period, and that the open-access allocations are not exceeded during the fishing year. Because the amount of effort in the open-access fishery may change over time, Amendment 6 contemplated that trip limits may need frequent revision. The Pacific coast groundfish regulations at 50 CFR 663.23(c) establish a category of management measures called ``routine.'' Routine measures include the types of management measures, primarily trip limits but also including trip frequency limits and bag limits in the recreational fishery, that need to be adjusted frequently in order to manage the fishery consistent with the FMP's goals and objectives. Once a particular management measure has been established by regulation as ``routine,'' the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) may recommend that the Secretary adjust that measure at any time, following consideration at a single Council meeting and publication of the adjustment in the Federal Register , provided that the purpose for the adjustment is consistent with the rationale for needing frequent adjustments that was articulated at the time the management measure was determined to be ``routine.'' Implementing regulations for Amendment 6 inadvertently omitted a ``routine'' designation for trip limits for groundfish in the shrimp and prawn trawl fisheries. The routine designation is necessary in order to limit the open-access catch of groundfish to its historical catch proportions and to ensure that the annual open-access allocation is not exceeded. Thus, this rule deletes the trip limits in the pink shrimp and spot and ridgeback prawn fisheries at 50 CFR 663.24(a) and (b) while simultaneously designating them as ``routine'' under 50 CFR 663.23(c)(2) so that the Council may recommend adjustments as necessary without undertaking the time-consuming regulatory amendment process. In accordance with the procedures for routine designation, the Council considered the routine designation for trip limits for pink shrimp and prawns at the September 1993 meeting and recommended the designation at its November 1993 meeting. Rockfish and sablefish trip landing and trip frequency limits for all gear are already designated as routine. This action clarifies the regulations to include trip landing and frequency limits for rockfish and sablefish in the open-access as well as the limited-entry portion of the Pacific coast groundfish fishery. The fifth clarification addresses an inconsistency between how catches in the ``limited-entry'' and ``open-access'' fisheries are accounted for, and how the allocations are calculated for each fishery. 50 CFR 663.32(c) provides that any groundfish caught by a vessel with a limited-entry permit will be counted against the limited-entry allocation while the limited-entry fishery for that vessel's limited-entry gear type is open. Thus, for example, while the limited-entry fishery for groundfish is open, any groundfish taken by a vessel with a limited-entry permit, even if it is fishing with exempted gear such as shrimp trawl gear, will be counted against the limited-entry allocation. In sections II.E.(d)(3) and (d)(4)(A)(1) and (2) of the appendix to part 663, the ``open-access'' allocation is derived by applying the open-access allocation percentage to the annual harvest guideline or quota after subtracting any set asides for recreational fishing or treaty Indians. The ``open-access allocation percentage'' is calculated by computing the total catch during the limited-entry qualifying (window) period by longlines and traps (or pots) not initially receiving a limited-entry endorsement for that gear, and by exempted gear, and dividing that amount by the total catch during the window period by all gear. Thus, the groundfish catch taken during the window period with exempted gear by a vessel that initially receives a limited-entry permit will be included in the open-access allocation even though the catch with that same exempted gear in 1994 and beyond will count against the limited-entry allocation as long as the limited-entry fishery is open. To rectify this inconsistency, this rule amends the regulations to provide that the window period catch by vessels not initially receiving limited-entry permits will count toward the ``open-access'' allocation; conversely, the window period catch with exempted gear by vessels initially receiving a limited-entry permit will count toward the ``limited-entry'' allocation. Finally, this rule clarifies that the ``regular'' season with longline and fish trap (or pot) gear (nontrawl gear) for sablefish refers only to the ``limited-entry'' fishery. Vessels participating in the ``open-access'' fishery are not affected by the regular season because they are regulated under open-access trip landing limits which extend throughout the year.
