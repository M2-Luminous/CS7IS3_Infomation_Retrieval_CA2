FBIS3-681 "drafr048_c_94044" FBIS-AFR-94-048 Document Type:Daily Report 11 Mar 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 11 Mar MB1103134594 MB1103134594 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE CITIZEN TEC ANC Vehicle for Action Against `Enemies' -- Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 10 March in its page-6 editorial says it expected the "African National Congress (ANC)-dominated Transitional Executive Council [TEC] to take over functions of the government, which it is doing," but "never expected it to show such arrogance and treat the government with such disrespect." The paper refers to the TEC's attempt to "stop Housing Minister Louis Shill from going ahead with his R90 billion [rand] housing scheme for the low-income sector." The TEC is "setting itself up as a vehicle for ANC action against its enemies, including Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader, and President Lucas Mangope of Bophuthatswana. This does not augur well for reconciliation and national unity, but suggests a dictatorial, aggressive attitude which can only exacerbate matters." THE STAR Warning Against Postponing Election -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 11 March in a page-12 editorial notes that General Constand Viljoen of the Freedom Front, Lucas Mangope of Bophuthatswana, and the Inkatha Freedom Party's Mangosuthu Buthelezi want international mediation. "While such intervention implies neutral adjudication, it will not guarantee a satisfactory outcome, and will almost certainly (because of the time factor) require a postponement of the election. The country simply cannot afford that. If only out of considerations of security and reducing uncertainties, the poll must go ahead on April 27." BUSINESS DAY SANCO Appoints Itself `Inquisitor' for ANC -- "Spotting an opportunity for power and influence, SANCO [South African National Civic Organization] has appointed itself the extra-parliamentary enforcer of the ANC's reconstruction and development programme," declares a page 6 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 11 March. "It is now setting about stamping its undemocratic authority on a programme for which it is not accountable." "Last November, SANCO said it would investigate the operations of development agencies such as the Independent Development Trust and the SA Development Bank. Both of these operate with public funds and their activities can legitimately be questioned and directed by a new government; SANCO has appointed itself their inquisitor. In addition, it is now targeting private development agencies, the non-government organisations which raise and disburse money here, or which are channels of donations from abroad. SANCO is now determined to see that these funds, too, go where SANCO directs." BUSINESS DAY advises these agencies to "ignore these questions." "SANCO has no right to this information and replies may well lead to 'suggestions' about changes in priorities or procedures." WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN Call for Military Solution in Bophuthatswana -- Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in English for 11-17 March says in a page-16 editorial it "does not, as a rule, favour military solutions to political problems" like the unrest in Bophuthatswana. "But there is a very real prospect that more lives may be lost, and the crisis in the homeland may spiral out of control, if De Klerk continues to stay his hand. What, after all, are the `South African interests' De Klerk says must be jeopardised before he will intervene? Are they not the two million people South Africa cut adrift when it granted Bophuthatswana independence, and who have the inalienable right to cast their votes in the country's first non-racial elections?" CAPE TIMES Zimbabwe Government Abuse of Seized Land -- "The disclosure in our news columns that the first of 70 private farms seized by the Zimbabwe government ostensibly for peasant resettlement has in fact been allocated to a cabinet minister is yet another reminder of how government interference in the marketplace can be abused," warns a page-6 editorial in Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English on 9 March.
