A Foreign Ministry statement said that some declarations claimed to have been made by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin are untrue. The press on Monday had said that President Rauf Denktas of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] said "if southern Cyprus joins European Union [EU], we will join Turkey" and that Cetin answered by saying "let's see if the TRNC people will then support Denktas." The statement said these allegations were untrue. "Turkey believes that any decision on the membership of the Greek Cypriot to the EU without the knowledge or agreement of the Turkish Cypriots will hurt the talks process to solve the issue," the statement also added.
