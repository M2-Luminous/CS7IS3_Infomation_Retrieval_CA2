[passage omitted] Today, the country is at peace. Even though things are still not stable, organizing the military in general and organizing and building the special operations units in particular are different than in the past. In the present stage, construction and combat readiness are the leading tasks. Furthermore, the army's task of defending our socialist fatherland now has different requirements and themes: defending our independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity is tied to defending the party, defending the socialist system, and maintaining the country's political security. Opposing peaceful change and rebellions has become the leading task. This must be coordinated with and dealt with actively together with other situations. We are no longer receiving military aid from abroad as in the past, and today's national defense budget is limited. Thus, renovating organization and building forces in accord with the requirements, tasks, and new situation is the task of each branch of service and branch, which includes the special operations branch. In my view, in building special operations forces today, we must concentrate on the following main themes: 1. We must build special operations forces that are really well-trained, particularly forces that are well-trained politically. Special operations forces' combat strength is crystallized by many factors. This is the strength of the strong political capabilities, unique special operations combat arts, and tight military organization of a crack, revolutionary, and regular force that is gradually being modernized. If we simply compare our strength to that of the enemy, it will be very difficult to explain the victories of our special operations troops. Recent wars have shown that in many situations, one sapper team has successfully attacked a major target deep in the enemy's rear, an operation that would have been difficult for an infantry regiment, or even a division, to carry out. This stems mainly from the "special nature" of the special operations forces in all the factors and relationships, their skill in organizing and building forces, their special operating formulas, and their special capabilities in attacking the enemy. Thus, building special operations forces who are well-trained in all respects, particularly in politics, is an urgent and long-term task. As warfare develops and the enemy uses more and more weapons and more high-tech equipment, more and more attention must be given to this requirement. In today's conditions and in a people's war to defend the fatherland (if war should break out), the special operations forces must be organized broadly. But this does not mean that there should be large numbers of poor-quality troops spread far and wide. The guiding ideas of the party must always be thoroughly understood in building forces, and quality, particularly political quality, must always come first. Starting now, in carrying out the national defense and security tasks and maintaining political stability in the country, this issue must be greatly elevated. The enemy's "peaceful change" plot is constantly making advances and hurting us. The struggle against aggression is actually underway. This cannot wait until there is a war of aggression. Unless we defeat their plots and stratagems in peacetime, we could lose the party and the regime, as has happened in many countries. Once the leading party and the regime is lost, the entire system will be lost, and that will lead to the loss of the country. We will fall into the orbit of neocolonialism in one form or another. This new task requires that the military, which includes special operations troops, have a new combat strength and contribute, together with all the people, to winning the complex and very difficult "political war." At the same time, it must have the strength to serve as the activist for all the people and be prepared to defeat a war of aggression if war should break out in order to defend our socialist Vietnamese fatherland. Special operations cadres and soldiers must have strong political capabilities and adhere closely to the targets and ideals. They must be absolutely loyal to the fatherland and people and be vigilant. They must react quickly to all types of enemies and not vacillate or waver in the face of the deceptive arguments of the enemy or in the face of monetary or material bribes. At the same time, sappers must be imbued with a lofty idea of the offensive. They must be resolute, brave, and daring. They must have adequate military knowledge and be physically strong. Only then will they be able to stand firmly and fight for long periods in terrible conditions, have the fortitude to overcome difficulties, and have the wisdom and ability to defeat targets not of their choosing in conditions in which they are at a disadvantage in terms of both forces and equipment. With this spirit, along with improving the quality of military training, the special operations branch has constantly strengthened political and ideological education, regarding this as one of the important things for ensuring that the sapper forces are built up and can fight victoriously. [passage omitted] Political education must enable everyone to see that the tasks of sappers today have expanded as compared with those during the national liberation war. Because of this, the disciplinary and tactical requirements are higher, and this defines the determination to study and train to satisfy the requirements and fulfill the tasks. 2. Special operations detachments that are strong in all respects must be built. With respect to the special operations branch, just as in the past, the combat units must build strong sapper teams, spearheads, units, and joint units that have the ability to fight on any battlefield and attack targets deep in the enemy's rear using the equipment available. This is a pressing and long-term requirement. To build special operations detachments requires above all a thorough understanding of the spirit of General Staff Directive 116CT-TM on building units that are strong in all respects. Because of the special nature of the special operations forces, we are concentrating on the following: We must build strong party organizations, particularly party chapters and party cells. The various-echelon party organizations, particularly the party chapters, must really have the ability to lead the party members and masses in the units. The party organizations must ensure that people thoroughly understand the party's resolutions, policies, and lines and carry out the construction and combat training tasks for their units. At the same time, because sappers usually operate in small numbers far from the guidance of higher echelons, the branch is giving much attention to building party chapters having many outstanding members. Today, in the special operations branch, all combat units have party chapters. The problem is to ensure that many party chapters have party committee echelons and that more and more party chapters are strong in all respects. An important requirement is to build ranks of primary-level management cadres, because cadres are the root of every victory. Special operations cadres must not only have excellent technical and tactical standards and be strong physically but they must also be highly skilled in mobilizing the masses and building political bases among the people. They must be able to organize an area and be skilled in training the cadres and soldiers subordinate to them. The experiences gained from past battles and operations have been reviewed. Both the successful and unsuccessful experiences must be passed on to subordinate cadres and soldiers through both formal training and on-the-job training. Combat readiness training and training in discipline and order are central tasks in building detachments that are strong in all respects. Today, just as in other infantry units, sappers are obligated to serve in the military for only 2 years. In such a short period, training must be planned and follow a scientific model in order to ensure that 1st-year soldiers have good basic standards and that 2d-year soldiers are well-trained and skilled in every respect. Emphasis must be placed on forging excellent skills in independent combat as well as in joint combat with other branches of service and other arms. Combat training must be coordinated with physical education and with strengthening discipline and order. For a long time to come, just as in the past, the special operations troops will have to carry on operations and fight for long periods with just the equipment and food they carry. Thus, they must be physically strong and have a good concept of organization and discipline. Sapper discipline does not stop here but also manifests high combat coordination. In unusual times, special military knowledge will be used to affect the prestige of Uncle Ho's troops. [passage omitted] 3. Reviewing things and carrying on scientific studies must be strengthened in order to satisfy the new requirements and fulfill the new tasks. [passage omitted] If a war to defend the fatherland breaks out, the enemy will certainly use modern, high-tech weapons and equipment. But special operations forces must manifest their great role and exploit special methods of attack on the battlefields of a people's war based on the training that they received in peacetime. The special operations troops can attack important targets on land, command bases, rear area and technical targets, and the aircraft and ships of the enemy deep in their rear. Making complete preparations so that the special operations forces can fulfill the combat readiness tasks based on the experiences of the war for national liberation does not mean blindly applying the old experiences to the new situation, which changed has and developed. The special operations branch must study many problems such as the organization and construction of sapper forces, sapper combat arts, the use of sappers of integrated branch commands, formulas to maintain rear services, techniques, intelligence for the sappers during combat, and so on. Above all, plans must be studied to determine how to organize the special operations forces in a rational manner, from the special operations forces of the command and in the military regions and corps to the local special operations forces. The necessary ratio between professional forces and draftees in today's special operations units must be determined. Formulas for having sappers carry out quick and secret operations must be studied, and plans to build corridors, positions, and political bases in predetermined locations must be studied. Scientific research must go deeply into studying and purchasing new weapons and equipment, new modes of attack, and writing training materials for the special operations troops. The highest requirement with respect to the weapons and equipment used by sappers is that they are compact, easy to use, easy to assemble and set up, and easy to transport on both land and in water, that their shape is suited to each type of special operations force, and that they are highly destructive. Weapons research must be directed toward the application of the newest technology in order to improve the old types of weapons and improve and purchase equipment so that the special operations forces can operate at remote distances on both land and at sea. The signal and liaison means and reconnaissance means of the special operations forces is another difficult problem that must be studied. An important research task is to ensure that the special operations troops eat a proper diet and are physically healthy so that they can carry out the immediate tasks and remain in good health. Studies must be done on processing highly nutritious foods that are easy to use and that can be preserved for long periods. Food for water sappers, for example, must be small, light, impervious to water, and easy to use so that the sappers can eat while swimming. On the other hand, studies must be done on manufacturing preventive medicines and other drugs suited to independent activities, particularly when sappers must rely on themselves at sea. Many of the scientific research problems exceed the capabilities of the special operations forces. It is hoped that the state, the Ministry of Defense, and scientists both in and outside the military will provide help.
