While Balladur works to improve France's economic and social conditions, he "paradoxically" profits from the electorate's fear that it could worsen conditions by contesting the government's actions, Jeambar writes. Economic recovery might bring down Balladur's popularity by "removing the danger," he concludes. Balladur' s Presidential Prospects After Minister of Health Simone Veil and Minister of Defense Francois Leotard--both UDF members--strongly approved during television interviews of a Balladur candidacy in the next presidential elections, Jacques Patoz commented in the 20 December Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS that the two ministers' statements are really intended to block other candidacies and are "certainly not a naive homage to the prime minister." Many UDF officials wish to see Balladur as the conservative coalition's presidential candidate, Patoz writes, because they want to forestall the candidacies of UDF leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing and RPR leader Jacques Chirac. The endorsement of Balladur by Veil and Leotard was "logical" but "clumsy," Patoz continues. By opening the presidential debate and promoting confict based on party and personality differences, Veil and Leotard risk weakening the governing majority as well as the prime minister, whose strategy has been to place himself above partisan quarrels, Patoz writes. If Balladur is indeed considering a run at the presidency, being viewed as the UDF's favorite places him in a delicate position in his own RPR among those who disapprove of his policies or remain Chirac loyalists. Veil and Leotard's embrace of Balladur indirectly reinforces Chirac's position, Patoz concludes.
