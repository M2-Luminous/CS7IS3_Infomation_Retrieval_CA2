[passage omitted] Brother President Abu-'Ammar said that the press has never played such an important role in an international issue such as the role it has played in the Palestinian cause and the Middle East crisis over the last three decades. This was due to the region's sensitivity and importance compared with other parts of the world and the peoples of the world, a factor that explains the need to deal with the peace process in objectivity and justice, so as to reach a just solution guaranteeing our people's inalienable rights, freedom and independence. President 'Arafat called on the conferees to support the peace process and our people's efforts to build their national institutions, economic structure and infrastructure so that they can feel and enjoy the fruits of peace and look forward to a promising future in which stability, security and cooperation prevails between all the countries and peoples of the Middle East. 'Arafat stressed that the Palestinian National Authority, which was formed a few days ago to manage our people's affairs until free and open general elections are held, is committed to its obligations regarding peace and the freedom of the individual, the freedom of thought, the freedom of work and the freedom of the press for the sake of a real interaction in the open Palestinian society. [passage omitted] It is worth mentioning that this conference, the first of its kind to be held in Jerusalem, will be held over three days at the invitation of the League of Arab Journalists and the International Journalists' Union to discuss the challenges facing Palestinian journalists. A number of journalists are unable to attend because of the closure of Jerusalem. Journalists also suffer from imprisonment, beatings and bans as occupation authorities still think with a mentality of occupation and not one of neighborliness; the proof is the closure of Jericho and Gaza and Jerusalem, brother Sai'd 'Uraykat said. Furthermore there are the increasing practices of the settlers and the army against our people.
