In a 26 January statement to the local media, Pedro Noyola, deputy secretary of foreign commerce and investment at the Secretariat of Commerce, said foreign investors are still interested in this country despite the military conflict in Chiapas. "Investment projects are still strong," Noyola said to refute newspaper reports which claimed at least 100 programs were put "on hold" in the Secretariat of Commerce because of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) rebellion. Pedro Noyola announced the government and business groups were sponsoring nearly 500 foreign investment projects aimed at strengthening the textile, agro-industrial, tourism, commercial, and manufacture sectors starting this year. The plan foresees the promotion of investments through a litany of projects, and it includes the participation of the Secretariat of Commerce, the Foreign Trade National Bank, and the Mexican Businessmen's Council. The political crisis in Chiapas, yet unresolved, has created uneasiness among financial groups, tourism companies, and powerful local businessmen who stated fears about Mexico's economic future during the first week of the armed conflict. Referring to Mexico's foreign trade, Noyola said this sector experienced a growth rate of 325 percent over the past eight years, surpassing the United States, Germany, Japan, and the Pacific Rim countries. The growth rate achieved by the United States during that period was 170 percent; Germany 125 percent; Japan 130 percent; and "the Asian Tigers only achieved 270 percent," Noyola said. Mexico has maintained an annual productivity growth rate of between 6 and 7 percent since 1989 while the United States barely achieved "between 2 and 4 percent," he added. In another area, he said Mexico registered a participation in excess of 6 percent in the United States' total manufactured imports, as compared to 3.2 percent registered in 1985.
