Exports and imports decreased by 11.4 percent each. However, with just under 2.8 billion Austrian schillings [AS], the total trade surplus with these countries was well over AS600 million higher than last year's surplus. This surplus could even be surpassed this year if the present positive trend continues, Egon Winkler, foreign economy chief of the Federal Economic Chamber, stated at a news conference. In the first quarter of this year, exports to this world region increased by 14.9 percent, while imports from there decreased by 14.3 percent. Winkler blamed the decline in the oil price and the late effects of the Gulf war for the decrease in trade with the Arab countries. So far, it has not been possible to make up for these losses. Because of the UN embargo against Iraq, this important export market where Austrian goods valued at 2.2 billion schillings had, after all, been ordered before was also lost. However, the peace process provides new hope for an economic recovery of the region. In the near future, the foreign trade organization will deal in detail with relations with the state of Palestine, which is just developing, he said. By far, the most important trade partner is Saudi Arabia, which bought Austrian goods for more than 2.5 billion schillings. Austria's imports from there, which consist almost entirely of oil, account for 2.1 billion schilings.
