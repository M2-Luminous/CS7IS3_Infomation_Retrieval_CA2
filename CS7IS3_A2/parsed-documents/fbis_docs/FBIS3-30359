On Tuesday [1 February], the government did not reach an agreement with the Inter-Union Strike Committee [MKS] of arms industry employees, who on 9 February will take part in the "Solidarity" demonstration against increasing unemployment and prices, and the decrease in employee incomes. "Certain traditional elements of arms-industry products will, of course, not be armed," we were told by "Solidarity" branch head Stanislaw Glowacki. The demands of the arms industry have changed only slightly since the "Solidarity" manifestation in front of the Office of the Council of Ministers last September. At that time, 2,000 employees of arms-industry factories declared that they had had enough of the negotiations, which they saw as fruitless. After seven-hour negotiations on 1 February, most of the demands of the MKS (Trade Union of the Electromachine Industry, National Section of the Arms Industry of "Solidarity," the "Metalworkers" Federation) were included in the column of differences of opinions with the government. The arms-industry employees demanded, among other things, that the governmental level of orders for military equipment and ammunition be set "at a level that guarantees maintenance of the state's defense readiness" (5.5 trillion zlotys). The government did not go beyond the amounts of money envisioned in the budget bill and declared that money obtained through the sale of equipment would be earmarked for such purchases. As for the issue of covering the costs of maintaining the so-called defense reserves (readiness to begin manufacturing military equipment in the event of war, which is required by the Army) between 1990 and 1993, the government promised that it would once again present the Council of Ministers with the proposal to cover these costs with the companies' debts to the budget. The government stressed that the budget bill envisions money for the restructurization of this sector: money obtained from credit guarantees and the so-called EFSAL [expansion unknown] fund. Trade unions believe that this should be financed, in addition, through state subsidies (only every third company retained its creditworthiness). They also demanded separate legal regulations concerning social protection for arms-industry employees. The government spoke about how the popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] would be abolished, which the MKS also found unacceptable. The MKS also demanded wage increases to compensate for price increases (in September 1993 they were at the level of 60 percent of average pay in the country). The government pointed out that indexation of wages is not possible now and that it is holding talks with trade unions on the issue of wage levels. As for the issue of recovering money for deliveries of equipment to the former Soviet Union, the government will continue negotiations with the Russian Federation and, as previously, will compensate the Russian debt with Poland's dues for the sold equipment. The MKS wants the losses to be covered regardless of the result of the negotiations with Russia. Also unresolved is the problem of limiting Poland's negative balance-of-equipment exports to states under UN resolutions, as well as the issue of prepension relief. However, the government confirmed that the duty-free contingent for importing military equipment exclusively concerns products that are not manufactured in Poland or that are imported to be assembled in Polish arms factories.
