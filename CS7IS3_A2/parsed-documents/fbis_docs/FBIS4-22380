Herd reductions occurred mainly at agricultural enterprises, while their number at the population's private plots increased. However, the increased share of herd owned by the population has not made up for its decline at agricultural enterprises. Changes in the size of the livestock herd as of 1 January 1994 as compared to 1 January 1993 at agricultural enterprises and those owned by the population (including private farms) in individual Commonwealth states are characterized by the following data (in percents): Horned cattle Including cows Swine Sheep and goats agricultural population agricultural population agricultural population agricultural population enterprises and private enterprises and private enterprises and private enterprises and private farms farms farms farms Belarus 93 100.5 98 102 94 103 61 96 Kazakhstan 90 110 96 107 87 113 96 109 Kyrgyzstan 80 107 82 106 62 82 72 97 Russia 90 105 93 107 86 103 79 95 Uzbekistan 96 102 103 102 73 84 95 102 Ukraine 94 106 97 108 89 106 89 114 In January of this year, there was a decline in production of animal husbandry products at agricultural enterprises.

The differential between city market prices for foodstuffs and those in retail trade in a number of states are characterized by the following data: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |January 1994 as % of December 1993 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |retail trade |city markets | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Azerbaijan |157 |161 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Armenia |138 |108 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Belarus |151 |152 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kazakhstan |157 |139 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kyrgyzstan |113 |113 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moldova |142 |122 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia |121 |116 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tajikistan |... |... | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Turkmenistan |121 |149 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Uzbekistan |123 |91 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In practically all Commonwealth countries the physical volume of retail turnover continued to decline in January, while the total value at the same times increased (as a result of price increases).

In most Commonwealth states in January (1 February as compared to 1 January), inventories of goods in the retail trade network increased, calculated on the basis of one-day turnover in January of this year. In Russia as of the beginning of the year, the inventories were sufficient for 36 days of trading, and as of 1 February--47 days; in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Armenia, and Kazakhstan--correspondingly 41-54 days and 59-62 days; in Ukraine--43 and 50; in Uzbekistan--63 and 72 days; and in Turkmenistan--82 and 93 days. Over the elapsed month as compared to the same period of last year, the physical volume of for-fee services declined in all Commonwealth states, and very significantly, even as compared to the already low level in January 1993. Below are the data on for-fee services provided by officially registered enterprises in the Commonwealth states in January 1994: Billion units In percents of January 1993 of national currency, in current prices and rates in current in comparable prices prices Azerbaijan, manats 1.14 572 41 Armenia, drams 0.05 2,533 26.0 Belarus, clearing rubles 107.1 1,963 77.2 Kazakhstan[.sup]*[/], tenge 0.20 2,100 61 Kyrgyzstan, soms 0.03 736 56.2 Moldova[.sup]*[/], lei 0.02 1,392 63.8 Russia, rubles[.sup]1[/] 700 1,100 52 Tajikistan, rubles 3.5 888 35.9 Turkmenistan[.sup]*[/], 0.02 3,100 63 manats Uzbekistan, sum-coupons 38.7 1,290 97.0 Ukraine, karbovantsy 4,150.0 3,490 75.8 [.sup]1[/] Including services provided by individuals--R1.2 trillion rubles, or 12 times as much as last year in current prices, or 42 percent below last year's volume in comparable prices. Over the past two years (January 1994 as compared to January 1992) the physical volume of services rendered to the population by officially registered enterprises in this sphere fell almost by half in Ukraine, declined almost by a factor of three in Russia, fell by about 40 percent in Uzbekistan and Belarus, and declined by almost a factor of four in Kyrgyzstan and Moldova. Prices and rates for all categories of for-fee services for the population went up in January. As compared to December of last year, they increased most in Armenia (by 172.7 percent) and Azerbaijan (by 66 percent), and the least in Uzbekistan (by 12 percent) and Kyrgyzstan (by 16.1 percent). Fees for municipal services went up over the month by 3.9 percent in Turkmenistan, by 5.6 percent in Kyrgyzstan, and 4.6-fold in Armenia; passenger transportation rates--by 3.6 percent in Uzbekistan, by 89.0 percent in Moldova, and 2.7-fold in Armenia. The greatest increase of communications services rates in January as compared to last year December occurred in Azerbaijan (by 216.8 percent) and Armenia (by 181.7 percent), and the smallest--in Kazakhstan (by 2.8 percent). Moldova, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan kept communications services rates at last December's level. Fees for attendance of preschool facilities went up in Azerbaijan by 668.3 percent, Armenia--by 300 percent, Moldova--by 10.2 percent, Turkmenistan--by 15.5 percent, and Uzbekistan--by 16.3 percent. The cost of a stay in a sanitarium or resort went up by 80.8 percent in Belarus, by 61.5 percent in Kazakhstan, by 56.5 percent in Uzbekistan, and by 13.8 percent in Turkmenistan. The Labor Market In January, 1.3 million unemployed were registered with employment services of the Commonwealth states, which is 1.5 times as many as during the corresponding period of last year. The dynamics of numbers of those looking for a job through an employment service and their placement in January are characterized by the following data (in thousands persons): Number of Registered Placed Registration Number of Including: unemployed in January in jobs terminated in unemployed received at the in January in the end status of beginning January of January unemployed of January Azerbaijan 1993 32.5 4.8 2.0 ... 35.0 6.9 1994 47.3 3.6 1.7 0.4 48.8 20.2 Armenia 1993 62.2 6.1 0.2 0.3 67.8 61.8 1994 110.2 3.7 0.2 1.0 112.9 104.8 Belarus 1993 24.0 19.5 5.2 6.9 31.4 31.4 1994 66.3 15.3 5.0 4.2 72.5 72.5 Georgia 1993 ... ... ... ... 93.9 20.5 1994 ... ... ... ... ... ...

In Ukraine, jobs were found for 7.5 percent of unemployed. The diminished proportional share of persons placed in jobs in January 1994 was caused by a decline in requests for workers filed with the employment service: For instance, in Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan their number declined by a factor of 1.5; in Moldova--by a factor of 1.2; and in Russia--by a factor of 1.1 The number of those who received the formal status of unemployed increased in Azerbaijan 2.9-fold, in Armenia--1.7-fold, in Belarus--2.3-fold, Kazakhstan and Ukraine--1.2-fold, Kyrgyzstan--1.6-fold, Moldova--1.1-fold, Russia--1.4 fold, and Uzbekistan--1.3-fold.
