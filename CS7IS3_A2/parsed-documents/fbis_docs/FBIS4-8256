Representatives of some small trade unions even walked out of the negotiating room in protest against the deletion of the article establishing the Council of Union Chairmen. The Council comprised 38 chairmen of the individual unions associated in the Chamber, each having one vote. On the other hand, the new statutes create a new body -- the CMKOS Assembly, in which individual unions are represented proportionately to their memberships. The Assembly is to meet once in six months. Representatives of small unions were opposed to the abolition of the Council because they are afraid of the numerical strength of large unions in the Assembly. Representatives of the large unions, on the other hand, said the Council was not functional.
