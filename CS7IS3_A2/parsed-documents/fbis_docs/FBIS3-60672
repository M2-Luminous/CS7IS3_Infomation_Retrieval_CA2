Talking informally to journalists in Islamabad today, she answered a number of questions, including those on the nuclear issue and the Pakistan- American relations. [Begin Bhutto recording] With the United States, we have also started a two-way dialogue to see how the two countries can overcome the problem that has arisen in their relationship. We cannot roll back [the nuclear program] and this is the position we have tried to explain to the United States that we cannot roll back. At the same time, we have explained to the United States that we support nonproliferation and we seek to have a peaceful nuclear program and so long as there is no threat to our security, our program will continue to be peaceful. We feel that the Pressler Amendment is unjustified because it is not only discriminatory, but it does not serve the purpose of regional nonproliferation. In fact, it is a veto in Indian hands. So, we are trying to pull Pakistan out of international isolation. We are trying to put Kashmir in its proper perspective and we are trying to put the Pressler Amendment in its proper perspective. Obviously, this is not liked by the opposition because our achievements only highlight their failure, and, so, they are kicking up a big dust about a non-issue. [end recording]
