Heavy industry still occupies an important position in the overall industrial production, and in particular, the production of non-ferrous metals smelting industry and the iron smelting industry have increased further. In April, the total production output value of heavy industry reached 2.167 billion yuan, 11.7 percent more than that of the same period last year. Heavy industry's sales volume was 2.021 billion yuan, up 6 percent over the corresponding period last year. Its production and marketing rate was 93.2 percent. 2.

Production output of natural gas was 26.36 million cubic meter, up 400 percent over the corresponding period last year. 3. Production costs have increased by a wide margin, and the deficit situation remains serious. According to the results of investigations made in 201 large and medium-sized industrial enterprises, there were 123 deficit-making enterprises, accounting for 61 percent of the total. The newly increased deficits occurred mainly in the machinery, chemical, and light industrial sectors. Therefore, they face a very strenuous task of turning from deficits to profits.
