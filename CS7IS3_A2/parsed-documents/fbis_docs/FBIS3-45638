Zhu Rongji, vice premier and governor of the People's Bank of China, gave an important speech at the closing session. He fully affirmed the achievements in financial work last year. Setting forth this year's guidelines for financial work, he forwarded a three-point demand on the vast number of cadres and workers in the financial system. Zhu Rongji said: The CPC Central Committee and State Council decided last June to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control of the national economy through rectification of financial order. Acting in accordance with the CPC Central Committee and State Council plan, the vast numbers of cadres and workers in the financial system firmly observed the "three agreed rules" in rectifying financial order, strictly enforcing financial discipline, pushing forward financial reform, and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, thereby swiftly reversing the chaotic financial situation. Afterward, they promptly studied and analyzed the new development and problems in the national economy. In line with the demand to "stop dishonest practices and promote healthy trends," they exercised the right amount of macroeconomic regulation and control and firmly and decisively adjusted the direction in the use of funds. As a result, over 99 percent of the state's key projects have obtained the necessary funds; there have been no IOU's in purchasing agricultural produce; the strained situation in the working capital of major production enterprises and foreign trade firms has been essentially eased; and the excessive fluctuation in the development of the national economy has been avoided effectively avoided. At the same time, the over-issue of money has been curtailed; the total volume of money supply for the year has been controlled within the predetermined target; the market exchange rate has been consistently stable; and the state foreign exchange reserves have increased. Facts have demonstrated that the vast numbers of cadres and workers in the financial system are a contingent capable of standing the test, and they are trustworthy and able to fight. Zhu Rongji expressed appreciation and extended regards to them on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and State Council. Zhu Rongji pointed out: Some problems popped up in our economic work during the first half of 1993. Through the strengthening of macroeconomic regulation and control, we have ameliorated these problems to some extent; however, we have not fundamentally addressed the profound problems. We have not set up a risk mechanism to restrain investment in fixed assets, and the inflationary pressure could build up at any time. The State Council has established guidelines for this year's financial work as follows: continuing the rectification of financial order, steadily promoting financial reform, strictly controlling total credit supply, and earnestly strengthening financial supervision and management. He said: We made great achievements in rectifying financial order last year. However, this does not mean the task of rectifying financial order has been accomplished. Rectifying financial order will be an arduous long-term task for the financial system and it must be persistently carried out without relaxing our efforts. Zhu Rongji called for continuous implementation of the "three agreed rules" set forth at the national conference on financial work last July. At the same time, he forwarded three additional demands on the vast numbers of financial cadres and workers: 1. Strictly control the total credit supply. The key to controlling the total credit supply is in limiting loans extended by banks at all levels to finance investment in fixed assets. Beginning this year, loans for key projects in infrastructure and basic industries will be arranged in a unified manner by the newly established state development bank; all other banks shall not use funds earmarked for non-fixed assets projects, particularly funds to be used as working capital, to finance investment in fixed assets. Banks at all levels shall not provide any loans to any unauthorized projects, projects beyond the total credit line, or components of an unauthorized project; the planned total credit line must not be exceeded even by one yuan. Investigation will be conducted to trace the responsibility of those who resort to illegitimate means to break the total credit line. 2. Once their policy-oriented businesses are divested, specialized banks shall begin their transition toward commercial banks. They shall make bold moves this year to explore and pioneer. In consideration of the fact that state-owned enterprises are currently in the process of changing their operating mechanism, specialized banks shall first implement a funding system based on the ratio of the enterprises' assets and liability within the limit of their credit line and then gradually establish a mechanism for self-restraint and risk-taking to assume responsibility for their own management decisions and profits and losses. In coordination with the enforcement of the "Bankruptcy Law," they shall make good use of the reserves for doubtful and bad loans, which have been increased this year. 3. Branches of the People's Bank of China at all levels shall earnestly change their functions and play a leading role in supervising and managing regional financial activities. Branches and sub-branches shall truly concentrate their energies on stabilizing currency and supervising and managing financial activities. At present, they shall make particular efforts to prevent the resurge of unauthorized fund raising activities by stopping every unauthorized one. Only by controlling unauthorized loans and fund-raising activities can we limit investment in fixed assets and reduce the inflationary pressure. Zhu Rongji urged the vast numbers of financial cadres and workers to strengthen the building of their ranks by earnestly studying the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and actively, correctly, and comprehensively grasp and implement Comrade Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. He urged them to earnestly implement Comrade Xiaoping's instruction, "operate the bank the way a bank should be operated" and refrain from operating the bank like a "currency issuance company" or a "safe," still less making the bank a locked "safe." Zhu Rongji concluded by urging all financial workers to unite, pluck up their spirits, and in accordance with the demands of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, accomplish in an all-around way every financial task. He urged them to make persistent efforts to carry out the struggle against corruption and, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, successfully handle the relationship between development and stability to promote sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. Zhou Zhengqing, vice governor of the People's Bank of China, delivered a work report at the beginning of the conference.
