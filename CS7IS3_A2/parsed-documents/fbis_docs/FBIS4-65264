FBIS4-65264 "drweu094_o_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-094 Daily Report 13 May 1994 Cyprus Officials Return From Vienna Talks Officials Return From Vienna Talks Spokesman Views Turkish Stand NC1305151094 Nicosia Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in Greek 1030 GMT 13 May 94 NC1305151094 Nicosia Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network Greek BFN [Text] Ankara and Denktas are playing games as they attempt to remove all responsibility from the Turkish side, or at least to have its responsibility diminished, for the lack of progress in the talks due to the well-known stance of the Turkish Cypriot leader. This statement was made today by acting Government Spokesman Spiros Arotis when he was asked to comment on the lengthy explanations Gustave Feissel, UN secretary general's alternate special representative, gave in Vienna to Rauf Denktas' two advisers. These explanations were made during the past two days in the presence of Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Tugay Ulucevik and Robert Lamb, U.S. coordinator on Cyprus. Mr. Arotis noted that Ankara and Rauf Denktas have played the same game many times in the past. He added: If Ankara wanted, it could find ways to persuade Rauf Denktas to accept the 21 March document. Responding to another question, the acting government spokesman said the Cyprus Government hopes the UN secretary general's report will be circulated without any further delay. He also emphasized President Glavkos Kliridhis' statement that the report should call a spade a spade and noted alternative ways for a Cyprus solution. Rauf Denktas has threatened to unite the pseudostate with Turkey if Cyprus is accepted as a full member of the European Union [EU]. His threat is aimed at putting pressure on the EU, specifically on some of its members, so Cyprus' application for accession will be denied. This statement was made by Spiros Arotis today when asked to comment on the statement made by Rauf Denktas in Turkey. Mr. Arotis expressed the conviction that Denktas' threats would not find any response whatsoever in the EU; he also feels that the international community would not allow Rauf Denktas to proceed in this direction. Besides, Mr. Arotis added, there is also the reaction of the Turkish Cypriots. He pointed out that Turkey itself also seeks accession to the EU.
