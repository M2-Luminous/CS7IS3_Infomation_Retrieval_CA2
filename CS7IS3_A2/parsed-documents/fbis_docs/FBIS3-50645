There are reports that certain guerrillas captured by the Army have been executed, the bishop said during a news conference. The bishop also said that it is "foreseeable" the civilian population will be repressed by the Army, because there has not been a delimitation of the battlefields where soldiers are fighting the guerrilla Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN). The bishop, who held a news conference minutes before the Air Force bombed a hill in the outskirts of San Cristobal, said that approximately 12,000 Army troops are deployed in the strife-torn region. The prelate, who is involved in the defense of human rights, particularly that of poor Indians, said that the Army's massive military response "seems to be a decision" to totally crush the movement, and in this framework "there are many wounded people who have not even been counted." Ruiz called on the two sides to agree on a cease-fire so as to begin negotiations with the church mediation to lay the foundations for a concerted effort to end the conflict, which broke out on 1 January when EZLN members violently occupied five municipalities in the southern State of Chiapas. He recommended that the situation be observed by national and foreign human rights observers, and he mentioned that Americas Watch, Amnesty International, and Lawyers of Minnesota are willing to come to the region to observe the situation.
