Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's assistant special envoy for Cyprus, who is holding preparatory talks for the implementation of the confidence-building measures, met at 1645 today for his second meeting with Denktas. In a statement to reporters after the three-hour meeting, Denktas remarked that the talks are continuing and the sides are trying to understand one another within this framework. He pointed out that important issues face the two sides. Noting that there is no cause for concern, Denktas explained that attempts are under way to determine the agenda. Agreement was reached on several matters and conciliation is sought on the remaining issues, he added. The president said that he will meet with Feissel again if necessary. We tried to reach full agreement on the topics discussed during today's meeting, Denktas announced, adding that he conveyed the issues that are important for the Turkish Cypriot side to the UN officials. Pointing out that he also supplied answers for the questions put to the Turkish Cypriot side, Denktas said that he may hold another meeting with Feissel in order to understand the real content of the proposals submitted to the Turkish Cypriot side. I do not believe that there are differences of opinion between the two sides on the main issues, Denktas stated and expressed the conviction that everything is in order with regard to the indirect talks to begin on 17 February. He said that there are still one or two small outstanding points on which the two sides are yet to agree and expressed the belief that conciliation will be reached on these points as well. In reaction to a Greek Cypriot radio report that the agenda for the indirect talks is comprised of six items, Denktas said there is no fait accompli on this matter and many aspects requested by the Turkish Cypriot side are also included in these six items. The six items are derived from the UN secretary general's report, Denktas noted, adding that Feissel and his colleagues summarized these principles under six items, whereas the Turkish Cypriot side expanded them into 12 separate items. Denktas remarked that the Turkish Cypriot side is trying to base the negotiating process on a solid foundation. The president stressed that it is the content and not the number of these items that is important. He expressed the belief that the items on the agenda cover both the Turkish and Greek Cypriots' demands. Denktas concluded by saying that one should not create difficulties that do not actually exist. [passage omitted]
