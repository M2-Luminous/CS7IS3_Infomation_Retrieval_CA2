India has managed to get significant concessions for the recently concluded Uruguay Round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) negotiations, and the areas in which it will get the benefits are, agricultural exports services, chemicals and pharmaceuticals exports and even textiles. This was disclosed by the Deputy Director General of GATT, Mr. Anwar Hoda at a discussion on the Uruguay Round, organised by Rajiv Gandhi Institute for Contemporary Studies. Mr. Hoda, who was formerly India's chief negotiator in the Uruguay Round, however, said the country would have to make major legislative as well as policy changes in order to fully reap the benefits of the GATT agreement. For instance, the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act could be amended to provide stricter norms for anti-competitive measures by drug companies to allow easier recourse to competitive licensing. Similarly, he agreed with the participants that a legislation on plant breeders' rights would enable India to have greater control in the area of gene patenting. Clarifying several issues on intellectual property rights, he said that wide ranging policy changes would have to be made in the field of patent laws. At the same time, drugs produced under present patents would not be affected. The new regime would apply only to drugs based on inventions made after the document actually comes into effect in early 1995. Certain areas, he said, had not been specified clearly. "Public non-commercial production" of drugs, Mr. Hoda felt, could be applied to pharmaceuticals distributed through hospitals or public institutions. These areas would probably be clarified in the coming months. Giving a comprehensive picture of what he termed the "end game" of GATT talks, Mr. Hoda said unilateral action was still possible by countries such as India, in order to gain greater benefits from the multilateral regime. But the U.S. would no longer be able to take any action under the section 301 of its Trade Act without reference to the newly created World Trade Organisation which will probably be finally set up by January 1995. This follows ratification of the agreement by member countries during 1994. "Exports will go up:" On exports, Mr. Hoda was optimistic that the country would increase its share of agricultural exports substantially, owing to reduction in tariff barriers. Wheat, rice and sugar are the commodities in which India could be highly competitive in world markets, he felt. The reduction of subsidies on the total volume of agricultural exports would also help. For instance, with the total volume of wheat trade ranging around 40 million tonnes, the reduction of subsidised trade would be in the region of eight million tonnes, thereby benefiting more efficient producers in developing countries. In chemicals, he said industrialised countries have agreed to harmonise tariffs and bring down the average tariff levels from 20 to 6.5 per cent. In pharmaceuticals, tariffs would be brought down to zero, giving a substantial benefit to India which is already exporting large quantities of bulk drugs. Mr. Hoda said that contrary to public perception the Indian delegation was able to make a major contribution to the final agreement, greatly disproportionate to its 0.5 per cent share of global trade. For instance, it was not widely known that it was through the efforts of the Indian and Pakistan delegations that the developed countries agreed to end the Multi-Fibre Agreement and provide a specific transition period for phasing out of quotas. Even in services, the movement of personnel was brought into focus by India, though the developed countries were only interested in other areas. He said a thin wedge had been opened to allow Indian personnel from consultancy and computer companies to be transferred and located abroad. The Indian team was also able to ensure that the differing airn of food subsidies in this country, compared to the developed world, was highlighted an recognised. Similarly, the import restrictions on consumer goods owing to balance of payment difficulties was accepted by GATT. India also played a major role in ensuring that the three agreements on TRIPS (trade related aspects of intellectual property rights), goods and services were kept separate, he said.
