Of the applications for trading permits totalling over $8.6 billion that are being considered by the UN Iraq Sanctions Commission in New York, Jordan accounts for $5.4 billion and Baden-Wuerrtemberg for a further $1.3 billion. The land authorities evidently have no knowledge of this. An application for this unusual billion-dollar deal was quietly lodged through the Foreign Ministry by a Mannheim-based jewelry designer in the middle of February without the knowledge of the Federal Export Agency in Eschborn. The Mannheim citizen is now suspected by the Iraq Sanctions Commission of wanting to help Iraq circumvent sanctions. According to UN information, a Mannheim-based company applied for the delivery of goods worth a total of $1.343 billion (2.3 billion German marks [DM]) to Iraq. On 14 February, the Foreign Ministry passed on the application from the "United Oil Company" -- according to the Mannheim Registration Court, it does not appear in the register of companies there and does not have a phone of its own -- under filename "SA 1402 U 6" to the Iraq Sanctions Commission in New York through the German representation there without, it seems, informing itself on the background of the company. According to its letterhead, the company is based at Friedrichsplatz in Mannheim. The address and the name of the applicant are identical with the small firm "Ary Design Jewelry" located on the first floor of an apartment block. There is no sign at the entrance to the building or on the door of the apartment that would indicate anything about the "United Oil Company." A. Schweininger, who is listed in the register of companies as the owner of "Ary Design Jewelry," applied to the Foreign Ministry on behalf of the "United Oil Company." According to the Mannheim Registration Court, the jewelry business is involved in the "the design, buying and selling, import and export of jewelry, especially under the name Ary Design." Now, Schweininger is seeking a permit in New York for a billion-dollar deal with Iraq. Apparently Schweininger wants to export food, soap, and other goods to Iraq. All in all, the deal involves the delivery of 1,927 million tonnes of goods (palm oil, soap, sugar, chickens, corned beef, beans, and other items) to Iraq through the Jordanian port of Aqaba. According to UN information, the port can only be used by ships with a maximum tonnage of 36,000 tonnes, which means that more than 50 freighters would be needed for the delivery of all the goods. The exceptional size of the order caused -- in contrast to the reaction of the German authorities -- raised eyebrows at the United Nations. That is why the United Nations in New York, which was still of the opinion that the "United Oil Company" must be a large German company in the middle of February, checked the identity of the recipient in Jordan. The Amman post box number that appeared in the applications (post box 35284) turned out to be the address of a hotel belonging to a well-known international chain. Only hotel guests who want to "disguise" the fact that the recipient is a hotel guest use the post box number, was the answer from Amman. Both the recipient in Jordan and the final customer are Iraqi 'Usama 'Abed (post box 55026, Baghdad). After the German UN representation was told that the billion-dollar order it supported had an unusual foundation, to say the least, it did not withdraw the application, but asked only that Schweininger lodge an application with the Federal Export Agency in Eschborn. On Monday [28 March], a spokesman for the agency did not want to say whether the application had already been lodged. However, on 18 March, a request for a permit was lodged with the Federal Foodstuffs Agency for part of the export consignment. Bonn is still supporting the efforts of the Baden-Wuerttemberg jewelry designer to conclude a billion-dollar deal. In New York, UN employees took a closer look at Schweininger's delivery list and were astonished. Quite a number of goods on the list are to be obtained for unusual prices. Thus, Schweininger wants to export 100,000 tonnes of German made "soap" to Iraq at a price of four dollars (DM6.8) a tonne. As even the cheapest soap in Germany cannot be bought for that price, questions are being asked about whether Schweininger really wants to obtain the goods. On the other hand, other prices on the delivery applications -- such as palm oil --seem to be far too high. The United Nations has in the meantime acquired enough experience about Iraqi inventiveness to expose at least a few cases where the only aim of trade applications was evidently to release Iraqi foreign currency reserves, not to supply aid. In December, for example, an application from a Finnish company to export 3 million tonnes of sugar to Iraq was withdrawn. As annual sugar consumption in Iraq amounts to no more than 500,000 tonnes and sugar cannot be stored for years, it was quickly realized that the Iraqis sole aim was to release foreign currency reserves. The United Nations is astonished to say the least that the unusual billion-dollar application from the "United Oil Company," which is not registered, at any rate not in Germany, had not been withdrawn by Monday lunchtime. Anyone who wants to reach Schweininger under the telephone number -- it is identical to that of "Ary Design Jewelry" -- given in the "United Oil Company" letterhead, is connected with a answering machine with the following message: "Good day, you are connected with our Mannheim bureau. There is no one in our bureau at the moment. Please leave a message after the signal." Despite the unusual features of the billion-dollar deal, the Iraq Sanctions Commission will have to approve it in the next few days, not least because the German authorities have declined assistance so far. In addition, the deliveries of foodstuffs that Schweininger has applied for at the United Nations are only covered by a "notification requirement." Whether the goods will actually be later delivered will not be checked. That is why a first partial permit is "ready for signing" on UN desks.
