This task force was composed of Brigadier Mohammed Salim, Brigadier Javed, and Major Haider. A special research council is assisting this task force. It is composed of high military and ISI [Inter-Service Intelligence of Pakistan] officers. It decides how to provide aid to various active groups in India. The Indian Government has not yet made any plans to foil the Pakistani conspiracy. It is wasting time in other, unnecessary efforts. Pakistan's Operation K-2 is a decisive effort. It was launched in order to acquire Kashmir. The main battle under it is being fought in Kashmir. In order to strengthen their position, small groups are being incited to spread separatism and violence throughout the country. The Indian Government is aware that Major Haider has been managing this front in the Kashmir Valley since 1991. After establishing his control over all Kashmiri groups, Major Haider entered the valley. This is an example of fighting against India right on its soil. He is working closely with terrorist organizations. A U. S. Congress committee report has details of this operation. In December 1991, Major Haider called a meeting of representatives of Ikhvanul Musalmin, the Allah Tigers, Hizbul, and mujaheddin organizations. The decision to start a combined campaign was made in this meeting. This also affected the other, smaller organizations. At present, about 150 organizations are active there. This has helped the religious terrorists come under one umbrella. In response, the ISI increased its aid to them. In light of the activities of 1991, Major Haider went to the Kashmir valley to supervise this campaign. We can understand this because of the terrible fighting that occurred at that time. This was a very difficult period for Indian security forces. Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao has repeatedly said that Pakistan is fighting a shadow war in Kashmir. This is only half true. It is not a shadow war anymore, now that Major Haider has arrived there. During that period, the Kashmiri terrorists fought the security forces face to face. This is a great achievement for any terrorist group, and it is still going on in the Kashmir Valley. The next year, in the summer of 1992, a large number of Pakistani-trained terrorists entered Kashmir. According to one estimate, they had 20,000 AK-47 and AK-56 rifles. During those days, the terrorists attacked security forces on a daily basis. The ones that were killed in these skirmishes included, in addition to trained terrorists, the Afghan mujaheddin. According to one estimate, between 1990 and 1992, 20,000 Kashmiri youths received training across the border. Brigadier Mohammed Salim led this training effort. These training camps were operated as a joint project of the ISI and the army. There are 15 permanent training camps in Azad Kashmir, the portion of Kashmir that is controlled by Pakistan. There are an additional 30 temporary camps. These new training centers were built for religious terrorists in 1992. Brigadier Javed was made their director. He had all kinds of experiences, through the CIA, in working for the ISI and the mujaheddin during the Afghan War. Training camps were opened for religious terrorists in Gohad, Larkana, Sangli, Sargodha, Cuttock, Murree, Sialkot, and Lahore. One of these camps was operated with Iran's help. The suicide brigades were trained there. After that, in addition to Kashmir, efforts to spread terrorism across different parts of India were accelerated. Now they have opened centers in many places. The bomb blast on Palam Airport on 25 June 1991 attracted attention to these agencies. A bomb was found in an Air India plane on 1 December 1991. That plane was leaving New Delhi for London. The Janbaz Force took responsibility for it. After that, there were bomb blasts in Delhi and many other cities. In August 1992, two Pakistanis were arrested 30 kilometers from Madras. They were trying to blow up a train. Police agencies have collected a lot of evidence from these groups. Pakistani agents were also involved in blowing up the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh] office in Madras. They were conspiring to transform the religious tension there into a lava of violence. Who is helping the Pakistani agents? The Indian Government is in the dark about this. The little information that has been collected mentions SIMI (Student Islamic Movement of India) repeatedly. According to the U. S. Congress committee report, the religious terrorists trust this group. The central investigation bureau learned about a terrorist named Surjeet while investigating Dr. Jalis Ansari. It was learned that he was working with Abdullah Shiragi. Abdullah Shiragi is a well-known Kashmiri terrorist. He attended the SIMI conference in 1991. The Kashmiri active organization, Jamaat-i Tulba, was given the duty of sending its members to accept asylum in various parts of India. Its agents have taken different routes to go to India and Nepal. Jamal Alvi of Lucknow was their special agent. He was working for Dr. Jalis Ansari and Hilal Beg. Dr. Habib of Raibareilly is also considered a member of this group. The central and state governments' intelligence agencies could not understand the network that Jamaat-i Tulba had spread. The government is not sure how much it hurt the Pakistani conspiracy in its recent arrests. The only estimates it could make from these arrests were related to what kind of tricks Pakistan was using in the war on Kashmir. It appears to be establishing small groups in different places that can be activated at its instruction when the time comes. After the Bombay blasts, the government was wrong to consider that the Memon group was operating alone. That group had finished, to an extent. The recent arrests has created only the scene of the "seed of blood." The Indian Government will not be able to totally destroy it with its weak efforts. Before the last Independence Day, General K. V. Krishan Rao, the Jammu-Kashmir governor, admitted that Pakistan was planning to infiltrate India with a large number of soldiers. He reported that 10,000 Afghan mercenary soldiers were ready for it. This statement is also supported by a U. S. Congress committee report. According to the report, Pakistan has been using Afghan mercenary soldiers in Kashmir since 1992. During the summer of that year, 200 mercenary soldiers were working with the terrorists, and another 300 mercenary soldiers have been waiting since 1992. Last summer, 200 mercenary soldiers were sent into Kashmir. According to this report, the Kashmiri terrorists informed that 300 additional Afghan mercenary soldiers were waiting to enter since 1992. It is clear now that when CIA Director Robert Gates came to India in 1990, he pressured the Pakistani president to close the bases in Lahore. *
