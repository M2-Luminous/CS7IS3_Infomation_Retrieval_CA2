It reported that the Sudanese were held for seven hours. The travellers, mostly middle-aged men, told the television that they were held in a dining hall in a ferry named Saq al-Naam somewhere between Aswan and Wadi Halfa. They were denied drinking water and the opportunity to pray. The detainees said they were packed in a hot room without air-conditioning, while told by an Egyptian official that they would be allowed to continue to Cairo. Detainees said they were guarded by regular armed Egyptian troops during their interrogations and that they were returned back to Sudan without any explanation. Only old men and women were allowed to proceed to Cairo but all able-bodied and young men were returned to Sudan. The Sudanese travellers, who appeared frustrated and upset, told the Sudan television that their luggage and money had been stolen while they were in detention. Commenting, Sudanese television said that it was clear that the Egyptian authorities had adopted the measure as a precaution against any infiltration of alleged Islamic fundamentalists.
