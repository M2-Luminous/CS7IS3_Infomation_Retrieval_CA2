A resolution, adopted by the commission at its 50th meeting, said that all countries should refrain from taking any unilateral mandatory measures that run counter to the international laws and the U.N. Charter. Such measures not only impede trade among countries, but also hinder the full realization of the rights specified in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, said the resolution proposed by Cuba, China, Ghana and the Sudan. The commission condemns some countries for using their economic supremacy and continuing to take unilateral mandatory measures, such as trade sanction, blockade, embargo and asset freezing, to prevent the developing countries from exercising their rights to establish their political, economic and social systems and expand international trade. The resolution, adopted by 23 votes in favor and 18 against, was supported mostly by the developing countries and opposed by the United States and other Western developed countries.
