ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice terminates an existing Recreation and Public Purposes Classification N&hyph;56543 in its entirety and opens the land to appropriation under the public land laws and the general mining laws. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Carmen Donelson, Bureau of Land Management, Nevada State Office, 850 Harvard Way, P.O. Box 12000, Reno, Nevada 89520&hyph;0006, (702) 785&hyph;6530. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The lands described below were classified suitable for lease or sale pursuant to the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 869, 869&hyph;1 to 869&hyph;4) and the land was segregated from appropriation under the public land laws and the general mining laws: Mount Diablo Meridian, Nevada T. 21 S., R. 60 E., Sec. 11, lots 143 and 144. The area described contains 10.00 acres, more or less. On January 13, 1994, West Valley Assembly of God Church applied for use of the subject land pursuant to the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. The applicant was unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary zoning change allowing construction of a church. Pursuant to section 7 of the Taylor Gazing Act (48 Stat. 1272) and the authority delegated by Appendix 1 of the Bureau of Land Management Manual 1203, the aforementioned Recreation and Public Purposes classification is hereby terminated. At 10:00 a.m. on September 26, 1994 the above described land will become open to the operation of the public land laws generally, subject to existing rights, the provisions of existing withdrawals, and the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations. At 10:00 a.m. on September 26, 1994 the above described land will become open to the location under the United Stats mining laws. Appropriation of the land under the general mining laws prior to the date and time of restoration is unauthorized. Any such attempted appropriation, including attempted adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 38, shall vest no rights against the United States. Acts required to establish a location and to initiate a right of possession are governed by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in disputes between rival locators over possessory rights since Congress has provided for such determinations in local courts. The land has been and will remain open to the operation of the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 869, 869&hyph;1 to 869&hyph;4), and to leasing under the mineral leasing laws. Ronald B. Wenker, Acting State Director, Nevada. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23687 Filed 9&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;HC&hyph;M
