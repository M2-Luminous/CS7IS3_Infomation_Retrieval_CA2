This was announced by his state minister, Helmut Schaefer, at the opening of the 5th Hanseatic Economic Days of the Baltic Sea countries in Kiel on Tuesday [15 March]. With its aid, the European Union has contributed to the Baltic Sea countries' development. In view of the challenges, such as the integration of the eastern Baltic Sea countries into the EU's transport policy, the aid, however, is not sufficient in the long run, Schaefer said. The European Union in 1994 must conclude free-trade agreements with Poland and the Baltic states. "One of the objectives of the German EU Presidency in the next half year will be to conclude associate membership agreements with the Baltic states as soon as possible, including the prospects for future membership," he said. Schleswig-Holstein Minister President Heide Simonis, of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, has called for an opening of Western markets for the Eastern reformist countries. Despite the economic differences, the Baltic Sea region has great market opportunities. To utilize these opportunities it is necessary to improve the transport infrastructure. This includes the construction of the A 20 Baltic Sea highway. Apart from the 10 Baltic Sea countries, the 5th Hanseatic Economic Days are also attended by Great Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.
