FR940919-0-00121 FR940919-0-00016 (b) * * * (4)␣*␣*␣* (ii) The waste constituents to be monitored, if monitoring will not include all regulated constituents, for wastes F001&hyph;F005, F039, D001, D002, and D012&hyph;D043. Generators must also include whether the waste is a nonwastewater or wastewater (as defined in §268.2 (d) and (f), and indicate the subcategory of the waste (such as D003 reactive cyanide), if applicable. * * * * * (5)␣*␣*␣* (iv) For characteristic wastes D001, D002, and D012&hyph;D043 that are: subject to the treatment standards in §268.40 (other than those expressed as a required method of treatment); that are reasonably expected to contain underlying hazardous constituents as defined in §268.2(i); are treated on-site to remove the hazardous characteristic; and are then sent off-site for treatment of underlying hazardous constituents, the certification must state the following: I certify under penalty of law that the waste has been treated in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 268.40 to remove the hazardous characteristic. This decharacterized waste contains underlying hazardous constituents that require further treatment to meet universal treatment standards. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment. * * * * * 22. In §268.9, paragraph (a), (d)(1)(i), and (d)(1)(ii) are revised, (d)(1)(iii) is removed and (d)(2) (i) and (ii) are added to read as follows: §268.9 Special rules regarding wastes that exhibit a characteristic. (a) The initial generator of a solid waste must determine each EPA Hazardous Waste Number (waste code) applicable to the waste in order to determine the applicable treatment standards under subpart D of this part. For purposes of part 268, the waste will carry the waste code for any applicable listing under 40 CFR part 261, subpart D. In addition, the waste will carry one or more of the waste codes under 40 CFR part 261, subpart C, where the waste exhibits a characteristic, except in the case when the treatment standard for the waste code listed in 40 CFR part 261, subpart D operates in lieu of the treatment standard for the waste code under 40 CFR part 261, subpart C, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. If the generator determines that his waste displays the characteristic of ignitability (D001) (and is not in the High TOC Ignitable Liquids Subcategory or is not treated by CMBST, or RORGS), or the waste code listed in 40 CFR part 261, subpart D operates in lieu of the treatment standard for the waste code under 40 CFR part 261, subpart C, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. If the generator determines that his waste displays the characteristic of ignitability (D001) (and is not in the High TOC Ignitable Liquids Subcategory or is not treated by CMBST, or RORGS), or the characteristic of corrosivity (D002), and is prohibited under §268.37; or that his waste displays the characteristic of toxicity (D012&hyph;D043), and is prohibited under §268.38, the generator must determine the underlying hazardous constituents (as defined in §268.2), in the D001, D002, or D012&hyph;D043 wastes. * * * * * (d)␣*␣*␣* (1)␣*␣*␣* (i) Name and address of the RCRA Subtitle D facility receiving the waste shipment; and (ii) A description of the waste as initially generated, including the applicable EPA Hazardous Waste Number(s), treatability group(s), and underlying hazardous constituents (as defined in §268.2(i) in D001 and D002 wastes prohibited under §268.37, or D012&hyph;D043 wastes under §268.38. (2)␣*␣*␣* (i) If treatment removes the characteristic but does not treat underlying hazardous constituents, then the certification found in § 268.7 (b)(5)(v) apply. (ii) [Reserved]
