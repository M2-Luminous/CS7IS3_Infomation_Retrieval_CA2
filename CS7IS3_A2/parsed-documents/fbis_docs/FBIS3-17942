The catastrophe on 22 March killed 75 people. [Unidentified correspondent over video of crash site] The results of the analysis of the contents of the black boxes are to be announced tomorrow. However it is already known today that despite earlier interpretations, the crew of the Airbus were alive and continuing to converse among themselves in the last few minutes of flight. Specialists will, therefore, have to refute the theory that the catastrophe came about as a result of instantaneous decompression. The Russian experts in Paris will attempt to identify the pilots' voices and draw up a precise transcript of the conversation. At the same time, the other box, in which the functional parameters of all the components of the Airbus are recorded, is being decoded. The information retrieval process will probably take up until the end of this week, and the results of the decoding will be passed to members of the investigative commission. Only then will the final verdict be made.
