For his part, economist Jorge Mattoso is not well-known to the public, but he has a good chance of occupying "a prominent position in the economic area in a probable Lula administration." Precisely because of its assumption that a good many of its clients --important businessmen and bankers -- do not know about the PT's internal resistance to Mercadante or who Mattoso is, the Rosenberg Consultancy has prepared a report on what the PT's factions think and what its program is and listed the top people in the party. That "Who's Who" of the PT describes the 138 prominent figures who are either in the party or close to it and assesses their chances for being part of a Lula administration. Luiz Paulo Rosenberg, a former adviser to Delfim Netto (when the latter was minister of finance) and to former President Jose Sarney, takes a pragmatic view of the matter. Since there is a reasonable chance that Lula will be elected, he feels that it is time for businessmen to stop complaining about the PT and start getting better acquainted with the party and its people. To help prepare his report, he hired Wladimir Pomar of the PT Executive Committee. Pomar, who was general coordinator of the PT's campaign in 1989 and is involved in the current campaign, is "ideologically a democratic socialist," according to the description in "Who's Who." The report's general assessment of the PT and its program is far from being apocalyptic. Rosenberg personally is convinced that a Lula administration "will not be a disaster." He feels that Lula will be a combination of Argentine President Carlos Menem, although not as pragmatic, and Socialist French President Francois Mitterrand "in his doctrinaire stuffiness." In other words, he will end up adjusting pragmatically to reality and its limitations. "Lula is not another Alan Garcia," says Rosenberg, referring to the former Peruvian president whose populist policy led his country into bankruptcy. The history of the PT and its internal disputes involves a tangle of acronyms, realignments, and breakups. The current picture as described in the report involves eight main groups: 1. Alliance (now called Alliance in Struggle), comprising 30 percent of the party. Uniting Christian socialists, social democrats, democratic socialists, and pragmatics, it occupies the center-right in the party. 2. Leftist Alliance (now called Leftist Option): 23 percent of the party. Uniting Christian socialists, democratic socialists, revolutionary socialists, and pragmatics, it combines the center and the center-left. 3. Socialist Democracy (now part of the Leftist Option): 11 percent of the party. A combination of democratic socialists, revolutionary socialists, and Trotskyites, it is obviously further to the left. 4. Socialist Force (now part of the "In the PT Struggle" faction): 10 percent of the party. It comprises democratic socialists and revolutionary socialists. "In the PT Struggle" unites the factions further to the left and "Shiites." 5. Labor (of "In the PT Struggle"): 5 percent of the party. A combination of revolutionary socialists and Trotskyites. 6. Socialist Component ("In the PT Struggle"): 3 percent of the party. A combination of Christian socialists and revolutionary socialists. 7. Plan for Brazil (now called Radical Democracy): 11 percent of the party. It unites neoliberals, social democrats, democratic socialists, Christian socialists, and pragmatics. Comprises the PT's right-wing groups. 8. Independents: 7 percent of the party. These are individuals or groups that have no ties with factions; they cover the entire spectrum from right to left in the party. Anyone adding up the figures based on this picture will conclude that the Left predominates. But the report is more cautious. "Looking at things realistically, Leftist Alliance and Socialist Democracy (grouped together in Leftist Option) represent the center and the center-left. They are the pendulum in the PT's political spectrum. By allying themselves with part of the "In the PT Struggle" movement, they are seeking basically to ensure their hegemony in the party machinery and prevent the former Alliance, with which they still have many points in common, from uniting with Radical Democracy completely and moving the PT all the way to the right. In practice, that center seems to be acting as the point of equilibrium preventing the "Shiite" wings from becoming a center of attraction for the party's rank and file -- something that was in fact happening as a result of the Alliance's move in the direction of Plan for Brazil (now called Radical Democracy)," says the report. The report admits that that kind of reasoning is very different from the analysis usually found in the media, which are in the habit of describing the PT as a party dominated by the "Shiites." The report observes that presenting it in that way may be useful as a weapon in anti-PT propaganda but that it is also deceptive."This has probably done more to confuse the PT's opponents themselves, since those analyses are of little value if they are to be used in the strategic battle or if they are to serve as reference points in dialogue and negotiation," the report argues. In its extensive analysis of the PT's platform, the report shows that on several points it is much more moderate and realistic than the 1989 platform. It represents a compromise among the various factions, which are currently divided on two issues: 1) the chief reforms that a PT administration should introduce, and 2) attitudes toward such controversial issues as agrarian reform, the role of the state, monopolies, privatization, inflation, foreign debt, an opening up to trade, foreign capital, fiscal and tax reforms, education, science and technology, and public policies. As described in the report, the thinking of the Radical Democracy faction is to a large extent indistinguishable from that of the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. It wants to stabilize and modernize the economy, reduce state monopolies as much as possible, and privatize. It supports fiscal reform, favors rural settlements but opposes the invasion of property, and favors an opening up to the rest of the world (although with some control over foreign capital). Federal Deputy Jose Genoino belongs to this faction. The Alliance faction is divided. Some of its members support Radical Democracy, while others want more thoroughgoing reforms. The Leftist Alliance wants a mass market. It also wants to change the profile of rural and urban production and preserve an important role for the state. The other factions polarize around leftist ideas. "Who's Who" has several surprises for anyone not familiar with the party. The report points out that Mercadante, for example, "is accused of being one of the current defenders of policies approaching neoliberalism on the issues of foreign capital, negotiation of the foreign debt, and stabilization policies, even though his stands on those issues are more complex." Hence the resistance that will arise in the party if Lula appoints him minister of finance. Another of the PT's public stars in the economic area, Senator Eduardo Suplicy, is described in tough terms. "He has a great feel for creating political events and appearing in the media...and charisma in the eyes of part of the population. Despite that, his influence inside the PT is relative. He seems to have no preconceived ideas on the most controversial issues, but simply sticks to the middle way when it comes to opinions." He is not mentioned as a possible candidate for a post in Lula's administration. Several of the individuals mentioned as possible occupants of important posts in the economic area do not come as a surprise: businessman Oded Grajew, who is involved in Lula's campaign; Professors Paul Singer and Francisco de Oliveira; Maria da Conceicao Tavares; and Paulo Nogueira Batista, Jr. (although not a member, he is often consulted by the party). Jose Marcio Camargo, an economics professor in Rio de Janeiro, and Jose Graziano da Silva, an agricultural expert, are likely to be members of a PT administration. Several other individuals who are also prominently mentioned are much less familiar to the public. In the economic area, besides Jorge Mattoso, whom we have already mentioned, there is Cesar Benjamin, who is one of the coordinators of the party platform, a member of the Leftist Alliance faction, and one of the chief supporters of the introduction of a mass market. Another economist who is not well known to the public but who may be given a post is Carlos Eduardo Carvalho, coordinator of the 1989 platform. He is a "democratic socialist" who tends to side with the Leftist Alliance on tactical issues. Marco Aurelio Garcia, a prominent adviser to Lula, is mentioned as the probable minister of foreign affairs. Geographer Aziz Ab'Saber may be a star in the area of the environment. Benedita da Silva and Herbert de Souza ("Betinho") may be important in the social area. Santos Mayor David Capistrano and Leoncio Feitosa (of the parallel government) may be given key positions in the Ministry of Health. Luiz Soares Dulci of the Minas Gerais National Directorate and the Alliance faction "will probably be given an important post in a Lula administration." So will physicist Luiz Pinguelli Rosa and Prof. Emir Sader. Philosopher Leandro Konder is tipped for the cultural area, and journalist Perseu Abramo is seen in some sort of direct advisory capacity in the Office of the President. Among the party's well-known politicians who may occupy federal posts, the following are mentioned, among others: Plinio de Arruda Sampaio, Jose Dirceu (if he loses the gubernatorial race in Sao Paulo), Rui Falcao, Jose Genoino, Luiz Gushiken, Jorge Bittar (if he loses the gubernatorial race in Rio de Janeiro), and Vladimir Palmeira. Also mentioned are jurists Dalmo Dallari, Fabio Konder Comparato, Raymundo Faoro, and Helio Bicudo. If there is a PT administration, it will not only change the government radically but also cause a substantial increase in the size of businessmen's lists of telephone numbers. "Plan Will Obstruct Future Administration" Sao Paulo -- The national president of the Workers Party (PT), Rui Falcao, said last Friday that "the big problem with the economic plan is that it may obstruct action by the future administration, especially if it causes a recession." When asked whether Lula's campaign managers were concerned about the benefits that the stabilization plan might have for presidential candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Falcao answered: "What we are concerned about are the perverse effects that introducing the real may have, particularly from the standpoint of unemployment." But despite saying that the PT does not fear the stabilization plan's possible effects on the election, Falcao asserted that "this new plan is as much a vote-getting ploy as the Cruzado Plan was, and the fact that the real banknotes are being printed with Fernando Henrique's name on them is conclusive proof of that." Falcao also said: "The government's economic plan would not be a vote-getting ploy only if structural reforms were included among its goals, which is what the PT is doing in its plan for government." Among the structural reforms listed by Falcao, the most important are agrarian reform and employment. To deal with that last-named problem, the party has introduced the Plan for Impact on Unemployment under the coordination of Deputy Aloizio Mercadante. The PT's plan for combating unemployment will earmark $25 billion for promoting the creation of 8 million jobs. The money will come from the Social and Constitutional Funds and from budget allocations from the National Treasury, according to the Globo Agency. The most important official topic at the meeting was the possibility of alliances in three states: Santa Catarina, Rondonia, and Bahia. In the case of Santa Catarina, the PT wants to support Senator Nelson Wedekin of the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], provided that PT members Milton Mendes de Oliveira and Luci Choinacki can run respectively for lieutenant governor and for one of the vacancies in the Senate. In the case of Rondonia, the PT National Executive Committee decided by a vote of 10 to three to uphold the resolution passed at the party's Ninth National Convention, which stipulated that the regional directorate should "lay the foundations enabling the PT to present its own candidate." The stand taken by the PT Executive Committee was motivated by the decision by the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] in Rondonia to support the candidacy of Orestes Quercia. In Bahia, the situation is too complicated for the PT leadership. The reason is that while the executive committee wants to develop support for the candidacy of Jutahy Magalhaes of the PSDB, most of the PT in Bahia wants to run a PT candidate and is suggesting the name of Zezeu Ribeiro. To get around the problem, the Bahia PT is suggesting that Lula campaign for all three candidates: Zezeu Ribeiro for the PT, Jutahy Magalhaes for the PSDB, and the current front-runner in the polls, Joao Durval of the PMN [National Mobilization Party]. Joao Durval was launched in politics by former Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes of the PFL [Liberal Front Party].
