He said that although Belarus was well aware of the importance of its participation in the international effort to settle armed conflicts, the presidium did not even venture to raise this question in the parliament. The Belarusian people have not yet got over the Afghan syndrome, he said. He also added that during the Afghan war Belarus had lost far more soldiers than other former Soviet republics. Shushkevich said that the current psychological condition of Belarusian society and the memories of World War II during which Belarus lost one fourth of its population was another reason for refusal. He stated that other representatives of the UN secretary-general had also been informed of the presidium's unanimous position. See the upcoming issue of the Presidential Bulletin for Shushkevich's exclusive interview with Interfax.
