The circumstances of Mr. Baholo's death are still unclear, although we know that his body was riddled with bullets. His funeral will take place on Saturday 23 April in Leribe and Friday has been declared a day of mourning, with schools and buildings closing. There is a strong military presence in the town, but apart from sporadic gunshots, everything is quiet at the moment, although Friday's public holiday reflects the government's concern about possible unrest. Prime Minister Mr. Mokhehle has not given any statement as yet on the abrupt departure of half his cabinet, but we believe that the ministers of information, natural resources, and trade have fled to Botswana, and the ministers for education and justice to South Africa. Whether the government of Lesotho will be able to overcome the present difficulties remains to be seen. This is Sara Hilderbrand for Radio Today in Maseru.
