FR940721-2-00087 FR940721-2-00047 Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement Privacy Act of 1974_Deletion of Notice of System of Records Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a), notice is hereby given that the Department of the Interior is deleting from its inventory of Privacy Act systems of records a notice describing records maintained by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. The system of records notice being abolished is entitled ``Applicant/Violator System (AVS)_Interior, OSMRE&hyph;9'' It was previously published in the Federal Register on November 16, 1989 (54 FR 47734). A review of the system of records has determined that the records are not subject to the Privacy Act. The review was prompted by an opinion issued by the General Counsel, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), on August 30, 1988, affirming OMB's 1975 guidelines which interpreted the statutory term ``individual'' to exclude natural persons acting in an entrepreneurial capacity from the coverage of the Privacy Act. A review of the Applicant/ Violator System conducted by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement indicated that the records contain information about persons in their entrepreneurial capacity and not in their capacity as individuals. Therefore, the notice is being deleted from the Department's compilation of Privacy Act systems of records notices. This change shall be effective on publication in the Federal Register . Additional information regarding this action may be obtained from the Departmental Privacy Act Officer, Office of the Secretary, Office of Administrative Services, 1849 ``C'' Street NW., Mail Stop 5412 MIB, Washington, DC 20240, telephone (202) 208&hyph;6045. Dated: July 15, 1994. Albert C. Camacho, Director, Office of Administrative Services. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;17750 Filed 7&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;01&hyph;M
