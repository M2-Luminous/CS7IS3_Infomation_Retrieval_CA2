He told Radio Monte Carlo that a crime of such a nature cannot take place without the knowledge of the Israeli Army and the Israeli security organs which directly encourage the settlers and cover up their fascist actions against the Palestinians. Abu-'Ali Mustafa said this massacre is further proof that the Gaza-Jericho agreement legalizes settlement, protects the settlers, and perpetuates the occupation. He said the PLO leadership's official stand, which overlooks the issue of ending settlement, is responsible for the settlers' crimes against the Palestinian people. The PFLP assistant secretary general called on the United Nations and the human rights bodies to act immediately to protect the Palestinian people under occupation. Meanwhile, Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, director of the Hamas office in Damascus, has said this massacre is a message -- signed in blood -- and one which confirms that peace with those terrorists is an illusion. He stressed that the terrorists, with the help of the Israeli soldiers who claim to protect the Ibrahimi Mosque, who attack in their mosques those who fast, have given a slap in the face to the defeatists in Tunis who daily negotiate and offer concessions. The director of the Hamas office in Damascus emphasized that this crime will not go unpunished, and that the 'Izz al-Din al-Qassam Battalions will avenge this massacre as they avenged al-Aqsah massacre.
