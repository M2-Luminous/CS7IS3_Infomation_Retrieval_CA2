He said Castro "is becoming more modern: He changed his combat fatigues for a light shirt [guayabera]" during the recent summit of Ibero-American heads of state and heads of government in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. In response to a journalist's question on the Cuban leader's change of dress, Menem said: "It is a good omen that leads us to believe Cuba will soon be democratized." Menem emphasized that he responded with a joke the journalist's question because "this style of dress suits him well and makes him look younger." "I said it with all respect and with all my affection for the president of Cuba," said Menem, who for the first time used the word "president" for Castro. He previously referred to him as "the commander." Menem later told the journalists that, during his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton, "the Cuban issue was not discussed." Menem held informal talks with Castro in Colombia. He referred to the Cuban issue during a news conference at the Argentine Embassy in this city after meeting with Clinton at the White House.
