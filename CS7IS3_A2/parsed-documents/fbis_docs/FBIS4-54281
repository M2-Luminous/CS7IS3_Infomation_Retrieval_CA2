The campaign is to be led by members of reformist groups in the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. Some coalition party members are also expected to join. The campaign was conceived in response to a proposal from the Committee for the Promotion of Political Reform (chairman: Masao Kamei), a private panel organized by business and labor leaders. Nearly 70 lower house members -- more than 40 from the LDP and more than 20 from the SDPJ -- intend to meet on 26 May to promote the campaign. Some LDP and SDPJ members are seeking an early general election before work has finished on the allotment of single-seat constituencies. The campaign is likely to exercise considerable influence on the direction the coalition-opposition struggle takes over the issue of dissolving the lower house because it is being led by reformists from the two opposition parties. The campaigning LDP and SDPJ lawmakers have decided to jointly conduct the collection of signatures prompted by concern about moves to have the next election under the old multi-seat system. They feel this would "ruin efforts so far to win electoral and political reform." The campaign is largely supported by those who have been trying hard to get the political reform bills enacted. From the LDP, more than 40 members of the Dietmen's League on Political Reform will join the campaign. These include Yuji Tsushima, Takeshi Noda, Koji Hosaka, Akihiko Noro, and Takeo Kawamura. Participants from the SDPJ include about 20 members of the rightist "Democrats" group such as Tadayoshi Morii, Kazunari Inoue, and Masao Sakon. In addition, several members will join the campaign from each of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito, the Japan New Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, Sakigake [Harbinger], and New Party Mirai. The Committee for the Promotion of Political Reform is scheduled to announce on 26 May an emergency advisory report calling for: 1) a general election under the new electoral system; 2) further promotion of political and administrative reform; and 3) enforcement of political ethics and the reinforcement of anti-corruption measures. Following the announcement, the lawmakers will hold the first meeting of the campaign to adopt a "political reform declaration" based on the private panel's three-point proposal. The signature-collection campaign is intended to obtain support from the majority of lower house members. It is believed reformist lawmakers are trying to discourage the idea of calling an early election under the multi-seat system before the political scene begins to shift toward an "attempt to oppose political reform."
