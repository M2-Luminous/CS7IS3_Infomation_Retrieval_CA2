This is the opinion voiced on 29 December by the Bolivian Private Businessmen Confederation [CEPB] on the behavior of the economy during 1993. The CEPB pointed out that this year the Bolivian economy followed the same pattern as in previous years. According to the document released to the press by CEPB Chairman Carlos del Chazal, the underlying reasons for this "modest" growth are the relative stability of prices, and above all, the social stability achieved on the basis of dialogue and consensus, especially with regard to relations between employers and employees. The change of administration in August did not alter the economic policy, particularly the monetary policy. One may rightly venture to say that in the eyes of Bolivian businessmen, 1993 was a year without major jolts, in which problems and disssatisfactions were expressed by other sectors of Bolivian society. The Damned Fiscal Deficit One of CEPB's concerns was, for example, the steady and relentless increase in the fiscal deficit, which is estimated to reach 6.5 percent of the GDP by the end of the year. This was undoubtedly the largest deficit in four years, since it totaled 4.6 percent in 1992. The CEPB document stresses that the fiscal imbalance was real in spite of the significant and sustained increase in tax revenues. CEPB's most serious concern lies in the fact that the deficit is financed with foreign resources, by running into debt, the level of which cannot be sustained for much longer. And yet, what is still more disturbing is that most of government spending is earmarked for current expenditures, thus curtailing resources and possibilities for public investments, both in the development of human resources as well as in the upgrading of the productive infrastructure that would enable ending "bottlenecks that hinder private productive activities from achieving greater dynamism and development." Policies and Indicators The most salient aspect of the monetary policy furthered by the Bolivian Central Bank is the curbing of inflation to levels below 10 percent. The exchange rate behaved in a way comparable to the controlled inflation pattern. According to the CEPB analysis, these factors contributed to the improvement of the real exchange rate for the exporting sector. The CEPB contends that "the increase in the country's international reserves constitutes another factor that provides stability in the short term." Among the most significant events, the CEPB mentioned the passing of the new General Law on Banks and Financial Establishments, which will enable the establishment of new financial institutions to democratize credits and benefit vast business sectors, which will in turn be instrumental in creating new jobs and wealth. These encouraging accomplishments made by the Bolivian economy contrast with some other negative and restrictive aspects, like the increasing prevalence of making transactions in U.S. dollars and high interest rates. The CEPB believes that "the cost of money, together with rules of the game that are not altogether clear, conspire against private investments, and therefore, against employment and economic growth." The document released by Chazal cites preliminary estimates by the National Statistics Institute of a 3.2-percent GDP growth due to "opposing behaviors." On the one hand, the dynamism of agriculture and the mining industry, and on the other, the slump in sectors like the manufacturing industry and construction [sentence fragment as published]. With regard to foreign trade, the imbalance continues, so much so that it is estimated that the deficit of the 1993 trade balance will be as high as in the previous year, i.e. more than $500 million. The document states that "we meet our needs by resorting time and again to the rest of the world at the expense of domestic economic development." The Bolivian businessmen's closing assessment of the economic year includes a review of the national economy's prospects and projections. The administration must first engage in modernizing the state by completing the great structural transformations and changes initiated. These transformations and changes must be completed with the constitutional reforms. These great reforms will redefine the state's role and will guarantee effective economic freedom and responsibilities for the entrepreneurial segment. Entrepreneurs trust that the fiscal deficit will be reduced in 1994, that it will be controlled better, and that it will be financed with real resources. This must be achieved without resorting to increased taxes, but rather by attempting to increase the number of taxpayers and reducing tax evasion. This will prevent the "crowding out" [preceding two words in English] phenomenon, "which prevents the private segment from making more effective contributions to investments." Within the framework of the expected modernization and without considering the removal of the powers of the state, the entrepreneurs propose the following: -- To transfer the large public enterprises, including the deregulation of the markets in which they are operating, thus eliminating the harmful public monopolies. -- To reform education, thus allowing our country to have -- in the middle and long term -- qualified human resources, the basis for any development process. -- To restructure the social security system in order to improve the standard of living of the workers through appropriate health and housing contributions -- and to reform the retirement funds through an individual capitalization system, which will also contribute to financing substantial investments required to grow at a faster pace and democratize the ownership of capital. The Bolivian entrepreneurs emphasize: "We will continue to contribute to improving the standard of living of the population through the production of wealth and the creation of jobs. This process will be more dynamic if the state establishes the conditions required to guarantee an increased flow of national and foreign investments."
