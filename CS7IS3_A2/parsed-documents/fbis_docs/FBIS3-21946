Macaspac] [Text] The Central Police District Command (CPDC) has created a drug enforcement team which will conduct police operations in a national level. CPDC Director Chief Superintendent Diony Alvaro Ventura bared this during their weekly command conference wherein he directed his 11 station commanders to turn over all cases involving illegal drugs to newly-activated Drug Enforcement Task Force (DETF). According to Ventura, the DETF will be the sole authority in the command level to conduct intelligence and investigation on suspected drug traffickers not only in Quezon City but also nationwide. "Not only that, but DETF will also be responsible in filing drug cases which was the normal practice in CPDC before. DETF was born by a unified effort not only to sting the street but the national level as well," Ventura explained. He said, only two commands -- the CPDC and the Western Police District Command (WPDC) -- under Senior Supt. Hermogenes Ebdane were tasked by Chief Superintendent Recaredo Sarmiento III, National Capital Region Command (NCRC) director, to create their own "centralized" drug enforcement office. He said the two command's task forces will be headed by Supt. Dominador Resos. The PNP-Narcom [Philippine National Police-Narcotics Command] has provided the personnel, the PNP General Headquarters will render legal assistance, and the PNP Crime Laboratory will conduct lab testing on seized illegal drugs.
