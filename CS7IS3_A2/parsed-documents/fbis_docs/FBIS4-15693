The Ingushetia president is known to have walked out, stating that the edict took no account of the Ingush side's wishes regarding the narrowing of the state of emergency zone down to Prigorodnyy Rayon, the scene of hostilities in October-November 1992, and the placing of the rayon governing bodies under the Provisional Administration. None of the points in the Russian Federation president's edict had been agreed on with the Ingush side, whereas the remarks of the Ingush "vis-a-vis" from Vladikavkaz had been reflected in the text of the edict. Insisting on his own version that Russia and, in particular, Sergey Shakhray, its vice premier and minister for the affairs of nationalities and regional policy of the Russian Federation, remain guilty for the conflict that continues between the republics of the Federation, Ingushetia President Aushev doubted the wisdom of Ingushetia's remaining in the role of Russian Federation component if this does not find practical expression.
