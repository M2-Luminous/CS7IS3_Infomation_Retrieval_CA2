FR940426-0-00077 FR940426-0-00017 Nevertheless, NHTSA has no objection to making the changes suggested by Ford. Section 542.1(c), Procedures for newly introduced vehicle lines, now explicitly states that the manufacturers are to follow the procedures in evaluating whether a new line is likely to have a theft rate above or below the median theft rate. Chrysler and VW recommended that the deadline for manufacturers notifying NHTSA of new lines be 12 months before the introduction of the line, instead of 18 months before the introduction, as proposed in the NPRM. Both Chrysler and VW stated that, since the American automobile market is very competitive, manufacturers may decide to introduce new lines with less than 18 months' lead time. They argued that being allowed to inform NHTSA of new car lines 12 months in advance would provide more flexibility to the manufacturers. VW further stated that if NHTSA amended part 542, and issued its preliminary determinations of high or low theft sooner than the 90 days presently provided in part 542, manufacturers could file new vehicle line information with NHTSA as late as 10 months in advance of introduction of the line. Both the VW and Chrysler objections to the 18 month advance notice requirement are apparently based on the possibility that each may wish to introduce a new line in the U.S. with less than 18 months' notice. In the 8 years since part 542 took effect, NHTSA has been notified of a new line less than 18 months before the introduction model year in only a few instances. No manufacturers, besides VW and Chrysler, objected to the 18 month lead time requirement. NHTSA has carefully considered Chrysler and Volkswagen's comments, and calculated the latest date on which it can accept new line information. For reasons explained below, NHTSA needs to issue final determinations of high or low theft, at least six months in advance of the manufacturer's model year. NHTSA has decided that it can accept new line information as late as 15 months before the beginning of the manufacturer's model year, and still issue final determinations six months before the beginning of the model year. Thus, beginning with model year 1997 vehicles, manufacturers are required to notify NHTSA of new lines 15 months before the new line is introduced. NHTSA has not shortened part 542's timeframe for NHTSA's preliminary and final determinations since that is beyond the scope of notice of the NPRM. NHTSA needs to issue determinations six months in advance of the model year because under section 603(a)(3) of the Theft Act, NHTSA must, to the maximum extent practicable, assure that likely high theft lines are selected at least 6 months before the first applicable model year, to notify manufacturers that they must mark the major parts of the line. More importantly, if NHTSA issues a final high theft determination less than six months before an upcoming model year, NHTSA cannot require the manufacturer to mark the parts of the high theft line during that model year. Instead, it cannot mandate parts marking until the following model year. Requiring manufacturers to submit information 15 months (instead of 12 months) before the model year would lessen the likelihood of NHTSA's missing the 6 month deadline to notify manufacturers, before the first applicable model year, of the high theft status of a new line. NHTSA does not believe requiring manufacturers to submit information 15 months in advance of the model year would pose a hardship. NHTSA does not believe that any of the information to be reported (specified at appendix C of part 541) is detailed or complex. The appendix C criteria are: Price; vehicle image; lines competitive with the new line; line(s) the new line is intended to replace; presence of any antitheft devices; and any preliminary theft data for the line. NHTSA believes that a manufacturer planning a new line for sale in the U.S. knows, 15 months before the model year of introduction, fundamental information about the new line, including that specified in appendix C, and would have no difficulty in reporting it. NHTSA believes further that even if, on some occasion, a manufacturer does not make a formal decision to introduce a new line until some time after 15 months in advance of the model year of introduction, the manufacturer must be very actively entertaining, at the 15 month point, the possibility of making such a decision in the next several months. The commercial and regulatory logistics involved in introducing a new line to the U.S. market are complex. The very complexity of this process necessitates that, by 15 months in advance of the model year of introduction, the manufacturers have a good idea whether they will introduce a new line into the United States. If, 15 months before the introduction of a new line, a manufacturer is still undecided whether to introduce the line, it could nevertheless comply with part 542 by sending a letter to NHTSA stating that it may introduce a new line and providing the information specified in appendix C of part 542. To avoid the possibility of a disclosure of its potential plans, the manufacturer may request confidential treatment for the letter. NHTSA has determined that future specific model plans would presumptively be likely to result in substantial competitive harm if disclosed to the public, before the date on which the specific model is first offered for sale. (See 49 CFR part 512, appendix B.) If confidential treatment has been granted, and the manufacturer decides not to introduce the line, NHTSA will not disclose the contents of the letter.
