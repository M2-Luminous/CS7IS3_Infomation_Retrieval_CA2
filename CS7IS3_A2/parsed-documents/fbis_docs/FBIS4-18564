He is Much Too Nervous To Go to Palazzo Chigi; I Am Starting Consultations" -- first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction] [Text] Milan -- How are things going, Senator Bossi? "Fine, thank you, things are always just fine with me." League leader Umberto Bossi was returning by car to Gemonio, having spent a four day vacation in Ponte di Legno. While on the road, the news came through: [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi was breaking off the negotiations with the League. On Monday [4 April], Bossi had sent him a devastating broadside, calling him "Napoleon," branding him as an "autocrat," considering him "a danger to democracy," and reviving, for the occasion, an old nickname used in the election campaign: "Berluskaiser." [Passalacqua] Senator Bossi, what do you think of Berlusconi's announcement that he is breaking off the talks? [Bossi] Well, it is probably a nervous fit, which is even more untimely considering that he is proposing himself as the new prime minister. [Passalacqua] But you have been attacking him since the beginning of the election campaign. [Bossi] Why is Berlusconi breaking off? Over the condition that he was setting, namely, that of being the boss. So, in turn, I put forward the condition of the ethical question. We must put a stop to partyocracy, which was a medley of politics and civil society, a medley of deals. Berlusconi, however, would carry out this medley in the first person. What sort of change for the country could someone like him represent, someone who every day must choose between his own business and public business? [Passalacqua] An ethical condition -- to what extent? [Bossi] We cannot give in. So it is useless for Berlusconi to indulge in nervous fits, because the country will then understand that we are facing something very different, namely, an autocrat's discourse, as we have been saying for some time -- the leader of a virtual party, who sets his own personal power as a condition. [Passalacqua] So you will stand firm by this? [Bossi] The League, which is a force of the people, will not betray the people, will not allow that sort of mechanism to exist. The League will not allow the partyocracy to survive, to stand on its feet in the form of a medley in the person of the prime minister. In the end, we will manage to form a government, but let it be clear that a great change must take place. [Passalacqua] Will you really go to Rome tomorrow (today, for our readers -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) in order to start negotiations with the other parties? [Bossi] Of course. I will be going to Rome and opening the consultations. [Passalacqua] Berlusconi has said that he is waiting for a mandate from the president of the republic to form the new government..Otherwise new elections will have to be held. [Bossi] Berlusconi can say anything he likes, but the real problem is in fact holding new elections. Is he mentioning "new elections?" Very well then, anybody reasoning that way is showing that he is very undemocratic. [Passalacqua] Why? [Bossi] You see, he is saying "either me or new elections." [Passalacqua] Why should this not be the case? [Bossi] We will hold new elections, but with new rules, with genuinely democratic rules, so as to prevent his scores of TV networks and newspapers from brainwashing people. And we will hold the elections with real rules, unlike those ratified in the latest round. Enough with manipulating voters, enough with manipulating public opinion! [Passalacqua] In short, you would agree to a new electoral contest, but only if the rules of the game are changed? [Bossi] Of course, but with genuine rules. Only then will I agree. It will be up to Berlusconi, however, to assume responsibility for that sort of thing. But the real problem, in my view, is a different one. [Passalacqua] What, then, is the crux of the matter? [Bossi] He is threatening us with new elections in order to make us give up the fundamental principles on which the League is based and which the country needs: Enough with partyocracy, with the intermingling between politics and business, particularly in the person of the prime minister! I will not give in on this point. Furthermore, there is the federalist prerequisite, which aims to give citizens institutions enabling them to control those who are engaged in politics. These are the conditions that Berlusconi must face up to. If he opts for elections, the country will reply in the polling booths... [Passalacqua] What will happen now? [Bossi] Nothing. [Passalacqua] How do you mean, nothing? [Bossi] Negotiations will proceed in any case, what do you think should happen? [Passalacqua] But are negotiations with Forza Italia suspended or not? [Bossi] Negotiations are being started elsewhere. [Passalacqua] What about Berlusconi? [Bossi] If he thinks that the country is his seat or his kingdom, he is reading the wrong page. Italy is not Berluskaiser's kingdom. Someone who sets his own personal power as a condition has a few problems grasping a concept which in my book is called democracy. [Passalacqua] Are you satisfied with your results? [Bossi] Please do not ask this sort of question. I believe that the people constitute a steadfast force. What sort of picture of Berlusconi emerges in the end? That of someone who has lost his temper. But can someone who wants to become prime minister lose his temper because we have stopped him by setting such crucial conditions? I believe Berlusconi is digging his own grave. In short, we can say "no" to Berlusconi because he is a profiteer. And a profiteer cannot become prime minister.
