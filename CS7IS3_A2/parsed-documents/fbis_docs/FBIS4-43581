Del Turco's resignation, for example. He had already handed it in two weeks ago, but nobody realized. Not a line was written about the secretary of the glorious Socialist Party [PSI]. However, Del Turco did not lose heart, and yesterday he once again formally announced: "I am resigning as from today." He then claimed the distinction of having kept the party alive when everyone else had pronounced it dead. However, after the European elections, the PSI is as alive as a mineral can be. With its votes added to those of Democratic Alliance [AD], it obtained 1.7 percent. In fact, yesterday former AD coordinator Willy Bordon also resigned. "Our result is truly disappointing, but I will not give up," the former PDS member explained, attempting to reassure his voters ("there are 100,000 of them in Italy overall"). The next step? "A great center-left force, distinct from the PDS." [passage omitted]
