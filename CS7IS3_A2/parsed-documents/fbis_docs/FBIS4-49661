Mr. Deng told him in earnest that: "Hong Kong is going to be handled by us as a special region and a special question. By 1997, no matter how the question of Hong Kong is being resolved, its special status will be guaranteed. "That is to say, in a considerably long period of time between this century and early next century, Hong Kong may practise capitalism while we practise socialism. Therefore, investors around the world should have nothing to worry about." Then, in 1984, when Mr. Deng met with the then British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, Mr. Deng stressed to Sir Geoffrey Howe that: "Hong Kong's prosperity and stability cannot be maintained without a guarantee on its continued capitalist system," and, "I am confident that the principle of `one country, two systems' is workable." Mr. Deng's remarks were by no means casual. What he said was the conclusion drawn after considerable investigations and studies. Before the negotiation between China and Britain on the question of Hong Kong started, Mr. Deng held talks with people from Hong Kong and sent people to Hong Kong many times to make field studies. A special team was set up to look into this question. I was then a member of this team. The team first analysed the factors leading to the economic success in Hong Kong and the conditions under which they were formed. Then, the team studied whether these factors could continue after 1997. The answer was positive. A twelve-point policy was formulated. This policy was laid down in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and later in the Basic Law, and they are the basic policies of the Chinese Government regarding Hong Kong. I want to emphasise that these basic policies are not the result of the Sino-British talks. They were, as a matter of fact, laid on the negotiating table by the Chinese Government right from the beginning. The Reason Now, let me talk about why China decided to adopt the principle of `one country, two systems' to settle the question of Hong Kong: -- First, it is the best and the only solution for maintaining the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. To look for a solution, we took into consideration the historical factor as well as the current status quo of Hong Kong. The solution will not only have to be acceptable to China, but also to Hong Kong and to the British side as well. There should be as little changes and disturbances as possible in 1997. -- Second it is good for the country as a whole. For the modernisations to succeed, we need a bridge to carry us to the Western world, and for the Western world to come to the China market. Hong Kong has been playing this role all along, and China wants it to continue to do so by retaining its capitalistic characteristic. We believe that a socialist mainland and a capitalist Hong Kong can co-exist in harmony in such a way that they can supplement each other instead of confronting each other. The mainland can contribute to Hong Kong its huge market, abundant human resources and ample supply of raw materials. Hong Kong can contribute to the mainland its advanced technology and management skills, its wide contacts with the Western world as well as its strong financial market. Cities like Shanghai can never take the place of Hong Kong because no matter how developed Shanghai becomes, it will remain socialist. Shanghai will serve the country as a socialist metropolis, while Hong Kong will play a different role in its capacity as a capitalist special administrative region. -- Third, it is a big move in the course of reunification of China because by offering Hong Kong as a blue print to the settlement of the questions of Macao and Taiwan, China sets an example to the world that it can settle disputes in a peaceful way through mutual accommodation. Therefore, the 'one country, two systems' principle is by no means a transient or an offhand policy, nor is it a manoeuvre. It is truly China's long term policy. No Change Some may worry that someday China's policy might change. My answer is: "No matter what happens, the principle of `one country, two systems' will not change for at least 50 years, because it is a correct policy, it is good for Hong Kong, good for the country and good for the rest of the world. It is also acceptable to all. [no closing quotation marks as published] Why would China want to change it? It is the responsibility of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office to see that the principle of 'one country, two systems' as well as all the basic policies laid down in the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law are being fully carried out. The principle of `one country, two systems' is embodied in all the articles of the Basic Law, which was adopted by the National People's Congress and has become a national law. It has to be observed not only by Hong Kong but also by the rest of China for matters relative to Hong Kong. It took four years and eight months to work out the Basic Law. As the Chinese saying goes: "One word is worth a thousand pieces of gold." The Basic Law is worth much more than that. If we are not serious in carrying out the principle of `one country, two systems', why on earth should we waste such a lot of time, money and energy to put it into law? I wish to repeat that the principle of `one country, two systems' is guaranteed by law. I foresee that the principle of `one country, two systems' will not change not only within 50 years, but much longer. The obvious reason is that we are still in the primary stage of socialism. We need hundreds of years to build China into a strong socialist state. In this whole course of building socialism Hong Kong will continue to play its important role as a bridge between China and the Western world. Two Aspects Of course, by `one country, two systems' we mean that the main body of the country practises socialism, which is the fundamental system of China, while as a supplement to the socialist state, Hong Kong continues to practise capitalism. Therefore, when we say there will be no change in the principle of `one country, two systems', there are actually two aspects: The capitalist system of Hong Kong will remain unchanged, but the fundamental socialist system of the country will also not change, otherwise it will be one country, one system', instead of 'one country, two systems'. There are some who believe that only when China turns capitalist that Hong Kong's capitalism can be guaranteed. This is an entirely wrong concept. I want to ask, if in case (which is an impossible supposition) China turns capitalist as some people wishfully think, where will Hong Kong stand? Can Hong Kong continue to play its role as a bridge, which contributes as a major factor to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability? Chinese leaders are determined to build a strong socialist China. Any movement or action to change this direction may cause chaos and disruption to the Chinese economy. Hence, any foreign government or Hong Kong people trying to exert pressure on the Chinese Government will not succeed. China would not want itself to be rampant with chaos. Furthermore, can Hong Kong continue to prosper with a turbulent mainland at its back? During the Cultural Revolution, which was purely an internal conflict, Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai to some extent, could still exercise some control over the "Red Guards". Back in 1967, it was premier Zhou Enlai who at the very last minute stopped the "Gang of Four" sending troops to Hong Kong. Do you know that in order to maintain the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, China has been imposing strict self-control on the exodus of immigrants to Hong Kong? It has been, and still is, the People's Liberation Army, under the strict orders of the Central Government, who have been guarding the Hong Kong borders and maintaining the stability in Hong Kong. Therefore, in order to maintain the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, it is of vital importance to maintain the stability of China, without which, the principle of 'one country, two systems' will be built on sand. Value of Hong Kong I would like to stress that the value of Hong Kong to China has been and will be its economic value. Hong Kong has always been an economic city, never a political city. If you ask anyone in the street, what he or she is most concerned with, I bet over 90 percent will say, it's their livelihood. It is precisely on the basis of Hong Kong's economic value that China formulates its present policy towards Hong Kong. Of course there are always a handful who are so naive to think that they can turn Hong Kong into a political city in order to influence the mainland in the sense of politics. If that were the case, Hong Kong would be of negative value instead of positive value to China. This is disastrous for Hong Kong. Hong Kong People Rule Hong Kong In order to put the principle of `one country, two systems' into practice, we have to adopt the policy of letting Hong Kong people rule Hong Kong and allowing Hong Kong enjoy a high degree of autonomy. To preserve the capitalist system in Hong Kong, we need Hong Kong people who are familiar with the capitalist operations to manage themselves. As stipulated in the Basic Law, after 1997, Hong Kong will enjoy its own administrative, legislative and judicial powers. All daily affairs, except those concerning foreign affairs and national defence, will be managed by Hong Kong itself. We have been repeatedly told by our leaders that Hong Kong shall not be dealt with as we did with Shanghai. No department or province will be allowed to interfere in the internal affairs of the Hong Kong SAR, and this should be made known to everybody, starting from now. Therefore, in promoting the Basic Law, we should not only promote it in Hong Kong, in overseas countries, but also within China. In future, any department when dealing with Hong Kong, must abide by the Basic Law, and it is the responsibility of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office to see that everything is done in this manner. To take the airport question as an example, it is because the SAR government still does not exist that China is at present negotiating with the British side for the benefit of the future SAR. If it were after 1997 such an affair would be an internal affair of the SAR, and it would be entirely up to you to decide what you want. The reason why we set up the Preliminary Working Committee is mainly to provide an opportunity for Hong Kong people to participate in the preparation of the SAR, to provide a solid foundation, an optimum starting point for the SAR government, so that when the time of July 1, 1997, comes, what Hong Kong people have will continue to be an economically prosperous, financially sound, socially secured Hong Kong, with everything in order and well-prepared. This is a tremendous task, but I and my colleagues all regard it as an honoured task endowed upon us by the 1.1 billion people. That is why I always said to my colleagues we should be fully dedicated and consecrated to the success of this lofty cause. Before concluding, I would like to reiterate that it is my responsibility to see that the principle of `one country, two systems' being put into practice, that the Basic Law is fully carried out; that Hong Kong will continue to prosper, that Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, that `Hong Kong People rule Hong Kong' all will be strictly observed. People will continue to enjoy their present way of life; and that all of you present here today will be given the chance to further Fat Choy [make money].
