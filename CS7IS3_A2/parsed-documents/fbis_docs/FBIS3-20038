In a communique issued after an EU foreign ministers' meeting failed to agree on changes to voting procedures after four new member states are admitted to the Union, Andreatta said "I believe that at the basis of the solution there must be a compromise between those members which, like Italy, wish to see a gradual political and economic integration between member countries and, on the other hand, an acceptance of some nations' concern to not allow the isolation of a minority which represents a significant part of Europe's citizens." EU foreign ministers will gather in northern Greece this weekend for further talks on the voting procedure, which is holding up entry to the Union for Austria, Sweden, Norway and Finland. With the four new members, who now seem unlikely to enter the Union on January 1, 1995 as planned, the number of votes in the council of ministers would rise from 76 to 90. Some nations, including Spain, want the blocking minority to rise from its current 23 votes to 27 votes, to reflect this increase. The Europarliament, which would have to ratify the new memberships before they go to referendums in the countries involved, has already said that it will not accept a blocking vote of less than 27. The Parliament will be dissolved shortly, to allow for elections in June.
