Inorganic materials such as ceramics and carbon have far better properties than metal materials in terms of radiation resistance, corrosion resistance, heat resistance, abrasion resistance, reduction of radiation, insulation, etc. However, the use of single materials, even though their individual properties are superb, is limited in the nuclear environment, where many functions such as radiation resistance, strength at high temperatures, heat resistance, corrosion resistance, etc., are required simultaneously. In this context, compound materials that combine inorganic materials with high levels of heat resistance and durability have been noted as one kind of high-performance material. At JAERI, research and development of high-performance compound materials has been conducted as a key technological issue. In this section we report on the current state of research and development for functionally gradient materials for the purpose of improving the oxidation resistance of carbon materials, which feature superb strength at high temperatures and superior neutron properties, as well as high-performance fibers for the purpose of improving the tenacity of ceramic materials with superb strength in high temperature and corrosion resistance. 1. Development of Oxidation-Resistant Carbon Materials by Gradient Composition (1) Objectives and Issues of Research and Development Because of their superb properties in high-temperature and nuclear environments, carbon materials have been used in a broad range of fields, including nuclear engineering, for instance, for the core structure of the HTTR being constructed by JAERI. At the same time, their lack of acid resistance in a high-temperature oxidation atmosphere has restricted their use. In general, a surface coating is viewed as one way to improve acid resistance. However, when used for a long period of time, or in conditions of severe thermal stress, the coated layer may be removed from the base material by the stress concentrated on the phase boundary. This stress, in turn, is caused by the difference in thermal expansion factors of the coating and the base. Therefore, we have paid attention to gradient compound materials, which do not receive stress on specific places, and do not allow the surface layer to be removed easily. This is because such materials do not have a clear phase boundary between the coated layer and the base, because the density of the two materials varies gradually. The development of high-performance acid-resistant carbon materials is in progress. Such materials are expected to be applied in fields radically outside the nuclear field as well. In the development of high-performance acid-resistant carbon materials, we selected silicon carbide (SiC) as the material for the acid-resistant surface layer. This is because SiC has the highest acid resistance and nuclear stability at 1,500-1,600�C among carbides. SiC, a high-performance acid-resistant carbon material, and a gradient compound material (SiC/C gradient compound material) using a carbon base were produced in the following two processes. [1] Process-1 Based on the porous property of a carbon material, a layer with a SiC density gradient (SiC/C) is formed from the surface to the inside of the carbon material using the diffusion response of gaseous SiO on the carbon material surface and the pores. [2] Process-2 On the surface of the material with a SiC/C layer, SiC is coated with the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. In this report, the production method and evaluation testing in the current stage of SiC/C gradient compound material are discussed mainly for graphic materials. (2) Production of SiC/C Gradient Component Materials i) Formation of SiC/C Layer The reaction between SiO and carbon is used to form the SiC/C layer. SiO has a fusing point above 1,700�C, and is extremely easy to evaporate at high temperatures. This characteristic is used to form the SiC/C layer. Powdered SiO with a purity of 99.9 percent, which is commercially available, and a cylindrical graphite base material measuring 10mm in diameter and 20mm in length with rounded ends are used. The electric furnace used for the SiO and carbon reaction is a sealed type that uses siliconite as a heating element. The locations of the two materials in the reaction furnace are illustrated in Figure VI-1. The powdered SiO is evaporated after being heated to 1,300�C in highly purified helium, the carrier gas, and forms SiC by the following reaction with graphite heated to 1,380�C on the surface and in the pores: SiO (gas) + 2C (solid) = SiC (solid) + CO (gas) [1] The results show that SiC is distributed from the surface to the inside of the graphite material with a gradient density. The gasification temperature of 1,300�C for SiO, and the response temperature of 1,380�C in equation [1] were determined from the standpoint of the response speed. Due to the formation of SiC, an increase in the dimensions of the graphite material as a result of an increase in weight and volume was observed. Although the temperature condition is different, an example of an increase in measurements of the graphite material as a result of an increase in weight and volume is illustrated in Figure VI-2. It also has been confirmed that the void content of the graphite material with the SiC/C layer increases along with the increase in weight compared to the base graphite. When the SiC density of the base increases as a result of excessive reaction, in other words, the increase in weight is over about 2-3 percent (differs according to type of base materials), cracks occur near the surface. Since cracks occur easily at the ends, the ends are carved to prevent them from forming. The degree of reaction speed can be discovered by measuring the CO gas density generated in the equation [1] as needed. The SiC density of the graphite material is indicated by the increased weight after the reaction. The SiC thus formed has been confirmed to be beta-SiC by X-ray diffraction. ii) SiC Coating by CVD A complete SiC/C gradient compound material is produced by coating SiC by CVD on the surface of the graphite material with the SiC/C layer. The basic temperature at the time of SiC coating by CVD must be lower than 1,380�C for the SiC/C layer formation to maintain the correct SiC density gradient. Coating of SiC targeted at 100 �m is done externally. Figure VI-3 is a conceptual presentation of Si distribution in the cross-sections of a SiC/C gradient compound material, a SiC-coated SiC/C material (SiC-SiC/C), and a SiC-coated graphite material (base graphite simply coated with SiC: SiC-C). Although there is a clear phase boundary as a border line between SiC and base graphite in ordinary SiC-coated graphite materials, there is no clear phase boundary as a border line in the SiC/C gradient compound material, and the SiC/C layer exists as a boundary layer between the SiC and the base graphite. (3) Evaluation Test Oxidation testing and thermal cycle testing were used to evaluate the compound material. i) Oxidation Testing An oxidation test for SiC-SiC/C was conducted in the atmosphere at 800�C and 1,000�C. For the sake of comparison, graphite materials with only SiC-C or SiC/C layers (SiC/C) as well as the base graphite material were tested. The base graphite for the four types of materials was identical. Figure VI-4 illustrates weight reduction curves for the four materials. Weight reduction in the SiC coated materials, SiC-SiC/C, and SiC-C was nil in practice. SiC/C, the graphite material with the SiC/C layer but without the SiC coated layer, does not have the perfect oxidation resistance that can be observed in SiC coated materials, although some improvement can be made over other graphite materials. Figure VI-5 illustrates the appearance of the SiC/C and base graphite test pieces before and after oxidation for about 2.5 hours at 1,000�C. The base graphite test piece is reduced in size (carbon and oxygen react with each other and produce CO[.sup]2[/] gas), but there is no change in the external view of SiC/C, even though there is reduction in weight of 76 percent. Because SiC/C, unlike SiC coated materials, is not covered with a SiC layer and is still a porous material, oxygen reacts with unreacted internal carbon (carbon not yet turned to SiC) through pores. Porous diffusion of oxygen is easier with SiC/C, which has a high level of porosity, than with the base graphite. Although there is no change in the external view due to a lack of oxidation in the SiC portion of the SiC/C layer, it is internally oxidized. Even though it is possible to produce SiC/C with different SiC density by varying the response temperature and time in equation [1], the reaction of oxygen with unreacted internal carbon cannot be avoided. Therefore, it is necessary to coat the SiC/C surface with SiC further, and to turn it to SiC-SiC/C if more severe oxidation resistance is required. Based on a detailed examination of SiC behavior, an extremely thin and stable SiO[.sup]2[/] layer is formed on SiC by the following reaction: SiC (solid) + 20[.sup]2[/] (gas) = SiO[.sub]2[/] (solid) + CO[.sup]2[/] (gas) [2] up to 1,000�, and the oxidation resistance of SiC is believed to be maintained. ii) Thermal Cycle Testing The evaluation test for thermal cycle resistance properties was conducted for SiC-SiC/C and SiC-C coated with SiC by CVD. The method of the thermal cycle test was as follows. First, as a preliminary heating process, it was heated at 800-1,000�C in the atmosphere for several hours to verify the soundness of the SiC coated layer. Then, those test pieces with a sound coated layer were heated to 1,000�C or 1,200�C at the speed of 20�C per second. Next, after maintaining them at that temperature for 5 minutes, they were dropped into pure water at 20�C. In order to evaluate the soundness of the test pieces after testing, isothermal heating was conducted for one hour in the atmosphere at 800�C after each cycle, and any changes in weight were measured. When cracks in the SiC coated layer or exfoliation of the layer is caused by the heat cycle, the test piece loses weight due to a reaction of oxygen and the base graphite through the damaged section by isothermal heating. Thermal cycle and isothermal heating were repeated until the weight reduction rate, where the coated layer was damaged, reached about 10 percent. Figure VI-6 illustrates a typical example of a test piece where the coated layer is damaged, and the internal graphite base is oxidized. Figure VI-7 illustrates weight reduction curves for three kinds of SiC-SiC/C (with different SiC density in SiC/C) and SiC-C. A list of preliminary thermal process conditions to verify the soundness of SiC coated layers, and a suitable retaining temperature for thermal cycle testing concerning the test pieces a-j in Figure VI-6 are presented in Table VI-1. Although differences in the behavior of the three types of SiC-SiC/C cannot be accounted for, they clearly are due to different SiC densities in individual SiC/C elements, and to different preliminary thermal process conditions prior to thermal cycle testing. The figure indicates that the thermal cycle resistance properties are far more stable than those for SiC/C. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table VI-1.

Figure VI-8 indicates the surface conditions of SiC-C (test piece: g) after the fourth thermal cycle, and isothermal heating and SiC-SiC/C (test piece: h) after fifth thermal cycle and isothermal heating as examples. There are many cracks in SiC-C. The thermal expansion factors of beta-SiC and the base graphite (marketed under the trade name of IG-110) are 4.7 x 10[.sup]-6[/]/K (293-2,400 K) and 4.06 x 10[.sup]-6[/]/K (293-673 K), respectively. As Figure VI-3 indicates, a phase boundary of heterogeneous materials exists between the SiC-coated layer and the base graphite in SiC-C, but there is no clear phase boundary in SiC-SiC/C. In other words, since the phase boundary between heterogeneous materials exists not as a line but as a layer in SiC-SiC/C, stress tends not to concentrate in specific places. Therefore, it can be said that the SiC coated layer of SiC-SiC/C expresses stable properties even under thermal cycles. iii) Miscellaneous Strength properties are an important evaluation item if the SiC/C gradient compound material (SiC-SiC/C) is to be put to practical use as a structural material. Concerning the effects of the SiC/C layer on the strength properties of the base graphite at room temperature, a preliminary examination was conducted. As a result of the examination, it was confirmed that the strength of the graphite material with the SiC/C layer was equivalent to or greater than that of the base material without depending on the weight increase factor, or SiC density, if the weight increase factor was below 2 percent, or within the range where cracks were not created at the time of SiC/C layer formation. Figure VI-9 illustrates the bending strength of IG-110 graphite with a SiC/C layer in comparison with the base IG-110. (4) Conclusion and Future Perspectives The development of a SiC/C gradient compound material from which an oxidation-resistant SiC surface layer is hard to exfoliate has been conducted for the purpose of improving the oxidation resistance of carbon materials. Using the reaction between gaseous SiO and carbon, a SiC/C gradient compound layer was formed in the graphite material. Using the graphite material as the base, a SiC/C gradient compound graphite material consisting of a SiC-coated layer produced by CVD, a SiC/C gradient compound layer, and the graphite base was successfully produced. According to an evaluation of its oxidation and thermal cycle resistance properties, it displayed a level of oxidation resistance equivalent to SiC coated graphite, and a thermal cycle resistance far more stable than that of SiC coated graphite. To date, only three experimental pieces of SiC/C gradient compound graphite material have been produced and evaluated. We have good prospects for the development of a high-performance oxidation-resistant graphite material. We will continue our research on how the SiC density of the base SiC/C layer affects the stability of the surface SiC layer, and on the long-term stability of SiC/C density gradient. Also, we will try to put the material to practical use. It has been confirmed that the SiC/C layer formation method based on the reaction in the equation [1], which is used for the graphite material, also can be applied to both carbon materials and carbon fiber reinforced compound materials (so-called C/C compounds). We plan to use the surface SiC coating by CVD technique to produce a SiC coated layer-SiC/C gradient compound layer-carbon base, a SiC coated layer-SiC/C gradient compound layer-C/C compound base, and a SiC/C gradient compound C/C compound material. We will conduct evaluation tests on these materials. 2. Development of Highly Thermal-Resistant Silicon Carbide Long Fiber (1) Objectives and Issues of Research and Development Although ceramics have superb properties in the areas of heat resistance, reduction of radiation, and corrosion resistance, their lack of fracture toughness presents a problem in terms of reliability. In order to improve their fracture toughness, research and development of a fiber-reinforced compound ceramics material (FRC) is being considered. There are many ceramics, ranging from porcelain, which has a long history, to the recently developed fine ceramics. However, there is only a limited number of reinforcing fibers, such as alumina fibers, silicon carbide fibers, and zirconia fibers. Although glass fibers and carbon fibers are used widely as reinforcement fibers for plastic, glass fibers and carbon fibers cannot be used directly as reinforcement fibers for ceramics because of their heat resistance and reactions to ceramics, respectively. Normally, compounding and molding of ceramics are done at high temperatures between 10,000 and 20,000�C. It is also necessary to mold fiber-reinforced compound materials at high temperatures, and thus the development of reinforcing fibers that can be processed at such high temperatures is expected. It is anticipated that silicon carbide (SiC) fibers can be used as reinforcement fibers for ceramic compounds. The SiC fiber was invented by Yajima, et al., of the Research Institute for Iron, Steel, and Other Materials of Tohoku University. In their method, polycarbosilane (PCS) fiber, an organic silicon polymer, is used as a precursor. After it is processed to make it infusible by thermal oxidation in the process illustrated in Figure VI-10, it is baked to produce fibers. The SiC fiber obtained by this thermal oxidation method is known as "Nikaron," while the SiC fiber obtained by the same method using polytitanocarbosilane compounded with polycarbosilane and a few percent of titanium is called "Tilano." These fibers have a high level of flexibility, strength, and oxidation resistance, and their maximum heat resistance is 1,200�C. Therefore, their application as reinforcing fibers for compound materials is limited, and they are used only to reinforce materials with a relatively low melting temperature, such as glass for FRC, and to reinforce aluminum for metal compounds. The heat resistance of SiC fibers must be improved if they are to be used for the development of heat-resistant compound materials. "Nikaron" and "Tilano" as marketed at present, begin to decompose at 1,200�C. This most likely is because of the oxygen included in the SiC. A process to make PCS fiber infusible is essential to maintain the fiber form in the ceramic production process. If this is done by thermal oxidation, oxygen is introduced into SiC fiber after burning, and its density increases by 10 percent in weight. To reduce the oxygen level, a method to make the fibers infusible by using radiation was examined. As a result of developing infusibility technology based on the study of the effects of radiation on PCS, SiC fibers with far greater heat resistance than expected were obtained. The following describes the properties of the SiC fibers obtained in this research and development effort. (2) Production Technology for Silicon Carbide Fiber Using Radiation i) Radiation Method We developed a method to process silicon polymer (PCS) fiber to make it infusible (a process to maintain the fiber form by heating it to a temperature higher than the fusing point of the fiber) by irradiating it. When organic polymers are irradiated, a covalent-bonded molecular chain is either cut off or forms new bonds with another molecular chain. The reactions that occurred with PCS were examined by using [.sup]60 [/] Cogamma ray radiation. The results show that radiation in a vacuum at room temperature resulted in the emission of hydrogen (H[.sup]2[/]) and methane (CH[.sup]4[/]), and cross-linking was promoted. Meanwhile, radiation in an oxygen atmosphere at room temperature resulted in the emission of oxidative destruction products, carbon dioxide, and water. Also, oxygen was absorbed extensively compared to the amount emitted. Infusibility processing can be conducted in this case as well, and oxygen density can be controlled and varied between 3 and 25 percent. The amount of oxidation induced by PCS radiation is 10 times higher than that of hydrocarbon polymers, such as polyethylene. This indicates that PCS, including silicon atoms, is extremely susceptible to oxidation. When PCS is subjected to gamma rays in a vacuum, it becomes infusible by cross-linking, but reaction activity (radicals) still remains, and exposure to air promotes rapid oxidation as well as the intake of oxygen. Therefore, we have developed an infusibility process that does not introduce oxygen by eliminating the remaining oxygen while implementing stabilization processing to prevent oxidation in the air. It is known that there is no difference between gamma rays and electrons in terms of the radiation effects on organic polymers. It has been confirmed that electron and gamma ray radiation produce a cross-linking reaction in PCS fiber. ii) Development of Production Technology PCS fiber can be rendered infusible without oxygen by radiation in a vacuum, but this process requires a dose of 15 MGy. Although gamma radiation can be used for large amounts of PCS fibers at a time, the radiation speed (dose rate) is about 10 kGy/h at the maximum. This is unrealistic in practical terms as it would require 1,500 hours of radiation. Therefore, electron radiation by electronic accelerators was examined for practical application. Although electronic accelerators are capable of producing large doses of radiation in a short time, it is necessary that the items being radiated are thin as its transmittivity is small. As illustrated in Figure VI-11, we have developed a method to spool fiber on a bobbin (30 cm in diameter and 30 cm in width), and to radiate the spinning bobbin in the radiation container. The electron accelerator used here operates at a current of 2 MeV, and is capable of radiating electron beams at a maximum of 30 mA with a scanning width of 120 cm. As the effective transmittivity of the electronic beams is 0.6 g/cm[.sup]2[/], the maximum thickness of the PCS fiber is 0.6 g/cm[.sup]2[/]. Therefore, the maximum amount of PCS fiber that can be radiated at a time with the bobbin in Figure VI-11 is about 1.5 kg. However, a dose of 15 MGy means that 15 MJ of energy is applied to 1 kg of fiber, and most of this energy is transformed to thermal energy. Therefore, if the PCS fiber being radiated is not sufficiently cooled, the fiber will melt with the heat from the electrons. For efficient cooling, helium gas was used as the atmosphere during radiation, and the helium gas was cooled with a heat exchanger. This method made it possible to achieve infusibility for a maximum of 4.5 kg of PCS fiber by irradiating it for four hours, which demonstrates the prospect of practical application. (3) Properties of Silicon Carbide Fiber After PCS fiber is made infusible by radiation and thermal oxidation, it is processed with heat up to 1,200�C in an inactive gas flow. Then, it emits H[.sup]2[/] and CH[.sup]4[/], and is transformed into ceramic SiC fiber. The SiC fiber obtained at this temperature has an amorphous structure with a density between 2.5 and 2.6. The strength of the fiber does not depend much on the oxygen content, and shows a value of 2.5-3.0 GPa (100 kg/mm[.sup]2[/]). When this SiC fiber is processed with heat up to 1,500�C in argon gas, the fiber with a low oxygen content does not change its form or strength, but the density rises slightly to about 2.7. Meanwhile, when the oxygen density increases, its strength drops radically, although the fiber form is maintained. Examination with a scanning electron microscope shows that the higher oxygen density generates particles on the surface of the fiber, and that decomposition is taking place as illustrated in Figure VI-12. Decomposition is particularly prominent in the SiC fiber with 10 percent oxygen produced by thermal oxidation infusibility. The oxygen density indicated in the figure is expressed in percent by weight based on an element analysis of SiC fiber. The fiber processed with heat after electron radiation is the lowest at 0.4 percent. The oxygen density at 1.4 and 2.3 percent indicates insufficient heat processing after radiation. Since PCS fiber as a material contains about 0.2-0.3 percent oxygen as an impurity, the oxygen density of the SiC fiber after burning becomes almost 0.4 percent without additional oxygen in the infusibility process. Figure VI-13 consists of scanning electron microscope photographs of low-oxygen SiC fiber being processed by heat up to 2,000�C in argon gas. Although there is no change in the fiber with 0.4 percent oxygen, the surface of the fiber with 1.4 percent oxygen is coarse, and large crystallized particles can be observed between fibers. The results of an X-ray diffraction analysis of the structure of the crystals are illustrated in Figure VI-14. Those with a higher oxygen density present diffraction images equivalent to single SiC crystals (_b_-SiC). In SiC with a lower oxygen density, however, particle growth is slow, and the fiber form is maintained, although crystals are formed. Figure VI-15 illustrates the oxygen density and carbon/silicon ratio by thermal processing, and it indicates the disjunction of oxygen and carbon beginning around 1,400�C. This is because oxygen that has combined with silicon atoms is released. It then reacts with excessive carbon, and is emitted as carbon monoxide (CO) gas. SiC that remains in thermal decomposition develops into crystallized particles and becomes deposited between fibers, as illustrated in Figure VI-13. Although element composition does not change in samples with small oxygen density up to 2,000�C without thermal decomposition, crystallization takes place gradually. Figure VI-16 illustrates the relationship between strength and elastic coefficient of the fiber with the least oxygen density at 0.4 percent in a tension test at room temperature after thermal processing in argon gas at various temperatures. Reduction of strength is extremely small up to about 1,700�C, and elastic coefficient begins to decrease beyond 1,900�C. When the results are compared with "Nikaron," which is rendered infusible by thermal oxidation, heat resistance has been improved by 500�C in the range of dynamic properties. Table VI-2 indicates representative property values of SiC fiber with a low oxygen density obtained in the infusibility process by thermal oxidation. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table VI-2.

An experiment using this technology for production on a scale of one ton per month is in progress at Research Development Corporation, and it is expected to be completed at the end of FY 1994. For the future, we anticipate the development of fiber-reinforced compound materials using this newly developed fiber. Silicon carbide fiber obtained by radiation can endure a high temperature of 1,700�C for a short time. The range of matrix materials will expand, and it can be compounded with ceramics. The initial items of examination include compatibility, reactions, and deference in thermal expansion between compound materials and this fiber. The next item is the development of compound technology. Superb inspiration and its efficient execution will be needed in this unknown field. The situation will differ depending on whether the matrix is metal or ceramics, but in each case this will be key basic research worth our efforts because of its variety. The application of new materials to the nuclear field becomes possible only when technological development of compound materials expands. A broad range of uses is expected for enhanced light-water reactors; nuclear fusion reactor materials; aeronautic and space materials, including rockets; and heat-resistant materials, including gas turbines. 3. Conclusion We have reported on concrete developments in key technological research concerning compound materials, noting that high-performance oxidation-resistant graphite materials, as well as a production method for high-performance silicon carbide fiber, have been developed. The development of high-performance oxidation-resistant graphite materials leads to the enhancement of all carbon materials, and the development of high-performance silicon carbide fiber will lead to the development of fiber-reinforced metal and ceramic compound materials. Our dream expands to the development of gradient composite silicon carbide fiber compound materials -- the ultimate compound materials -- by reinforcing the base material with silicon carbide fiber gradiently compounded with environment-resistant materials.
