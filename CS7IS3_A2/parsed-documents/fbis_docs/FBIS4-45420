Alejandro Leon Pazos, the Peruvian permanent OAS representative, suggested that a new chapter of international provisions on human rights take into account the true intensity of the violence generated by terrorism and drug trafficking. Leon stated that effective international measures of condemnation should be adopted, and the appropriate sanctions meted out to offenders, in order to eradicate terrorism and drug trafficking. The Peruvian delegate today addressed the delegates from the 34 OAS member states who are meeting this week in the Brazilian Amazonian city of Belem, in Para State. Leon noted that the recent Vienna Conference on Human Rights regarded the various forms and manifestations of terrorist acts, methods, and practices, as well as the nefarious ties existing between terrorist agents and drug trafficking, as activities aimed at destroying human rights, fundamental freedoms, and democracy; and as activities that threaten the territorial integrity and security of all states. Leon added: "The international community must urgently strengthen the indispensable cooperation measures aimed at both preventing and fighting terrorism." He added that the OAS "must clearly condemn terrorism as a form of human right violation that affects our peoples, and consequently it must act immediately and effectively to stop this criminal scourge, instead of limiting ourselves to watching the tragic consequences it brings to our nations." The Peruvian Government is waging a war against Shining Path terrorist guerrillas and to this end has adopted the death penalty, thus violating an OAS convention.
