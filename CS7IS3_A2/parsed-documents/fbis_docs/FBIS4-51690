The Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives (Zenchu) said the proposal also calls on the government to increase stockpiles of rice, including imported rice, to about two million tons. The union also urged the government to review its policy of rice production cutbacks under which farmers are imposed a uniform quota for acreage reduction. The proposal is in line with the government policy of deregulation to cope with a partial opening of Japan's rice market, union officials said. The officials said the union wants the government to adopt a pricing system aimed at promoting consumption of domestically produced rice. Rice held in government stock should be used not only for table use but also for animal feeds and foreign aid, the officials said. They said the government should seek the people's understanding for an extra cost of about 219.3 billion yen for the rice stockpiles. The proposal will be examined further before it is submitted to the government on June 8, when the union will come up with its demand for prices of newly reaped rice this year, they said.
