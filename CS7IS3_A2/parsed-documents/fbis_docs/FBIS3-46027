Observer Mission in South Africa (UNOMSA) to include observation of the country's elections on April 27, as suggested by the U.N. chief. At the request of the transitional Executive Council of South Africa, Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali had proposed the United Nations provide some 1,800 observers. Along with those from the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the European Union, the commonwealth and individual states, the total number of international observers would probably exceed 5,000. The UNOMSA would have a significant role "not only in assessing the freedom and fairness of the elections, but in monitoring each stage of the process," the U.N. chief said in his recent report on South Africa. The unanimously-adopted Resolution 894 urged all parties in South Africa, including those which did not participate fully in the multi-party talks, to respect agreements reached during the negotiations, to adhere to democratic principles, and to take part in the elections. It also called upon all parties to take measures to end the violence and intimidation and thus contribute to the conduct of free and fair elections, and expects that anyone who seeks to disrupt the elections will be held accountable. Speaking at the Security Council meeting today, Li Zhaoxing, Chinese permanent representative to the U.N., said the success of the election depends on the South African people themselves, and hoped that all parties in the country will make efforts to ensure the election be held on schedule. At present there are 100 observers in UNOMSA, which was established in 1992 to assist in creating conditions for negotiations leading towards a peaceful transition to a democratic, non-racial and united South Africa.
