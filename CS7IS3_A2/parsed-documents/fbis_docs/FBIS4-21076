They are implicated in the shooting on 3 March in which Federal Judicial Police Commander Alejandro Castaneda Andrade was killed. At a press conference (postponed four times), the deputy prosecutor for local offices and inspection, Alfonso Cabrera Morales, was accompanied by the PGR's director of preliminary investigations, Juan Alberto Carbajal. They announced that the officials and State Judicial Police agents implicated had protected the escape of Ismael Higuera Guerrero, alias "El Mayel," who has taken control of the Arellano Felix brothers' ring. Based on the reconstruction of the incidents, the federal agents were attacked to prevent them from discovering the identity of an individual who was being watched, and to prevent his capture. The official added that 11 persons have already been remanded, including the state's deputy prosecutor of justice, Sergio Ortiz Lara, and the agent of the Public Prosecutor's Office for the common jurisdiction, Juan Carlos Guerrero. The others under arrest are Javier Arce Garcia, Pedro Muniz Resendiz Flores, Gustavo Aguilar Villasenor, Humberto Iribe Obeso, Jose Gallegos Astorga, and Juan Carlos Aguilar Renteria. All are civilians, and assistants of members of the State Judicial Police, who are accused of homicide, aggravated injuries, breach of trust, gangsterism against authorized agents, carrying firearms exclusively for Army use, and usurpation of functions. In the same legal circumstances but not yet under arrest are Julio Cesar Guzman Castillo and Gilberto Vega Hernandez, drivers of municipal patrol car 497, accused of injuries; Juan Jesus Hernandez Tejeda, a State Judicial Police member; and the La Mesa group chiefs, Mauricio Sanchez Zavala, Esteban Cebreros Zavala, Jaime Valderrabano, and Julio Cesar J. Guzman; as well as Municipal Public Safety Commander Antonio Cano. They were remanded for abuse of authority, escape of prisoners in a gang, and acts against the administration of justice. The state's attorney, Juan Francisco Franco Rios, who was cleared of all liability, remarked: "Just because there are bad members of the force, there is no need to discredit everyone." In the case of Juan Carlos Guerrero, it was specified that he had permitted inmates to escape when they were introduced to him. However, it is not yet known who they were. As for Ortiz Lara, he appeared with an armed group and argued with one of the captives. He was taken away, and his whereabouts are as yet unknown. Ortiz Lara appeared before the authorities with amparo, 28 hours after having been summoned for the first time, and after having received four additional summonses. As a result, he has not been apprehended either.
