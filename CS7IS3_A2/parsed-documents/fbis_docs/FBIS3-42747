At that time the young director-"therapist" was diagnosing the illness. A great deal depended on the accuracy of the diagnosis. It would decide whether the enterprise could manage to climb out of debt and the labor collective could escape the constant threat of poverty and social disorientation. In the event of an error, the "physician of record" would be in a hopeless situation. Expulsion from the CPSU was tantamount to the loss of respect and prestige in society, however honest and decent a man he may have been. His knowledge and ability seemed dubious at first, irrespective of the conditions in which he was doing his work. It is clear, however, that although personal preferences were rarely considered at that time, only a courageous man would have agreed to take charge of a lagging enterprise. I do not know whether Tonchuk gave this any thought or not. I remember that he was completely preoccupied with finding the reasons for the combine's inefficiency. He soon found a way out of the impasse and the protracted economic slump, but this was not the end of his difficulties. It was much more difficult to carry out his plans when everything had to be approved and "okayed" from above, and no one even dared to think about autonomy or the freedom from tutelage the young director wanted. Not everyone could or would make the only correct decision at a crucial time and assume all of the responsibility for the consequences. This takes more than physical stamina and a strong will: It also takes a somewhat prophetic nature. Otherwise, self-destruction is a distinct possibility. They say that someone who never takes risks never drinks champagne. This is only partly true. Risks have to be reasonable unless a person wants to break his neck. Tonchuk had checked and rechecked everything, and for this reason he did not retreat from his own convictions until he had demonstrated the accuracy of his approach. The collective he headed climbed out of the hole where it had been buried almost up to its chin and became the leaseholder of the building materials combine. Now almost 10 years have gone by, and this is the fourth year that Director V. Tonchuk of the building materials combine has occupied the biggest, most spacious office in the Balti municipal government building, with direct telephone lines to the president and government of the Republic of Moldova. He is the head of the municipal administration in Balti. My conversation with him, oddly enough, was about the same kind of autonomy with which he began his tenure as director of the building materials combine. [Starika] Judging by the constant calls from Chisinau, it appears that there have been no significant changes in administrative methods in spite of the changes in our country's economic and political goals. Am I mistaken, Vladimir Stepanovich? [Tonchuk] It is easier to exercise rights than to fulfill obligations. It is easier to change laws than to change human habits, and the most difficult thing of all is to surmount bureaucratic obstacles and break through the web of interlocking interests and long-standing faulty ties and instructions. [Starika] The human being is an intricate mechanism. Experience has confirmed, however, that he can be led in virtually any direction: toward good and evil. We know this from specific cases and general trends. Remember how a whole nation turned toward fascism in the 1930s under Hitler's influence.... [Tonchuk] And I will remind you of Stalin's crimes--the forced collectivization, the firing squads, the prison camps, and the resulting spiritual corruption. The effects of Stalinism and the communist totalitarian past will continue to be felt for a long time. Announcements, resolutions, and sporadic anti-bureaucratic measures are not producing the necessary results yet. Every remedy has been tried, but the illness continues. It is as if we are fighting a phantom. [Starika] Are you saying that we will not have self-government soon? [Tonchuk] The experience of the last few years has convinced us that we will have to begin by surmounting not only doctrinaire obstacles and ideological jingles, but also the frequent and understandable anxiety caused by changes in rules and guidelines. We are seeing signs of inflexibility, passive resistance, and the fear of violating individual and regional interests, which are often concealed behind pseudo-reformist verbosity. In the simplest terms, these are signs of a difficult and sometimes fierce battle between the old and the new, between statewide interests and emerging private interests. [Starika] Let us imagine the ideal situation or one close to the ideal. You, as the head of the municipal administration, have been entrusted with all of the reins of government. Will you be able to guarantee the normal economic and political life of Balti? [Tonchuk] Life is normal in the city. Residential neighborhoods have a constant supply of heat and scheduled supplies of hot water. Vegetables, fruit, dairy products, baked goods, and other foods are delivered to stores on schedule and in sufficient quantities. The municipal transport network is operating without any interruptions. Believe me, this is not such a simple accomplishment under present conditions. [Starika] But what about municipal industry, construction, and freight deliveries? They are on their last legs, so to speak.... [Tonchuk] The difficulties all of us have had to endure are mainly the result of shortages of crude resources, materials, and money. We have also encountered a form of resistance caused by conservative tendencies and the inability to act under the new conditions. Furthermore, this is true of enterprises and of republic agencies of economic administration. Measures in priority fields--the economy, education, medicine, and other socially vital areas--should be coordinated by the center. All other administrative prerogatives, after certain sums have been deposited in the republic budget, should be transferred to the local level. And the main one is the right to dispose of generated revenue. Incidentally, one such attempt was already made. In the middle of 1991 the government issued a provisional statute on so-called municipal self-government. It was impossible, however, to use this statute as a guide. Each ministry and department still felt obliged to interfere in municipal affairs, and particularly in the municipal economy. It seemed that people there thought they knew more about what we should be doing here. Therefore, there is no reason yet to think of the city as an autonomous administrative and economic entity. This can only be finalized after the passage of the appropriate laws and, in particular, the strict observance of the law on the budget. [Starika] Nevertheless, at the recent conference of representatives of local government agencies in the north of Moldova and the heads of regional gas utilities, which was held in Balti by General Director Boris Karandyuk of the republic State Department of Gasification, the first step in this direction seemed to have been taken. [Tonchuk] It has already become impossible for the Department of Gasification to fulfill its obligations or even to exercise its rights. This is why its powers have been transferred to the local level. It was a civilized decision. Now we have been self-reliant for a long time, and others will have to make their own decisions on the installation of gas supply lines. Other sectorial ministries should follow the example of this state department, especially if they cannot give weak enterprises any help. Let them turn their resources over to the city, and we will use them wisely. [Starika] Then we will reach the point at which the Balti administration will have to conclude its own agreements, on shipments of apples or cucumbers, for instance, directly with Glodeani or another region in Moldova. [Tonchuk] I do not see anything bad about this. The existing economic, cultural, and other ties between Balti and the Glodeani, Riskani, Falesti, Floresti, Singerei, and other regions of the republic and with nearby and distant foreign countries have proved that it is simpler, easier, and safer to work without middlemen. [Starika] In view of this, do you believe it would be advisable to establish a free economic zone in the northern region, with all of the ensuing obligations and rights? After all, it is no secret that dozens of vehicles race from the regions to Chisinau, burning up tons of scarce and costly fuel, on every minor pretext, but our problems generally remain unresolved. [Tonchuk] I believe this might be a good thing, but I have no jurisdiction over the administrative structure of Moldova. [Starika] Nevertheless, as the head of the administration of one of Moldova's largest cities, you must have your own opinion. [Tonchuk] We already have autonomous regions--the self-proclaimed PMR and the Gagauz Republic.... [Starika] You have misunderstood me, Vladimir Stepanovich. I am referring to economic self-rule and the obvious benefits this would mean for an independent, indivisible, and sovereign Moldova and the people living in it. [Tonchuk] I am not afraid of defending my own point of view on any level when I am certain that I am right. As far as the creation of what you propose, a Balti economic zone or something similar, is concerned, I can only repeat that I believe this might be a good thing. As they say, however, we have to be certain that we are not leaping from the frying pan into the fire. We are not entitled to any more mistakes. Hasty decisions can cost too much. We have seen the result of the forced institution of the official state language and the threats of certification. We know that the pitiful state of our economy is a result of severed economic ties with the republics of the former USSR and the implacability of the Moldovan parliament and the different parties that blocked the ratification of the republic treaty on membership in the CIS economic union. History does not forgive mistakes. It does not allow us to ignore the laws of economics with impunity. It also does not tolerate implacability and contempt for the feelings of the laboring public. This is why we have to hear the voice of the people and tell the people the truth, even when it is disturbing. We can see farther from above, but details can be seen more distinctly from below. [Starika] Recently the city has made a great effort to become a political center as well as the economic and cultural center of northern Moldova.... [Tonchuk] It is true that political parties have been more active in our city. [Starika] As the head of the city government, what kind of relationship do you have with the parties, to which party do you belong, and which do you support? [Tonchuk] None of them, although several have offered me their hand and heart. They have promised me a place on their party tickets in the elections for the new parliament. It takes time to be active in politics, and I do not have the time. I hardly have enough time to keep up with municipal affairs. As for my relationship with the parties and their leaders, it is as it should be--detached and impartial. I support those who can do something good for the city and for Moldova as a whole. [Starika] What if the party that wins the election does not care for Tonchuk? [Tonchuk] Then I will start selling sneakers.... [Starika] But seriously? [Tonchuk] I am an engineer, and I am not afraid of resigning. Besides, people today are being judged on their ability instead of their political views. [Starika] It seems to me, however, that the upcoming power struggle will not bypass Balti and the head of its administration. [Tonchuk] Fights, arguments, and conflicts have always been part of our life. We have to be ready for them. It is difficult to imagine that they will disappear someday. We are instituting reform in a time of dramatic difficulties. This is just like making major repairs on a ship in a severe storm. I am certain, however, that the storm will soon be over and we will finish the repairs. The Moldovan state will be strong, capable, and just. It will have the respect of its citizens and, in turn, it will respect their dignity and beliefs. I have to repeat, however, that democracy cannot exist without a legal system. We will be able to attain our goals after we have reinforced the structures securing the observance of laws for the government and for all citizens.
