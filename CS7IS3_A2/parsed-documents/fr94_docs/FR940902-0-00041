FR940902-0-00041 FR940902-0-00010 Needs-based payments. Needs-based payments may be made in circumstances where fixed or scheduled supportive services fail to meet the needs of an individual to participate. For example, if a standard transportation reimbursement is $2 a day for participants, but a particular participant must spend $10 a day to commute to a training program, this need would be identified in the objective assessment and recorded in the ISS. Then a needs-based payment of $8 could be made to meet that participant's transportation needs. No additional documentation other than the transportation need identified in the objective assessment and recorded in the ISS is required for the initial $2. However, a specific notation of the additional need would be identified in the objective assessment and recorded in the ISS for the $8 needs-based payment. While this payment should be the amount ``necessary for participation,'' it also may be a scheduled or fixed amount (see the discussion of supportive services, below, for an additional discussion on ``scheduled'' or ``fixed amount''), as provided for in the SDA policy. Incentive and bonus payments. A number of comments were received requesting that the ability to use incentive and bonus payments not be limited to title II&hyph;C. Several commenters indicated they would prefer to use incentive and bonus payments rather than a wage or training payment to encourage participant performance. Since it is important to have tools to reward participant accomplishment, and incentive and bonus payments are not prohibited in those titles, the final rule is amended to clarify that incentive and bonus payments also may be made to participants under titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;B. Approximately equal numbers of comments were received requesting that ยง627.305(c) require that incentive and bonus payments be based upon attendance and performance as there were comments requesting attendance or performance. Several commenters thought that teaching life skills, such as good attendance, is an appropriate function of JTPA and should be rewardable. Because section 264(c)(2)(D) of the Act uses the word ``and'', the final regulation is revised to reflect the statutory language. Payments are to be reasonable and commensurate with the behavior being rewarded. The policy for such a payment is to be included in the SDA job training plan, which is approved by the Governor. The provisions of paragraph (c) are amended in the final rule by removing paragraphs (c) (2) through (4), to reflect the simplification of this topic. Training payments. To permit longer term participation, ยง627.305(d) provides for training payments to be paid for certain title II activities, such as work experience and limited internships. Section 627.305(e) provides for training payments for participation in other activities, such as classroom training, if the concurrent work-related activity is for more than 50 percent of the training time. Several commenters indicated that the work-based training requirement for adults in classroom training combined with work experience at interim final ยง627.305(e)(2) may not always be appropriate and was redundant with regard to the requirements of section 204(c)(1) of the Act on workplace context and integration. Therefore, the Department encourages SDA's to link classroom training to the work-based training activity, but the condition for making such payments to adults that the classroom training have a workplace context is removed. The term ``wage'' is replaced with ``training payment'' or ``training payment for combined activity'' to reflect the rare circumstances when a participant may not be in an employee-employer relationship as defined by the Internal Revenue Service, and also to make clear that the SDA may not be required to make a payment equal to the minimum wage. The minimum wage requirement still exists where participants are receiving wages as outlined in section 142 of the Act. The Department believes that payments in most work-based training activities should be equal to or exceed the minimum wage to better approximate a work setting. With the exclusion of on-the-job training and disaster relief employment, this change from ``wage'' to ``payment'' runs through the entire payments section. Supportive Services. Supportive services are often critical in serving those most in need. The use of supportive services is encouraged to enable the hard-to-serve population to participate in longer term interventions. The objective assessment and, under title II, the ISS, is the basis for determination of need for a particular supportive service. The major change in ยง627.310 is that further documentation of need is not required. Supportive services may be provided in-kind, through cash assistance, or by arrangement with another human service agency when necessary to enable an individual eligible for JTPA training, but who cannot afford to pay for such services, to participate in JTPA-assisted programs. Several commenters indicated that the administrative determination and documentation of participants' actual cost, for example, of lunch or transportation, was unduly burdensome. Given the generally narrow variance in cost for those services, most stated that a single dollar amount, or a schedule of dollar amounts, would be equally prudent. The Department agrees that such a method is acceptable and should be outlined in the supportive services policy of the SDA or SSG. To reduce its administrative burden, an SDA or SSG may set fixed levels of benefit for particular supportive services; e.g., an SDA or SSG may reimburse participants who incurred transportation expenses with identical payments, regardless of actual cost to an individual participant, even though some participants may receive a payment above their actual cost and others may be underpaid.
