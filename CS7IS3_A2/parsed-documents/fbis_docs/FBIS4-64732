The head of the PP list emphasized that "on various occasions, I, too, have called for the prime minister's resignation, since the grave situation currently ravaging Spain affects the credibility of the whole government and, especially, of its leader." After stressing that he does not question the prime minister's personal integrity, the former European commissioner insisted that "the resignation of Felipe Gonzalez is necessary." Asked about his former, rather reserved declarations, Abel Matutes emphasized that "my party requested the prime minister's appearance before the Congress of Deputies, and I deemed this appearance necessary on previous occasions, just like the assumption of political responsibilities." "At any rate," Matutes concluded, "the problem is that, whatever the prime minister will say at his appearance, I am afraid that it will be too late." M.L.G. Franco reports that in Bilbao Matutes added that "the corruption had damaged Spain's international reputation, traumatized the Spanish people, and would prevent or slow down our country's economic recovery."
