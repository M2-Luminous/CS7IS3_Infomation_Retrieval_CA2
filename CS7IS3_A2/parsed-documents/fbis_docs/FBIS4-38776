[passage omitted] Leonid Kravchuk stressed that peace on the peninsula can be achieved only by placing Crimea in the framework of Ukraine's Constitution and laws. He said that the Crimean leaders' references to the agreement between Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as an example are misplaced since they cite an agreement between a federation and its part which clearly defines the federation's supremacy. Leonid Kravchuk described the actions of the Crimean leadership as destructive to Ukraine's sovereignty. He said Ukraine's Government has always met Crimea halfway, which is obvious from the laws on the delimitation of powers between the state authorities of Ukraine and Crimea and on the open economic system in Crimea that enables the republic to function in a wide legal range. The Government of Ukraine also accepts Crimea's proposals of wide- ranging budgetary freedom. But Crimea is not living up to its budgetary obligations. Leonid Kravchuk also pointed out Crimea's tendency to attract specialists from Russia which reveals a disregard for local personnel and, in the president's view, violates the law of Ukraine on citizenship. [passage omitted] Leonid Kravchuk stressed that stabilization in Crimea will facilitate completion of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia on the division of the Black Sea Fleet, the deployment of the two fleets from separate bases, a definition of the status of the Crimea-based Russian fleet, payment of compensation for the ships which Ukraine is giving up as redundant, the division of the marine infantry, and so on. Leonid Kravchuk proposed a draft resolution to be passed by Ukraine's Supreme Council "On Implementation of the Ukrainian Supreme Council Resolution of 20 May 1994 on Suspension of the Law of the Crimean Republic on the Restoration of the Constitutional Foundations of the Crimean Republic." It proposes to form a Ukrainian constitutional court with decision-making powers, instruct the Ukrainian Supreme Council chairman to ask the Constitutional Court to decide whether the Crimean republic's law "On the Restoration of the Constitutional Foundations of the Crimean Republic" accords with the Constitution and laws of Ukraine, advise the Supreme Council of Crimea to reconsider bringing the autonomy's Constitution in line with the Constitution and laws of Ukraine, and establish that the Ukrainian Supreme Council resolution of 20 May 1994 remains valid pending a relevant judgement by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine. A total of 58 people's deputies of Ukraine signed up to speak in the debate. In their speeches, deputies are calling for dissolution of the Crimean Supreme Council and suspension of its activities (Ivan Zayets, Vasyl Kornelyuk, Andriy Mostytskyy) and the introduction of direct presidential rule. Some suggest forming a delegation of deputies to go to Crimea to study all aspects of the problem, and considering interstate agreements between Ukraine and Russia on the inadmissibility of infringement of territorial integrity (Ruslan Bodelan). The debate continues.
