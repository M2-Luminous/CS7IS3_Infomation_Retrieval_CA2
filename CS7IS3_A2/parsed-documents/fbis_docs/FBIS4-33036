Judge Gloria Arteaga dismissed the petition to release the military officers as inadmissible, because "important steps to confirm or dismiss the charges" filed by military justice against them are still pending. The Army placed General Jaime Rios, former Huallaga Front commander, and the other 11 military officers indicted with him at the disposal of civilian courts after it was discovered that they had covered up drug trafficking activities in the region. The officers involved, besides Gen. Rios, are: Lieutenant Colonels Luis Aparicio and Marco Zarate; Majors Marco Landor, Alejandro Mutante, and Eliseo Gonzalez; Captains Oswaldo Zapata, Carlos Hernandez, and Carlos Marin; Lieutenant Rolando Chiotty; and noncommissioned officers Roberto Zarate and Luis Gomez. In 1991 all of them were stationed in the Huallaga Valley, the largest cocaine paste production center in the world. The officers are accused of having charged a fee to permit drug traffickers to ship their cocaine paste to Colombia. The lawsuit says that the military charged a fee of $8,000 to single engine planes, and $15,000 to double engine planes, to permit them to land and take off in the zone to collect drugs. The money was collected by Uchiza's former Mayor Demetrio Diaz and Uchiza's former Governor Carlos Rodriguez. The two are currently fugitives. Drug traffickers provided medicines and food to the troops through a "civic committee" that coordinated "donations" made through Maj. Landor and Lt. Col. Zarate. These two are currently in jail under charges of trying to depose Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori in 1992.
