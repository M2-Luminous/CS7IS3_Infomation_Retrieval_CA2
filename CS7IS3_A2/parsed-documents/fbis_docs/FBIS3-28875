It is indeed a heartbreaking and intolerable national shame that our nation, which has lived in harmony with Tangun as the founder, sharing one blood and creating a 5,000-year history, has been suffering from national division by outside forces for a long time. Thus, in the fifth year of this decade [referring to 1994], the whole nation is accelerating the grand march of reunification more than any other time and is upholding the banner of great national unity. The Kim Yong-sam puppets, however, who put out the signboard of a civilian government, are rushing in the opposite direction along the road of treachery and antireunification. The rascals have viciously carried out reckless maneuvers for a northward aggressive war rupturing all North-South dialogue and have committed unforgivable serious crimes, such as trampling the North-South agreement, which was already adopted and about to come into effect. In the meantime, they are recklessly running wild to harm fellow countrymen by picking on us with the nonexistent nuclear issue with outside forces. This year, traitor Kim Yong-sam is still walking along the road of treachery and is in the fever of the maneuver for an aggressive war. The rascals, who have conducted northward aggressive war exercises every day in various parts of South Korea since the beginning of the new year, mobilized military forces of the puppet Capital Defense Command a few days ago and conducted war exercises day and night three times in areas adjacent to Mt. Umyon in Seoul, driving residents in fear and horror by firing guns and shells at random. Due to such maneuvers of aggressive war of the Kim Yong-sam puppets, North-South relations are being further aggravated and more and bigger obstacles are piling up on the road of reunification, which is the greatest long-cherished desire of the nation. Facing the severe situation, officers and men of the Armed Forces should think deeply when putting their hands on their breasts. On which road are we walking? What is the road following Kim Yong-sam, the flunkyist nation-seller second to none in the world and the most vicious antireunification element, that you are still walking along? The more you think, the more you cannot resist the shame of walking along the road of treachery following the traitor Kim yong-sam, who trampled the nation's dearly long-cherished desire of reunification and who is running wild to harm fellow countrymen with a mouthful of blood. All people want to spend their youth, the most precious time of life, valuably. The glory of youth ultimately lies in the devotion to the country and the nation. Officers and men of the Armed Forces: The whole nation has come to vigorously advance along the grand march of reunification in the nineties. As young men born with the blood of the Korean nation, you should resolutely part from the Kim Yong-sam puppets and boldly come out to actively contribute to the cause of national reunification. At present, there is no greater devotion to the country and the people than for Koreans to sacrifice themselves for national reunification. When officers and men of the Armed Forces vigorously walk in step with the nation's strong grand march of reunification, their value of life will shine on and they will live in endless happiness even after the reunification, amid the nation's respect and love being highly appraised as the ones who contributed to the feat of reunification. When officers and men of the Armed Forces become deeply conscious of the national duty they are entrusted with and walk along the road of devotion to the country and the people with firm unity under the banner of the great national unity, the greatest long-cherished national desire of the fatherland reunification will thereby be expedited.
