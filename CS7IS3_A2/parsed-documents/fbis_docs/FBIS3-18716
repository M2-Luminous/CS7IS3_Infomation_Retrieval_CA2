The campaign, which peaked in a TV debate with President Francois Mitterrand, made a national figure of the former social minister. In public opinion polls a year after the referendum, 54 percent of the French people declared themselves in favor of the Seguin line against Maastricht. Born in Tunis, Seguin, whose father had died in action in 1944 as a volunteer in de Gaulle's army, worked on behalf of an open, leftist Gaullism. Because of his protectionist tendencies, the mayor of Epinal, whom LE MONDE characterized as "le colosse," was reproached for being a nationalist and populist. Following the election victory of the right wing in March 1993, the popular, self-confident nonconformist took on the office of president of the parliament instead of heading up a ministry. From this politically neutral base, Seguin, 50, could become a compromise candidate of the right wing for the presidential elections in 1995--in the event that the top candidates, Jacques Chirac and Edouard Belladur, block one another. [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, when you were six years old, you accepted a medal on behalf of your father, who had been killed by the Germans in France in 1944. Have your pain and memories of this time shaped your attitude toward the Germans? [Seguin] My father died in a war. I have never felt ill will toward the Germans. Quite to the contrary: The memory was a special incentive for me to work for reconciliation and cooperation. [DER SPIEGEL] The usual harmony between Bonn and Paris has given way to a kind of disenchantment of late. Is the German-French relationship damaged? [Seguin] There have always been differences of opinion and difficult periods. But I don't see any reason for alarm just now. Our special relationship arose during the Cold War. Thus we have to put it on a new basis now. Germany is no longer in the position it was in during the sixties, and France is beset by moral doubts that have thrown it into an identity crisis. [DER SPIEGEL] Both states suspect one another of national egoism. The Germans accuse the French of selfishness and protectionism. The French are suspicious that the Germans have been seized once again by the drive to the east. Do the two partners still have a common concept of Europe? [Seguin] The end of the Cold War changed the old roles. Many of the French fear a return of German nationalism. Paradoxically, the most ardent French proponents of the Maastricht Treaty used the argument that Germany had to be contained. We French are displeased by the occasional German reproach that we have a Grande Nation complex. We stand before a turning point of history. There is thus indecision in the two countries concerning the future path. But this onset of insecurity is not dramatic. [DER SPIEGEL] The opposition by President Francois Mitterrand to German unification perplexed, even shocked many Germans. Were Mitterrand's delaying tactics a mistake? [Seguin] Yes, and we have had to pay for that. I, too, was very shocked that in the symbol-laden moment of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the reaction of the French head of state was to first pay a visit, during a curious tour, to those who in East Berlin wanted to maintain the GDR, and then in Kiev to induce Gorbachov to join an alliance of opponents to German unity. [DER SPIEGEL] Doesn't that show that France had gotten to like the division of Germany? [Seguin] We should have shared the joy of the Germans, and that was also the spontaneous feeling of many French citizens when they saw what was taking place on the Wall in November 1989. On the other hand, the Germans probably wouldn't have completed the unification so hastily, so precipitately, if they hadn't felt this antipathy, if not to say hostility, on the part of their most important European partner. They believed they had to move quickly to create irrevocable facts. [DER SPIEGEL] In any case, Mitterrand did not try--as Margaret Thatcher later accused him in her memoirs--to block German unity. Didn't his ambivalent behavior nevertheless create lasting mistrust? [Seguin] I hope not, but in the aftermath our concepts of the makeup of Europe in particular have changed. From that point on, we urged acceleration of the establishment of the European Union. In this way we wanted to counteract all the dangers that could arise from German unification. This haste was our second mistake. [DER SPIEGEL] But Chancellor Kohl participated in this as well. Maastricht was to be the compensation, the tranquilizer pill, for German unity. [Seguin] The way things were handled didn't do a service for the development of Europe. The reason may have been that the responsible politicians belong to generations that were marked by history. Only this can explain the all too famous remark by Francois Mauriac: "I love Germany so much that I am happy there are two of them." [DER SPIEGEL] How long will this kind of thinking last? [Seguin] It no longer exists in my generation. Even if my struggle against the Maastricht Treaty was not understood correctly in Germany at the outset--I resisted the idea of imbedding Germany in Europe, because that is a curious way of keeping up friendly relations. The notion that the European Union was an instrument for containing Germany was publicly espoused even by such serious-minded politicians as the former Socialist prime minister, Michel Rocard. [DER SPIEGEL] Will the Paris-Bonn axis hold, or does it need new bearings--less sentimentality, a greater convergence of interests? [Seguin] We have to renew it without abandoning the emotional ingredient. It is reassuring that for a long time relations, beyond the level of government, have become a matter of the peoples.... [DER SPIEGEL] ...despite the occasionally flickering fear of the French people that the old German demons could be resurrected? [Seguin] As far as right-wing extremism in general is concerned, the French people have no lessons to teach the Germans. [DER SPIEGEL] As the leader of the Maastricht opponents, who barely lost the European referendum in September 1992, you are living in a Europe that is not the way you wanted it. Is your struggle for a different Europe continuing? [Seguin] I lost in the referendum, but I ask myself whether this defeat was not a victory in many respects. I basically feel that one could have concluded the Maastricht Treaty in its present form even in the days before Leonid Brezhnev.... [DER SPIEGEL] ...and Erich Honecker? [Seguin] Yes, and without changing a single line of the treaty text. If we first limited Europe to six, then nine, then 12 partners, we did so because the Iron Curtain divided the continent. If Europe's founding fathers--Adenauer, de Gaulle, Monnet, De Gasperi, and the others--had lived under present-day conditions, they would not have started out with six, but would have considered a quite different number. [DER SPIEGEL] So, the European Union should expand to the East? [Seguin] Definitely. I also think that prosperity in the West will depend on how much we help the East in its development. I dream of a kind of West European Marshall Plan for East Europe.... [DER SPIEGEL] ...for the time being, this will probably remain just a dream. The European Union would certainly be taking on too much if it integrated the East European countries precipitately. The Brussels consensus is: intensify instead of enlarge. [Seguin] The one thing is not incompatible with the other. The European Community originally set itself three goals: First, to create peace between the arch enemies; second, to contribute to prosperity; third, to influence the world together. Whoever wanted to join had to have a democratic government. Thus, there were only six partners at the outset, because Greece, Spain, and Portugal were not democracies, and Britain did not want to subscribe to the common goals. When these countries were later accepted, economic criteria hardly played a role. Otherwise, Greece would never have been allowed to join. [DER SPIEGEL] And Spain and Portugal wouldn't have been accepted either. Nevertheless, Europe could not now afford financially to expand to include the Eastern countries. It would have to forget the desired economic and currency union. [Seguin] Naturally, we cannot bring everything about overnight. We would not be doing the Eastern countries any favors in doing so. First we have to help them to organize economically, but also guarantee that they will become members over the long term, even if that takes three or four decades. [DER SPIEGEL] That sounds different. And what place are you reserving for Russia in your Europe? [Seguin] What to do with Russia is a problem as old as Europe, and it can be summarized in one question: Is Russia really European? I think that is an open question for the time being. But in any case we have to help Russia to become a part of Europe. A phenomenon like Shironovsky was made possible because Europe does not have a decisive foreign policy. [DER SPIEGEL] The European Union has to define its position not only toward Russia but toward America as well. Can the Atlantic alliance survive in its present form? [Seguin] I think NATO has outlived its usefulness. America's disengagement has already begun. The number of U.S. troops stationed in Europe will be reduced to around 100,000. In the long run, public opinion in America will demand that these troops be brought home and that Europe be left to its own devices. Europe has to become grown up enough to take care of its own security, in friendship and alliance with the United States. [DER SPIEGEL] Would France be prepared to make its nuclear power--a symbol of its greatness and independence--a part of a joint European defense policy? [Seguin] France has to rethink its military policy. But France's nuclear power must never be jeopardized. Therefore, I belong to those who call for the resumption of our nuclear testing. [DER SPIEGEL] Mitterrand allowed the tests to be suspended in April 1992--a bow to the pacifists? [Seguin] Vicious tongues maintain he ordered that because he thought he could win the political support of the environmentalists. Besides, the president apparently believes our nuclear weapons are technically on a high enough level--which many experts challenge. [DER SPIEGEL] But this nuclear power is to remain exclusively under national command? [Seguin] We should discuss with our European partners which forms of consultation and cooperation can be used in the event of operational engagement, and how the force de frappe can be reconciled with a common foreign and security policy. [DER SPIEGEL] Like other European countries, France is experiencing a crisis of direction--anxiety over unemployment, waves of immigration and a rising crime rate, and disaffection from politics. Does the Socialist Mitterrand have to first step down--his term in office ends in 1995--before the right wing governing together with him can introduce a real change? [Seguin] Yes. That is not possible before he does so. Our political system functions in such a way that only presidential elections can decide the really big questions of the nation. They decide policy for the next seven years--for the duration of the presidential mandate. We are thus still living within the framework set by the election of Mitterrand in 1988. Despite the victory of the right wing in the parliamentary elections last March, the Balladur government is only a transitional government.... [DER SPIEGEL] ...that therefore cannot deal with the crisis? [Seguin] We are experiencing a moral crisis, a cultural crisis, an identity crisis. We are seeking our role, our future, France's road. We can only hope that the 1995 presidential elections will provide the impetus to find answers, to set a new course. [DER SPIEGEL] First-time voters, who are 18 or 20 years old, cannot remember any president other than Mitterrand. Doesn't a seven-year mandate, which can also be renewed, have to lead to political paralysis? [Seguin] If we shorten the seven-year period, we necessarily end up with a regular presidential system of the American kind, with the simultaneous election of the president and the parliament. But our constitution was designed along parliamentary, not presidential lines. I don't believe that shortening the term in office to four or five years would produce any advantages. [DER SPIEGEL] The president is the supreme commander. He can remove the prime minister, dissolve parliament, influence day-to-day policy of the government. Isn't that too much power? [Seguin] The problem lies less in the institutions of the Fifth Republic than in its undesirable developments. The government that had the greatest room for maneuver in France after the war was paradoxically the first cabinet of Charles de Gaulle with Michel Debre as prime minister, although the general was indeed an overpowering personality. But he concerned himself only with diplomacy and the Army--at the time there was also the war in Algeria. Everything else, all domestic policy, he left to the government. He did not get involved in the work of the government. [DER SPIEGEL] That means that Mitterrand keeps a tighter rein on the country than de Gaulle did in his day? [Seguin] From de Gaulle to Georges Pompidou and Valery Giscard d'Estaing to Mitterrand, the presidency has taken on increasingly monarchic characteristics. It would be desirable if things returned to their original condition. [DER SPIEGEL] Is Gaullism a doctrine with which France can proceed into the 21st century? [Seguin] When I look at people of my generation who caused the turmoil of May 1968--Maoists, Socialists, Communists, and what not--I consider myself very lucky that I followed the ideas of de Gaulle, that I never fought for ideas. that lay outside the bounds of reality. The general foresaw what is taking place in Europe today. [DER SPIEGEL] De Gaulle gathered left-wing and right-wing people around him. In the meantime, the conservatives have grabbed Gaullism for themselves. How do you view the general's legacy today? [Seguin] Just as the principles of the constitution have gradually shifted, Gaullism, too, has shifted to the right. That is regrettable because it isn't consistent with the essence of Gaullism. Gaullism stands for a certain commitment to the nation--not for an egoistic, secluded, anxious, and thus outwardly aggressive nation, but for a nation as the fundamental bulwark of democracy and the foundation of a strong feeling of community. Gaullism is the victory over the conflict between left and right in the name of national solidarity. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you consider yourself a pure Gaullist? [Seguin] I hope I am. In any case, people say I am when they want to speak ill of me. [DER SPIEGEL] The Gaullists are again in the majority in the government, but its base is largely no longer reflected in the policies of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. Why is Balladur nevertheless so popular? [Seguin] There is doubtless a contradiction between the personal popularity of Balladur and the relative unpopularity of the government's policies. He is the opposite of the Socialists who ruled before him. He speaks sensibly and makes no empty promises, and the people's weariness with politics works in his favor. Balladur embodies values in which the French seek refuge in their moral crisis. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you know who your candidate will be for the presidential election in 1995? [Seguin] My, what an indiscreet question! I will support the candidate who is most closely associated with my ideas. [DER SPIEGEL] That would be you.... [Seguin] ...You can insert three dots at this point. [DER SPIEGEL] If you could draw a picture of the ideal president for the future France, what would be his most important characteristics? [Seguin] Such a picture could resemble someone you think you recognize. He will surely be a Gaullist. [DER SPIEGEL] And what do you expect of him? [Seguin] Even if the expression doesn't seem happily chosen, owing to the historical example, I hope he introduces a real cultural revolution in France that will attack a whole series of problems--from European policy to combating unemployment to education. We have a lot to do if we are to preserve and develop our model of civilization.
