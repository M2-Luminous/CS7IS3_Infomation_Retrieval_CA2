RP93&hyph;56&hyph;005, RP93&hyph;86&hyph;004 and RP93&hyph;139&hyph;004] Transwestern Pipeline Co., Notice of Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff March 18, 1994. Take notice that on March 16, 1994, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern), tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets, with a proposed effective date of April 1, 1994: 9th Revised Sheet No. 87 8th Revised Sheet No. 88 17th Revised Sheet No. 89 6th Revised Sheet No. 89A On June 9, 1993, as amended July 16, 1993, Transwestern filed tariff sheets in which it sought to modify its take-or-pay, buy-out and buy-down mechanism (``Transition Cost Recovery'' or ``TCR'' mechanism) in order to recover certain take-or-pay, buy-out, buy-down, and contract reformation costs. On July 30, 1993, the Commission accepted and suspended the filings, subject to conditions. On August 30, 1993, in Docket Nos. RP93&hyph;56&hyph;002, RP93&hyph;86&hyph;002, RP93&hyph;139&hyph;002, the California Public Utilities Commission and Southern California Gas Company filed a joint request for rehearing of the July 30 order requesting that the Commission remove the litigation exception provision from Transwestern's tariff prospectively. In its order on rehearing on March 1, 1994, the Commission found that the litigation exception language should not apply to future filings and ordered it removed. Transwestern states that the purpose of this filing is to file tariff sheets to comply with such order. Transwestern also states that in addition to changes necessitated by removing litigation exception language, 17th Revised Sheet No. 89 is being submitted in order to correct an error made on 16th Revised Sheet No. 89 in which the amount for TCR No. 13 was inadvertently changed to an incorrect amount. The correct amount, $20,100,000, was approved by the Commission in Docket No. RP93&hyph;139 on 15th Revised Sheet No. 89. Transwestern states that copies of the filing were served on its gas utility customers, interested state commissions, and all parties to this proceeding. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC, 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before March 25, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
