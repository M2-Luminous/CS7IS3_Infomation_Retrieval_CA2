Approached for comment the sources however stressed that the proposals were still being studied and that comment was premature. The package seemed to be a reformulation of the initial proposals which had led to the deadlock in trilateral talks, they said. "We cannot understand why it is so difficult to insert a clause that there `shall' be a volkstaat [homeland]. It would be difficult to sell a vague concept or a promise to our constituents in this volatile political climate." This created the impression that the government and the ANC were not totally serious, they said.
