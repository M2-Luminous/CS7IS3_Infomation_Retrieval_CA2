In reality, however, in the opinion of the heads of the Russian Federal Migration Service (FMS), there were around 1.5 million of them at that time. In November 1993, Tatyana Regent, chief of the FMS, reported at a session of the Presidium of the Russian Federation Council of Ministers that in 1993 Russia received around 2 million forced resettlers and economic migrants. Official sources estimate the number of refugees and migrants in Russia to be between 1.7 million and 2 million. That figure includes not only those who registered their status as a refugee, but also individuals who did not register after arriving from other independent countries. The share of non-Russian ethnic groups among the total number of immigrants in Russia, according to calculations by the experts, amounts to 30 to 45 percent. Refugees and Forced Resettlers in Russia The most active and large-scale migration of national, principally Russian-speaking, minorities, and frequently indigenous residents, is presently observed as coming mainly from Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Tajikistan, and Moldova. In 1992-1993, for example, some 800,000 persons left Georgia, a third of whom are Georgians. As many as 778,500 individuals departed Tajikistan, according to incomplete data. The stream of migrants from Latvia, Estonia, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan is also quite significant. All those who have that right and apply to local organs of the migration service are subject to registration as refugees. The laws of the Russian Federation on refugees and on forced resettlers, adopted on 19 February 1993, provide the following formal-legal definitions of the corresponding categories of people. A refugee is any individual who has entered or plans to enter the territory of the Russian Federation who does not hold citizenship of the Russian Federation, and who was compelled to leave or has the intention of leaving the place of his permanent residence on the territory of another country as the result of violence committed against him or because of persecution in other forms, or because of a real threat of being subjected to violence or other persecution because of race or nationality, religion, or language, or affiliation with a certain social group or because of political convictions. An individual who has committed a crime against peace, humanity, or some other heinous premeditated crime cannot be recognized as a refugee. A forced resettler is a citizen of the Russian Federation who was forced to leave or has the intention of leaving the place of his permanent residence on the territory of another country or on the territory of the Russian Federation because of violence or persecution in other forms against himself or members of his family or because of a real threat of being subjected to persecution due to racial or national affiliation, religious beliefs, language, or membership in a certain social group or because of political convictions causing hostile campaigns directed against individuals or groups of individuals, massive violations of public order or other circumstances that substantially infringe on the rights of the individual. An individual not holding citizenship of the Russian Federation who left the place of his permanent residence on the territory of the Russian Federation for reasons listed in the first part of the article on resettlers may also be recognized as a forced resettler. A citizen of the former USSR, who resides on the territory of a republic that was a part of the former USSR, who arrived in the Russian Federation under circumstances indicated in the first part of this article and who acquired the citizenship of the Russian Federation while on the territory of the Russian Federation may be recognized as a forced resettler. An individual who has committed a crime against peace and humanity, or is guilty of some other heinous premeditated crime cannot be recognized as a forced resettler. (See the law of the Russian Federation on refugees and the law of the Russian Federation on forced resettlers in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, 1993, No 54, 20 March, p 4). In accordance with these criteria, the status of a refugee is currently granted to those arriving in Russia primarily from Tajikistan, Moldova, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, that is, from hot spots where armed clashes occur. In addition, at present the status of a refugee may be obtained by individuals arriving from Latvia and Estonia, where they are becoming individuals without citizenship. They have now been joined by refugees from Ingushetia and North Ossetia who have left places of residence in the Prigorodniy Rayon. Refugees from Chechnya and Dagestan are also arriving in southern and central regions of Russia. Individuals arriving from other regions, as a rule, receive the status of forced resettlers. In Moscow and its environs, as well as in St. Petersburg, only those are now being officially registered who have relatives there agreeing to register the refugees to their housing area. The new federal migration program has now been elaborated together with drafts of supplements and changes pertaining to laws on refugees and on forced resettlers which refine and concretize criteria used to determine their status. The proposals have been submitted to the Federal Assembly. Until now, registration was not carried out at the time that the border of the Russian Federation was crossed, which was explained to a great degree by a lack of facilities on the border. An individual intending to obtain the status of a refugee or a forced resettler must personally apply to the local organ of the migration service immediately upon arrival on the territory of the Russian Federation. A refugee may not be forcibly returned to the country which he left. The migration service must examine the application within three days and issue the applicant an appropriate document. After receiving the document determining his status, a migrant acquires the same political and social rights as a Russian citizen and is eligible to receive assistance from state structures (grants, credit for housing construction, medical and employment services) as well as various privileges (interest-free long-term credit). A presidential decree on measures for conduct of migration control was signed on 16 December 1993, in accordance with which it is planned to conduct the registration of migrants at the time they cross the borders of Russia, in airports and at railway stations. Preparations are currently under way to implement that decree. The opinion of experts on the number of migrants in all categories (refugees, forced resettlers, economic migrants) in Russia differ from official and unofficial figures of the migration service. In the view of some of them, at the present time this figure is around 4 to 5 million persons. The volume of illegal migration is estimated at more than 500,000 persons per month. According to predictions by specialists, a minimum of 2 million to 3 million persons, and a maximum of 4 to 6 million may arrive in 1994 on the territory of Russia from the near abroad and several autonomous republics of the Russian Federation (North Caucasus) (some experts predict 10 million at the minimum), along with over 100,000 coming from the far abroad. Russians as a National Minority The most unfavorable living conditions for Russian national minorities has developed in the region including Azerbaijan, Georgia, the republics of Central Asia, and in Russia--Dagestan and Chechnya. These regions account for up to 80 percent of all Russian emigration. From one-third to a half of the almost 800,000 former local Russian residents have already departed the most unstable Muslim republics of the former USSR--Tajikistan and Azerbaijan. In the past four years (1990-1993), for instance, the Russian-speaking population of Tajikistan actually shrank by one-half: Of the almost 390,000 Russians (according to the 1989 census) fewer than 200,000 remain. Tajikistan, where practically 100 percent of the remaining Russian residents intend to emigrate; Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan, where 60 percent of the nonindigenous residents are ready to emigrate; Armenia, where 70 percent of the population in the republic intends to emigrate outside the country, mainly to Russia and the United States; Latvia and Estonia, where 80 percent of the Russian-speaking population hold a negative view of the state of interethnic relations and are ready to emigrate; all have the greatest emigration potential for Russia at the present time. As indicated above, the listed countries should also include Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Moldova, where the number of those wishing to emigrate, both Russians and indigenous residents, is steadily growing. The Migrational Balance of the CIS At present, it is possible to speak about the substantive change in the situation in the migrational balance of the former Union republics. Beginning in 1993, immigration into Russia has increasingly exceeded emigration from it. For instance, by comparison with 1991, the number of people entering Latvia from Russia and other former Union republics for permanent residence decreased in 1993 by a factor of 2.7, from 12,600 to 4,600, whereas the number of those departing Latvia during that period increased by a factor of 2.2--from 23,900 to 51,800. In the opinion of some experts, at the present time the correlation between immigrants and emigrants in the migrational balance of Russia with other former Union republics may be expressed as a ratio of 8:2. Departures from Russia for Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Moldova, and Tajikistan have practically ceased. There was a considerable drop in departures to Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. At the present time, fewer people depart for Russia than enter only in Ukraine and Belarus. In the opinion of the experts, emigration and immigration streams will become equal in Lithuania in 1994. The return of Estonians to Estonia, primarily from Russia, as well as from Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Abkhazia continues at a rate of approximately 600 persons a year. At the present time, all of the former Union republics are experiencing severe economic difficulties. That circumstance significantly diminishes the streams of economic migration, which always existed in the former Soviet Union, and the primary role is acquired by refugees and forced resettlers for social, national, and political motives. During 1990-1993, the share of Russian residents in Kazakhstan decreased from 40.8 percent to 36.4 percent. This datum is evidence that in the superficially peaceful Kazakhstan there are growing social and political tensions. Causes and Consequences of the Influx of Refugees and Resettlers Immigrants who left for Russia from Georgia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, and Tajikistan almost all indicated the threat of physical violence as their principal motive for coming to Russia. The same reason was indicated by around 50 percent of immigrants who left Central Asia. Migrants from the Baltic countries point to problems with acquisition of citizenship (in Latvia and Estonia) and concurrent discrimination in education, at the place of employment, in social security, and so on. Those leaving Central Asia also speak of day-to-day crime against the nonindigenous population, and add the Islamization of the way of life to the listed reasons. Adoption of new laws on citizenship in a number of countries on the territory of the former USSR, as a rule, stimulates emigration among the Russian population. Eighty percent of the Russian population in Estonia and Latvia, for instance, wish to leave those countries specifically because of the new citizenship laws adopted there. Some 40,000 Russian-speaking residents of the Estonian city of Narva, or two-thirds of all of its residents, want to leave for that reason. Rejection of a regulation on the possibility of dual citizenship is prompting the exit of Russians from Kazakhstan. At the same time, recognition of dual citizenship in Turkmenistan diminished emigration of the nonindigenous population out of that republic. The massive influx of refugees into individual regions (for instance, in the south of Russia) throws virtually all of the social and economic infrastructures and almost all of the ancillary support systems out of balance. The food problem is acutely exacerbated, and the social security system cannot withstand the growing load. The situation in the sphere of consumption is deteriorating. There is an increase in crime. The situation with housing becomes much more difficult, and there is a catastrophic shortage of it not only for local residents (in Russia 10 million people are on the waiting list for state housing), but also for hundreds of thousands of military personnel returning to Russia from the near and far abroad, to say nothing of refugees. The state of affairs on the employment market is growing increasingly more tense. Possibilities for finding work are shrinking rapidly. All this compels one to view growing immigration as a potentially explosive issue. In Kuban, for instance, the number of migrants already comprises 15 percent of the kray population and beyond 15 percent, according to the theory of threshold figures, the normal and controllable course of events ends. The situation is further aggravated by the fact that the government of the Russian Federation is unable to offer migrants really effective assistance. A total of 43 billion rubles [R] were appropriated for the Russian FMS for 1994, when the Moscow migration service alone needs R56 billion. For minimal realization of laws on refugees and on forced resettlers, R165 billion is needed, in January 1993 prices, while full realization of these laws in the same prices requires R240 billion.
