It is thought that major commodities to be reserved throughout the year will include grain, vegetable oil, pork, sugar, chemical fertilizer, insecticides, coal for civilian use, clothing material, and cotton. In case fluctuations in market supply occur in the future, the government will sell reserved commodities to curb price rises. The Chongqing City government has put aside 10 million yuan as a risk fund for grain and 7 million yuan as a risk fund for nonstaple foods. These funds will be used to make up for price differences and other costs to curb market prices of grain and edible oils. During slack seasons, major festivals, and at times when market prices fluctuate greatly, the funds will also be used to organize supplies and to make up for price differences and other costs of curbing market prices.
