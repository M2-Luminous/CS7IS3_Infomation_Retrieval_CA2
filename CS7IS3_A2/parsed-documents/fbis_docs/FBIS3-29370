Jayakumar at the Foreign Ministry this morning, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said that his new Singapore counterpart came to see him just to get acquainted and their discussion touched on general issues. Asked about the Taiwanese president's recent visit to Thailand, the foreign minister said he had earlier pointed out that the visit was a personal affair. There was no official reception held for Li. He does not believe that the visit will have any impact on relations between Thailand and the PRC. However, the foreign minister said that Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen will stop in Thailand on 27 February and he will take this opportunity to explain to him about the Taiwanese president's visit to Thailand so that China will understand Thailand's position. Asked about the report on the extended detention of Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the foreign minister said he knows nothing about this matter, adding that the permission granted to a U.S. democratic congressman to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi is a good sign because it indicates that the Burmese Government has become more open in dealing with all problems. However, he noted that the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi is an internal affair of Burma. The foreign minister anticipated that Burma's political situation will improve since the world is paying much attention to it and the Burmese leaders themselves are aware of this fact.
