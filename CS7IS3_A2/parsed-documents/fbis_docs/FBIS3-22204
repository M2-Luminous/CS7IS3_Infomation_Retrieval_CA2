The inspection visited 14,500 Russian enterprises using nuclear materials or radioactive substances. The extreme measure of enterprise halt was used 78 times, Inspection Chairman Yuriy Vishnevskiy told a news conference here today. As for nine nuclear power plants with 29 power units, there were no accidents related to melting of the reactor active zone and discharge of considerable amount of radioactive substances into the atmosphere, same as big fires with the exception of several spontaneous fires and smoking up. A total of 38 percent of accidents at nuclear power plants happened through the fault of personnel, a considerable amount of violations is related to malfunction of equipment and system elements. A major reason for nuclear safety violations is the lack of money. The nuclear branch was the only Russian one that preserved its output in 1993, but it fails to receive payment for electricity consumption. In the words of Vishnevskiy, the Russian Ministry of Finance did not allocate a single ruble in 1993 to raise safety of nuclear power plants. The 1994 planned allocations of 114 billion rubles will hardly be received as well. Another problem is the lack of corresponding legislation. Russia is the world's only state that does not have laws on the use of nuclear energy and state policy on treatment of radioactive waste. Draft documents were kept by the former Supreme Soviet for 18 months, but no decision were taken. Due to the absence of legislative acts, the inspectors cannot invoke efficient economic sanctions against violators of nuclear safety. Today's fine for violation of nuclear safety rules by an individual is 100 rubles (six cents).
