(IDO) has reached a broad agreement with Motorola Inc. of the United States over Motorola's demand for more access to the Japanese mobile telephone market, industrial sources said Wednesday. Motorola Vice President Arnold Brenner arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday to finalize negotiations. IDO said it hopes to straighten out differences over the issue by the end of this week. The accord would help avoid U.S. trade retaliation against Japan. The U.S. Trade Representative Office has set March 17 as the deadline for an announcement on sanctions over trade issues. IDO and Motorola were near agreement over the timing of an expansion of a network of Motorola-formula car phone relay stations and an allocation of radio frequencies, IDO officials said. They said Motorola has agreed to IDO's offer to increase the number of relay stations, which will total 190 at the end of June, by an additional 159 stations. But the officials said Motorola demanded that the network expansion be completed within the next one and a half years, while IDO contends that the project will take more than two years. IDO was also resisting Motorola's demand that part of the frequencies allotted for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) formula transmission be transferred to its service in Japan on the ground of high costs, the officials said. They said the frequency switch to the Motorola formula is almost impossible because it requires remodeling all NTT-formula relay stations, which would require an investment of tens of billions of yen. Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's top automaker and a major investor in IDO, is set to help finance the project by increasing IDO's capital through a new share issue, they said.
