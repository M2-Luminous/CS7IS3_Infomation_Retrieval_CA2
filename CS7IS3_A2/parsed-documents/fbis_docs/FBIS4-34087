FBIS4-34087 "drlat115bb_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-115 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS Chilean Foreign Minister Addresses OAS Assembly Chilean Foreign Minister Addresses OAS Assembly PY1306223694 Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish 7 Jun 94 pp C1, C8 PY1306223694 Santiago EL MERCURIO Spanish BFN [Report by ``special correspondent'' Elia Semeone from Belem, Brazil] [Text] On 6 June, Chile urged the Inter-American community to focus on honesty on the grounds that corruption is a threat to the democratic governments that, for the first time in history, are installed in most countries of the hemisphere. Chile also emphasized that economic development and social well-being must go hand in hand, and that free trade should be promoted through ever-broadening integration mechanisms. Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa made these proposals on 6 June during his address before the OAS General Assembly. The issue of honesty and its effects on growth and the shoring-up of democracy is a new concept within the framework of the OAS, a concept that Chile decided to include in the organization's agenda this year. Figueroa reiterated Chile's commitment to the Americas and said that from its viewpoint any common effort to strengthen democracy in the hemisphere is very important. He expressed Chile's utmost interest in the struggle against extreme poverty because severe social differences in American countries pave the way for political instability, which usually weakens democracy and jeopardizes peace in the hemisphere. Figueroa said: "We must realize these urgent needs and the subtle threats against democracy in our countries." He said it is necessary to modernize the state, which implies turning it into an effective and capable manager by staffing it with trained, honest, and public service-oriented people. Figueroa emphasized that honesty must be addressed as part of this quest for the modernization of the state. He quoted Chilean President Eduardo Frei's address to Congress on 21 May: "The lack of public ethics is the result of an uncontrolled exercise of power, and ambiguous responsibilities... Public ethics affect private business and public administration alike." The foreign minister stated that society's commitment to democracy will undoubtedly be strengthened if administrations remain honest, if excessive centralization of power and decisionmaking is abolished, and if the required oversight mechanisms are established. Among the issues Chile considers in need of priority attention from the OAS, Figueroa mentioned the development of American people within the framework of free trade, fairness, and growing integration. He said the recent amendments to the OAS Charter -- which allow the organization, among other things, to suspend members for breaches of democratic order -- show once again that democracy, development, and peace are closely related. Figueroa stressed: "Our countries must have development formulas that ensure fairness. Our economic policies must seek sustained growth as a way to guarantee the well-being of all social strata." He added that this means all countries of the region must be able to freely market their products. He praised the Marrakech agreements on free trade, and urged all American governments to seek out agile and effective formulas for economic integration. Figueroa reaffirmed that Chile will pursue economic cooperation and free trade agreements with other American countries, and emphasized his government's decision to seek rapprochement with the Common Market of the South. He said: "Regional trade freedom is Chile's topmost priority and that is what we work hardest for. We would like to see every country in the continent share our desire to implement a policy of open regionalism which -- if followed by practical agreements -- will fuel our economies and allow us to improve the standards of living of our people." Figueroa said the region must take concrete steps toward a realistic integration process that is open to the world economy. Figueroa mentioned the hemispheric summit that U.S. President Bill Clinton has called, saying that Chile warmly supports it. Chile's foreign minister said: "We are convinced that it is a worthwhile opportunity to thoroughly study burning regional issues such as free trade, economic cooperation, and the development of our countries. We hope this summit will yield concrete results and a clear-cut and feasible plan of action." He conveyed Chile's satisfaction over the OAS acknowledgement that social issues must be considered in the search to maintain peace. Figueroa recalled that the World Summit on Social Development will take place next year in response to Chile's proposal to the United Nations. The Chilean foreign minister addressed the significance of cooperation, protection of the environment, and full respect for human rights. He underscored the need to maintain peace and security within a more global concept of the latter, by promoting measures to enhance trust. Figueroa said conditions for improving regional security have improved in recent years. Chile is convinced that among all the continents, the Americas probably have the best chance of success. He emphasized the steps Chile has taken in this direction, like the signing of the Mendoza Commitment to ban chemical and biological weapons, which Argentina and Brazil have also signed. He mentioned Chile's compliance with all obligations of the Tlatelolco Treaty which bans nuclear weapons from Latin America. Figueroa outlined Chile's efforts in the quest for a new system capable of eliminating chemical weapons throughout the world. He said: "Chile is convinced that efforts in this direction must be made prudently, gradually, and realistically by taking successive steps rather than by embarking on overly broad and pretentious schemes which turn out to be unfeasible in the long run." Figueroa stated that current conditions are favorable for redesigning hemispheric security. On the one hand this process should make hemispheric security a more global concept, while at the same time it should encourage all kinds of measures -- be they political, diplomatic, military, educational, or cultural -- to stimulate trust and security. The foreign minister thanked Joao Clemente Baena Soares for his contribution to the OAS as its secretary general for 10 years, and conveyed Chile's support for the incoming OAS secretary general, current Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, who will assume that position in August.
