Likewise at this session more than 180 deputies condemned the siege of Gorazde by the Serbian criminals and the deathly silence of the UN and some Western nations in the face of these crimes. We direct the attention of our esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings. Farjollah Afrazideh, Deputy From Noshahr and Chalus The Majles should spend half its time supervising the implementation of laws. The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was Afrazideh, deputy from Noshahr and Chalus. [Passages omitted on criticism of UN and Russian role in Bosnia.] Afrazideh discussed the public's liking for the president of the republic and the nation's reconstruction after the war and the earthquake, which is not such an easy task. He said: In these conditions of economic adjustment, only the capable hand of the president of the republic can put the country in order. The general public knows that inflation and high prices are not just in countries, but throughout the world. He then said: One thing which must not be forgotten, however, is that there is no correspondence between incomes and the cost of living in our country. The wage-earning and low-income classes in society are particularly severely beset, and their living expenses are absolutely not being met. Even more overwhelmed than these two groups are those who have no jobs with which to meet their living expenses. This is especially true in the municipality of Noshahr as a result of the unpredictably harsh environmental conditions which are completely unreasonable by any standard. There are not many factories to employ all these people with high school diplomas and less and with bachelor's degrees. They are unemployed, and one of the big problems we deputies have is the many requests from these young people for jobs. If some basic thinking is not done to employ them, the country will be afflicted with thousands of kinds of corruption and affliction. Continuing, the deputy for Noshahr and Chalus said: One of the nation's important problems is that the government has given the flatterers a free hand so that anyone can suck the blood of the poor and oppressed people to fill his pockets as much as he wants and through any means. Not the least thing has been done to control prices. Up until the end of the year 1372 [20 March 1994] a kilogram of sugar or sugar cubes was 70 tumans and a package of number 16 nails was 350 tumans. The people are asking us, how is it that in the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], with foreign exchange rate fluctuations overnight the price of a kilogram of sugar or sugar cubes increases to 140 tumans and a package of No. 16 nails goes up to 1,100 tumans, yet there are thousands of tons of sugar, sugar cubes and nails in the warehouses? Without any trouble, their owners instantly added billions of rials to their wealth and no one said a word to them. He added: My recommendation is first of all that in cases like this the president of the republic order the assets of these profiteers and economic terrorists confiscated through the judicial system, as an object lesson to others so that no one will dare overcharge society's deprived and oppressed people this way. Second, the government should use all its power to control rates in some way so that goods will be sold at the same price throughout the country. Right now, 50 stores will have 50 different prices on the same street. He continued: In short, one cannot run a country with sermons, advice and `my dear, my dear.' Continuing, the speaker condemned the cronyism, flattery, superficiality, and hypocrisy that have become prevalent in our society and also find receptive audiences. He said: The existing situation must be conveyed to the hearing of officials. Inappropriate optimism and saying that everything is good will only tempt and deceive the officials and it will have dangerous consequences. He criticized the programs of the Vision of the Islamic Republic and recommended that the programs feature scholars from Qom Seminary like Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi, Javadi-Amoli, Makarom-Shirazi and other scholars, and, from the universities, people like Dr. Javad Larijani and other great people as hosts, and that basic and important religious questions and answers be raised. The deputy from Noshahr and Chalus said: Although the Fourth Majles has taken positive steps in several areas, this is not enough. In my view, instead of spending all this time on laws, the Majles should spend half its time supervising the implementation of laws and see how much waste, dissipation, and embezzlement of the public treasury exists in the government organizations. In conclusion, the speaker called for laws that will solve the important problems of society. As an example he mentioned passing the "Where Did You Get It?" law so that those people can be legally prosecuted who committed many crimes during the revolution, through trickery, deception, and aligning themselves with this or that faction, and their assets can be confiscated in the interest of the deprived and the oppressed. Ghaffar Esma'il, Deputy From Hashtrud The people expect the government to deal decisively with violators and to precisely control prices. The next speaker was Esma'il, deputy from Hashtrud. During his speech he discussed the secret collusion by NATO officials. He said: The fear of an independent Islamic nation in Europe has led those in the Security Council and their NATO allies to stoop to any disgrace. The situation has become so shameful that peacekeepers were taken hostage by the Serbs and nothing changed. He praised the consolidation of the ministries of industry and expressed the hope that the existing malaise in the nation's industry will end and that it will be the basic focal point for alleviating the economic problems of the government and the people. The exalted leader's 13-point publication must be the focus of the Second Five-Year Plan. In must be considered in the framework of statistics and figures, and a comprehensive plan must be compiled using the experience of the First Five-Year Plan and its strengths and weaknesses. He added: Paying subsidies in the existing way is not just. Those who are better off benefit that much more from the subsidies on some goods, and the proper procedure should be the opposite. Rural people are deprived of the subsidies given to those living in the cities. The procedure adopted in the Second Five-Year Plan must be such that the most deprived people in society enjoy the most subsidies and those who are prosperous will pay the real price of basic goods and the subsidies on energy and fuel. The deputy from Hashtrud emphasized: An unavoidable necessity is to review the method of collecting taxes and adopt proper procedures for creating reliable sources of revenue for the government and prevent inflated revenues. It is also necessary to invest in the education and training sector in training committed and skilled manpower, and developing education and training centers in the agricultural sector, which are the main focal points of economic development. Despite the high added-value in the agricultural sector compared to the other sectors and its vast resources, we still do not market enough products in this sector for domestic consumption. Yet the least investment of all the sectors is required to create employment in this sector, because by allocating to agriculture only 8 percent of all the nation's infrastructure investment, it will account for about 24 percent of the nation's gross revenues and 28 percent of its employment. Continuing, Esma'ili said: The revolution people expect the government to deal decisively with violators and the financially corrupt, and to precisely control prices. I thank the president of the republic for seeking to stabilize prices and for taking steps in this area. The people and the Majles will clearly support these measures. I ask the economic council to expedite implementation of pricing legislation. Clearly, one of the major factors in high prices is the lack of conformity of supply to demand. For more supply there must be more production and less consumption. Continuing, he discussed the solution to high prices. He said: To accomplish this there must be a proper public consumption and distribution model, and there must be a culture of work and a work ethic, which is one of the basic and crucial principles of our dear leader's guidance. The culture of work and economizing must be planted as a value in the hearts and minds of each of the people like a fruitful sapling. The people must understand its importance and its reward as something akin to going to the war fronts. Instead of thinking about their personal interests and earning incomes from brokerage and false employment, which is one of the major factors in inflation, they must think about national interests and work. Esma'ili then emphasized the problem of unemployment in the country. He said: In this sensitive time of manpower adjustment, privatization, factory closures, and high inflation, and the fact that our workers are seeking work in other countries, the general interest of the country requires that Afghan workers be returned to their own country so that in addition to not creating numerous forms of corruption, they will not snatch the few existing jobs from Iranian workers. In this situation with high prices, Iranian workers must not be left with nowhere to turn. He then thanked the minister of agriculture for his visit to the exalted leader's projects in Hashtrud, and he praised the minister of energy's attention to providing water service to the region, and he praised the chief of the Plan and Budget Organization and the minister of roads and transportation for creating the Hashtrud beltline road. Mohammad Reza Naseri-Dowlatabadi, Deputy From Barkhar And Mimeh Is it in our interest, in the name of economic prosperity and without regard for the struggles of the people, that we should impose the pressures of inflation and high prices on the vulnerable classes? The next preagenda speaker was Naseri-Dowlatabadi, deputy from Barkhar and Mimeh. During his speech he said: Today humanity is aligned against free thinking, especially that of the Muslim nations. These international criminals are attacking the Muslims of the world, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Palestine. No clear position is taken against the racists, and, despite the signing of the nongenocide treaty, genocide and mass killings continue. This adds another black page to the record of the world's lying monopolizing human rights organizations. It is not clear how they will answer history for the crimes at al-Khalil and Gorazde in Bosnia. Today the human rights war is being waged against those who generally seek to act independently in the world. The speaker discussed the anniversary of the martyrdom of Martyr Motahari and the arrival of Teacher Day, and he mentioned the cultural invasion. He said: First of all, I am astonished and dismayed that a nation with this cultural background is unable to stand up against the enemy cultural invasion by using the potent and effective tools that are embedded in the heart of its Islamic culture. Why should a country be worried about a cultural invasion that has this vast education and training and higher education system, which embraces 20 million people? This means that one in every three Iranians is directly involved with education, teaching, and training. In the same regard he added: Isn't it time for our researchers to study and determine the reason for this bitter truth that our education and training and higher education officials and planners are unable to create the necessary incentives for our elementary school children, high-school adolescents, and university youth? If the educational organizations do not move positively based on the psychological needs of the young generation, we will move farther from our goal. Continuing, Naseri said: Is it in our interest, in the name of economic prosperity and without regard for the capability of the people to struggle, that we should impose the pressures of inflation and high prices on society's vulnerable classes? Continuing, he discussed Worker Week. He said: The necessary leverage must be provided to support this class, and basic steps must be taken to solve their problems. If this is not possible, one must live simply, as they do, to increase their tolerance for poverty. The speaker discussed the exalted leader's New Year's message. He said: A look at the government offices, which are a government family of several million, and at the useful work hours, puts us in a state of uncertainty and anxiety. We must study what volume of personnel foreign offices and companies use to produce several times more than what we produce. Don't hidden unemployment, corruption and administrative bribery damage the spirit of the revolution and threaten its future? The deputy from Barkhar and Mimeh discussed the fact that America's fate will be no different than that of the Soviet Union. He discussed the water conference in Oman, attended by the Zionist regime's experts. He said: Although the aforementioned conference is apparently about water, its goals are in line with imperialist efforts to establish peace between the Arabs and Israel. Experts predict that an arms conference will soon be held in Qatar, attended by Israel and several Islamic nations. The existing situation shows that Israel, more than ever since its inception, is coming closer to the world of Islam and the borders of the Islamic heartland. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs must therefore do the necessary planning and adopt a systematic policy to thwart the negative effects of this inauspicious alliance in the history of the struggles of Muslim combatants. Continuing, Naseri said: I recommend that in the matter of eliminating social subsidies we seek the views of the people, to make it possible for them better to participate in their own destiny. I also ask the respected president of the republic and the Council of Ministers to provide the necessary tools to obtain the views of the Majles in adhering to the principle of economizing, which is the message of hope in the 1373 budget. It is the duty of the Majles to use its legal resources to support the government. Some of the executive officials must avoid useless extravagance and pointless gratuities from the public treasury, using government resources and printing advertisements of congratulation and condolence with the government's general budget. The continuation of what has been happening in recent years and the waste is a cause for serious concern. If the important principle of economizing is observed by the government leaders, the people will also be inclined to economize, for "the people follow the religion of their rulers." In conclusion he thanked the management in his electoral precinct and the executive, military and police officials, especially the office of the governor and the traffic control forces in his electoral district for securing and watching the exit and entry routes during the New Year's holidays. He issued memos to the minister of power concerning the completion of the Barkhar water canal project, to the minister of petroleum concerning gas service, to the minister of agriculture concerning agricultural self-sufficiency and to the minister of the reconstruction crusade about rebuilding and asphalting the Barkhar and Mimeh rural connective roads, and he asked that the above problems be dealt with. Sa'id Raja'i-Khorasani, Deputy From Tehran We should be trying to prevent waste and extravagance. The final preagenda speaker was Raja'i Khorasani. In his speech he offered congratulations on the birth anniversary of His Holiness Imam Reza (peace be upon him), and he discussed the regrettable situation in the city of Gorazde. He said: The criminal West, on various pretexts, brought about the occupation of Gorazde, and it really refused to use the military leverage it had available, and we strongly condemn this inadequacy that we see in the Western nations, especially in the Security Council. He added: We must not forget that in this regard the sins of the Russians are no less than those of the Westerners and the Americans. I remember when the Security Council's forces took formal action against one or two Serbian tanks, the Russians immediately expressed concern, asking why this was done without their knowledge. The deputy from Tehran then discussed the problem of high prices in the country. He said: I must ask the officials not to present pointless analyses about high prices. It is not quite correct to say that the small percentage of our budget and public treasury being used for subsidies is not reaching the right people. Is this because a small percentage of our people are quite wealthy and do not deserve these subsidies? If we look at the masses of the people in our country, we see that everyone is suffering from the high prices, and these small subsidies that are being given do not require all this debt infliction. We should be trying to prevent waste and extravagance. If the officials are telling the truth, let them look at how economical the development projects have been that were carried out. Weren't some of them carried out at two or three times what they should have cost? Dr. Raja'i-Khorasani then noted: If there is really a proper policy in effect concerning self-sufficiency, it should be pursued. We must give the good news as soon as possible that the production line for these experimental models, which were built have gone into operation. We must try to end our need as soon as possible for items being purchased, for which some very inadvisable things have been done. Legislation The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles session was the single-consultation Bill on the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Membership in the Islamic Insurance Investments and Export Credits Company and the Purchase of 5,000 Shares of the Aforementioned Company Valued at 5 Million Islamic Dinars, of which Article 1 was approved by the deputies. Article 1: The government is authorized to join the Islamic Insurance Investments and Export Credits Company affiliated with the Islamic Development Bank and to be a charter subscriber to 5,000 of its shares, valued at 1,000 dinars each, or $130 million, and to add to the company's future investments with the approval of the Council of Ministers. The second item on the agenda was the report from the second consultation of the Administrative and Employment Affairs Commission on the Bill Exempting Nursing Retirees From the Age Requirements for Retirement Given in Note 1, Article 2 of the National Retirement and Compulsory Service Law Regulations Amendment Law, of which Article 1 was approved. Article 1: Nursing Retirees, on the condition that they have at least 20 years service in the aforementioned employment, are exempt from the age requirements given in Note 1, Article 2, of the National Retirement and Compulsory Service Law Regulations Amendment Law, enacted 12/13/1368 [3 March 1990]. The third item on the agenda was the report from the Housing and Urban Construction Commission concerning the Bill Authorizing the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran To Join the International Maritime Rescue Convention, and this bill was approved by the Majles. The next item on the agenda was the report from the first consultation of the Administrative and Employment Affairs Commission concerning the Bill Amending Article 8 of the Iran Handicraft Industries Organization Charter, the general form of which was approved. Based on Article 1 of this bill, the chief of the Plan and Budget Organization and the minister of the reconstruction crusade, respectively, are added to the general assembly of the Iran Handicraft Industries Organization. The final item on the agenda was the report from the first consultation of the Bill Forming Rural Water and Sewage Companies, continued consideration of which was postponed to the next session. Letter From More Than 180 Majles Deputies Condemning the Siege of Gorazde by the Serbs Once again one of the greatest human tragedies has taken place in the heart of so-called civilized Europe, and oppressed Gorazde in Bosnia and Herzegovina is burning in a ring of fire and blood as the result of the crimes of the aggressor Serbs. The oppressed cries for mercy from innocent children, defenseless women and besieged men can be heard through the vicious flames and Serbian crimes. For two years the Serbs, armed to the teeth and with a clear green light from the Unied Nations and criminal America, with the support of the Russians and with the deathly silence and implicit approval of most of the European governments, have besieged this oppressed city. Periodically, using a heavy arsenal of firepower and even chemical weapons, they have flattened and bloodied its defenseless residents. The United Nations, which claims to support peace and security for this city, made a false claim of creating a safety zone, giving the oppressed people of this city a false sense of security, yet on the other hand it completely insists on continuing the arms embargo against the oppressed Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the face of all these clear crimes by the criminal Serbs and the clear violation of international regulations, it has adopted an approving silence and it will not even condemn these crimes verbally. With this encouragement, the criminals have continued with their crimes. The UN Security Council has opposed the proposal by Islamic nations, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, that they join the UN peace-keeping forces, and in practice they have given the bloodthirsty Serbs a free hand to commit any kind of crime. The tragedy in Gorazde is clear evidence of shame for the United Nations and the Western governments claiming to support human rights, and it is a blot of shame on the history of humanity, which took place and in the proximity of the European neighbors of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We Majles deputies announce our regret at the occurrence of such a human tragedy. We condemn the United Nations, the secretary-general, and the governments supporting and encouraging the Serbs for their approving silence in the face of all these crimes. In obedience to the orders of the exalted leader, we declare our full readiness to give any kind of aid and assistance to the oppressed and defenseless people of Gorazde in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Signed by 180 deputies
