FR940318-0-00079 FR940318-0-00014 Section 382(l)(5)(D) of the Code provides that, if a second ownership change occurs within two years after an ownership change to which section 382(l)(5) applies, the section 382 limitation with respect to the second ownership change is zero. A commenter suggested that the final regulations provide that the zero limitation applies only to losses incurred prior to the first ownership change. The final regulations do not provide such a rule because it would be inconsistent with the language of section 382(l)(5)(D). The proposed regulations provide that the value of the stock of a loss corporation does not include stock issued with a principal purpose of increasing the section 382 limitation without subjecting the investment to the entrepreneurial risks of corporate business operations. A commenter requested that the final regulations provide further guidance regarding the stock subject to this rule. The Treasury and the Service believe that additional guidance is not necessary because the test sufficiently limits the scope of this anti-abuse provision. The proposed regulations provide that the value of any stock issued in connection with the ownership change cannot exceed the value of the property received by the loss corporation in consideration for the stock. A commenter questioned the appropriateness of this limitation. The final regulations, however, retain the limitation to preclude any claims that the stock is worth more than what was paid for it. The limitation avoids the valuation disputes that would result from these claims. Further, the limitation on losses provided by section 382(a) of the Code is intended to measure the earnings power of the corporation. When a loss corporation issues stock, it increases its earnings power by the value of the property it receives, regardless of whether that value represents a fair price for the stock. Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking for the regulations was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business. Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is Robert Liquerman, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (Corporate), Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service. However, personnel from other offices of the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department participated in developing the regulations, in matters of both substance and style.
