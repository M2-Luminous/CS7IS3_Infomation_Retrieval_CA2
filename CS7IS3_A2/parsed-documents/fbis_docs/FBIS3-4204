The office is to provide legal services for both foreign business people who have had investment or wish to invest in China, and Chinese enterprises entering the world market. It will also introduce Western law firm management expertise, said Cai Qing, director of the office, in his office in Shanghai's five-star Jinjiang Hotel. Cai obtained a master's degree and then Ph.D in law in the United States and was qualified as a practising lawyer in Washington State before returning home, majoring in the laws of corporation, securities, investment and real estate. Cai's colleague Tang Yilin is also a registered practising lawyer in the United States. The firm has five members who have settled down in the United States, and another four coming from the United States and Canada are expected to join the firm soon. While mainly employing returned students, the firm is planning to recruit foreign lawyers, and it will also help send Chinese lawyers to engage in advanced training overseas. Local experts believe there will be more such law firms in China along with the country's ongoing reform of the lawyer system and the nation's drive to build a socialist market economy. China would regulate its lawyer system in line with international practice, Gan Jihua, vice-chairman of the Beijing-based All-China Lawyers Association, said.
