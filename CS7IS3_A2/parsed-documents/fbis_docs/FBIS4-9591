The international grouping, based in Vienna, has asked authorities in Belgrade to allow the resumption of long-term CSCE missions in the southern province and other mixed areas, the Sandzak and Vojvodina, a statement said. "The CSCE is very concerned by the deterioration (...) especially the recent suppression of human rights and basic freedoms which have led to increased tension and instability in the region," it said. The body has been notified of many cases of arrests, detentions and arbitary police brutality against the ethnic Albanian majority, "a flagrant violation of the principles of the CSCE and the commitments made by the Serbian authorities," it continued. The resumption of long-term missions, banned by Belgrade last July, "could contribute to the prevention of conflicts in the region," it said.
