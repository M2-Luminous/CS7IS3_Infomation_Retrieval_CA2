Luis Enrique Figueroa, Sandinist National Liberation Front departmental coordinator, explains that through discussion and the participation of members of the church, the Sandinist People's Army (EPS), mayors, and others, the organization has "neutralized" conflicts between former EPS and Resistance members. Figueroa explains that property issues are more difficult to resolve because deeds are required from the government, which he calls the "Achilles Heel" in conflict resolution. Figueroa hopes that the program "will serve the nation" as a model because relations in Chontales are "friendly, respectful, and fraternal."
