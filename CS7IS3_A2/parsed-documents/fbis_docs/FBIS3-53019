In a statement to KUNA after the meeting, Shaykh Sabah said "the meeting led to many positives we have always looked for." He added: "We have invited the next session of the ministerial council of the Damascus Declaration States to meet in Kuwait. The declaration lays down that such a meeting be held once every six months, and we in Kuwait are looking forward to the timely convening of the session. The foreign ministers will hold consultations on this issue." He pointed out that Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal spoke at the final session on our behalf -- as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the chairman of the current session of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- and expressed our pleasure with the good results we arrived at, and with our profound satisfaction with what has been achieved within the framework of joint cooperation between the member-states of the Damascus Declaration. Shaykh Sabah will leave Damascus later today after participating in the meeting of the foreign ministers of the member-states of the Damascus Declaration.
