What lesson can we draw from the first two years of Ukrainian state sovereignty? Nowadays it is surely obvious to everyone that there will be no perect economic solution to the problem of extricating ourselves from this all-encompassing crisis. We need to solve the problem of making a systemic transition to a new quality of society, state administration, and economics. One gets the impression more and more nowadays that the situation is being pushed--whether consciously or not--in the direction of extraordinary measures. There is a persistent argument to the effect that the escalation of the above-mentioned crisis is being brought about by Ukraine's energy dependence, as well as by the constant rise in prices spent for energy-bearing materials. But the proportion of such energy sources in Ukraine's credit indebtedness is less than 15 percent. And what about the remainder? The rest of this indebtedness is caused by the noncompetiveness of Ukrainian goods in the markets of other states and by the fact that we have a tight taxation, customs-duty, and import-export policy. The real cause of our worsening situation lies in the absence of reforms and consistent actions in the field of managing the economy. Our economy cannot be rebuilt without an all-encompassing change in the structure of property rights. And it is groundless to anticipate changes in the behavior of economic factors without privatization. It has never happened anywhere and surely never will. Having set out on the path of reform, we must organize a rapid and mass privatization. The goal of privatization is to find new property-owners and managers and to channel the funds obtained into the appropriate solution of social problems. We are taking the initial steps of our reform policy in the agro-industrial complex. And we are beginning with land reform. Ukraine's agriculture requires various forms of management and various forms of property ownership. At present the process of privatizing land and making a total farm inventory on a shareholding basis is urgent. We must ensure that there are state monitoring controls on land utilization. The goal of privatizing land and property is to reform collective farms into full-valued cooperatives, shareholding enterprises, private-type farms, and associations of village-owned farms. The question of prices and price formation is extraordinarily important and--at the same time--painful. The present-day government in Ukraine, having abandoned the path of direct administrative command, has not set forth on the path of market-type changes, but instead has chosen the path of the absurd. What else can one call a course directed at reducing the Gross National Product, curtailing production, and precipitously impoverishing the population, while--at the same time--creating the conditions for superprofits and enriching state bureaucrats by means of bribery, extortion, and other such mercenary behavior. The first step in this field must be to ensure that there are public monitoring controls by citizens on the utilization of the state budget. This step has to be taken in order to prevent the budget from being plundered in the form of granting privileged credits, subsidies, and budgetary loans. We need to legislatively reinforce evenhanded tax conditions for enterprises under all forms of property ownership. In order to encourage investments and stimulate the entrepreneurial spirit, we should introduce "flat" taxes on profits. This is a very important step--one which could encourage, first and foremost, the active influx of medium-sized and large-scale international capital. In parallel fashion, we have to adopt and apply progressive taxes for individual incomes. While creating favorable conditions for business activity--conditions which will enable us to realize high profits--we must also ensure protection for sensitive social groups by providing targeted aid and relief for them. We are introducing into our Rukh program precise ways and means for implementing such protective institutions. It is a known fact that the success of the economic reform depends--to a considerable extent--on cooperation between state and private property owners. Pushing on forward is only possible if we begin real privatization, including that of land. This would enable us to put a stop to the plundering of state property and free the state from the need to subsidize enterprises making low profits or even operating at a loss. Privatization would also mean the end of uncontrolled credit issuance, inasmuch as the granting of credits to state enterprises is the principal source of the deficit today. In order to expand the possibilities for Ukraine's citizens and to create evenhanded conditions in the obtaining of credits, we must legislatively reinforce the right to grant credits to those citizens who wish to start up their own businesses or to acquire housing. We also need to create favorable conditions for the emergence of new private enterprises and to implement programs for supporting and developing entrepreneurship. We have such a specific program. Each person desiring to become an owner-manager will be allowed to participate directly in the administration of the economic region involved. And, therefore, we must carry out not only small-scale privatization, but also provide for the joint-stock ownership of corporate-type enterprises. The creation of a private sector will be accompanied by mandatory anti-monopoly measures, which will simultaneously provide equal rights among enterprises having various forms of property ownership. An interest in--and concern for--turning out competitive goods or services needed in the marketplace will facilitate the growth of social production. Privatization will have to cut back on the production of energy-consuming, noncompetitive machiner and semifinished goods; and it must expand the sphere of producing consumer goods. We already need to tackle the structural change of energy production in Ukraine now so as to reduce the imports of oil and gas to a minimum. All these measures are possible only if the problem of government power is solved. Otherwise, the decline in the economy will continue even more precipitously. Therefore, we are in favor of combining our efforts with those of all Ukrainian patriots and supporters of rapid, radical reforms. We have faith in our success, and we anticipate that the path to it will not be too long and painful.
