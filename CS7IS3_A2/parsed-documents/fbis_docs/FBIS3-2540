They extended new year greetings on behalf of the people and communist party members of Beijing, to the former secretary and mayor and wished him long life and a happy Spring Festival. Comrade Peng Zhen was very pleased, and also wished Beijing's people and the communist party members a happy new year. Comrade Peng Zhen, who is 91 years old, cordially talked with the municipal leaders with a high spirit and clear mind. Chen Xitong and Li Qiyan said: Under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, Beijing improved all of its 1993 work over work in 1992 and achieved sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. The per capita income of urban staff members and workers registered a substantial increase last year thanks to economic development. However, we still have some poverty-stricken, mountainous areas and low-income plants, shops, schools, and households that are experiencing difficulties. We will make efforts to solve this problem as a priority in our endeavors to achieve a fairly comfortable life in the next few years and make it a success. Comrade Peng Zhen said happily that healthy development was genuine development. He emphasized that great efforts in improving state-owned, large and medium-sized enterprises and agriculture, were key to this development. Chen Xitong said: This year's tasks for reform and development are very arduous. Great efforts should be made to maintain political and social stability in the capital. Meanwhile, we should further emancipate our minds, seize the opportunity, conduct investigation and study, make breakthroughs in key areas, and resolutely implement the arrangements of the party Central Committee and the State Council to win still greater achievements in the capital's reform, opening up, and modernization drive. Comrade Peng Zhen said: Stability is a major task concerning the entire country, and the capital should take the lead in maintaining it. Without a stable environment, nothing can be developed. Chen Xitong said that to continuously promote the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as advocated by Comrade Xiaoping, we should strengthen party building and, in particular, achieve ideological and theoretical progress and improve leading bodies. He reported to Peng Zhen that the end-of-term reshuffles of district and county leading bodies improved the age structure to add impetus to the orderly succession of cadres. Comrade Peng Zhen said: A good age structure is good. Without the combination of old, middle-aged, and young comrades, the party's line will lack continuity. The basic issue is to uphold socialism and communist ideals. Communist party members should intensify study of Marxist theory, persistently seek truth from facts, uphold truth, and correct mistakes that may arise. In this way, they will have bright prospects and make progress endlessly. Chen Xitong said to Peng Zhen: Eleven years ago when I first served as the mayor, I asked you for instructions. You gave me four: 1) say less and do more, and say nothing about completed work; 2) a mayor needs money at his disposal, thus meaning that production needed to be developed to increase financial resources; 3) set the highest possible demands on all work and advance continuously; and 4) "measure several times before cutting" by conducting more investigation and study. I have benefited greatly from these four instructions. When Comrade Li Qiyan became the mayor, I passed on the instructions to him. Li Qiyan said: I kept your four instructions in mind constantly. In your introduction remarks to the "Frontline" magazine, you urged us to adhere to the thinking of seeking truth from facts, and we have always used it to guide our work. Comrade Peng Zhen smiled. Li Zhijian and Chen Guangwen, deputy secretaries, and Duan Bingren, secretary general of the municipal party committee; and Fan Yuanmou, secretary general of the municipal government; also visited Comrade Peng Zhen together.
