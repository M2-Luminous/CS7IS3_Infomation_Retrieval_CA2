Bei, 34, who had been subjected to daily interrogations by Shenzhen security from Saturday to Tuesday for publishing an "illegal journal", originally wanted to leave the special economic zone through the Huanggang border checkpoint. However, Chinese immigration officials at Huanggang, which is one of only a few exit points commonly used by foreigners, held him up for 1 1/2 hours before "suggesting" that he use the Lowu exit. Bei, a green card-holder who has been resident in the United States since late 1988, was suspected by State Security of liaising with pro-democracy activists since his return to China last December. One thousand copies of the magazine he founded, Tendency Quarterly, which were printed in Shenzhen had been seized by the, authorities. From 5 pm to 6.30 pm at Huanggang, official used several reasons to stop him leaving, he said. "I showed them [officials] my air tickets back to the States, but they claimed there was something wrong with them. "They also suggested Hong Kong officials on the other side might not let me in." After repeated arguments, one officer left the immigration counter and made a phone call, after which he suggested that Bei use the Lowu checkpoint. At the immigration counter at Lowu, Bei said the officer had prolonged the processing by making numerous checks in his computer and putting down his particulars by hand. The poet claimed his picture was also taken. The immigration official then took a look at the clock on the wall and then waved him past. "I suspect they [Shenzhen security] wanted me to leave through Lowu because they have the personnel and equipment there to make the proper recording," Bei said. It was almost 8 pm when he arrived in Hong Kong. After boarding a Kowloon-bound train, Bei said: "I'm really tired but I feel very peaceful here. "I don't understand why the Chinese Government gave me so much trouble this time," he said. "My magazine is just about culture and literature, not politics." Although he encountered a lot of trouble on his first trip back to China. Bei said he hoped he could return some day. Bei will stay in Hong Kong until the end of this month, when he will go to Taiwan to promote the magazine before returning to the U.S.
