We welcome our dear brother President Idriss Deby, and the high-level delegation accompanying him. We thank him for paying this visit. They are at home, among their brethren. Their visit at this time is considered as standing on the side of their brother the Libyan people in this confrontation [as heard], and their presence among us lifts the morale of their Libyan brothers. We are meeting now that all the problems that were pending between the two countries are finished. This was realized with the victory of fraternal will. The Libyan people sacrified a great deal in order to help their brother the Chadian people in a long battle in which victory was won by the Chadian people, a victory which is also considered as a victory of the Libyan people at this hour. Now we can cooperate hand in hand for construction and edification, and in order to consolidate brotherhood between the two fraternal peoples. In fact, the Libyan people and the Chadian people are of the same origin. [passage omitted] We are happy with this meeting today, and in accordance with our common wish we are founding the basis for a joint strategic action for the good of the two peoples. The two countries have considerable potentials which, if integrated and exploited in a common program, will greatly benefit the two peoples. Those who consider Chad as being poor are mistaken. Chad has a basic capital: It is rich in raw materials, most important of which is water. Libya has known potentials, and each country needs the other. Each country has its own important possibilities. With fraternal spirit and revolutionary will we can integrate these resources and exploit them for the good of the two peoples. [passage omitted] [end recording] President Idriss Deby then made a speech in which he said: [Begin Deby recording, in French, followed by Arabic translation; translated from the French] Brother leader of the Libyan revolution; on behalf of the delegation accompanying me I thank you very sincerely, yourself and your government, for the very warm and fratern welcome accorded us. On the same occasion, and as I said yesterday during our meeting, I have come here at the head of a very important delegation consisting of members of the government, the pariament and political parties in order to salute the courage of the leader of the Libyan revolution, the Libyan people and its goverment for having done their utmost in resolving the problem which for more than two decades constituted a major handicap in our relations. [passage omitted] We can say that a new era of cooperation opens today between our two peoples. You mentioned that the Libyan people shed its blood for the Chadian people and the Chadian people shed its blood for the Libyan people. They are two peoples that have many things in common, and the time has come for us to make of our space a space of fruitful cooperation, a space for peace, a space for development for the benefit of our two peoples, who have much in common, as I said. Brother leader of the revolution; your role and that of Libya in the development of Chad is very important. We consider that your brothers in Chad, in this precise framework, need unlimited support to enable them to resolve their problems and the difficulties they often face. We believe that this visit is a first of its kind, which in our view will permit the laying down of the foundation stone of peace, friendships and cooperation. This will also enable commissions to meet to examine all the possibilities of cooperation between our two countries, without limits. Brother leader of the Libyan revolution; be assured that the Chadian people support the Libyan people in their difficulties, in their problems. The Libyan people will not betray this position of principle, a global, African and Arab position of principle. Thank you. [end recording]
