He also said the company was considering production in Argentina, too. At home, Toyota will renovate old factories and review a list of items to be produced at these factories, he said. Concerning production in Mexico, President Toyoda merely said: "We are studying it." Meanwhile, Toyota Vice President Masaharu Tanaka met with visiting Mexican presidential aide Gomez on the morning of 22 December and was briefed on how North and Central American markets would expand after NAFTA takes effect. Although President Toyoda said "we have not decided on details," the company will promote the study of making inroads into Mexico. Toyota once set up a local production system in Mexico in the sixties. Also, it dispatched a survey team to Mexico last October, indicating a desire to make inroads into the country. Nissan Motor Company has a production base in Mexico. Although Japanese car manufacturers are worried that the ratio of parts to be procured locally might be raised following the effectuation of NAFTA, they are expected to make full-scale inroads into Mexico because of the market's bright future. Toyota is currently promoting a feasibility study in Argentina. In 1992, it exported 1,300 vehicles to the country. To increase the volume of exports to Argentina, it is necessary to establish a production base there, Toyota believes. At home, Takaoka and Tsutsumi Factories in Toyoda city are subject to renovation. The two factories manufacture passenger cars like Corolla and Corona. Toyota is said to plan to remodel them into ones for parts production. Concerning prices of Toyota cars in the U.S. market, President Toyoda said: "The appreciation of the yen is still continuing. We have to take this into consideration." His remark suggests that Toyota will further raise the prices of its products in the U.S. market in the near future. Explaining Toyota's long-term sales and production plans, Toyoda stressed that the company would vigorously promote overseas production, saying: "I hope we will sell 6 million vehicles (in the world market) before we enter the 21st century."
