Commenting on the package, a government official said: "The package is a `device' to resume the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks." In response to the package, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said: "The package is not enough to resume the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks." He made clear the U.S. negative reaction to the package. The points of contention between Japan and the United States are: 1) macroeconomic measures needed to stimulate the Japanese economy; 2) the issue of opening up the Japanese market; and 3) the handling of objective criteria. As far as macroeconomic policy and the issue of market opening are concerned, Japan's view is that "it has done its utmost in the package." On objective criteria, the most contentious issue between the two countries, the Japanese package carries no good answers to the U.S. demands. It is being said, however, that the lack of good answers on the issue is a hidden device. On Japanese voluntary measures for three priority sectors that were discussed at the framework talks, the package far from satisfies U.S. demands in the automobile sector, but clearly indicates specific objective criteria that Japan considers the best option in present world economic conditions and in view of the current business activities of Japanese automakers. On the issue of government procurement, the package provides "statistics and related information" in an abstract form, but it does not touch on insurance at all. The handling of objective criteria varies from sector to sector. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] said: "We intend to look for a way to settle the issue while presenting the United States with three alternative proposals." Japan's tactic is that it will search for clues to the resumption of framework talks by narrowing the gap between the two countries over the interpretation of objective criteria while playing its "insurance" and "government procurement" cards on which it has left room to make concessions. A senior Foreign Ministry official said: "The United States has not rejected contacts with Japan on the resumption of framework talks." Both Japan and the United States are expected to resume framework talks when they find areas of agreement, and the issue of handling objective criteria was a primary cause of the stalemate in the framework talks. Will Japan's tactics really work as they hope?
