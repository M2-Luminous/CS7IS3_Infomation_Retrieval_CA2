FBIS4-22275 "jpusr034___94051" FBIS-USR-94-034 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 18 March 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Government Strategy on Foreign Investment Remains Unclear Government Strategy on Foreign Investment Remains Unclear 944Q0261B Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY in Russian 18 Mar 94 p 4 944Q0261B Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY Russian CSO [Article by Natalya Kalashnikova: "Clouds Appear in Russia's Investment Skies"] [Text] One of the largest United States companies, Russel 20x20, yesterday expressed its readiness in principle to cooperate with Russia, in particular within the framework of establishment of a fund for the insurance of foreign investments. The declaration was made during the course of talks at the Russian Agency for International Cooperation and Development (RAICD). Quite a number of proposals of this sort continue to be received by the agency, whose status today, incidentally, is quite hazy (on 16 March KOMMERSANT-DAILY reported certain proposals regarding its fate). The West has apparently taken seriously the statement made by Viktor Chernomyrdin at the end of last year that 1994 will become "the year of investments." And it is not easy to explain to investors that the situation is not in fact shaping up all that smoothly. They would not understand. Taking the operational experience of similar agencies into account (they exist in virtually all the developed countries), RAICD has proposed its concept of the formation of investment insurance institutions. At its initiative, we already see the establishment of the Russian Bank for Reconstruction and Development and two corporations--the Russian Financial Corporation and State Investment Corporation. Among plans not yet realized is the establishment of an independent tender committee and, finally, the Multilateral Agency for Guaranteeing Investments in Russia (including guarantees from political risk). To form the latter, it is proposed to create an international fund (located abroad) in which Russia could be the first to make contributions. An invitation would then be extended to private foreign capital to follow this example. Interest in this business has also been expressed by the American firm Russel 20x20, which controls capital in the amount of $1 billion and has already established a similar fund in Poland, then in China. Practice shows that foreign investors prefer right now to engage in risky business in Russia through Russian state structures--as being more reliable. But rumors to the effect that one of these is operating effectively (or the opposite) are spread extremely rapidly among conservative (at least when it comes to money) "Westerners." And it may seem strange to them that following the declaration on priority being given to investment cooperation in the January presidential edict on structure of the government, RAICD--in essence a ministry, was subject to transformation into a state institution under the roof of MFER [Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations]. While on 7 February the prime minister officially agreed to transfer the entire investments unit to the competence of the Ministry of Economics. Insofar as the above-mentioned presidential edict was not repealed by anyone, however, MFER also continues to consider itself the "investments boss." In this regard, judging from the plans of this department (drawn up recently in the form of a draft governmental decree), the RAICD investments unit may dissolve within the framework of the relevant governmental ministry. It remains an open question to what extent this diminished status will conform to the declared state strategy of priority being given to investment policy. [Begin boxed item] Data on Foreign Capital in Russia --As of 31 January 1994, 12,173 enterprises with foreign investments were recorded in the State Register. The greatest flow of capital is attributable to 1993. Three hundred ninety-seven enterprises were registered in January 1994. --The most intensive activity in Russia is being manifested by countries of the West, including the "Big Seven," as well as states of the former CMEA and China. --Among new trends in the organization of enterprises with foreign investments we see a growth in the number of structures having 100-percent foreign capital (this practice is especially pronounced among Chinese businessmen). In connection with the falling rate of the ruble, however, the amounts of authorized capital of such enterprises (in hard currency) are diminishing on the whole. --The share of foreign investors in the authorized capital of joint enterprises since March 1992 comes to about $870 million. --With respect to size of charter fund and in terms of percentage of the total number of joint enterprises, the predominating share are enterprises engaged in intermediary and consulting services, and in light industry production output and trade. Some 21 percent of enterprises are engaged in the development and introduction of new instrumentation and technical systems. --Among the enterprises with 100-percent foreign capital, the majority are engaged in intermediary and consulting services, financial transactions, and export-import operations.
