In the interview, the minister explains the violations committed by importers of foodstuffs and medicines and accuses them of importing material unfit for human consumption and low quality and "rotten" food. He also notes that these importers and merchants have strong connections and "money to buy people, newspapers, and everything else." He also hints at differences with the prime minister over the way to handle the dispute with the merchants and importers.
