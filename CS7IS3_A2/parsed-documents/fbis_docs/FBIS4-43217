What is especially disappointing is that the no side was strengthened particularly at the expense of the Social Democrats, and this could well revive the old Social Democratic conflict between supporters and opponents of greater European cooperation. The fact that a third of votes went to opponents of union will underline Denmark's image as the European paradox, and it could also sow doubts about the Danes' wholehearted participation in the intergovernmental conference in 1996. The day before the election both Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen and Liberal Party leader Uffe Ellemann-Jensen predicted very optimistically that the turn out would be between 58 and 60 percent. And it is perhaps these two men in particular who should take part in a face-to-face showdown to discover to what extent they bear part of the responsibility for the people's lack of interest. Were the elections to the European Parliament not really about domestic politics? And is it right that party leaders who are not running in the election should assume the dominant position in an election campaign that is not theirs? In the Folketing the party leaders leave the responsibility for voicing the party's views to their respective spokespersons, and only by way of exception do the party leaders step into the frontline. The same should be true of European politics. Leading candidates do not need stand-ins -- not even in nationwide television programs. The Socialist People's Party's John Iversen takes the view that the European Parliament should be closed if people do not take an interest in it. The problem is rather that the members of the European Parliament [MEP's] have been unable to give their place of work a presence in everyday Danish life. The 16 newly elected European Parliament deputies are therefore facing a major task in explaining why the European Parliament is worth taking an interest in. The Social Democrats' major losses meant that the Liberal Party has taken over the yellow jersey of the largest party. But the improvement in the Liberal Party's fortunes was not as great as predicted. The Conservative People's Party enjoyed what we could call the former prime minister effect. Poul Schluter received a pat on the back and had a very good election. Lone Dybkjaer and Lilli Gyldenkilde were vote magnets for the Radical Liberals and the Socialist People's Party respectively. Meanwhile the Center Democrats had a catastrophic election. The Center Democrats' Peter Duetoft has the knowledge and the objectivity, but he lacks trenchancy. And it is true that the party did not benefit from the fact that Arne Melchior stepped in as an interim MEP right in front of the nose of Peter Duetoft when Erhard Jakobsen wanted to give his successor a further chance to create a profile for himself. The question is whether we have not now seen the overture to the Center Democrats' withdrawal from the work of both the Danish and European parliaments.
