Praising Jiangsu's achievements in various fields of endeavor, Song Jian stated: During the Spring Festivals I have spent in Jiangsu over the past two years, I witnessed its rapid development, which was very heartening. All provincial, city, county, and township cadres followed a clear ideology, adopted effective measures, and scored remarkable achievements. The economy has been thriving in many localities. Last year, Jiangsu's provincial gross product increased 18.5 percent, or 5.1 percent more than the national growth rate. This remarkable feat explains the brilliant performance of the provincial party committee and provincial government. Moreover, Jiangsu adopted realistic measures in promoting development, such as efforts to minimize the use of crop lands in establishing economic development zones. By relying mainly on its resources, cadres, and people, Jiangsu has taken its own road of development with distinctive Chinese characteristics. Song Jian discussed agriculture at length. He said: By the CPC's centenary in the next century, our population will probably reach 1.6 to 1.7 billion. To feed such a large population, we must increase the output of grain and farm products by 50 percent over the current level, thereby catching up with intermediate developed countries. To this end, we must imbue ourselves with a sense of urgency in developing agriculture. Due to various reasons, we did not pay sufficient attention to agricultural science research. From now on, we must further uphold the policy of relying on policies first, investments second, and science and technology third when developing agriculture. Governments at all levels should give top priority to agricultural basic research and development, and should increase investments in these areas. This will be crucial to scaling new heights in agricultural production over the next few years. Only a developed agriculture can support the nation and maintain sustained development and stability. Underscoring the importance of popularizing agricultural science and technology, Song Jian added: We must grasp the work with two hands. On the one hand, we should allocate all-level financial resources to steadily popularize agricultural science and technology; on the other, we should develop and nurture new mechanisms for popularizing science and technology through innovations by the masses and in line with the requirements of a socialist market economy. He praised some localities for popularizing science and technology through integrating production, supply, and marketing; establishing associations of special trades; and introducing share-holding cooperative systems. Discussing ways for implementing large-scale management in rural areas, Song Jian stated: We should encourage diversification and multi-polarization instead of practicing a single mode and demanding uniformity. On the issue of readjusting farm product prices, he said: Rural prosperity depends to a large extent on the prices of farm products. However, in the long run price hikes alone cannot promote prosperity. At the core of the issue is to increase rural labor productivity. All sectors of society should make more contributions to promoting high-tech in rural areas in order to facilitate the production of high industrial goods and gradual agricultural modernization.
