With the Japan-U.S. summit talks coming on 11 February, the United States is becoming more and more irritated. According to a Japanese Government source, U.S. officials have made informal inquiries about Japan's approach to the summit meeting, but policymakers in the government and the ruling coalition parties have no time for anything else but political reform. They are not in a mood for prior consultations on the summit. The summit meeting in February is supposed to be a venue for the two leaders to assess the results of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. However, a head-on collision has occurred at the working level framework talks over the handling of the numerical targets, and it has become difficult to come up with results that can be taken up at the summit talks. While negotiators on both sides agree that "there can be no progress without a political decision by the top leader," the Hosokawa administration has shown no sign of taking any action. White House officials are becoming increasingly irritated. Some U.S. Government officials have even expressed the view that "if results cannot be expected from the framework talks, it would be better for Japan to ask for a postponement of the summit talks...." This is because if the summit meeting ends in failure, anti-Japanese feelings may flare up in Congress, and the President may be put in a very difficult position. If there should be a postponement of the summit talks, it would be a serious diplomatic setback for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. It seems that the prime minister's "troubles at home and abroad" will continue for awhile.
