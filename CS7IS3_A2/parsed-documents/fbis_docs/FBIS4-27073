At this three-day conference, the guidelines of the State Council instructions were relayed, the methods for the reform of Shandong's crude oil and refined oil distribution system were discussed and drawn up, and rectification of the refined oil markets throughout the province was arranged. Vice Governor Wang Yuxi gave a speech at the conference. Wang Yuxi said in his speech: The basic guideline of this reform is, by achieving a balance between the total demand and total supply, to control resources, prices, and tax revenues, rationalize the channels for marketing, implement the two-tier reserve system, strengthen supervision and management, and establish new mechanisms to ensure the smooth operation of production and distribution. The major content of the reform is as follows: First, based on the economic development rate, industrial policy, import and export policies, energy consumption pattern, the policy of frugality, and oil field production capacity, the State Planning Commission draws up annual plans as well as medium- and long-term plans for balancing the total supply and total demand of crude oil and refined oil to guide and arrange the production, import and export, and distribution of crude oil and refined oil. Second, the crude oil to be processed according to plans will be delivered to the petrochemical corporation by the State Planning Commission; and the crude oil not covered in the plans will all be organized for processing by the petrochemical corporation except for that used by oil fields themselves and the amount lost in a reasonable way. Oil fields are no longer permitted to exchange oil for electricity or materials and to provide crude oil directly to local governments. Regarding the crude oil delivered to local small oil refineries for processing as a support to the refineries, its amount will not be increased. All oil refineries will no longer take domestic crude oil for processing. Third, the refined oil produced by all refineries from the crude oil distributed by the state in a unified manner, the imported refined oil, and the refined oil produced by foreign-funded enterprises to be marketed in China according to regulations will all be distributed under state guidance. The distribution of refined oil will be organized by the petrochemical corporation along with the various provincial, regional, and municipal petroleum companies. Fourth, all the refined oil produced by refineries will be sold at the state-stipulated factory prices, and all gas stations and retail outlets should sell at the stipulated retail prices. All distribution units should strictly implement the state tax system and unify the tax rate. Fifth, the channels for marketing will be rationalized, and the intermediate links will be reduced. Sixth, the existing oil product wholesale units will be strictly screened, and the existing gas stations and refined oil retail outlets will be rectified with great efforts. Meanwhile, the sales agent system will be phased in.
