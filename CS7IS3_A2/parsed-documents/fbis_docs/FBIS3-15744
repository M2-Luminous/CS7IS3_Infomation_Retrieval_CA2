This was stated to journalists by Russian President Boris Yeltsin following the wreath-laying ceremony at Yuriy Gagarin's tomb at the Kremlin Wall. Boris Yeltsin noted that "we have enough grain to last us until the new harvest." He also emphasized that whereas three years ago "we talked about famine, today we are saying that food will be fully provided." The Russian president also said that currently "we are interested in achieving variety and quality to match foreign standards, as well as in tackling the issue of prices." "This is what we will be working on," the president stressed.
