The agreements came amid annual bargaining between the ministry's budget drafters, the Defense Agency and the Foreign Ministry prior to government approval of the fiscal 1994 state budget, slated to come during a cabinet meeting Tuesday. On Thursday, the ministry proposed fiscal 1994 Official Development Assistance (ODA) spending of 1.05 trillion yen, up by a record low 4.0 percent over the initial fiscal 1993 ODA budget. The agreed-upon budgetary revival calls for adding 1.09 billion yen for Japan's refugee assistance program and an additional 1.7 billion yen for grants to poor countries. The agreements also authorize the Defense Agency to spend an additional 273 million yen to finance a noise abatement program to ease the troubles of residents in areas surrounding U.S. or Japanese military bases, the officials said. The ministry earlier proposed a defense budget of 4.68 trillion yen, up 0.8 percent over the initial fiscal 1993 budget. It was the first time in 34 years that the growth of Japan's defense budget failed to rise above the 1-percent mark, the officials said. In fiscal 1960, Japan's defense budget eked out a tiny 0.6 percent rise. The ministry also approved additional spending of 424 million yen to finance a personnel training and recruitment program for the self-defense forces, they said. The budget drafters have been in negotiations with officials from other ministries and agencies since Friday after the ministry Thursday proposed a 73.08 trillion yen draft budget for the next fiscal year that will start on April 1. The draft budget projects a mere 1.0 percent growth but virtually shrinks from the initial fiscal 1993 budget. In Saturday's negotiations, the Finance Ministry also approved the restoration of a 140 million yen budget request made by the environment agency for improving environmental information systems. Among other restorations of budget requests, the ministry approved the Health and Welfare Ministry's request for a 1,150 million yen budget for improving the infrastructure for the handicapped and the elderly.
