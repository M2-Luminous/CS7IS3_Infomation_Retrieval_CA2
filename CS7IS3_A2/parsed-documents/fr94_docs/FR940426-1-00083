FR940426-1-00083 FR940426-1-00008 EPA also recognizes counter-arguments that it should apply a more stringent variant of the section 211(c)(4)(C) approach, without deference to the OTC's view that no more ``reasonable'' and ``practicable'' alternatives to the recommended measure exist. This departure from the section 211(c) approach may be justified by a difference in context between sections 211(c) and 184. In particular, the purpose of preemption under section 211(c) is to preserve national uniformity in EPA fuel regulations, which States can override where ``necessary'' for purposes of achieving attainment. In contrast, under section 184 the OTC is authorized to specify, subject to EPA approval, measures necessary for compliance with the prohibition in section 110(a)(2)(D) of the Act against significant contribution interfering with attainment in any other State. States are already obligated to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D) and are free to choose the control measures to do so; section 184 adds an element of compulsion whereby the OTC may override an objecting State to impose specific ``necessary'' measures. Arguably, EPA deference might be less appropriate for the OTC, which can specify measures overriding the objection of a minority of its member States, and depriving them of their choice of measures to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D). On the other hand, it can be argued that Congress, in enacting section 184, intended the OTC to be given a substantial voice for proposing solutions to the ozone transport problem, even where its solutions override the views of some member States. Moreover, strict insistence on showing that no reasonable and practicable alternatives are available would seem to add little to the States' independent obligation to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D), since States are likely to choose reasonable and practicable means to comply. Still, Congress's own emphasis in the 1990 Amendments on specifying control measures it thought necessary for attainment, in addition to specifying deadlines, may indicate that allowing the OTC to specify additional control measures, even under a strict interpretation of ``necessary,'' is significant. EPA requests comment on whether, if that test should apply, EPA the interpretation of ``necessary'' under section 211(c)(4)(C) should apply here. In addition, EPA requests comment on whether it should defer to the OTC's evaluation of whether ``reasonable'' and ``practicable'' alternatives to the LEV program are available. Finally, EPA is considering how comparative cost-effectiveness and other social and environmental factors should affect its analysis of reasonable and practicable alternatives. One possible approach is that the LEV program would be necessary if it is still needed after all more cost-effective measures are adopted. As noted above, EPA considered cost-effectiveness as a criterion, but not the only criterion, in evaluating the reasonableness of controls under section 211(c)(4)(C). EPA recognizes that other policy reasons may support adoption of control measures that may not appear to be the most cost- effective for purposes of attaining the ozone NAAQS. For example, the socio-economic distribution of the burden of particular measures, employment impacts, and cross-media environmental impacts may affect the choice of control measures. EPA requests comment on how these factors should affect an analysis of alternatives. 2. Magnitude of Reductions As noted above, EPA believes it should address the amount of reductions needed for attainment in the OTR as the first step in evaluating whether the LEV program is necessary. In particular, EPA believes it is important to evaluate what reductions are needed, where they are needed, and when they are needed. In addition, EPA is considering whether it may also consider whether the LEV program is necessary for maintaining the ozone NAAQS even after it is achieved. The OTC addressed the magnitude of reductions necessary for OTR attainment in its response to comments and technical support documents. There, the OTC expressed the belief that the control strategies specifically mandated in the Clean Air Act would not be sufficient for the nonattainment areas in the OTR to achieve and maintain the ozone NAAQS. The OTC believes that more reductions will be needed than the LEV program would generate. Also, the OTC notes that, despite an overall recent decline in the frequency and severity of ozone exceedances, it believes that short term trends have proven inaccurate indicators of long term status. Further, the OTC notes that studies indicate that the trend toward fewer exceedances will reverse without significant additional NO X and VOC control.
