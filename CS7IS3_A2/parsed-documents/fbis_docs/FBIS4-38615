"We plan and, I think, will soon work on a possibility of another meeting of foreign ministers. There is common understanding that this meeting should be held at the Russian representation in Geneva," he said. "State leaders are interested in the initiative of President Boris Yeltsin to hold a special summit on Bosnian settlement. If this summit is not held till mid-June, the Yugoslav problems will be discussed at the Naples meeting of the G7 to be for the first time held as a meeting of the `political eight' with fully-fledged Russian participation in political discussions. This is an opportunity that cannot be missed," said Churkin.
