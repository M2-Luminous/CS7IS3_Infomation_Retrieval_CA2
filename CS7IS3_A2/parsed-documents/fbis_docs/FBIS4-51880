The pipeline, with an annual transport capacity of 2 million tons, has carried tens of millions of tons of headings after its commissioning. Laid in 1975, it stretches 98 kilometres from the Musan iron ore mine, North Hamgyong Province, in the northernmost region of Korea, to the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex, a metallurgical giant in Chongjin. By carrying a large portion of iron headings to the complex, the pipeline lessens the burden of rails and motors. Technicians and workers have laid double lines in the steepest 8 km-long section across the Kumpae ridge and improved the equipment for a higher rate of operation. The great leader President Kim Il-song initiated the laying of this pipeline to fully solve the problem of iron heading transport in keeping with the increasing production capacity at the Musan mining complex and the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex, and wisely led the work. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il took all necessary measures such as the supply of equipment and building machines so that the construction of the long-distance pipeline for the transport of headings could be finished in a short time. And he sent many latest equipment and facilities after the construction of the transport pipeline so that it could fully display its potential.
