Speaking to reporters accompanying him today, he reiterated that it was necessary to form a completely new party through unification of the ruling to establish a two-party system under which changes of power become possible. Foreign Minister Hata said: There are moves toward forming a new party or political alliance in the Diet. But while seeking appropriate ways to deal with elections to be held under the new electoral system, it is necessary to form a new political group to compete with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. His comments indicate he believes it is necessary to unify the ruling parties to establish a two-party system. He was asked what he thought of the view, held by members of different parties within the government, that Prime Minister Hosokawa should lead any such new party. He said: I have no objection to this idea because the prime minister is in charge of the government now. As the deadlock in Diet interpellations is becoming prolonged, support is growing for the possibility of dissolving. Commenting on this, Hata said: Our task is to establish a political system which reflects people's opinions through the new electoral system. We are not in the position of needing to dissolve the Diet in the face of a host of domestic and foreign relations problems. His comment showed he did not want the Diet dissolved under the current electoral system.
