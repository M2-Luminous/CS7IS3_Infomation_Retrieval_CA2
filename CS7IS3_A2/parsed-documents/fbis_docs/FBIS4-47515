This thermochemical reprocessing, or conversion, may improve the use of fuel energy in thermal electric power plants. It may also substantially reduce the amount of fuel used to produce electricity. Consequently, thermal electric power plants may be modernized virtually without reconstruction of existing equipment. Endothermic conversion is found to be more efficient than exothermic, but requires radical retooling. The problem is being examined in conjunction with the US Institute of Gas Technology. Exothermic conversion may be used without retooling. The conversion process is described. Exothermic conversion involves the combustion of natural gas with an insufficient amount of oxygen to convert CH[.sub]4[/] into CO+2H[.sub]2[/]. Endothermic conversion involves conversion of CH[.sub]4[/] into CO and H[.sub]2[/]. The reactions which occur in fuel conversion and changes to existing equipment, which are minimal, are described. In addition, some of the heat of stack gases is used to heat water. Figures 3; table 1; references 3 (Russian).
