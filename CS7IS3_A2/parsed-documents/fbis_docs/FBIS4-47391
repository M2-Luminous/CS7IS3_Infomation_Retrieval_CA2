Estimates are given of the possible changes which may occur with an increase in global temperature by 1-2 and 3-4ï¿½C. Predictions made at the State Hydrological Institute on the basis of paleoclimatic reconstructions of warm epochs of the past are used as climatic scenarios of the future. A model with a monthly computation time interval was used for conversion from the climatic parameters to hydrological characteristics. The increase in temperature and precipitation in the Yenisey basin which began in 1975 indirectly confirms the conclusion that there has been a global warming of climate. At the present time the rate of increase in temperature and precipitation in this region exceeds the computed values for the Earth. However, the increase in the mean annual precipitation has not resulted in a change in annual and seasonal runoff. Under all scenarios of change in the climatic situation runoff in the Yenisey basin will substantially increase. With a climatic warming there will be a seasonal redistribution of runoff and the duration of winter will substantially decrease. The study was made without allowance for the influence of permafrost on the hydrological regime of rivers in the Yenisey basin under conditions of a climatic warming, which would be especially significant with a temperature increase > 2-3ï¿½C.
