Kopeykin and domestic and foreign media, claiming that americium-241, which was discovered after the Chernobyl breakdown, is far more dangerous than cesium, strontium, and plutonium, were the reasons behind a press conference held recently at the Ministry for Chernobyl Issues. The reports also indicated that measures applied after the Chernobyl catastrophe should be reexamined, including the possibility of evacuating certain districts of Kiev. In the opinion of B. Prister, first deputy minister for Chernobyl issues, who headed the press conference, as well as of other Ukrainian specialists and scientists, the reports on the americium threat are groundless. Studies have shown that the volume of this element--which was discovered in 1944--does not exceed previous readings. Compared with cesium, strontium, or plutonium, its contribution to the radioactive pollution is insignificant, however, whereas the radioactivity of cesium and strontium will be gradually decreasing, the radioactivity of americium and other elements will increase. Nevertheless, according to our scientists, even when the maximum radiation level of americium is reached, which will be by the year 2050, its concentration in the Dnepr river will be so low, that this will be an exclusively scientific problem.
