Yan Zhixiang made the above remarks at today's national work conference on civil aviation's flight safety. He said this year the character "strictness" will be emphasized in civil aviation's safety work. He called for practising strict management, for formulating strict rules and standards, for strict enforcement of discipline, and for applying the character of "strictness" in all areas of the civil aviation work. Under the condition of a fierce market competition, he called on all to guard against the tendency of only paying attention to development to the neglect of safety; to overcome the tendency of stressing production management to the neglect of safety; to overcome the tendency of stressing efficiency to the neglect of safety; and to give safety top priority at all time. Yan Zhixiang pointed out the need to adopt resolute organizational measures against units which are poorly managed, which are poorly led, and which are beset with serious safety problems and to sternly call to account the leaders of those units. In the future, he said, one of the main criteria for evaluating and promoting cadres should be made to evaluate their attaching importance to the safety work and to their ability to do a good safety work.
