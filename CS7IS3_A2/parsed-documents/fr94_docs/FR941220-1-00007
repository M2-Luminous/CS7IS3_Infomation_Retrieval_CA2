FR941220-1-00007 FR941220-1-00003 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;168&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Model ATP Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Jetstream Model ATP airplanes. This proposal would require installation of modified engine de-ice timers, modification of the electrical wiring for the duct heat of the engine air intake, and installation of a time delay for the de-ice system in the air intake duct of the right engine. This proposal would also require associated revisions to the Airplane Flight Manual. This proposal is prompted by reports of ice that accreted in the engine air intake ducts and was ingested into the engine; this resulted in engine power rollback (loss of engine power). The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent loss of multiple engine power during flight in icing conditions. DATES: Comments must be received by January 31, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;168&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
