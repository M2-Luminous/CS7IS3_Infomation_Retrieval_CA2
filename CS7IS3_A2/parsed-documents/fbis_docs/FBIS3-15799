Yavlinskiy attributed that not only to Russia's nuclear potential, but also to its geopolitical situation. The "Yabloko" leader also spelled out to Richard Nixon his vision of the problems facing economic and political reform in Russia, Western assistance, and the Russian Federation's place in world politics.
