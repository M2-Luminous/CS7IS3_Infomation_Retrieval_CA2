Hector Arenas reports: [Arenas] The Guatemalan Government has asked the Spanish Government for support to try to attain a definitive peace agreement this year in talks it is holding in Mexico with the guerrilla movement. Negotiations started in Spain, in El Escorial [near Madrid], a few years ago. The request for support was made by recently appointed Guatemalan Foreign Minister Marithza Ruiz de Vielman during a short stay in Madrid, in which she held a meeting with Foreign Minister Javier Solana. The Guatemalan minister described the meeting as being very positive. [Begin de Vielman recording] We find it positive that they are very favorable to the beginning of this new phase, and we believe that Spain will be among those countries watching this process closely, and that they will support us. [end recording] [Arenas] Also, during this meeting Guatemala asked the European countries to lift present restrictions on the import of tropical fruit, especially bananas. Finally, the Guatemalan minister said that reports last week on the alleged plotting of a coup d'etat against President Leon Carpio were lies.
