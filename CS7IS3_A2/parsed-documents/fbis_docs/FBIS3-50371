"Muslim Army Commander Rasim Delic reiterated threats against the Serb side on 25 January, while Muslim Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic spoke of the concept of continuing the war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina on 26 January", Karadzic said in his letter to Butrus-Ghali. "At the same time, Alija Izetbegovic is visiting Muslim countries and is asking for their help, which makes us believe that--despite their pretense that they want to negotiate--the Muslims really never gave up their aspiration for the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina", Karadzic stresses. According to Karadzic, this aspiration is "in conflict with the interests of the Serbian and Croatian people in Bosnia." Recalling that the Serbs and the Croats signed an agreement on the exchange of official representatives during the last round of Geneva negotiations in order to resolve the disagreements through political means, Karadzic notes that the Muslims were also asked to sign a similar agreement, but did not respond. "Muslim demands regarding territorial borders in eastern and western Bosnia, which caused the breakup of the negotiating process, rendered futile the cochairmen's attempts to achieve a result in the peace process that would satisfy all three sides in the conflict". In his warning to Butrus-Ghali that Izetbegovic's strategic objective is to halt the peace process, Karadzic notes that Izetbegovic was essentially trying to buy time for importing weapons and strengthening the military option. "Tuzla airport is intended to be used for arms smuggling, which would cause new incidents, for which--as usual--the Serbs would be blamed", Karadzic warns and points out that the problem of humanitarian aid deliveries can be resolved by widening the land corridor to Tuzla. "Although humanitarian deliveries would double this way, Muslim authorities still insist on opening Tuzla airport in an attempt to create a crisis spot", Karadzic says, and adds that the "problem" of replacing UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops in Srebrenica has also proven to be another Muslim insinuation. "This, however, does not decrease the possibility of air strikes against the Serbs, despite the fact that such an act could be catastrophic and could cause far-reaching complications". Karadzic goes on to say: "If we are attacked, we will exercise our legitimate right to self-defense, in which we will use all available forces". "Now that Muslim intolerance is the only obstacle to peace, I cannot understand why the international community should discuss such an absurd step for achieving absurd objectives," Karadzic says. He adds that the Serbs have fought simply to be able to live on the land they had succeeded in preserving through six centuries of despotism under the Turkish and Austro-Hungarian empires. "We shall fight for another six centuries if need be, but we can have peace as early as tomorrow, provided the rights of each side are respected", Karadzic says to Ghali. In the conclusion of his letter the president of the Serb Republic calls on the UN secretary general to do his utmost to encourage U.S. diplomacy to clearly underline to the Muslim government in Sarajevo the advantage of peace and the dangers of continuing the war.
