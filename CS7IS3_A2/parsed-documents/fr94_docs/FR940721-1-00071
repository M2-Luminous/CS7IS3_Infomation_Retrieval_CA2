FR940721-1-00071 FR940721-1-00014 (b) Comments from Supporters of the Final Rule's Disclosure Statement. The Department received detailed comments on controlled business disclosure policy from more than a dozen commenters who supported the final rule in most of its particulars. Typically, these commenters believed that the form and level of detail of disclosure of controlled business arrangements that were in the final rule were ``more than adequate'' to permit informed choice by consumers concerning settlement service providers. Several commenters pointed out that the required form of disclosure appeared to exceed the statutory disclosure requirements in several respects. One, the commenters urged that the statute required only that the ``existence'' of a financial interest be disclosed, while the regulation required that the disclosure outline the ``ownership and financial interest.'' Two, the regulation requires that all disclosures, not just those related to costs, be made in writing. Three, the regulations require separate disclosure of controlled business relationships. Finally, the ``suggested format'' for the disclosure (although not the regulation itself) includes the caution: ``You may be able to get these services at a lower rate by shopping with other settlement service providers.'' Most commenters who raised these points did not address them as objections to, or criticisms of, the 1992 final rule. Instead, these observations were cited as indications that, in the commenters' views, the rule already was suitably attentive to consumer protection concerns, in that it went beyond bare-bones statutory disclosure requirements. Several of these comments went on to urge that the Department continue to limit its RESPA regulations to disclosure-related concerns, and not bend to the will of advocates of other methods of regulating or curbing controlled business arrangements: RESPA is predicated on the belief that consumers, when provided with appropriate disclosures, are capable of making informed decisions. Those who argue otherwise frequently do so only to protect their competitive position, not to advance the interests of consumers. *␣*␣* [T]he information contained in the existing controlled business arrangement disclosures is sufficient and the requirements should not be disturbed. The Federal Reserve Board's comment agreed that the controlled business disclosure policy set out in the rule and the format were ``more than adequate'' as disclosures. ``*␣*␣* [I]f anything, it may be over-disclosing given the quantity of information that a consumer receives when applying for a mortgage loan.'' A few lender-commenters expressed a similar view. The Federal Reserve suggested that the consumer needs to know that the two parties involved in the referral are related, but may not need further details. While the Federal Reserve agreed it is important that the consumer know that use of the provider is not required, it suggested that including the estimated charges for the service was ``redundant,'' since such costs would have been disclosed on the Good Faith Estimate. One lender argued that controlled business arrangements arise in a variety of situations, and that it is ``impossible'' to mandate the use of a form that is suitable for all providers in all situations. The commenter asked the Department to provide for flexibility concerning format, ``as long as consumers are informed of the referral and the relationship between the parties.'' 5 5 The same commenter, a lender, asked for more flexibility in the timing of the controlled business disclosure. Many referrals do not occur at face-to-face meetings between the consumer and the referring party, the commenter suggested, and asked that the rule clarify that the service provider be required to furnish a disclosure ``at the time of the initial contact between the consumer and the provider.'' Another comment urged that the controlled business disclosure form not be required for disclosure of the specific providers of ``lender required services such as credit reports, appraisals, [or] flood plain searches.'' The commenter suggested that early disclosure of the identity of these providers was impractical and provided ``absolutely no benefit to the consumer.'' The information, the commenter concluded, would appear on the HUD&hyph;1 Settlement Statement. The most frequent criticism of the rule's controlled business disclosure requirements from commenters supportive of the rule was that, in some instances, it was unclear when a controlled business arrangement was required to be disclosed. Several commenters asked whether the disclosure was required when a bank has a wholly-owned subsidiary mortgage company or when a mortgage company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the same holding company as the bank. The situations in which related businesses were required to make disclosure also were questioned. One commenter asked whether, if a bank is affiliated with a mortgage company by common ownership, the bank has to make disclosures to consumers in the following circumstances: •When a consumer is directly referred to the mortgage company for a mortgage loan; •When the consumer is simply informed of the availability of loans from the mortgage company; and •When the bank includes references to the mortgage company in its advertising or its brochures. One commenter, stating that the entire category of ``referrals'' was not intended to fall within the coverage of the controlled business arrangement rules, recommended creation of an exemption to the controlled business arrangement rules for ```referrals' between bank holding companies' wholly-owned subsidiaries.'' Two commenters asserted that failing to provide this exemption would be placing mortgage companies within bank holding companies at a competitive disadvantage when compared to bank mortgage departments. ``The purpose of RESPA is not to dictate the form in which a bank structures its lending business.'' (c) Position Taken in the Proposed Rule on the Controlled Business Disclosure Statement. The Secretary concluded that the elimination of the employer-employee exception would, in turn, eliminate a number of the strongest concerns regarding the information in the controlled business disclosure. However, the Secretary has accepted some suggestions for modifications to the disclosure as useful and beneficial to the consumer. Accordingly, certain of these suggestions have been included in the proposed rule and in the format of Appendix D. The suggested borrower-acknowledgement box has been added to the controlled business disclosure format. Additional plain language has been added to the format. Section 3500.15(b) proposes a requirement that disclosure be given at a time to be relevant to the consumer: either (i) at the time of referral or no earlier than 3 days before; or (ii) if the lender requires the use of a particular provider, the time of the loan application. The preamble of revisions that extended RESPA coverage to subordinate lien transactions (59 FR 6505, 6510, February 10, 1994) also discussed the appropriateness of disclosures, stating that ``incidental and uncompensated referrals, such as brochures in a bank lobby or street directions given by a bank employee, are not perceived as rising to the level necessary to require a controlled business disclosure.'' More sweeping modification of the controlled business disclosure form is not considered necessary. While many commenters disparaged the use of written disclosure as a means of coping with perceived controlled business-related problems, the Department continues to believe that full disclosure is useful as a means of informing consumers. Disclosure is also a preeminent principle of the RESPA statute. V. Other Matters Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, other than those impacts specifically required to be applied universally by the RESPA statute.
