Police claimed demonstrators had opened fire first. The crowds had gathered at the family's Al-Murtaza residence in Larkana to take part in ceremonies marking the 66th anniversary of the birth of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, former Pakistan leader and founder of the ruling Pakistan People's Party, who was hanged in 1979. Fearing clashes between rival Bhutto family factions, police had cordoned off the premises and set up check points in the city to prevent Murtaza's backers from reaching the graveyard where his father is buried until after Benazir Bhutto had paid her respects. Murtaza, arrested in November on charges of terrorism during the 11-year rule of late general Mohammed Zia-ul-Haq, was refused parole to visit the grave by a Karachi court. A slogan-chanting crowd suddenly emerged from Al-Murtaza, where Benazir Bhutto's estranged mother Nusrat Bhutto was staying, and tried to march to the grave site 17 kilometers (10 miles) away, witnesses said. Another group from the city tried to link up by forcing their way through a police barricade towards the residence. Senior Superintendent of Police, Bashir Memon, said police opened fire only after they were fired on by demonstrators, an allegation denied by sources close to Nusrat Bhutto. Her spokesman said the premises came under a "hail of bullets" and witnesses said numerous bullet marks could be seen in the gate and walls of the house. "The incident was worse than anything experienced in the darkest days of Ziaul-Haq," said one of her supporters. Members of her personal staff, whose hands were stained with blood, claimed at least two of the wounded were shot inside the family compound. "One of the boys injured in the incident was shot in the back while he was talking to someone at the gate. The car trying to take him to hospital was also fired upon by the police," said provincial Senator Makhdoom Khaliquzzaman. Police had surrounded the house, allowing no one in or out, after reports that Nusrat Bhutto was planning to go to the grave in a procession, officials said. "For security reasons we could not allow miscreants to accompany Begum Nusrat Bhutto," to the Garhi Khuda Bakhsh graveyard, said Memon. During the clashes two police were seized by demonstrators. One was still being held, said police chief Memon. Earlier Benazir Bhutto had visited her father's grave amid top security. Police ringed the graveyard within a radius of 20 kilometers (12 miles). She was accompanied by members of the Pakistan People's Party's central executive committee, federal ministers and MPs. Tight security kept reporters away from the premier who appeared composed. She stayed about 30 minutes and left without incident. The Bhutto family has become increasingly divided in recent months. Benazir has kept her distance from Murtaza since his return to Pakistan in November from 16 years of self-exile in Syria. Her mother, however, has actively supported him. The two women clashed last month when Benazir ousted her mother from the presidency of the ruling people's party. Nusrat maintained that her husband before he died had made her the party's president for life. It was not clear whether Nusrat would go later to pray at her husband's gave. "She is ill and running a high temperature, said her spokesman.
