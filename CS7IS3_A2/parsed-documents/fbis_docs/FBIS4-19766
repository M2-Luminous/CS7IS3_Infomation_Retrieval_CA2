The law foresees the establishment of a radio and television high board to control and oversee the media. The multi partisan board will be composed of nine members: five from the ruling party and four from opposition parties and will be nominated by parliament. The board will function for six years and three of its members will be replaced every two years. The board will delegate national and regional frequencies, will issue broadcast licenses, will allocate channels and will monitor the compliance of radio and tv broadcasts to international agreements. The board will be responsible for making sure that the broadcasts are in compliance with the expression of thought, the existence, independence and unity of the Turkish State, pluralism in communication and broadcasting, national and ethical values, and the basic concepts and principles of the republic as stated in the Constitution. The amount of advertisement will not exceed 15 percent of daily broadcasting time. The broadcasts will not be subjected to a ban or censorship by the board, unless by court verdicts. However, the prime minister or a minister charged by the prime minister will be authorized to interrupt a broadcast when national security issues clearly necessitate it or there is a very high likelihood that the public order could be damaged. Radio and TV stations will be responsible for broadcasting announcements made by the president or the government on national security, public order, general health and general ethics.
