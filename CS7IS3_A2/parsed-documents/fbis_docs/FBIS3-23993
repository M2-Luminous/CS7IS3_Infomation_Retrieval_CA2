The oblast administration decided to take this step in connection with a sharp decrease in the extraction of gold. As Oleg Ivanov, chairman of the territorial Committee on Geology and Utilization of the Mineral Resources of Novosibirsk and Omsk Oblasts (Novosibgeolkom), stated in an exclusive interview for KOMMERSANT-DAILY, several areas of gold deposits exist in the territory of Maslyaninskiy Rayon, Novosibirsk Oblast. The gold is contained in river sediment (alluvial deposits). According to Novosibgeolkom data, extraction volumes of the high-purity gold (950-990 pure) in 1993 amounted to 84 kilograms--less than the 1990 volume by a factor of 2.2. In Ivanov's opinion, the drop in gold extraction can be explained through insufficient funds of gold prospecting cooperatives and the poor organization of their work. Mr. Ivanov did not rule out the possibility of an auction being conducted for the right of exploitation of the alluvial gold deposit areas, as envisaged by the Law on Mineral Resources. In such event, Novosibirsk Oblast would be one of the first in Russia to test the auction scenario although, as the Novosibgeolkom chairman emphasized, this alternative "has a number of significant deficiencies." In his opinion, conduct of an auction does not preclude the possibility that licenses will be acquired at random by private individuals uninterested in extracting gold and only capable of acting as intermediaries. In Mr. Ivanov's words, particular features of the Novosibirsk gold deposits make them suitable for development by small enterprises and gold prospecting cooperatives, insofar as the extraction of gold at them does not require significant financial investments. The main participants in the competitions and auctions will most likely be five or six prospecting cooperatives and enterprises of Novosibirsk Oblast. Mr. Ivanov stated that enterprises of Novosibirsk Oblast exclusively will be permitted to participate in the competitions, and that the list of gold deposit areas designated for tender (auction) would be published in the mass media following coordination with the Novosibirsk Oblast Administration.
