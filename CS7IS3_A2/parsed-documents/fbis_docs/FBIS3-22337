The department's spokesman denied a report of the South Korean agency YONHAP, published on Wednesday, quoting anonymous sources as saying that the Russian Government has allegedly told Seoul and Tokyo that it will inevitably dump into the open sea the nuclear waste from atomic submarines unless other ways of its disposal could be found. The agency claims that the Seoul government does not even consider offering material support to Russia in building facilities for recycling this waste because the question of recovery of Russia's arrears in repaying South Korean credits has not yet been resolved. In this respect, the representative of the South Korean Foreign Ministry said that these allegations "do not reflect at all the real stance" of the government of the Republic of Korea. The possibility of offering help to Russia is now being considered, he said, refusing, however, to go into further detail. According to him, such reports divorced from reality, which appear in the South Korean press, "bring nothing but deterioration of the relations between the two countries."
