FBIS4-6727 "dreas077_i_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-077 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 Cambodia * CPP Paper Supports Ranariddh's View of Democracy * CPP Paper Supports Ranariddh's View of Democracy 11111111 11111111 CSO [Editorial Report] The "Political Viewpoint" column on pages 1,2 of the 27 Feb 94 PRACHEACHON carries a 700-word article entitled "What To Do To Get Real Democracy." The author, Im Sonchearea, somments that democracy is not simply the right of freedom of expression, a free press, or freedom to stage demonstrations. Nor is it something that can be imported from abroad and applied 100 percent in Cambodia. The writer views democracy as tied to the availability of employment and says that each country must create democracy by itself. The author sees as "very correct" First Prime Minister Ranariddh's "recent" comments in which he said that "Democracy is not just the freedom of expression, but also rests on [people] being educated, happy, and proper attention being paid to avoiding cleavages between rich and poor." The author comments that if the gap between haves and have-nots is large, true democracy will not exist for long. True democracies abroad do not merely have freedom of expression, but also a gap between rich and poor "that does not keep growing." The writer says that in Cambodia "if this gap continues, it will be impossible to stamp out corruption, people's happiness will certainly be threatened... and democracy will be simply a matter of lip service."
