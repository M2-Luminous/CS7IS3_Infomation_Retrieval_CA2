Boudewijn, you have moved into the city. What have you seen and what have you been doing there? [Van Spilbeeck] Well, Nadine, this morning we moved into the city with a convoy of Belgian and French paratroopers to pick up the last Western refugees from the French School. This means that the evacuation for Kigali, from the capital, has been completed. All the refugees came with us. We had all kinds of vehicles at our disposal from various aid organizations as well as from UNAMIR [UN Mission in Rwanda] and from the Belgians and the French, and everybody has boarded these vehicles. It was a difficult journey, a long journey, as a part of the city is off limits because of the fighting there. So, quite a detour had to made. During the trip, the convoy came under fire. Rwandan troops on an Army truck driving behind us returned the fire. A couple of French paratroopers also shot a few rounds. It was quite a journey. But the evacuation is finished now. This morning, and this may be good news for those people that have family in the Rwandan interior, a Belgian convoy with armored personnel carriers has moved southward to pick up some 20 people. If this turns out to be successful, it may be repeated toward the north in the coming days. [Desloovere] Boudewijn, the situation apparently is worsening. The rebels reportedly are involved in heavy fighting with the Army. What actually is going on? [Van Spilbeeck] Indeed. Yesterday, upon our arrival, there was heavy artillery fire. I already told you that yesterday. It calmed down during the night. But this morning there has been extremely heavy shelling and machine gun fire in the northeast of the city in the neighborhood of the Amaholo where the UNAMIR peacekeeping forces have their headquarters, and the neighborhood of the parliament, obviously, where those 600 or possibly already 800 rebels have dug in. Those rebels apparently are advancing. There is very heavy fighting and everybody here is afraid that, once all the Westerners have left, it really will deteriorate and may become kind of a Somalia or Liberia. [Desloovere] The government, the interim government, reportedly has fled Kigali. Do you know anything about that? [Van Spilbeeck] I have also heard that, but I could not confirm this rumor. Indeed, those people should also be on the run. That government did not represent many parties. It was comprised mainly of people from the entourage of the dead president, and it could be expected that they would not be able to hold out. [Desloovere] Thank you, Boudewijn.
