The record number of interpellators came from his belief that legislators should be spokespersons for the people. Omi, 58, is a House of Representatives legislator of Komeito [Clean Government Party] backed by the Buddhist group Soka Gakkai, an influential party in the coalition government. He succeeded Satsuki Eda of the United Social Democratic Party (USDP). Some party members said he is earnest and warmhearted. Born and brought up in Osaka, Omi has been elected from the No.3 constituency in Osaka Prefecture nine times since 1967, but he has not held any conspicuous post in the party. In 1967, the third Komeito Chairman Yoshikatsu Takeiri, the forth Chairman Junya Yano and the fifth and current Chairman Koshiro Ishida were also elected lower house members for the first time.
