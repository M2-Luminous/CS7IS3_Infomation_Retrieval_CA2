Among the priorities are broad involvement of the population in the process of reforms by means of developing the securities market, creating public joint-stock companies with a reduction in the proportion of shares belonging to the state, and forming markets for real estate and means of production. Another priority is the demonopolization of production and control structures and the attraction of foreign investments by holding tenders, auctions, investment auctions, and direct sale of property. The decree stresses the need for state support for privatized enterprises. For public joint-stock companies in which the state retains its share, it is envisioned to have blocs of shares belonging to the state, to the work force, to foreign partners, and free selling on stock exchanges and securities markets, including those abroad.
