The PWC's Government and Administration Group will begin discussions on the formation of new district boards and municipal councils after 1997. The PWC's Government and Administration Group leader Leung Chun- ying said last night, that Hong Kong's post-1997 administration would only be discussed in principle and it was unlikely any concrete proposals would be formed. China would not be making a final decision on the structure of Hong Kong's future government until the preparatory committee meets in 1996. Earlier, China had reiterated its warning that talks on Hong Kong's political future could resume only if Governor Chris Patten withdrew his constitutional reform bill from the Legislative Council. "The door of the talks is open," Chinese Foreign Ministry official Wu Jianmin said. "If the British side wants the talks to be restored, it must withdraw that portion of the package submitted to the Legislative Council." He said China's position on resuming the talks remained unchanged. But Patten has refused to withdraw his partial bill, although he has not abandoned the possibility of further talks. Patten will meet British Foreign Minister Alistair Goodlad today, to discuss his political reform agenda. He will also hold crucial talks with Prime Minister John Major and other Cabinet ministers in London, later this month, to examine the options. It is believed he will table the second phase of his package, covering more controversial arrangements for the 1995 elections, in March if talks do not resume. China has sent official word to London through diplomatic channels, that talks will not continue on 29 December [date as published]. The political party, Meeting Point have said that Patten planned to disclose full details of the 17 rounds of unsuccessful Sino- British talks when he tabled the rest of his reforms. China has threatened to disband the three-tiers of government after 1997 unless Patten withdraws his proposals. A group of City Polytechnic students demonstrated on campus last night, to protest against the PWC, when officials from China's de- facto embassy in Hong Kong arrived for a function. The students called for a dissolution of the PWC, saying it was not representative of the Hong Kong public.
