The document points out that the desire of Georgian peoples to get rid of everything that is negative and "alien to a socialist way of life" has not been fulfilled. In the opinion of the document's authors, "by the ambitions of Georgia's national-liberation movement and with an active support from former communists, the country has been thrown back to feudalist fragmentation." Georgia, the document says, has become a beggar on an international scale, and its people, proud and happy in the not so distant past, are currently suffering from hunger and poverty. The GCWP Central Committee thinks that the policy of denying any protection and depriving the population of the right to exist amounts to a downright genocide and extermination of one's own people. All this is the reason for an unrestrained outflow of the population, including Georgians, from the country. Georgia's true communists, the document says, do have a plan for overcoming the crisis. "We are ready to assume responsibility for the fate of the country, but for this to be done we must become a party that has parliamentary seats" -- is how the party's immediate prospects are described. "By joint efforts, in an open dialogue let us expose the doings and true political faces of demagogues, idle talkers, and turncoats both within the parliament walls and outside them." The GCWP Central Committee urged people to elect its representatives to official posts. So far it is hard to say what influence the GCWP may have on various sectors of the population, but the documents it has been issuing come to the attention of many people. In a number of Georgian regions former party activists are trying to resuscitate district and city organizations of the Georgian Communist Party.
