The statement says that similar actions "destabilize the situation in the Balkans, internationalize the conflict, which is the internal affair of the state structures formed on the basis of the former republics of Yugoslavia." The statement says that the world wars of the 20th Century were unleashed in the Balkans and adds that the "Russian people support their Serb brothers." Liberal Democratic party chairman Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is currently in Strasburg where the Russian parliamentary delegation takes part in the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe.
