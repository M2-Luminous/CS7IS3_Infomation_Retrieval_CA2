The permit holders own 19,000 handguns, 5,000 rifles, and 1,000 small-caliber firearms. M. Dohnal of the Prague police told reporters this yesterday. Last year, in comparison with 1992, the number of arms-permit applications doubled. According to Dohnal, this is caused by the growing number of businessmen who want to protect their property. The Interior Ministry is drafting a law on arms and ammunition. It should do away with the so-called group arms permits (there are 800-900 of them in Prague) and require special training for applicants for individual permits and a psychological assessment. The policeman, unlike the legislators, believes that a permit should also be required for crossbows, which he described as very precise, quiet, and deadly. The law should go into effect at the beginning of next year. The theft of firearms is alarming; approximately 10 disappear in Prague every day.
