ACTION: Proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') is publishing for comment proposed amendments to Rule 15c2&hyph;12 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), which would make it unlawful for a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer to act as an underwriter of an issue of municipal securities unless the broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer has reasonably determined that the issuer or its designated agent has undertaken in a written agreement or contract for the benefit of the holders of such municipal securities to provide certain information to a nationally recognized municipal securities information repository; or to recommend the purchase or sale of a municipal security, without having reviewed the information the issuer of the municipal security has undertaken to provide. The purpose of the proposed amendments is to further deter fraud and manipulation in the municipal securities market by prohibiting the underwriting and subsequent recommendation of securities for which adequate information is not available. DATES: Comments must be received on or before July 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted in triplicate to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. All comment letters should refer to File No. S7&hyph;5&hyph;94.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction In a recent report to Congress, 1 the staff of the Division of Market Regulation (``Staff'') reviewed many aspects of the municipal securities market, including whether opportunities exist for overreaching and investor deception. The Staff found that investors need sufficient current information about issuers and significant obligors to better protect themselves from fraud and manipulation, to better evaluate offering prices, to decide which municipal securities to buy, and to decide when to sell. 2 Moreover, the Staff found that the growing participation of individuals as both direct and indirect purchasers of municipal securities underscores the need for sound recommendations by brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers. 3 1 Securities and Exchange Commission, Division of Market Regulation, Staff Report on the Municipal Securities Market (Sept. 1993) (`` Staff Report ''). The Staff Report was prepared at the request of the Hon. John D. Dingell, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, United States House of Representatives, and the Hon. Edward Markey, Chairman, Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, United States House of Representatives. Among the topics discussed in the Staff Report were political contributions, sales practices, transparency, audit trails, issuer disclosure, and the regulatory structure for municipal securities. See Letter from Hon. John D. Dingell, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, and Hon. Edward Markey, Chairman, Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance to: Mary L. Schapiro, Acting Chairman, SEC; Christopher A. Taylor, Executive Director, Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``MSRB''); and Joseph R. Hardiman, President and Chief Executive Officer, National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') (May 24, 1993). 2 Staff Report , supra note 1 at 38. 3 Id . at 28. Based on these findings, the Staff recommended that the Commission use its interpretive authority to provide guidance regarding the disclosure required by the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. 4 Today, in a companion release, 5 the Commission is interpreting the disclosure obligations of municipal securities issuers. The Companion Release also addresses the obligations under the antifraud provisions of brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers who underwrite and sell municipal securities, and the information dissemination requirements of Rule 15c2&hyph;12. 6 4 Id . at 40. Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''), and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b&hyph;5 promulgated thereunder, apply to ``persons,'' including issuers of municipal securities. 5 Securities Act Release No. 7049, Exchange Act Release No. 33741, FR&hyph;42 (March 9, 1994) (``Companion Release''). 6 17 CFR 240.15c2&hyph;12. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26100 (Sept. 22, 1988), 53 FR 37778 (``Proposing Release''); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26985 (June 28, 1989), 54 FR 28799 (``Adopting Release''). Rule 15c2&hyph;12 requires an underwriter of municipal securities (1) to obtain and review an issuer's official statement that, except for certain information, is ``deemed final'' by an issuer, prior to making a purchase, offer, or sale of municipal securities; (2) in negotiated sales, to provide the issuer's most recent preliminary official statement (if one exists) to potential customers; (3) to deliver to customers, upon request, copies of the final official statement for a specified period of time; and (4) to contract to receive, within a specified time, sufficient copies of the issuer's final official statement to comply with the rule's delivery requirement, and the requirements of MSRB rules. Rule 15c2&hyph;12 also contains specific exemptions for three types of municipal securities offerings. In addition, the Staff recommended in the Staff Report that Rule 15c2&hyph;12 be amended, or that similar rules be adopted, to prohibit municipal securities dealers from recommending outstanding municipal securities unless the issuer has committed to make available ongoing information regarding its financial condition. 7 This release proposes to implement the Staff's recommendation. 7 Staff Report , supra note 1 at 40. See also Testimony of Arthur Levitt, Chairman, SEC, Concerning the Municipal Securities Market, Before the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, Committee on Energy and Commerce, United States House of Representatives (Sept. 9, 1993) at 5&hyph;7; Remarks of Arthur Levitt, Chairman, SEC, The Bond Buyer Ethics in Public Finance Conference (Jan. 24, 1994) at 6; Remarks of Richard Y. Roberts, Commissioner, SEC, ``Alternatives for Improving Municipal Secondary Market Disclosure,'' The Southern Municipal Finance Society 13th Annual Fall Conference (Sept. 15, 1993) at 9&hyph;12. Section 15(c)(2) of the Exchange Act prohibits municipal securities dealers from effecting any transaction in, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of, any municipal security by means of a ``fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative act or practice.'' 8 This section specifically authorizes the Commission to promulgate rules and regulations to define, and prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent, such acts and practices. Pursuant to this authority, the Commission adopted Rule 15c2&hyph;12 in 1989 for the purpose of preventing fraud by enhancing the quality, timing, and dissemination of disclosure in the municipal securities market. 9 8 Exchange Act Section 15(c)(2), 15 U.S.C. 78 o (c)(2). 9 See Adopting Release, supra note 6 at 54 FR 28800. The Commission proposes to amend Rule 15c2&hyph;12 to further deter fraud and manipulation in the primary and secondary municipal securities markets by prohibiting the underwriting and subsequent recommendation of securities for which adequate information is not available. 10 For many years, the courts and the Commission have emphasized that, under the antifraud provisions, a broker-dealer recommending securities to investors implies by its recommendation that it has an adequate basis for making the recommendation. 11 In the Proposing Release and the Adopting Release, the Commission discussed broker-dealers' obligation to have a reasonable belief in the accuracy of statements made when underwriting securities. 12 When recommendations in the secondary market are made, they must be based on information that is up-to-date and accessible. 10 Under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, issuer disclosure not only must be accurate in all material respects, but also must not omit information necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances, not misleading. The proposed amendment will assist issuers in satisfying their obligations under the antifraud provisions by creating a mechanism for the dissemination of primary and secondary market disclosure. See Companion Release, supra note 5 at Section III.A. 11 See e.g. Feeney v. SEC , 564 F.2d 260 (8th Cir. 1977); Cortlandt Investing Corporation , 44 SEC 45 (1969); Crow, Bourman & Chotkin, Inc. , 42 SEC 938 (1966); Shearson, Hammill & Co. , 42 SEC 811 (1965). 12 See Proposing Release, supra note 6 at 53 FR 37787; Adopting Release, supra note 6 at 54 FR 28811.
