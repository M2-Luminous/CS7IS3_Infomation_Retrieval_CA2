According to the Tatarstan President, "this idea is unfeasible and nonviable because the majority of the republics and oblasts in the Volga area (excluding Tatarstan) have signed the Federation Treaty." "It is primarily up to the Russian leadership to think about such problems and also to make sure in particular that the treaties and agreements already signed should work. If these documents only remain on paper, such ideas are bound to persist," Mintimer Shaymiyev said. True, such a position, according to Mr. Shaymiyev, does not refer to the sphere of "small-time diplomacy" -- the conclusion of horizontal accords with neighboring republics and oblasts. Here, on the other hand, in his opinion, "a very interesting development occurs." After the privatization of local enterprises, a substantial portion of shares is retained by the republics' governments. According to Mintimer Shaymiyev, in the very near future "we should think what to do with these shares" and whether it is not a good idea to trade part of them, for instance, for shares of related enterprises in neighboring regions. This form of cooperation and integration, in the Tatarstan President's opinion, will be most effective.
