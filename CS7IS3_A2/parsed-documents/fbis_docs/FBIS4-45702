Attempts by the West to convince them to shut their most suspect nuclear installations are generally countered with arguments that this is not possible until alternative sources of energy are found. Ahead of the Council of EU Foreign Ministers on May 16, which discussed nuclear assistance to the Ukraine, Kiev declared it would need some ECU 6-8 billion to shut down the Chernobyl plant -- more than double the estimate the authorities gave a fortnight earlier. In Slovakia, by contrast, President Michal Kovac declared on 13 May that there were alternatives to a nuclear future for Central and Eastern Europe. Close Chernobyl Campaign On 16 May, French President Francois Mitterrand added his voice to those calling for the aid to halt Chernobyl and other unsafe East European nuclear plants from the Group of Seven major industrialised countries, when their leaders meet in Naples for the Western Economic Summit in July. "These dangers have to be countered, because tens of nuclear installations could explode at any moment," he said. G-7 finance and strong political will were needed to protect the whole of Europe "from catastrophes whose consequences I dare not even imagine," Mr. Mitterand said. May 16 also saw the creation by Belgian scientific and medical experts, including former International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) President Rene Constant, of a Committee for the Closure of Chernobyl. The Committee insists it is "not anti-nuclear." It wants to see the setting up of a European Foundation which will coordinate scientific and technical assistance for decontaminating the Chernobyl region. Eight years after the Chernobyl disaster, underground water contamination from 600 provisional nuclear waste storage sites, the departure of Russian doctors and the fragility of the Ukrainian health system are preventing victims of radiation from receiving proper treatment. East European Nuclear Plans Meanwhile, Bulgaria's National Electricity Company has announced it is to invest a further ECU 200 million to modernise the accident-prone Soviet-style Kozloduy nuclear plant. MEPs have on various occasions voiced fears that the plant can never be brought up to EU safety standards. In Slovakia, the government is envisaging a prolongation of the life of two more Soviet-style VVER 440s at Jaslovske Bohunice until the year 2005. Next year, Romania expects to commission its first nuclear reactor at Cernavoda, on the banks of the Danube and less than 1,000 km from Chernobyl. With EU and international pressure on the Ukraine to close the latter for good and doubts about Kozloduy persisting, the Romanian Government has made no secret of its desire eventually to export its nuclear power to neighbouring countries. The Cernavoda plant, began under the Ceausescu regime in 1981, will cost some ECU 600 million and supply 10 percent of Romania's electricity. Since 1991, an Italian-Canadian consortium brought into the project has spent a third of its time simply checking the work completed previously. The IAEA is keeping a close eye on the proceedings. Austrian Anxieties In the firing line of any future nuclear disaster, prospective EU member Austria is, along with Germany, spearheading calls for the definite closure of existing nuclear plants in neighbouring Central and East European countries and a halt to construction already underway there. Vienna will thus take some comfort from the declaration on 13 May by Slovak President Michal Kovac, who said his long-term aim was a Central Europe without nuclear power plants. "Nuclear energy is not the only alternative" for producing electricity, Mr. Kovac said. The Slovak President's comments came on the eve of a visit to Vienna. He confirmed that the controversial Slovak plant at Bohunice, some 40 kms from the Austrian border, "will be closed down in 2002." However, contrary to Austrian wishes, the more modern Mochovce installation currently under construction to the East of Austria, will still be brought on stream, Mr. Kovac said.
