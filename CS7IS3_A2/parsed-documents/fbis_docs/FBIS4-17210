Russian Crime Assumes International Scale"] [Excerpts] "The increasing number of Russian criminal groups is becoming a global criminal problem that undermines President Boris Yeltsin's reform program, whereas a growth in the Russian drugs mafia is becoming a serious international threat," CIA Director James Woolsey said 20 April. [passage omitted] Nikolay Osipov, deputy chief of the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry's administration for the struggle against illicit drug trafficking, has told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that his agency does not fall under the CIA's jurisdiction, so the CIA chief has no right to set any requirements for it. He disagreed with a passage of James Woolsey's statement about the Russian drug mafia's assisting Colombian and Italian groups. When asked about the quality of his administration's work, Mr. Osipov declined to respond. Officials at the Russian Foreign Ministry's Press and Information Department told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that they do not see James Woolsey's report as intervention in Russian internal policy. In the view of department staffers, all that was said in the report about corruption among government employees was the author's insinuations, because he "has not caught anyone from the Russian government red-handed, nor does he accuse anyone specifically." Yuriy Kobaladze, chief of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] press bureau, sees the CIA chief's report as very competent and approves of his stance on the Russian internal situation. In Mr. Kobaladze's opinion, the facts used in James Woolsey's report largely coincide with what has been reported in open documents drawn up by the Russian authorities, which have been fairly widely publicized. When asked by your correspondent whether the FIS considers this report as improper with regard to the Russian Government, Mr. Kobaladze responded that "the FIS also affords itself to assess actions by the U.S. Government. James Woolsey's statement should be seen only as an attempt to help the Russian Government, not to accuse it."
