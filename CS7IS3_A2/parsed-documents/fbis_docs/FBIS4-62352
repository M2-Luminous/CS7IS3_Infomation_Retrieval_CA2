Zakharov, chairman of the Economic Committee of the Kaliningrad Oblast Administration; place and date not given: "Oblast Economy Is in Alarming Situation" -- first two paragraphs are YANTARNYY KRAY introduction published in boldface] [Text] The results of the social and economic development of our oblast in the first quarter of 1994 have been summarized. We have asked V. Zakharov, chairman of the Economic Committee of the Kaliningrad Oblast Administration, to comment on those results and make a prognosis for the near future. "Comparing the situation in our oblast with that of the northwestern region of Russia (Pskov, Novgorod, and Leningrad Oblasts), it is worth noting that we achieved better results in the production of consumer goods, in the volume of retail commodity circulation, in cargo shipments, and in the financial situation of enterprises. Also, Kaliningrad Oblast, in comparison with Russia as a whole and with the above-mentioned region, has a lower inflation rate. True, the situation in our agricultural sector is worse. "It should be said straightforwardly -- the social and economic situation in our oblast is complex, contradictory, and extremely unstable. In spite of this, we have been able to reduce the rate of consumer price increases from 15-16 percent, in the first quarter of 1993, to 10-12 percent in the first quarter of 1994. The production of sausage, cheese, whole-milk products, and margarine has also increased. Taking into account the cost of 19 basic foodstuffs in April, Kaliningrad occupies 69th place among over 120 Russian cities. Over 45,000 apartments were privatized by our residents. We have more than 700 joint ventures with a total capital of 6.5 million Russian rubles [R]. "Along with this, industrial production, as compared to that in the corresponding period of 1993, dropped 41 percent. The slump in the fuel industry amounted to 8 percent; the food industry -- 17; electricity production -- 22; building materials -- 47; pulp-and-paper industry -- 48; light industry -- 58; and machine-building -- 78. The smallest drop was registered in those branches which satisfy the needs for electricity, fuel, and food. The other branches of the national economy suffered an unprecedented drop in production. "The main problems in industry and other branches of the national economy, as well as in the entire sphere of material production, are the following: a crisis in the realization of products, curtailment of manufacturing or undertaking activities, nonpayments, a high level of hidden unemployment, and inflation. The reduction of jobs should be specified separately. At certain enterprises, jobs were reduced by 22-43 percent. This refers especially to the machine-building sector. At the same time, the number of jobs increased at `Kaliningradmorneftegas,' the `Pregol' ship-repair yard, `AGA-GAS' joint stock companies, and `Yantarenergo.' Employment also increased at enterprises in the building, butter- and cheese-processing, milk-processing, and chemical industries. Thus, a tendency toward transferring labor from one enterprise to another has begun to show. Still -- and I will repeat myself -- the general situation in unemployment is very serious. At the current time, unemployment benefits are being paid to 6,500 people. "An alarming situation can also be seen in the agricultural sector. The number of livestock decreased by 12 percent, the production of meat -- by 22 percent. For example, in Krasnoznamensk and Chernyakhovsk rayons, the production of meat dropped by over 40 percent. Last year's level of production was only preserved in Gusev and Bagrationovsk rayons. The production of milk in the first quarter of 1994, as compared to that of the corresponding period last year, dropped by 24 percent. Difficult problems are also facing the 1994 harvest. As of the middle of April, it was necessary to sow over 100,000 hectares of farmland, including winter crops. "Briefly about the financial situation of enterprises. The cost effectiveness in industry amounted only to 17.5 percent. Notwithstanding the fact that this index is higher than the average for Russia, enterprises -- due to inflation -- will fail to reach the break-even point. Their debt liabilities amount to R130 billion and in credits -- R144 billion (as of 1 April). At the same time, various financial operations carried out by enterprises involve over R15 billion, which is not connected with basic production activities. As of 1 April, the debts of agricultural enterprises to banks amounted to R13 billion. At the same time, significant sums are owed to agricultural producers by the food-processing industry. "Now, about the prognosis for the next three months and the half year as a whole. The main problems in the branches of material production will remain the same as before: sales, nonpayments, a high level of hidden unemployment, lack of turnover means, and halts in production at enterprises. Disruptions in paying wages and a growing tendency toward barter deals will follow. A fall in industrial production will continue. If the problem of nonpayments is resolved by some means, a certain surge in production may be expected. The volume of agricultural production will be around 10-15 percent lower than last year. "The oblast budget will suffer with ever-increasing expenditures connected with the increase in enrollment of the housing sector as well as facilities of social and cultural sphere on the balance sheets of municipalities. Real incomes of the population, as it seems, will be reduced by 10-15 percent in comparison with the first quarter of 1994. A share of expenses for municipal services and foodstuffs will increase in the structure of consumption. An increase in consumer prices will continue. The inflation rate at the end of May and in June-July, in my opinion, will amount to 15-20 percent due to the lack of state credits and repayments of debts to the state. However, there is a danger in that. If the experience with the reckoning of nonpayments and currency emissions is to be repeated, the inflation rate in the third quarter may reach 45-50 percent.
