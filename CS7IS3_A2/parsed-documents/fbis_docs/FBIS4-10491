This brings Ernesto Samper close to the percentage of votes that would determine the presidential elections in the first round. [Begin Samper recording] I think the decision to choose Dr. Humberto de la Calle was predictable, as the report so clearly states. He is a serious, very responsible person, a great constitutionalist, and he is well aware of the country's problems. He guarantees not only a responsible ticket but also the Liberal Party's unity. [end recording] Samper also warned of the risks of being overconfident: [Begin Samper recording] My principal enemy at this moment is overconfidence. I ask all those who have supported me, especially the Liberals, not to ease up in this campaign. The election is not won yet. It is true things are going along very well, but we must do better to exceed the 50 percent needed to win in the first round. [end recording] Samper and Pastrana concentrated their political activities on the Atlantic coast. This area of the country has become a decisive factor in the campaign, given its enormous electoral potential.
