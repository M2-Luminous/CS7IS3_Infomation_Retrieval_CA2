The report notes that the Northern Electricity Company (Edenor) will invest $100 million in 1994 to upgrade networks and service. According to d'Allonney, president of Argentine Electricity (EASA), the private consortium that took over Edenor, the company will show a profit in 1994 if things go as planned. "We knew we would have losses in the first two or three years," explains d'Allonney."We are very close to breaking even and are certain that we will show our first month of profit before the middle of the year." The quality of service, he predicts, will "gradually" reach the same level as in France.
