The proposal of the UN Headquarters for Bosnia-Herzegovina is in accordance with the conclusions of the meeting of the commanders of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the United Nations. It envisages the construction of 66 observation points in the southwest and northeast sectors. The Serbian aggressor's side has not delivered its proposal to the UN Command for Bosnia-Herzegovina yet. The final version on the observation posts can, therefore, be expected at the next meeting. The General Staff of the Supreme Command of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army continues to insist on an improved number and place of deployed UN observers, especially in the Bihac and Gorazde regions. If the observation posts are not set up on the territories temporarily controlled by the Serbian aggressor's side, then we will not accept and allow observation posts to be constructed on the free territory of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, is written in the statement by the Army Press Center. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army proposal on the number of liaison officers and line of administration and command has been accepted in its entirety by the UN Command for Bosnia-Herzegovina. The proposal facilitates efficient surveillance and reporting by the incumbent commands on the observation of the cease-fire.
