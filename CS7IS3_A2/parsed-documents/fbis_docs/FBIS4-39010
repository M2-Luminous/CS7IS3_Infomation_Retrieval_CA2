The Military To Get 55 Trillion"] [Text] In a closed session yesterday, the Federation Council accepted as a basis the decree "On the Course of Shaping the 1994 Federal Budget," which calls for a notable increase in the number of defense and social-sphere expenditure items. The decree recommends to the State Duma "to increase in the expenditure part of the budget financial aid to the other levels of power up to 23 trillion rubles [R], including the financing of outlays for the maintenance of facilities in the social sphere and the housing stock which is being turned over under the authority of local bodies of state power in 1994, by R7.3 trillion," "to increase defense spending to R55 trillion," to regard it as necessary to replenish the financial aid fund through Central Bank emission credits rather than through transfers from the federal budget, "to regard it necessary to accept R4.3 trillion as the sum to cover the creation of regional food funds in the budget to be distributed among the specific regions." One of the recommendations to the State Duma asks it "to establish a system of priorities for the distribution of emission credits so as to provide finances in a timely manner to those regions that lack them." As regards an increase in defense spending, the Federation Council suggests itemizing the funds thus: R12 trillion for arms purchases, up to R5.5 trillion for research and development work, and up to R8 trillion for capital construction, while outlays for the maintenance of the Armed Forces should be cut from R28 trillion to R25.8 trillion. Thus, the decision so far accepted "as a basis" restores the Defense Ministry's and the military-industrial complex's share of participation in the budget to the one initially planned during the Finance Ministry's drafting of the budget message, which, however, was reduced before having been put before the State Duma. The Federation Council asked the Duma to increase the budget deficit attributed to defense items to R18 trillion in all. Commenting on this decision by the upper house of parliament, Senator Nikolay Gonchar stated that the Federation Council "wants no standoff with the government; it weighs the interests of the government and the country as a whole, and if the country's interests tip scales, this is normal." If the State Duma fails to consider the Federation Council's expenditure recommendations, the senators would go back to discussing their budget amendments after the budget has been put to the upper house of parliament for approval. According to Nikolay Gonchar, the Federation Council decision is not in recognition of Glazyev's budget, although there are constructive aspects on the Duma economist's stance. However, "Glazyev's additional incomes can go to patch up the holes in the old budget." More critical of the decree were Yuriy Chernichenko and Boris Nemtsov, who talked to journalists. A chagrined Mr. Chernichenko said it was guns before butter. Boris Nemtsov thought it necessary to hold an independent item-by-item study of the budget expenditure, because it could yield rather unexpected results. Arguing against the funds for military capital construction, Boris Nemtsov stated that he "has no use for Defense Ministry funds to build a home for some officer named Ivanov, for example, in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast," while it would be sensible to arrange for personal bank accounts to transfer the money that can only be spent by its owner for housing construction. "Eight trillion means 400,000 officers would be able to have decent homes built for them." To illustrate the justice of the claims made by Nemtsov, who spoke at the session, it suffices to recall the recent con jobs in the United States where hammers ordered by the government were sold at a thousand bucks each.
