Adressing the ceremony, he said it is not totally right to think that Indonesia would not be able to sustain its rice self-sufficiency if it has to import rice from other countries. The head of state said Indonesia can still import rice, but at the same time it has to export its rice. He said that Indonesia has to comply with this system because this is a more profitable way of developing the national food industry. According to the president, this mechanism can also be applied to other commodities but inter-sectional cooperation is essential in tackling difficulties in the food-related businesses. In the past, the import of rice had been linked to the issue of Indonesia's inability to achieve self-sufficiency in the commodity. This happened in 1991 when Indonesia imported 178 tons of rice, while there were no exports at all. In 1992, Indonesia exported 72,000 tons and imported 63,000 tons of rice. Indonesia had imported 375 tons and exported only 11,000 tons prior to achieving self-sufficiency in 1984. It is interesting to note that President Suharto's observation on the food industry, especially when it is linked to GATT rules on rice imports, signed recently at the GATT ministerial conference in Marrakech, Morocco. Under the agreement, every signatory is required to import rice amounting to three percent of its domestic consumption. This means the world rice market will be widened and that it will be possible for Indonesia to increase exports of excess rice. It has been reported that Indonesia's 1993 rice export reached 30 million tons and its domestic consumption 25 million tons. The extra five million tons are reserves and would be exported should the surplus rise. Meanwhile, based on world food statistics, the world supply of rice is about 12 million tons or about four percent of the world output, or about 300 million tons. All this while the world rice market has been dominated by the United States, Vietnam, and Thailand. These three countries supply about 70 percent of the rice in the world market. In such conditions, rice prices in the world market have become unstable. On the other hand, when all signatories are required to strictly observe GATT rules on the rice trade, Indonesia is required to import about 700,000 tons of rice. However, at the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations in December 1993, Indonesia managed to bargain for some relaxation to the rules. In the meeting, Ibrahim Hasan, minister of state for food affairs and head of the Logistics Board who was leading the Indonesian delegation, explained Indonesia's difficulties in observing the GATT rules in view of the characteristics of the world rice market and the fact that it has a huge population to feed. Some time ago, Syarifudin Baharsyah, minister of agriculture, announced that Indonesia had been forced to import 10,000 tons of rice from the United States. This was not because Indonesia faced a shortage, but the consequence of being one of the signatories of the GATT multilateral trade agreement. With the existence of the obligatory rice import rule, we can anticipate that the considerable amount of rice being imported may negatively affect our domestic rice market. Even though the amount to be imported is relatively small compared to the domestic consumption of 25 million tons, Indonesia still has to take measures so that it will not affect the domestic market where local farmers are the producers. In addition, Indonesia must pick the quality of the rice it imports from the United States. In connection with this, Ibrahim Hasan said the rice imported would only be sold at special stores in the country or consumed at hotels and restaurants. Indonesia has to intensify efforts to increase its rice exports to counter the pressure for rice imports due to the minimum access opportunity (MAO) regulation under GATT. The other alternative that Indonesia can resort to is to impose high tariff barriers on imported rice. Somehow, in reality it looks like Indonesia will pursue the two alternatives. The nature of rice self-sufficiency achieved by Indonesia depends on trend [two preceding words in English]. Its exports or imports are based on economic considerations and efficiency. On the basis of this, Indonesia has expressed its willingness to import a maximum of 50 percent of the 70,000 tons of rice it used to import with a 90 percent tariff quota. The tariffs to be imposed on the remainder of the imports will depend on the domestic price stability with a 180-percent tariff quota. Ibrahim Hasan said Indonesia will also implement the CBO (Ceiling Binding Offer) [preceding four words in English] because CBO is more profitable than any open tariff system.
