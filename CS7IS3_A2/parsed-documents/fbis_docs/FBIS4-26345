According to observers this indicates that the Cambodian Government has effectively severed all contact with the DKP and closed the door on peace talks and national reconciliation. Before leaving, Tap Kunnal, the DKP's representative, released a message thanking people at all levels who have, in various ways, shown their support. The message also expressed the DKP's "regret at having to leave Phnom Penh...for a while." Tap Kunnal's message said that the DKP had come to work in Phnom Penh in compliance with the 4-party Paris Agreement and with the approval of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk. This was to facilitate and maintain communication between the two groups with the aim of fostering mutual understanding until full national reconciliation. Following last Friday's official instruction DKP staff were given a deadline of June 19 for departure from Phnom Penh. However, as visas could not be obtained from the embassy during the weekend holiday, the government had agreed to a one-day delay for their departure. The DKP's message stressed that this was only a temporary situation and that they sincerely hoped could return one day. [sentence as received] It added that they would pray for the quickest possible realization of national reconciliation and unity in a united, independent and peaceful Cambodia.
