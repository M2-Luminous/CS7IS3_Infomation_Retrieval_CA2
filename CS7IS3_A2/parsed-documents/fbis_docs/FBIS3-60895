Interior Minister Nahit Mentese, in a telephone interview with state television, said reports that Ocalan might have been killed or wounded had reached Ankara, but it had not yet been possible to confirm the truth of them. Prime Minister Tansu Ciller told the press there might be "surprising developments" concerning terrorism. There were reports a few weeks ago, which the authorities here could not confirm, that Ocalan had been arrested in Syria on the orders of President Hafiz al-Asad. Turkey has often complained that Syria, and Iran, give help to the PKK in its decade-long fight in south-east Turkey for a Kurdish state. Since 1984, more than 10,500 civilians, rebels and troops have been killed in the fighting.
