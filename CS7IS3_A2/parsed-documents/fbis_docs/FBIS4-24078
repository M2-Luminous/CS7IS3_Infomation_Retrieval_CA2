EP command will comprise the African National Congress' Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], Pan Africanist Congress' Azanian Peoples Liberation Army and the former Ciskei and Transkei Defence Forces. The structure of the integrated force was outlined by Lt-Col J M Swanepoel at a media briefing on Tuesday [21 June] night. He said it had been decided early in the planning of integration that the new EP Command would cover the former Eastern Province and Border/Kei areas. - EP Command would be divided into five army districts: - Hantam Army District with its headquarters in Grahamstown; - Algoa Army District with headquarters in Port Elizabeth; - Border/Kei Army District with headquarters in East London; - East-Border Army District with headquarters in Queenstown; and - Transkei Army District with its headquarters in Umtata. EP Command commanding officer Brig Toon Slabbert said the SANDF aimed to establish a strong core army, whose primary role would be defence. Secondary roles would be to preserve life and the health of the population; to assist the police in maintaining order; to provide essential services, especially in disaster areas; and to support the nation's socio-economic upliftment. The SANDF [South African National Defense Force] would use the former SADF as the core around which to develop a strong apolitical force with high standards and full-time and part-time components. Brig Slabbert said with the integration of the SADF, former TVBC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, and Ciskei] armies and non-statutory forces, the SANDF could comprise about 130,000 soldiers.
