The Croats forcibly mobilized by the Muslim army are being sent to the front lines and forced to shoot at their dearest ones -- fathers, brothers, and sons. Recalcitrant Croats and those refusing to be mobilized are being arrested in large numbers. The building housing the Croatian cultural center, which is a symbol of Croatian struggle, has been turned into a Muslim forces' military building. Before that it was a frequent target of Muslim fire. The Croatian population of Zenica is quietly resisting all forms of imposed Muslim authority.
