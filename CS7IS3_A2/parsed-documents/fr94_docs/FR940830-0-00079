FR940830-0-00079 FR940830-0-00013 Miscellaneous Issues Several comments were also received in response to HUD requests for specific comments in the preamble to the proposed rule. Additional comments were made on other topics and guidance provided in the preamble or comments which are not limited or covered by regulatory sections. These issues include HA discretion, LOCCS/VRS, space guidelines, environmental reviews, procurement procedures, HUD&hyph;2530 Previous Participation, force account, Section 3, paperwork burden, consistent funding levels, ACC issues, contractor delays and wage rate issues, Consolidated Supply Program, HUD Assistance, including Handbook guidance and Field Office assistance, Section 504 issues, and CGP and MROP. HUD Discretion Comment: Commenters emphasized that HAs should be given discretion, flexibility, responsibility and control of their CGPs. Changes to the CGP program should contribute to the greater discretion, flexibility, responsibility and control of the local HAs and their residents. HAs should maintain control over methods of working with and meeting with residents, determining and prioritizing needed improvements, determining the methods to accomplish these improvements, establishing budgets, generating bid documents, entering into contracts, and determining the clearest methods of providing HUD with required information such as comprehensive plans, annual submissions and P&E Reports. Response: HUD agrees, and this final rule supports HA discretion. LOCCS/VRS The impact of LOCCS/VRS on the CGP program has been discussed above; however, additional miscellaneous comments were received which recommended various changes. Comment: Commenters recommended that HUD eliminate the thresholds for LOCCS/VRS because they found the threshold amounts are insufficient and result in Field Office review for approval. They found this is often time consuming and results in delays in payments and delays in fund expenditure. HAs favored eliminating the percentage limitations on monthly draw-downs. In addition, it was recommended that the eight percent draw-down limit be lifted for high performers. It was noted that because the modernization process results in low levels of expenditure during early design phases and high levels of expenditures when one or more construction contracts are in process, HAs have frequently exceeded the percentage limitation and delayed requesting funds or sought HUD approval to request additional funds. Response: LOCCS/VRS contains an edit limiting the total cumulative amount that any HA can draw down in a current month without triggering Field Office review. The limit is set forth as a percentage of the annual grant and varies by size of the annual grant (from 2 percent to 8 percent). The Department is reevaluating these percentages to determine if they are overly restrictive and result in an excessive number of requisitions requiring Field Office review. If the Department finds this to be the case, the Department will adjust the percentages accordingly. However, it should be noted that Field Office review should not result in lengthy delays in payment. When a HA's voucher is flagged for review, the HA should immediately call the Field Office and explain the circumstances. Based on the HA's telephone explanation, the Field Office may decide to release the voucher or request additional documentation. Extensive documentation is not needed in most cases. Comment: HAs requested immediate access to funds via LOCCS once an amendment to the ACC is executed. Response: Once the ACC amendment is executed by HUD, the Field Office must enter the Budget Line Items (BLIs) into LOCCS/VRS before HAs may requisition funds. The Field Office may not enter the BLIs into LOCCS/VRS before the fund obligation (ACC amendment) is recorded in the Program Accounting System (PAS). Comment: One commenter opposed entering expended and obligated funds into LOCCS on a quarterly basis because it requires extensive research and data preparation as well as requiring more frequent budget revisions. A two-day turnaround on the supply of funds through the LOCCS was requested (currently it is three days). Full fungibility was also requested to be reflected in LOCCS. Response: The Department believes that obtaining quarterly information on obligations and expenditures is essential to monitoring implementation progress by HAs. This requirement should not be burdensome since HAs should be maintaining this information as part of their own financial systems and controls. The Department would like to point out that the need for budget revisions triggered by obligations and expenditures will be greatly diminished by the provision of fungibility. Comment: CLPHA advised HUD to meet with industry groups quickly, make a commitment to a specific deadline for changing the LOCCs system to accommodate five-year fungibility and in the interim, make some changes manually. Response: The Department has taken steps to revise the existing BLI edits in LOCCS/VRS to accommodate fungibility. Specifically, the existing soft edit of 110% will be removed for the following BLIs: 1430, 1440, 1450, 1460, 1465, 1470, 1475, and 1495. In addition, the existing edits for BLIs 1408 and 1410 will be revised.
