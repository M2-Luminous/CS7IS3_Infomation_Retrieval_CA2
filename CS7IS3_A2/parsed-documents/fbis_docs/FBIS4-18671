Commenting on the fighting in Rwanda following the death of the Rwandan and Burundi presidents in an aircrash said to have been caused by unknown attackers, Leotard said that France and its military chiefs of staff were preparing for the evacuation of French nationals. It was to be expected that such procedures would be required increasingly often in the future, notably in black Africa and North Africa, he told reporters here. The evacuations could be carried out with the cooperation of local authorities, who would facilitate access to ports and airports and provide radio liaison, or, in cases of war, without their cooperation. France last year called on its nationals resident in Algeria to pull out of the North African country following a wave of attacks on foreigners by Islamic fundamentalists.
