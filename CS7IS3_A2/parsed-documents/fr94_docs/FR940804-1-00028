FR940804-1-00028 FR940804-1-00011 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931100&hyph;4043; I.D. 072894A] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Apportionment of reserve; request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS proposes to apportion reserve to certain target species in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to allow for ongoing harvest and account for previous harvest of the total allowable catch (TAC). DATES: Comments must be received at the following address no later than 4:30 p.m., Alaska local time, August 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be sent to Ronald J. Berg, Chief, Fisheries Management Division, Alaska Region, NMFS, 709 W. 9th, Room 401, Juneau, AK 99801 or P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802, Attention: Lori Gravel. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the U.S. BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the initial TACs specified for sablefish in the Bering Sea subarea (BS), for sablefish and the sharpchin/northern rockfish species category in the Aleutian Islands subarea (AI), and for Atka mackerel in the Central and Western Aleutian Districts, need to be supplemented from the non-specific reserve to continue operations and account for prior harvest. Therefore, in accordance with ยง675.20(b), NMFS proposes to apportion from the reserve to TACs for the following species: (1) For the BS_81 metric tons (mt) to sablefish; (2) for the AI_420 mt to sablefish, and 850 mt to the sharpchin/northern rockfish species category; (3) for the Central Aleutian District_6,679 mt to Atka mackerel; and (4) for the Western Aleutian District_1,500 mt to Atka mackerel. These proposed apportionments are consistent with ยง675.20(a)(2)(i) and do not result in overfishing of a target species or the ``other species'' category because the revised TACs are equal to or less than specifications of acceptable biological catch. Pursuant to ยง675.24(c)(1)(i), the proposed apportionment of the BS sablefish is allocated 41 mt to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear, and 40 mt to vessels using trawl gear. Pursuant to ยง675.24(c)(1)(ii), the proposed apportionment of the AI sablefish is allocated 315 mt to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear, and 105 mt to vessels using trawl gear. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 675.20 and 675.24 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. Dated: July 29, 1994. Richard B. Stone, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18976 Filed 8&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;F
