Nehm: At the moment there are intense discussions going on within the RAF on whether they should change their objectives and renounce violence. If the "hardliners" get their way over the next few weeks, attacks cannot be ruled out. BILD AM SONNTAG: Do you have any hot leads in the arson attack on the Luebeck synagogue? Nehm: We are currently investigating some 250 leads. If we persevere, I expect that we will be able to clarify the matter and bring those guilty of the Luebeck attack to trial. [passage omitted]
