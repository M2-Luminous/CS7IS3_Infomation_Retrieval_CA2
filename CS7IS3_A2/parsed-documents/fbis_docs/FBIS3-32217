"The main disadvantage is that Brazilian producers will lose competitiveness regarding their international competitors because our export costs will increase," Bertone said. However, he estimates that this system gives the retention program greater credibility and is not as strong an interference as a confiscation system would be. According to a decision by the Industry, Commerce, and Tourism Ministry, as of 1 March the government will transfer to exporters the job of retaining 20 percent of the volume of coffee exports. In Bertone's opinion, the government's decision is the closest to a market solution. The CNC president said Brazil knows that its competitors also are facing an identical situation. "This has led our competitors to seek new methods to raise coffee prices, as in the case of the minimum registry system adopted in Colombia," he said.
