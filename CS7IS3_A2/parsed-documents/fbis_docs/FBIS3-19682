V."-initialled report: "1,049 Weapons Seized -- `Clear Warning to International Criminals'"] [Text] Bonn -- Minister of the Chancellery Friedrich Bohl (Christian Democratic Union) assesses the result of the first nationwide search operation against illegal owners of weapons as "proof of successful police cooperation within the European Union." "Interpol, the Belgian police authorities, and the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] have proved their joining effectiveness," Bohl told WELT AM SONNTAG. According to a now available balance sheet of a large-scale search in 420 German towns, which was conducted the week before last, a total of 1,049 weapons were seized, including seven submachine guns and three fully automatic guns. In addition, 2.5 tonnes of ammunition as well as five hand grenades with accessories were found. Most of the weapons came from Belgium. Twelve suspects were arrested and two arrest warrants were issued. Said Minister Bohl: "This successful operation is a clear warning to international criminals. Uniting the police forces leads to determined operations and greater security. An abolition of border checks is by far not tantamount to freedom of international crime. I congratulate the official of Interpol, of the BKA, and of the laender police forces on their success." A total of 2,247 federal and land official were involved in the police operations in all laender. A total of 754 apartments of 724 persons were searched, who are suspected of having brought weapons to Germany illegally -- in particular from Belgium -- and having sold some of them already. The occasion of the search in the FRG was information provided by Interpol in Brussels to the BKA in Wiesbaden. Last November and December, Interpol had provided information on 1,082 cases of the purchase of guns by German citizens in Belgium. Minister Friedrich Bohl announced that the European police authorities have already increased their exchange of information considerably. This is an "advance measure" regarding planned "bolstering measures" within the framework of the abolition of borders. Bohl: "The European registration service already works before it is officially introduced. This is now paying off." The minister announced that, when it takes over the presidency of the European Union as of July, the Federal Government will make a special contribution so that the European Union can combat international crime with determination as a "security community." Bohl: "In addition, cooperation between the judicial, security, and customs authorities of the member states must be improved in such a way that the latest success against the arms smugglers becomes a normal part of everyday police life in Europe."
