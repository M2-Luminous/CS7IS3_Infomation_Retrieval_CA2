Majority of the members of the Council save the United States and Britain expressed their confirmation that nothing negative to be issued against Iraq. Following the discussions the Russian permanent delegate to the UN expressed strong hope that the Security Council would acknowledge next July what Iraq had achieved of positive steps in implementing provisions of the Resolution 687. The Russian delegate told journalists following the Council's deliberations that the Russian stance toward the blockade against Iraq was a practical one and simple depending on the fact that Iraq had made good steps and the Security Council had to admit that and "we have proposed that on the council." The French ambassador to the United Nations expressed his belief that the general feeling at the Council was that Iraq had accomplished a progress in the area of cooperation with the special commission. He said the French stance was still the same since the previous reviewal, i.e. there was a progress in the field of weapons and monitoring and that "we are with the legal reading of the Resolution 687 which means that soon after Ekeus and the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency informed the Council that the monitoring was working safely the council would give the green light to lift the embargo on exporting the Iraqi oil."
