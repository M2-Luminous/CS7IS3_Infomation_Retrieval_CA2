At 1000, Chi Haotian -- along with Lieutenant General Li Laizhu, commander of the Beijing Military Region; Lieutenant General Yu Zhenyu, deputy commander of the Air Force; and other members of his retinue -- arrived by car at the First Army Division, headquartered at the Military Village. From the reviewing stand, Chi Haotian inspected well-equipped units under the First Army Division, including motorized infantry, armored cavalry, field and anti- aircraft artillery, air defense, reconnaissance, and guard units; as well as the airborne infantry brigade affiliated with the Eastern Military Region. Brazil's First Army Division consists of 22,000 officers and men. Its predecessor, the First Strategy Brigade, was founded in 1908. During World War II, the division's troops were incorporated into the First Expeditionary Division and took part in the war against Fascism in Italy. In addition, they also joined international peacekeeping forces on two occasions. Then, the Chinese Defense Minister, accompanied by Brazilian Division Commander General Leonel, watched live ammunition exercises performed by the division's special task battalion and anti-terrorist shock brigade with great interest. At the airborne infantry brigade's parachute training center, Chi Haotian also viewed paratroopers' physical fitness, skills, mental readiness, and simulated parachute exercises. Founded in 1945, the parachute training center is mainly in charge of the teaching, fieldwork, and training of paratroopers; as well as the research and development of personnel training techniques and parachute materials. So far, the center has trained some 50,000 certified paratroopers for 10 countries, including Argentina, Chile, the United States, and France. After watching the exercises, Chi Haotian told the gracious hosts: "There is much in your well-equipped training center's hardworking soldiers and flexible training methods that we can learn from." Chi Haotian and his retinue arrived here on 2 April to begin a visit. This is the first time a Chinese defense minister has visited Latin American countries since the PRC's founding in 1949. Brazil is the first leg of the visit. The minister and his retinue will visit Uruguay and Chile.
