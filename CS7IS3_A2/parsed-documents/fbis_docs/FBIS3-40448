So far there are 22 firm orders for the aircraft. The Fokker 70 is now halfway toward obtaining its certification, which is expected in October 1994. Since its first flight on 2 April 1993, the prototype has made 195 flights and logged 250 hours, including 765 landings. The chief mechanical characteristics have been confirmed during this period: indicators and response to controls, flight envelope and stall limits, performance on takeoff and landing, and external noise measurements. The aircraft recently completed a two-month evaluation period in Spain (Granada), during which it flew more than 20 hours per week. The prototype has returned to its test facility at Schiphol (Amsterdam), where it will be equipped in January for a new series of tests that will include automatic landing with the AFCAS (Automatic Flight Control and Augmentation System) control system and verification of the performance of its engine (RR Tay 620), avionics (ARINC 700), and systems. After being ferried to Cranfield in Great Britain, the Fokker 70 will undergo tests aimed at verifying the behavior of its nose landing gear on wet runways. Program officials are very satisfied at the moment. They say that takeoff performance exceeds expectations and that fuel consumption is lower than expected. Early conclusions point to flight characteristics similar to those of the Fokker 100 and to the possibility of improving the Fokker 70's carrying capacity by moving the center of gravity forward two percent. Commonality with the 100-seat Fokker will make it possible to train the first crews on the Fokker 100 flight simulator. That, in turn, will make it possible to reduce the number of hours necessary for crew training by half. Assembly of the first series aircraft (No. 02) will begin in February so that it will be able to participate in the certification program in August. The order book contains 22 firm orders: 10 for Sempati, five for Pelita (Indonesia), five (leased) for British Midland, and two (plus an option for six) for Mesa Airlines, the first North American customer. The manufacturing schedule calls for the production of two aircraft in 1994 and 15 in 1995. Sempati, which is the first customer, will take delivery of its first aircraft at the end of 1994 with the intention of putting it into service in March 1995. British Midland will receive two aircraft in 1995 and three the following year.
