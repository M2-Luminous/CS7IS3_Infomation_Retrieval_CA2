The division will be established not only at the central office. It will also have its branches in big Russian cities, including Moscow, St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk. According to the director, these changes are provided for by the federal programme for stepping up struggle against crime for 1994-1995. The FCIS is vested with new, but, in actual fact, old forgotten functions, including the return of investigative bodies. In the near future, some 700-800 investigators having experience of work in security bodies will get down to work at the service. In Stepashin's opinion, clear-cut and efficient cooperation between his service, on the one hand, and the law enforcement bodies, the security service of banks, currency exchange points, tax investigation service and, if need be, the president's security service as well as other interested structures, on the other, will help to implement successfully the federal programme for stepping up struggle against crime.
