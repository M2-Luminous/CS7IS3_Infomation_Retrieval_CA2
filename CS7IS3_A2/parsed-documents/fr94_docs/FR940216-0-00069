FR940216-0-00069 FR940216-0-00010 I. Test Requirements 1. Winter Testing To be certified as reformulated, a gasoline must meet the air toxics and NO X emission requirements year-round; the oxygen, benzene, and heavy metal content requirements year-round, and the VOC emission requirements in the high ozone season. As discussed in Section IV of this notice and Sections III and IV of the RIA, the Agency does not have sufficient data to model winter exhaust emissions. While differences between the effects of fuel parameters under summer and winter conditions beyond those discussed in Section IV may exist, the Agency does not have any evidence to date to suggest that they are significant. Therefore, EPA will apply the exhaust models developed for summer emissions to winter fuels as well for purposes of determining their air toxics and NO X emissions. The Agency is concerned that allowing winter testing for some fuel parameters while modeling the effects of other parameters based on summer emission data creates the possibility of ``gaming'' the testing process. Fuel suppliers could use the summer model to determine the effects of parameters that would behave unfavorably under winter conditions and use winter testing to determine the effects of parameters that would behave favorably under winter conditions. This possibility may result in fuels being certified for winter use (through a combination of winter testing and summer modeling) that result in smaller emission reductions in-use than are intended by the Act or than would occur by using the summer model. Therefore, EPA is at this time requiring that all testing be performed under summer ambient conditions. As the Agency gathers additional data in the future with which to revise the model, EPA will consider whether sufficient winter test data exists to permit the development of winter NO X and air toxics models. If such models can be developed, the Agency will consider whether to allow winter testing. 2. Pollutants to be Measured To the extent testing is performed to augment the complex model, it must be performed to determine the emission effects on all the pollutants covered by the reformulated gasoline certification requirements, including toxics (carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide emissions must also be measured to permit validation of test results). Failure to have such a requirement might result in important emission effects being overlooked and could allow fuel producers to ``game'' the certification requirements by permitting them to utilize the modeling option for one pollutant and the test results for another pollutant when it would be advantageous. The resulting certified reformulated gasolines may not meet all of the applicable emission reduction requirements in-use. For example, the model augmented by test results may indicate that a fuel meets the VOC requirement but fails the toxics requirement, while the model alone may indicate that the fuel meets the toxics requirement but fails the VOC requirement. Allowing the petitioner to claim the toxics emission effects predicted by the model while claiming VOC benefits determined through testing would ignore fuel effects on toxics that may not be addressed by the model. Testing costs would be significantly reduced if only VOC and NO X emissions were measured by testing, and toxics emissions were allowed to be modeled. However, since the testing option can only be used when the candidate fuel's parameters fall outside of the range of the model, EPA believes that adequate information seldom would be available to allow toxics emissions from such fuels to be modeled adequately if adequate information on VOC and NO X emissions were not available. If a fuel parameter is expected to affect VOC or NO X and is not covered by the model, toxics emissions may very well be affected and should be measured. It should be noted, however, measurement of toxics emissions for the fuels used to determine interactive effects (discussed below in section IV.I.4.) need not be performed. During development of the complex model, EPA found that interactive effects for air toxics are either statistically insignificant, impossible to discern given the accuracy and extent of available data, or too small to contribute substantially to the model's explanatory and predictive power. The complex model being promulgated today contains no interactive terms for air toxics emissions for these reasons, and hence EPA considers it unnecessary to require testing for interactive effects on air toxics. Specifically, toxics emissions need not be measured when testing additional Extension Fuels to determine interactive effects or when testing Addition Fuels 4, 5, 6, and 7, as described in Section V.I.5. However, EPA reserves the right to require that toxics be measured during vehicle testing programs when evidence exists that adverse interactive effects may exist for toxics. In particular, EPA reserves the right to require testing for interactive toxics effects if future revisions to the complex model include such effects.
