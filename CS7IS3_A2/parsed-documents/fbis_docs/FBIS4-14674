The day before, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin urged his U.S. partners "not to be afraid but to approach the Russian market more boldly." Has there been a real response to these appeals or has nothing been done about them? The three days that the U.S. business delegation headed by Brown spent in Moscow do not seem to have completely clarified this question. On the one hand, four intergovernmental agreements were signed between the two countries Wednesday, including statutes on the Committee for the Development of Business Cooperation between Russia and America and on the creation of U.S. business centers in Russia. The joint statement adopted by Russia and the United States made special mention of the question of access to the U.S. market for Russian goods and to the Russian market for U.S. goods. Summing up the results of the U.S. delegation's three-day visit to Moscow at the end of the day on Wednesday, Brown made a special note of the successes of the delegation's representatives from the U.S. private sector and in particular the agreements signed with Russian partners by such U.S. corporations as McDermott International Inc., (shipbuilding), the Halliburton Company of Texas (gas and oil industry), Allen and Associates (the pharmaceutical industry), the Westinghouse Electric Corporation (modernization and construction of nuclear power power stations), and others. At the same time, as the secretary himself acknowledged, U.S. private capital investments in Russia, which have almost doubled in the past year, are still only $1 billion, which is a paltry sum by U.S. standards (by comparison, U.S. companies have invested $239 billion in West Europe). During the visit Brown predicted that U.S. investments in Russia could easily rise to $45-$50 billion if the right conditions are created. He cited the lowering of Russia's customs tariffs and the easing of tax legislation among those conditions.
