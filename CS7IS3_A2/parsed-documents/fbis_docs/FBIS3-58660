Today `Partnership for Peace' is the best response, because it does not also create uncertainty in other countries." This is Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's summing up of the situation on the eve of Monday's and Tuesday's important NATO summit in Brussels where she will head the Norwegian delegation. Several former Warsaw Pact (WP) countries want rapid membership of NATO and many people are calling the meeting the organization's most important meeting for years. The prime minister agrees with this description: "The previous summit in Rome a couple of years ago was also important. It decided NATO's position after the fall of the Wall. Now developments have moved on with new challenges which need constructive responses. The meeting is therefore of crucial importance." [Knudsen] Why is Norway negative toward the possibility of the former East bloc countries becoming members? [Harlem Brundtland] I think that it is wrong to put the question in those terms. For a long time there have been talks among all the NATO nations and there have been gradual developments. After the last summit the NACC (North Atlantic Cooperation Council) was the concrete response for increased cooperation between NATO countries and the former WP countries. Now we are building further on our experiences and are entering into even closer cooperation. Norway wants openness, in future developments too. [Knudsen] So former East bloc countries could become members in the longer term? [Harlem Brundtland] Yes, that is possible. We are offering a process toward ever increasing cooperation. [Knudsen] Would new members and an extension of NATO's borders toward the East have a destabilizing effect in the present situation? [Harlem Brundtland] Yes, membership for a few selected countries would be a less satisfactory solution. The new proposal for cooperation, "Partnership for Peace," is a concrete and good response. Nor will such a response create uncertainty in other countries. [Harlem Brundtland ends] The prime minister stressed that this response is flexible and adapted to individual countries: "NATO is offering similar bilateral agreements with interested countries, and also additional agreements for each individual country adapted to its cooperation needs." [Knudsen] Could Russia also join "Partnership for Peace?" [Harlem Brundtland] Russia will also receive an invitation. We are not creating divisions, but are aiming at developments involving democratic controls over and structures for the military forces. [Knudsen] What will NATO's main future role be in this scenario? [Harlem Brundtland] NATO will continue to build on what was contained in the original 1949 package: Looking after the territorial integrity of member nations. Now that we are extending cooperation to the east, we must not throw out the baby with the bath water. The responsibility NATO has had must continue to exist; new cooperation with other states is something additional. [Knudsen] But NATO's traditional enemy image no longer applies? [Harlem Brundtland] That is correct, but nor do we have any guarantee that we could not be attack by other countries. We still need mutually committed cooperation. [Knudsen] The United States is scaling down in Europe. Will not the Western European Union assume a larger part of the burden? [Harlem Brundtland] The Western European Union will be given the additional role of NATO's European pillar. But this will not mean that the original role underlying NATO will disappear. [Harlem Brundtland ends] Gro Harlem Brundtland also stressed that the government has broad support in the Storting for its future NATO course.
