FR940620-0-00135 FR940620-0-00029 13.3.4(7)␣Ovens This provision requires ovens to be of the self-cleaning type or to be located adjacent to an adjustable height counter with knee space below. For side opening ovens, the door latch side is required to be configured so that the oven interior is accessible to the counter space. This provision requires a pull-out shelf under a side opening oven extending the full width of the oven which can be pulled out not less than 10 inches. Ovens are also required to have controls on front panels or on either side of the door. Comment. The Greater Burlington Disability Council of Winooski, Vermont noted that the accident history of two Vermont public housing authorities suggested that both floor ovens and wall ovens have serious drawbacks with respect to accessibility. They, and other commenters, characterized both as unsafe. One commenter suggested that wall ovens with knee space under them are particularly hazardous because of risks of being burned by hot items falling in the lap. A commenter suggested that a combination convection/microwave oven was safer and more accessible. Response. Ovens are difficult for many people to use. However, no safety data has been provided on which to base a requirement for an alternative appliance. Knee space under wall ovens does not enhance their accessibility and invites accidents and therefore, the guidelines provide that wall-ovens shall not have knee space under them. Comment. One commenter noted that controls on the top of a wall oven may be within reach range, but may not be visible. Response. There appear to be no reasonable alternatives. Manufacturers offer very limited options for ovens with side controls and the guidelines cannot limit design alternatives so severely at this time. The Board acknowledges that the relationship between reach range and line of sight is a pertinent area of study that may bear on many other ADAAG provisions. For example, the ANSI A117.1 Task Force on Automated Teller Machines is currently studying this issue. 13.3.4(8)␣Refrigerators and Freezers This provision requires that refrigerators and freezers be either the side-by-side type or the over and under type, with 50 percent of the freezer within 54 inches. Where 100 percent of the freezer is not within the reach ranges specified in ADAAG 4.2.5 and 4.2.6, it must be a self-defrosting type of mechanism. Comment. One commenter took the position that side by side refrigerator-freezers were the only truly accessible units. Another commenter felt that side by side units restricted accessibility. In addition, a commenter questioned why bottom-mount freezers were not permitted. Response. Because very few comments were received regarding this provision, and because only two commenters expressed a preference for a certain style of refrigerator and freezer unit, the guidelines have not restricted choices regarding the type of unit. Proposed ADAAG 13.3.4(8)(b)(ii) which required 100 percent of the refrigerator to be no higher than 54 inches has been deleted to allow greater flexibility. Consequently, refrigerators, especially those with bottom mounted freezers, may have some portion of the refrigerator outside of the reach ranges specified in ADAAG 4.2.5 and 4.2.6. However, a new provision has been added to clarify that controls for refrigerator and freezer compartments must be accessible as required by ADAAG 13.3.4(3). 13.3.4(9)␣Dishwashers This provision requires that dishwashers be front loading machines. Comment. One commenter noted that references to ADAAG 13.3.4(2) and 13.3.4(3) should be removed as they are redundant. Response. These references have been removed. 13.3.4(10)␣Kitchen Storage This provision requires that kitchen storage cabinets, drawers and shelf areas comply with ADAAG 4.25. At least one shelf in all cabinets and storage shelves mounted above work counters must have a maximum height of 48 inches. Additionally, door pulls and handles are required to be mounted at the top of a base cabinet and at the bottom of a cabinet over a counter. Comment. One commenter understood the reference to ADAAG 4.25 to require all wall cabinets to be mounted with the top shelf no higher than 54 inches. Response. Reference to ADAAG 4.25 has been removed from this provision for clarity. At least one shelf of each wall cabinet above counters must be mounted at a maximum height of 48 inches. Other shelves in the cabinet may exceed this limit. Other applicable requirements contained in ADAAG 4.25 are duplicated in ADAAG 13.3.4(2) and 13.3.4(3). Comment. The NPRM noted that the Board was considering requiring that a portion of the kitchen storage cabinets be provided with pull-out shelving and requested comment on this subject. Responses varied widely. Most individuals with disabilities and organizations representing them favored a requirement; a few offered alternatives such as shallow pantries and lazy susan devices. On the other hand, State and local government housing providers felt that costs were too high and several commenters noted that maintenance, not installation costs, were of great concern. Some commenters felt features such as pull-out shelving or lazy susans should be the responsibility of the tenant. The American Society of Interior Designers noted that supplying all base cabinets with pull-out shelving could add as much as one thousand dollars to the cost of a kitchen. However, they added that floor space could be used more efficiently and perhaps fewer shelves would have to be accessible. One commenter suggested that pull-out shelving in wall cabinets could cause injuries from falling objects. Response. Because so many commenters had reservations about a requirement for pull-out shelving, no provision has been added. This, however, is considered a viable option for providing greater accessibility to kitchen storage.
