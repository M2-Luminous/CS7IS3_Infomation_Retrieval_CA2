The purchase will be made through the Bank of Mexico, bringing the country's total shares to a maximum of 27,589. The IFC is a division of the World Bank. The Senate also approved the second issuance of the new, silver 5-peso coin commemorating the quincentennial of the discovery of America. The issuance was reportedly authorized as an incentive for national producers and as a means for the executive branch to help strengthen the mining industry, which is currently experiencing a serious crisis. Porfirio Munoz Ledo, president of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, made a short statement to say the transaction with the IFC was "positive" as it calls for an additional disbursement of more than $4 million, which will strengthen the Bank of Mexico and increase the country's participation. Munoz highlighted the fact that the loans were to come from international financial organizations. Mexico urgently needs assistance to reconstruct its productive economy, increase employment, and funnel all possible funds, especially those coming from multilateral loans, toward developing small and medium enterprises, decentralizing the economy, and increasing production. Jesus Rodriguez y Rodriguez, president of the Senate Treasury Commission, said "the transaction is, of course, advantageous. He added that "our dealings with that organization have been beneficial as we have received $100 in loans for every $1 invested." He said such loans have been granted on excellent terms and under superb time conditions.
