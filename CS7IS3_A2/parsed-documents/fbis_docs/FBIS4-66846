Again and again, he does something or says such things that cause problems and worries for Narasimha Rao. On 20th April, while talking informally with the news media, he told them out of the blue, "The era when people caused problems between me and the prime minister has gone. It will not happen again. The problems that the ruling party and the nation are facing now are so serious that there is no room for such activities. "There was a time when each word I uttered was misinterpreted and misunderstandings were created between us. However, from now on, these people will not get the opportunity to cause such disagreements between us. "After the vidhan sabha elections in northern states, I had met the prime minister on my own and discussed the political scenario. I had told Mr. Rao directly that it did not matter what people said, I believed that it was not in anyone's interest to let such things go on and on. The prime minister had agreed with me in that meeting. I have also shared my feelings in the recent Congress high command meeting." While Mr. Arjun Singh said this all, he also hinted that he disagreed over the GATT agreement, however, he was going to stand by whatever decision the Party makes. It is especially important to mention here that Arjun Singh's opinion about GATT is his own and he had asked Prime Minister Narasimha Rao to call a meeting of all political parties to discuss GATT so that a national opinion can be formed. When Arjun Singh was asked if he agreed with the government over GATT, he said that he was on one side in the cabinet decision and also did understand the meaning of "collective responsibility." The way Arjun Singh said that made it clear that he had his own opinions about GATT and several aspects of the economic policy. When the correspondents asked Mr Arjun Singh if he supported the idea of knowing national opinion about GATT, he replied that we must look at his issue very carefully. We all have accepted the idea of liberalization and joining our economy with the rest of the world. India cannot survive in total isolation. Therefore, we have to develop standards keeping our nation's interests in mind. Can a person deny the fact that these standards should be collaborative and according to people's desires? Mr. Arjun Singh said that he had suggested to Prime Minister Narasimha Rao before GATT was brought to debate in the Parliament to call a meeting of representatives of major political parties to form a consensus after listening to their ideas. However, this meeting could not be called in the time that was available. Mr. Arjun Singh used every word very cleverly and cautiously when talking about Mr. Narasimha Rao's efforts to call this meeting. The reporters asked Mr. Arjun Singh why he did not defend the government over GATT in the Parliament. Mr. Singh presented a lengthy explanation. He said that an informal meeting of the central cabinet was held in the presence of Narasimha Rao on 28 February 1994. It was said in that meeting that many people were raising "totally unrelated issues" to benefit politically. It was decided at that time to prepare brief responses to issues that were creating misunderstanding in order to share facts with the public. Mr. Singh said that the prime minister asked him to prepare the list of these issues. After talking with the people who had something to say about these issues, he prepared a list of those issues according to his ability and sent to Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji after the prime minister's approval. Talking further, Mr. Singh said that when he returned from Egypt on 24 May [as published], he learned about the opinions of the commerce minister on each of those issues. At that time, it has been already decided to have special discussion on 29 March, however, it was not possible to call a meeting of all parties representatives during that time. It was very difficult for him to talk or discuss these issues in the Parliament because of these developments and because the people who had to say something about these issues were not contacted for their input. Mr. Singh took the reporters back to the recent past and said that he was asked to chair the cabinet committee formed in 1992 to review the Dunkel draft. This committee held some meetings and opinions of various groups and people was solicited as the issues included in this draft were very sensitive and important for our nation's future. This committee seeing the long-range implications of this issue, unanimously recommended that this whole issue should be debated in the Parliament and only then should the government make its decision. All in all, Mr. Singh meant that by not getting opinions of the major political parties before signing the GATT agreement, the recommendation made by the cabinet committee was ignored. His statement, which was delivered in very careful words, has created a difficult situation for Narasimha Rao's government once again. Its proof is that clarification of this statement was requested in the Parliament yesterday and the government had to face embarrassment. Instead of going into the details of GATT and Dunkel proposals or debating their appropriateness or unsuitability, it would not be out of context to mention here that no one can object to the idea of getting opinions from all major political parties as it is important to have national agreement over important national issues. However, the way he blows hot and cold in the same breath, talking about ending his differences with the prime minister, and then talking about ignoring the cabinet committee's recommendations is really amazing. This indicates that he has not changed his ways yet--his undeclared war against the prime minister is still going on. As for difference of opinion, differences are an important part of the democratic process, however, there should be some principle about expressing differences. Any difference of opinion with the party or the government should be taken care of within those organizations. No one benefits when these differences are aired in public; instead, everyone gets hurt. Anyhow, the way Arjun Singh has made contradictory statements at the same time has forced every intelligent person to wonder which one is right and which is wrong. The poet [Kabir] was right about Arjun Singh when he wrote, "God will not understand whatever he does."
