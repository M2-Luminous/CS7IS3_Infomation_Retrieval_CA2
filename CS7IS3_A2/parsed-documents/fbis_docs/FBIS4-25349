At present, 33 enterprises have been selected from Chengdu, Chongqing, Deyang, Mianyang, Leshan, Zigong, and Neijiang to make preparations. Differing from sales of loss-making enterprises in other localities, the enterprises for sale have good economic returns. Profitable enterprises account for 84.8 percent of the total, and the rest have great potential. These enterprises are engaged in machinery, electronics, metallurgy, chemical industry, construction materials, food, medicine, light industry, and textiles, and they have broad market prospects. This feature has been praised by foreign businessmen. According to information, Sichuan wants to adopt five sales methods: First, sell all of the property rights and land use rights; second, according to the requirements of the buyer, sell part of the property rights and land use rights; third, on condition that the buyer makes arrangements for the workers, sell all of the property rights and land use rights; fourth, on condition that the buyer makes arrangements for some of the workers, sell part of the property rights and land use rights; and fifth, transfer state shares and corporate shares to joint-stock companies.
