In the meantime, a strict monitoring and examination network system has been set up. Yang Qi, who is in charge of the Yunnan Provincial AIDS Prevention and Control Office, said: In the past few years, Yunnan has done a great deal of work in organizing and managing the prevention and control of AIDS, monitoring epidemic diseases, making laws and regulations, giving publicity to and carrying out education, and in training, researching, and gaining international cooperation. A monitoring and examination network, which is composed of one monitoring and examination center, 10 preliminary screening laboratories, and 34 monitoring points, plays an exceedingly important role in the prevention and control of AIDS. Yang Qi said that the monitoring of 147,330 highly susceptible people in Yunnan shows that HIV-infected persons are still mainly concentrated in the western border area of Yunnan. As of the end of 1993, there were 977 HIV-infected persons, of whom 102 were foreigners. Of these 977 persons, 17 were diagnosed as AIDS sufferers, and nine have already died. Yang Qi said: Yunnan keeps files on every HIV-infected person and every AIDS patient. Moreover, it follows up on them with medical treatment and continuously strengthens education for their families and highly susceptible people. Furthermore, in addition to the AIDS Prevention and Control Day held once each year, Yunnan has printed some 100,000 tracts about AIDS in the Dai and Jingpo languages and installed three telephones for inquiries. All this plays an effective role in preventing the spread of AIDS.
