However, those who believe that the current hardships and economic crisis have been originated exclusively during the years of Ukraine's independence are wrong. I would like to recall that from 1985 [to 1990] the USSR foreign debt increased from $28 billion to $55 billion, and hard currency reserves decreased two-fold. This "spending" took place over some five years. In other words, we have come to the crisis not alone, but along with our brothers and sisters from the Union, during several years. By the way, they also, as well as an array of countries from the former socialist camp, are experiencing difficulties caused by the processes connected with economic reform. However, we are not without sin. One could provide many examples of our own mistakes caused by the extreme complexity of the state-building process, our lack of experience, and our evident shortsightedness. Nevertheless, we should not seek the guilty today, as we used to do, but we should jointly find a solution. One such solution, in my opinion, is to liberate producers of industrial and agricultural goods. In place of the Moscow government, today we have the one in Kiev. Certain voices can being heard saying that it is necessary to establish tough administrative structures in the oblasts, and that they should take everything in their hands and restore order. But a producer should only obey the law and by the law be connected with the state. In politics, there is a priority task for us today -- elections for the new legislature formed along professional lines. Certain people predict that the people will not participate in the elections, because they do not trust anybody. But, this is an incorrect opinion. They want to trust somebody, but they do not know whom. I believe that it is impossible -- and sociological surveys confirm this -- for our people to elect a dictatorship, and this will lead the country away from the edge of the precipice. The people must elect legislators who will endorse centrist approaches to the most acute problems. Only such legislators will be able to form an efficient government. I believe that not a single man, for sure not a dictator or yet another secretary general, but a centrist bloc that will develop a national platform, not a narrow party one, will become Ukraine's leader in 1994. [Hrynyov] I believe that 1994 will see the introduction of intensive reforms in Ukraine. I do not expect any new political forces to appear and assume responsibility for carrying out such reforms. I think that the harsh reality will force Ukraine to reform its economy. We have wasted the opportunity to do so over the last two years. We have not even tried to actually introduce reforms, but spent our time on uncomprehensible policy which follows the principle of "neither a plan nor a market." This has led to the sharp deterioration of basic preconditions that are necessary for the introduction of market reforms. Two years ago, one could assess our situation as dramatic, today -- as tragic: We are beginning reform while in a state of complete economic destruction, a lack of control over economic processes, and the collapse of the financial system. Despite these facts, I repeat that 1994 will be the year of beginning economic reforms. Guarantees for success do not exist. Failure to proceed on the path of transformations means losing Ukraine. I am very aware of public opinion polls, and they indicate that the psychological atmosphere in Ukraine is that reforms are considered as not one of the variants, but as the only one possibility, and that there is no other path but the path of market reforms.
