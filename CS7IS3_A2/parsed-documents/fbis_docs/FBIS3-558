In submitting its report to the cabinet meeting, Government Spokesman Moctar Diallo reiterated the government's "willingness" to maintain dialogue and called on his fellow citizens to continue to "examine with serenity" the demands made by the Coordination of the Armed Resistence [CRA], the leading organ of the Tuareg rebellion. Regarding the prospect of the negotiations that are to resume at the end of March in Paris, the CRA demanded last month the right to manage, as autonomous territories, those parts of the country it is claiming in the north on behalf of the Tuareg community (10 percent of the population). The CRA also demanded quotas that would guarantee the representation of Tuaregs within the government, the National Assembly, and the National Armed Forces. This reaction, the first from the government since the publishing of the demands by the CRA, follows that of the opposition, which rejected on 2 March "all maneuvers aimed at dividing the country." Several associations and trade unions also made their stand clear against the CRA demands.
