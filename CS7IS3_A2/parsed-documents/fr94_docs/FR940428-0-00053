FR940428-0-00053 FR940428-0-00020 Federalism Implications The regulation adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this regulation will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Conclusion Because the regulation adopted herein is not expected to result in significant costs, the FAA has determined that this final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. For the same reason and because this is an issue that has not prompted a great deal of public concern, this final rule is not considered to be significant as defined in Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). In addition, since there are no small entities affected by this rulemaking, it is certified, under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities. A copy of the regulatory evaluation prepared for this final rule may be examined in the public docket or obtained from the person identified under the caption, for further information contact. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 25 Aircraft, Aviation safety, Federal Aviation Administration, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, 14 CFR part 25 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) is amended as follows: PART 25_AIRWORTHINESS STANDARDS: TRANSPORT CATEGORY AIRPLANES 1. The authority citation for part 25 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. app. 1344, 1354(a), 1355, 1421, 1423, 1424, 1425, 1428, 1429, 1430; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 49 CFR 1.47(a). 2. A new ยง25.519 is added under the undesignated center heading ``Ground Loads'' to read as follows: ยง25.519 Jacking and tie-down provisions. (a) General. The airplane must be designed to withstand the limit load conditions resulting from the static ground load conditions of paragraph (b) of this section and, if applicable, paragraph (c) of this section at the most critical combinations of airplane weight and center of gravity. The maximum allowable load at each jack pad must be specified. (b) Jacking. The airplane must have provisions for jacking and must withstand the following limit loads when the airplane is supported on jacks_ (1) For jacking by the landing gear at the maximum ramp weight of the airplane, the airplane structure must be designed for a vertical load of 1.33 times the vertical static reaction at each jacking point acting singly and in combination with a horizontal load of 0.33 times the vertical static reaction applied in any direction. (2) For jacking by other airplane structure at maximum approved jacking weight: (i) The airplane structure must be designed for a vertical load of 1.33 times the vertical reaction at each jacking point acting singly and in combination with a horizontal load of 0.33 times the vertical static reaction applied in any direction. (ii) The jacking pads and local structure must be designed for a vertical load of 2.0 times the vertical static reaction at each jacking point, acting singly and in combination with a horizontal load of 0.33 times the vertical static reaction applied in any direction. (c) Tie-down. If tie-down points are provided, the main tie-down points and local structure must withstand the limit loads resulting from a 65-knot horizontal wind from any direction.
