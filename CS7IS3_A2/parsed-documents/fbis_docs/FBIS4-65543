It completely lacks logic to abandon a technology in which German companies occupy a leading position internationally. Those who call for the abandonment of nuclear technology should realize that the resulting energy shortage will have to be made up for and that jobs for highly qualified people will be affected. In addition, it will be scarcely possible for Germany to make an effective contribution to improving the security of nuclear power plants in Central and East Europe without the necessary technology. Rexrodt said that the long-term option for the use of nuclear energy should not be given up now, even if a discussion is currently taking place on issuing permits for new nuclear power plants. He called on the laender governed by the SPD to stop resisting the law on the use of coal and nuclear energy, which the Federal Council is to decide about on Friday [20 May]. The law will set new conditions that have to be fulfilled before a permit for the operation of a nuclear power plant is issued. The main aim is to significantly reduce the danger to the population in the event of reactor accidents by way of preventative measures, including the prevention of melt-downs. The minister regretted that last year's talks on achieving a consensus had collapsed, at least temporarily. There should be a broad social consensus on the supply of energy in the future. Schwaben Energy AG board of directors member Staebler said that the consensus talks had, despite their collapse, increased acceptance for nuclear energy, because the discussion had acquired much more of a factual character. Thus, within a year, the number of people who wanted to abandon nuclear energy quickly fell from 32 to 24 percent. The number of people who are of the opinion that a modern industrial state needs nuclear power plants has risen from 29 percent at the beginning of the 1990's to 41 percent. Incidentally, with technological and other improvements to reactors over the past two decades, a notable degree of safety has been achieved. Serious accidents involving the release of radiation, even if the amounts do not exceed a natural level, have not occurred so far. Approved limits were only exceeded in the case of the "incident" at the Lingen nuclear power plant in 1969.
