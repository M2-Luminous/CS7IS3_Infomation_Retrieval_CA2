EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., August 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Riley, ANM&hyph;537, Federal Aviation Administration, Docket No. 94&hyph;ANM&hyph;9, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone number: (206) 227&hyph;2537. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On April 4, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish the Sandpoint, Idaho, Class E airspace area (59 FR 15669). This action is necessary to accommodate arrival/departure aircraft transitioning between the enroute and terminal areas in western Idaho. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference. Interested parties were invited to participate in the rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal. No comments were received. This action is the same as the proposal except for a typographical error discovered (and corrected herein) in the coordinates of the airspace description for Fairchild AFB, Washington. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace is published in Paragraph 6006 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Sandpoint, Idaho. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air). Adoption of the Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the FAA amends 14 CFR part 71 as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED] 1.
