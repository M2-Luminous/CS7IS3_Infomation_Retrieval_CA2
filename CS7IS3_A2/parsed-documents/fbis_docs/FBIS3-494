Feelings ran high yesterday following a Bophuthatswana cabinet decision not to participate in the April election. The announcement came amid an already volatile situation as civil servants demanding reincorporation into South Africa continued their strike. At the Mmabatho Sun Hotel, which was occupied by disgruntled workers yesterday, it was business as usual, and by midnight last night all communication links had been restored.
