The majority of the miners were arrested on the Brazilian-Colombian border, near the Army battalion in Cucui. Jose Altino Machado, director of the Legal Amazon Region Miners Union Association, said: The Brazilian miners were illegally arrested and taken to Puerto Ayacucho [Venezuela]. The undefined markers on the Brazilian-Venezuelan border, manifested in the massacre of 16 Ianomami Indians in the Haximu area in August 1993, facilitated the invasion of Brazilian territory. Jose Altino Machado said: The Venezuelan National Guard arrests the miners to steal their gold. The miners were arrested last week and held in Puerto Ayacucho, located 400 km from the border, until 16 February.
