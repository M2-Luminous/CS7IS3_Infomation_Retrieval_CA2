Italy, Saudi Arabia, and the Emirates are its first targeted customers. Matra Defense unveiled its new, combination navy weapons system featuring two new types of long-range missiles in a single firing unit at the Dubai Show held last week in the Gulf Emirates. The antisubmarine torpedo-bearing Milas carries a light torpedo about 55 km, while the antiship Otomat Mk3 can attack the biggest surface vessels from as far away as 180 km. According to Matra Defense, the combination Milas/Otomat Mk3 offers "unrivaled flexibility at minimal cost and with minimal space, weight, and electrical requirements." Indeed, a single combat system fires both the Milas or Otomat Mk3 using various on-board sensors (sonars, radars, sight units, etc.) and one control panel manned by a single operator. The missiles use the same firing containers mounted in pairs, a fact that enables the same firing unit to control 12 tubes containing any combination of Milas or Otomat Mk3 missiles. According to Matra, the eight-tube combination system can be installed on any warship starting at about 1,000 metric tons. Firing at a Ship From 180 Meters The Milas, says Matra, is "a new torpedo-bearing missile designed to respond without delay to the briefest detection of a faraway submarine", by firing a light torpedo at the target from distances of between 5 and 55 km. The National Navy has opted for the new Franco-Italian torpedo Impact, alias MU-90, which was designed on the basis of components of the Whitehead A290 and DCN's Murene torpedoes. The French and Italian navies are expected to order Impact--supposedly in early 1995--from Eurotorp, a consortium of Whitehead (50 percent), DCN International (26 percent), and Thomson-Sintra ASM (24 percent). For export purposes, Matra is also studying ways to adapt the American light torpedo Mk46 (Honeywell) to Milas. The Otomat Mk3 antiship missiles borrow the technical refinements of Milas, and the airframe and propulsion system (Microturbo turbojet) of the Otomat Mk2. The 650-kg missile--205 kg of which is explosive charge--flies at Mach 0.9 and ranges 180 km. According to Matra, the Mk3 has a lower signature and is less vulnerable than a powder missile. It also boasts performance that is superior to that of earlier versions, partly due to a new Thomson-CSF homing head. The Otomat Mk3 can attack a target via four preselected trajectories. It travels through three orientation points while skirting obstacles (islands, etc.), and automatically resets to the target in-flight before finally intercepting it via hedge-hopping or diving (nose-up dive) flight. Operators can fire a salvo of three Otomat Mk3s at a single target at intervals of three seconds, or a single missile every 20 seconds. The Otomat Mk3 borrows certain technical refinements from the Milas, whose development--kicked off in 1988 under contract to the French and Italian navies--should be complete in late 1995. Production of the Milas will begin in 1996. In contrast, the Otomat Mk3 is a joint research project of Matra Defense and OTO Melara (Italy), funded through their own equity. This is the same formula that was used for earlier Otomat versions, nearly a thousand of which (980) sold to ten countries. But the French missilemaker points out that full development of the new Otomat will proceed only if an order (still to be won) is placed. Assuming one is, the missile(s) could be delivered about a year and a half after the contract. A spokesperson for the firm says the Otomat Mk3 should be available around 1995. Matra lists Italy, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia--for its F2000S destroyers--as the first potential customers for Milas, the new Otomat, and the combination Milas/Otomat Mk3.
