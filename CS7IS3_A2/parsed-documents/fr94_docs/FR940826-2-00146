Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on July 9, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change Currently, Section 9&hyph;1, ``Trustees of Stock Exchange Fund_How Appointed'' of Article IX, ``Trustees of Stock Exchange Fund'' of the Exchange's By-Laws requires that the trustees of the Stock Exchange Fund (``Fund'') include the Chairman of the Exchange's Board of Governors, two Vice Chairmen of the Board of Governors and up to five other Exchange members, all of whom are appointed by the Exchange's Board of Governors and serve for three years or until a successor is appointed. The PHLX proposes to amend Section 9&hyph;1 to allow two members of the Exchange's Board of Governors, rather than two Vice Chairmen, to serve as trustees of the Fund and to allow qualified non-members to serve as trustees. In addition, the PHLX proposes to amend Section 10&hyph;13, ``Executive Committee,'' of By-Law Article X, ``Standing Committees,'' to delete the requirement that the Executive Vice President of the Exchange serve on the Exchange's Executive Committee. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, PHLX, and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The PHLX states that the proposal to amend By-Law Article IX, Section 9&hyph;1 will give the Exchange's Board of Governors more flexibility in choosing trustees of the Fund by eliminating the requirement that all trustees be Exchange members or affiliated with member organizations. Under the proposal, the Board of Governors will be able to choose qualified persons with investment management expertise regardless of their status respecting Exchange membership or affiliation. The proposed amendment will also eliminate the requirement that the Exchange's Vice Chairmen serve as Fund trustees, to ease the administrative burdens currently imposed upon the Vice Chairmen. The proposal retains the Board of Governors' oversight of the trustees by continuing to require the Chairman of the Board of Governors to be a trustee and by imposing a new requirement that two other members of the Board of Governors be trustees. The proposed amendment to By-Law Article X, Section 10&hyph;13 deletes the Executive Vice President of the PHLX from membership on the Exchange's Executive Committee. The PHLX states that the Exchange's management will continue to be represented on the Executive Committee by the Exchange's President and Chief Executive Officer. The PHLX believes that the proposal is consistent with section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular with Section 6(b)(3), in that it is designed to assure a fair representation of the Exchange's members in the administration of its affairs and to provide that one or more Fund trustees may be representatives not associated with a member of the Exchange. 1 1 Telephone conversation between Murray L.

(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The PHLX does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.
