In an interview with HANDELSBLATT, Cot criticized the EU states of causing a "confidence crisis" in parliament. With a view to the EU foreign ministers' meeting on Tuesday [22 March], intended to settle the week-long internal dispute on the future weight of votes in the Council of Ministers after an enlargement, he warns the Twelve particularly against giving in to British pressure and leaving the blocking minority at 23 votes. The Parliament would not accept that the differences of opinion regarding the voting practice in the Council are "patched up," the chairman of the strongest group (198 deputies) in the Strasbourg parliament said. "It will not be enough to satisfy the positions of one or the other or to find ambiguous formulas that would make it possible for (British Foreign Secretary -- the editors) Mr. Hurd to save face." Should the blocking minority of 23 votes for ballots with a qualified majority in the Council be maintained, then the already tiresome decisionmaking process in the Union would become even more difficult. According to Cot, the British Government has meanwhile openly admitted "that it will indeed try to use enlargement to trim Europe's sails, keep it on its course, and keep the specter of `federalism' at bay." Parliament was firmly determined "not to accept such a change of course. Raising the blocking minority from 23 to 27 votes is the absolute minimum Parliament can accept!" Regardless of the controversy about the blocking minority, Cot believes that there are numerous other factors that might make it impossible for the member of the European Parliament to vote in favor of the membership agreement scheduled for 4 May. For months, the "negative signals" from the Council of Ministers to the address of the European deputies have increased: The suggestion to make the sessions of the Council of Ministers more "clear" has fallen on deaf ears; among other things, the member states reject "any discussion" on democratic control in connection with intensifying judicial and police cooperation; the issue of the rights of parliamentary sub-committees has also been blocked; moreover, several member states have upheld the "threat to reverse achievements in common foreign policy under the cover of subsidiarity." Similar to Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos, a few days ago Cot conceded that it might have been a mistake to enlarge the Union first and later deepen it. Cot emphasized that, only after long hesitation, Parliament abandoned its original demand to carry out institutional reform of the Union before enlarging it. This order was opted for ultimately, among other things, to signal to the membership candidates that they are welcome in the Union. For Cot, "the EU states have fallen behind their obligations under the Maastricht Treaty to consolidate the Union. On the contrary, the Twelve initially accepted a creeping process of disintegration, which has now been clearly confirmed by the British foreign secretary." To return to the right course, moving up the date of the government conference on examining the Maastricht Treaty, scheduled for 1996, could be considered "to discuss all pending issues right now." However, this would put at risk enlargement, scheduled for early 1995. If the EU foreign ministers indeed wanted to save the entry round, they would have to make sure "that the decisionmaking processes in the Union are not weakened. The Council of Ministers must undertake clear political obligation to the necessity of institutional reform. Without such a commitment there can be no enlargement!"
