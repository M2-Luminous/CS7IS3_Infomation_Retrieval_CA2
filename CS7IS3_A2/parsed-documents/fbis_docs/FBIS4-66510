This modernization process was explained by Mr. Abdelhak Bouhafs, Sonatrach's director-general, at a conference, which he gave in December 1993. The first stage, covering the years 1992-95, aims at making Sonatrach an Algerian petroleum and industrial group having its hydrocarbon activity in every direction. This stage aims to strengthen the company's basic technical skills and seek excellence in these skills. The second stage, which overlaps the first, goes from 1992 to the year 2000. The aim is to make Sonatrach an Algerian and international petroleum and industrial group throughout the energy field, in chemistry, and associated services. Last the third stage, which will kick off the third millennium, should see Sonatrach turn into an Algerian and international petroleum group that is integrated and diversified in the new skills that have emerged out of the proximity of skills such as services, the farm-produce industry, etc. According to Mr. Bouhafs, four major phenomena arising from an analysis of the worldwide hydrocarbons economy argue in favor of such a modernization. He first cited a return to integration, with an upwards return by Western companies and a downward expansion of activities by producing countries. Second, he noted the more pronounced breaking up of the market and the preeminence of stock market phenomena in the setting of international prices for the resource, resulting in their instability and their decrease in real terms. The third phenomenon related to the major technological expansion of international companies and their refocusing on the hydrocarbon industry. Last, Mr. Bouhafs mentioned an affirmation of the role of a relatively recent player in the petroleum world, the petroleum group that had emerged from the producing countries. This development of the worldwide hydrocarbon industry convinced Sonatrach's leaders that an increase in petroleum receipts would be more the result of efficiency on the part of the petroleum group which, according to Mr. Bouhafs, will have to be different from Sonatrach's current organization in its technological development and structural and managerial reinforcement. In this spirit, the Sonatrach group will be built around three areas of responsibility: - The group level, in which the general management will play the role of an industrial holding company. - The operational activities branches level, which is responsible for activity management and development. - The operational base unit level. At the same time these organizational measures are being carried out, Sonatrach is continuing with its development plan begun in 1992 and that should make it possible, as of 1996, to double exports of natural gas, substantially increase GPL [expansion not given] and condensate production, and slow down the rate at which the production of crude oil is declining. At his 22 December conference, Mr. Bouhafs wondered whether the oil market would come up to the expectations of Algerians who will have made very major investments to develop and modernize their petroleum and especially their gas industry. He replied as follows to his own question: "It is widely recognized that forecast analysts are influenced by economic conditions to the detriment of a prospective move. The last two decades have illustrated the implications of such a move: in the 1970's, it was the source of investments in the development of costly nonconventional energy sources and of excessive diversification strategies for the activities and skills of oil companies." "These strategies and programs were abandoned several years later, with diametrically opposed goals: now the emphasis has been put on technology to improve the use of conventional petroleum and gas and generalize their use. (...) This reminder allows us not to ignore economic conditions but to generalize them. In other words, where we are concerned, we should pursue our petroleum and gas development plan."
