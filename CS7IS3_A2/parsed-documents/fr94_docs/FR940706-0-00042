FR940706-0-00042 FR940706-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Secretary 24 CFR Part 17 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1738; FR&hyph;3595&hyph;F&hyph;01] RIN 2501&hyph;AB70 Administrative Claims AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, HUD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule brings up to date the Department's existing regulations relating to administrative claims to reflect current statutory authority for federal agencies to compromise, terminate or suspend collection activities on claims of the Government up to $100,000 without prior approval from the Department of Justice. The existing regulation limits such collection activities to debts up to $20,000. The rule also makes two other technical amendments_one relating to the assessment of interest on claims due to the Department and one relating to the distribution of certain final decisions on indebtedness made by HUD Deputy Assistant Secretaries. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Albert M. Miller, Departmental Claims Officer, room 2206, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410, voice (202) 708&hyph;3310, TDD (202) 708&hyph;9300. (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 3711(a) of title 31, United States Code authorizes the head of an executive or legislative agency to compromise (or to suspend or end collection action) on a claim of the Government of not more than $100,000 (excluding interest) or such higher amount as the Attorney General may from time to time prescribe provided that the claim has not been referred to another executive or legislative agency for further collection action. Prior to amendment of this section by the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;552, 104 Stat. 2736, Approved November 15, 1990) this authority of agencies to compromise, or to suspend or end collection actions on government claims was limited to claims of $20,000 or less. Existing HUD regulations (24 CFR Part 17 (Administrative Claims) contain a number of provisions setting forth the now out of date dollar threshold of $20,000 rather than the $100,000 threshold which the statute (31 U.S.C. 3711(a)) currently authorizes. This rule updates HUD regulations (Subpart C of 24 CFR Part 17_Procedures for the Collection of Claims by the Government) to reflect the new $100,000 statutory threshold. Current regulations_17 CFR 17.72(e)_provide for assessment of interest on claims due the Department at 7 percent. This rule revises this provision to provide for the assessment of interest at the Treasury rate in effect when the demand for payment is made, as provided in the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982, and in the joint regulations of the Attorney General and Comptroller General at 4 CFR Parts 101&hyph;105 (joint regulations). The rule also revises section 17.72(e) which currently reads: When a debt is paid in installments and interest is collected, installment payments will first be applied to the payment of accrued interest and then to principal in accordance with the so-called ``U.S. Rule'' unless a different rule is prescribed by statute, contract or regulation.
