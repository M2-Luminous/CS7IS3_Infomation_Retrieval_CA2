FR941205-2-00076 FR941205-2-00043 (B) The Guarantees are made solely with respect to the amounts which are due the Plans, but unpaid, with respect to the GACs; and (C) The Settlement Agreement described within the Summary of Facts and Representations, in the notice of proposed exemption, is approved by the U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut. For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this exemption, refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on September 30, 1994 at 59 FR 50011. Written Comments: The Department received 16 written comments and no requests for a hearing. Two of the comments requested additional information, which was provided by telephone by a representative of the Department. Twelve of the comments did not address substantively the transactions addressed by the proposed exemption. The remaining two comments addressed substantive issues relating to the proposed exemption: 1. One comment raised issues which are summarized as follows: (a) The Plans continue to lose earning opportunities on the assets invested in the GACs until 1999; (b) The Plans' participants have incurred administrative and litigation expenses related to the proposed transaction; (c) The Employer's profitability is affected by the subject transactions; (d) The proposed transaction represents an estimated loss of 15 percent of the Plans' principal investment in the GACs; and (e) The Plans will have earned no income on their investments in the GACs. In a written response, the Xerox Corporation (the Applicant) notes that the comment raises questions, and appears to constitute an objection, with respect to the Applicant's entire two-part remedy proposed for the problems resulting from the conservatorship of Executive Life. This two-part remedy consists of (1) an up-front cash payment, and (2) the proposed Guarantees pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The Applicant emphasizes that the proposed exemption relates solely to the proposed Guarantees, and not to the entire two-part remedy. Since the comment addresses the entire remedy as a whole, the Applicant maintains that the comment is not relevant to the proposed exemption, which involves only the Guarantees. The Applicant states that prior to the Settlement Agreement's approval by the Federal District Court for the District of Connecticut (the Court), affected Plan participants were duly notified and afforded ample opportunity to comment on the proposed Settlement Agreement. In response to approximately 32,000 notices mailed to affected Plan participants publicizing the settlement's terms, in addition to newspaper reports, the Applicant states that only three objections were received. The Applicant represents that in its hearing on September 8, 1994, the Court determined that the Settlement Agreement was ``fair, reasonable and adequate''. In conclusion, the Applicant states that the comment is neither timely, nor relevant to the exemption request, nor in keeping with the judgment of the Court which has considered this matter. In specific response to the comment's point relating to litigation expenses, the Applicant states that fees and administrative costs with respect to the lawsuit resulting in the Settlement Agreement will be paid out of funds transferred by the Applicant to an escrow account. In specific response to the comment's point relating to loss of principal, the Applicant states that the comment is wrong factually: The Applicant represents that the proposed two-part remedy will protect 100 percent of the face value of the GACs as of April 1, 1991, consisting of all principal investments plus interest accrued at the rates guaranteed by the GACs, less previous withdrawals. 2. The other comment objected to the proposed transaction because of the commenter's opinion that it would wrongfully permit Xerox Corporation to reinstate the principal investments in the GACs by 1999 while depriving the Plans' participants of any interest on such funds. The commenter maintained that the proposed transaction rewards Xerox Corporation for faulty investment strategy and violations of its fiduciary duties. In a written response to this comment, the Applicant notes that, like the previous comment, it raises questions about the Applicant's entire two-part remedy as a whole, rather than the proposed exemption, which relates solely to the proposed Guarantees pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The Applicant maintains that since the comment addresses the entire proposed remedy, the comment is not relevant to the proposed exemption. As in response to the prior comment, the Applicant states that before the Settlement Agreement was approved by the Court, affected Plan participants were duly notified and afforded ample opportunity to comment on the proposed Settlement Agreement. The Applicant again notes that in its hearing on September 8, 1994, the Court determined that the Settlement Agreement was ``fair, reasonable and adequate''. The Applicant maintains in conclusion that the comment is neither timely, nor relevant to the exemption request, nor in keeping with the judgment of the Court which has considered this matter. 3. The Department notes that, although all aspects of the Settlement Agreement were disclosed in the Applicant's exemption application, the exemption request was specifically limited to the provision of the Guarantees by the Xerox Corporation. Accordingly, the Department considered the request in the context of a settlement agreement that had been agreed to by the parties to the litigation and approved by the U.S. District Court. In this regard, the Department noted in the proposal that it was not proposing any relief for any violation of Part 4 which may have arisen as a result of the acquisition and holding of the GACs. Accordingly, after consideration of the entire record, including the comments and the Applicant's responses, the Department has determined to grant the exemption as proposed.
