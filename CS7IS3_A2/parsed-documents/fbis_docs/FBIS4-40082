Viktor Ivanov, deputy director of the Second Asia Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, reported this to the ITAR-TASS correspondent today. Other documents are expected to be signed, including agreements on trade and economic cooperation in the agro-industrial complex, and an agreement on cooperation in the fishing industry. Ten intergovernmental agreements between Russia and Vietnam have already been signed. The diplomat noted that the visit was important because a Vietnamese prime minister will meet Russian leaders for the first time since the disintegration of the Soviet Union. [passage omitted] He said, however, that there were a number of complex and delicate issues in Russo-Vietnamese relations. These include the problem of Vietnamese debts to the former Soviet Union, which amount to around 10 trillion rubles (previous years prices). [passage omitted] The other matter is the Vietnamese community in Russia that numbers several tens of thousands of people. The diplomat noted that several of them--like representatives of other foreign countries--commit various types of offenses in their commercial activity. Joint, civilized, methods are needed to resolve this matter, based on legislation. Moscow welcomes the "open doors" policy conducted by the Vietnamese leaders, and it is no coincidence that priority at the upcoming talks is being given to trade and economic issues. The Russian diplomat noted that the stances taken by Russia and Vietnam coincide on the overwhelming majority of issues. It is expected that the parties will devote most attention this time to cooperation in the Asiatic-Pacific Ocean region, taking into account the increasing role Vietnam is playing in southeast Asia. Russia understands the Socialist Republic of Vietnam's desire to join ASEAN --with which Russia is also entering into more active political dialogue.
