Though directors of industrial enterprises and production companies participated in it, it definitely had a direct bearing on agriculture. After all, the severance of economic ties between Russia and Ukraine also hit rural areas hard. As we know, when the USSR collapsed, production of row-crop tractors remained in Ukraine and Belorussia [Belarus] while production of grain-harvesting combines remained in Russia. What is more, the "Rostselmash" plant receives diesel engines from Kharkov. As a result the slightest failure in the delivery of parts from Russia to the Kharkov "Serp i Molot" plant may lead to its shutdown, and this will disrupt the production of grain-harvesting combines, which in turn may disrupt agricultural work in Ukraine. Russia will also have a hard time. The meeting's participants came to the unanimous decision that the only way out of the present situation is to form an effective economic union. They adopted an Appeal to the Presidents, Parliaments, and Governments of Ukraine and Russia containing a demand to do everything in their power to create appropriate conditions of economic integration between the two countries. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, who received Arkadiy Volskiy and Leonid Kuchma, was familiarized with the document.
