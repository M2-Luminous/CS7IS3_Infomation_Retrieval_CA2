FR940826-2-00105 FR940826-2-00055 III. The Court Should Defer Consideration of the BOC's Request for Generic Modification of Cellular Exchange Areas The BOCs also seek relief expanding the areas in which they are permitted to offer local service to Major Trading Areas defined by Rand McNally, plus existing cellular service areas as they have been expanded by the Court in 49 cellular waiver orders, plus adjacent Rural Service Areas (``RSAs''). As a result, several of the calling areas that would be created by the BOCs' waiver are substantially larger even than MTAs. 56 56 For example, see the following maps attached to the Affidavit of Peter A. Morrison (June 15, 1994), submitted by the BOCs: Cincinnati-Columbus-Dayton, El Paso, Knoxville, Clarksville, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City, Tulsa, Wichita. Although the BOCs' memorandum makes no mention of the fact that they seek relief that is broader than MTAs, that is the effect of their proposed order's provision that, ``where a LATA or integrated service area authorized by a prior waiver overlaps two or more major trading areas, the major trading area in which the largest portion of the LATA or integrated service area falls (as determined by geographic area) shall be deemed to include the entire LATA or integrated service territory.'' BOC Proposed Order, p. 5. Enlarging local calling scopes moves traffic from the interexchange market, which is at least somewhat competitive, to the celluar market, which in the Department's view is less competitive. By AT&T's estimate, fully 25 percent of all interexchange traffic is within MTAs. 57 Thus, the proposed relief could move as much as 25 percent of cellular-originated long distance traffic from more competitive interexchange markets to less competitive cellular markets. 57 AT&T's Supplemental Opposition to RBOCs' Motion to Exempt Wireless Service from Section II of the Decree, p. 17 (Oct. 25, 1993). This 25 percent estimate would be reduced in light of existing cellular waivers, which have expanded the BOCs' coverage areas. See BOC Mem. 44 (``the switch to MTAs would not involve a very large expansion''). To the extent that current coverage areas approach MTAs in size, less traffic would be ``duopolized,'' but there is likewise less need for relief. Recognizing the consequences of expanding local calling areas, the Court has held that it would only do so upon a showing of ``community of interest,'' so that the Court could be satisfied that ``the public benefits accruing from slight departures from the strict LATA boundaries to accommodate motorists with cellular phones were so substantial that they outweighed, on this limited basis, the dangers to fair competition.'' 58 Traffic patterns and ``metropolitan complexes'' have been the Court's primary guideposts in making these exceptions, as the BOCs acknowledge. (BOC Mem. 41) 58 Triennial Review, 673 F. Supp. at 552, quoted, United States v. Western Elec. Co., 1990&hyph;2 Trade Cas. ¶69,177, at 64,455 (D.D.C. 1990). The BOCs had 23 waivers pending at the end of 1991, when they agreed to hold those waivers in abeyance pending their pursuit of this generic wireless waiver. Many of these waivers, such as BellSouth's waiver for all of the State of Florida, 59 cannot be justified by reference to traffic patterns or metropolitan complexes except in the most attenuated fashion. Rather, MTAs reflect patterns of commercial activity (BOC Mem. 43), not the patterns of personal movement on which the Court has relied. While ``patterns of traffic'' may exist among any two cities chosen at random (in that someone probably went between them once), MTAs do not purport to represent areas within which people move on a daily basis. 60 59 Motion of BellSouth Corporation for a Waiver of Section II(D) of the Modification of Final Judgment to Allow BellSouth Corporation To Provide Integrated MultiLATA Cellular Service, May 9, 1991. BellSouth made virtually no attempt to show a community of interest for the State of Florida. Rather, BellSouth relied principally on arguments that its cellular service faces competition. The only evidence of community of interest for the State of Florida that BellSouth offers is that the Department of Transportation has observed that a certain number of vehicles crossed LATA boundaries on a particular day. The fact that vehicles left the Tampa LATA on a particular day provides no support for the proposition that ``subscribers will want and expect to be in communication with mobile units in this traffic which regularly crosses from one LATA to another,'' Mobile Services Decision, 578 F. Supp. at 648, much less that people drive from Tampa to Miami as regularly as they drive from New York City to northern New Jersey. See also Southwestern Bell's Response to Comments (March 1, 1990) (``there is no requirement in Section VIII (c) that a BOC must make a showing that a ``community of interest'' exists before the Court can grant a MultiLATA cellular waiver''). 60 Thus, for example, the Los Angeles MTA includes Las Vegas; the New York City MTA includes Burlington, Vermont; the San Francisco MTA includes Reno, Nevada; and the Spokane, Washington, MTA includes Billings, Montana_a distance of nearly 1,000 miles (according to Rand McNally). It is also suggested that the FCC's decision to license some PCS spectrum blocks using MTAs indicates that MTAs are appropriate local calling areas. (BOC Mem. 43&hyph;44) The FCC has also ``embraced'' Basic Trading Areas, which are substantially smaller than LATAs. FCC PCS Order ¶76, at 7733. None of these determinations of the appropriate size of radio licenses_the context in which the Commission considered MTAs as providing ``economies of scale and scope necessary to promote the development of low cost PCS equipment'' (BOC Mem. 44, quoting FCC PCS Order ¶75, at 7733)_reflects a determination by the Commission of the appropriate local calling ares for cellular systems providing equal access. That issue will be taken up if the Commission decides to impose equal access on cellular or other wireless carriers, an issue now open for comment before it. The United States proposes that the Court defer redefining cellular local calling areas until the Commission has acted; the BOCs, having argued that the Commission's ``embrace'' of MTAs in another context is determinative, resist allowing the expert agency to attempt to address this issue. It would not be sensible for the Court and the Department to embark on this mapmaking project again, at the same time as the Commission is considering the issue. The result could be that, instead of the one cellular calling area map now devised by the Court, there could be three maps: The old adjusted LATA map, the new map drawn by the Court (whether MTAs or something else), and a different map developed by the FCC. It seems more sensible for the FCC to act first. If the Commission adopts equal access, and draws a map, then the Court can determine whether that map addresses the needs of the Decree and, if so, conform the Decree's cellular LATAs to the FCC's decision. If the FCC determines not to impose equal access, then the Court can revisit this issue_and the BOCs can attempt to make a more persuasive case, or seek a more reasonable alternative. In the meanwhile, the Department will consider the pending cellular geography waivers, which had been deferred, to be ripe for decision, and will advise the BOCs shortly whether it will support or oppose specific waivers.
