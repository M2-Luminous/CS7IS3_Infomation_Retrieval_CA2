Burgos] [Text] Armed Forces chief General Lisandro Abadia yesterday called on Nur Misuari, chief of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) to get members of the dreaded Abu Sayyaf group out of Basilan and Jolo to prove their sincerity in attaining peace in Mindanao. Abadia aired the call to Misuari in yesterday's breakfast forum at the Manila Pavilion. "Nakikiusap kami sa MNLF na kung hindi ninyo makumbinsi, paalisin ninyo sila (Abu Sayyaf members). Nakakahiya, naguusap tayo tapos yung mga kriminal nasa paligid natin [We are appealing to the MNLF that if you can't convince them (Abu Sayyaf members), then get rid of them. It's a shame to talk peace while criminals are freely roaming around us]," Abadia said. Although Abadia has belittled the capacity of Abu Sayyaf members -- about 100 to 150 plain criminals -- to launch major offensives against the government, he nevertheless sought the help of MNLF in maintaining peace and order in the area. Police reports said that while peace negotiations between the government and the MNLF were going on, suspected members of Muslim extremist group Abu Sayyaf were reportedly sighted roaming around Jolo, Sulu and Basilan. However, Abadia refused to comment on reports that the Abu Sayyaf is the "money-making front" of the MNLF but said that the extremist group has generated enough money from kidnaping and other criminal activities. Abadia also said that the recent clashes between government troops and some members of the MNLF did not in any way affect the ongoing peace talks. "Soldiers have to defend the innocent people," Abadia said. The 7 November interim cease fire agreement states that "the forces of both parties shall remain in their respective places and refrain from any provocative actions or any acts of hostilities." Latest reports reaching Camp Aguinaldo said at least seven troopers were wounded following a clash with MNLF rebels in Basilan last Saturday [22 Jan], the most serious breach of the interim cease fire agreed on by the government and the rebel group. Earlier reports of clashes after the truce pact was inked were all attributed either to the communist New People's Army (NPA) or the so-called "MNLF Lost Commands." In the past few weeks, sporadic encounters between government troops and suspected MNLF members in Basilan had resulted in the wounding of dozens of soldiers and policemen and an undetermined number of casualties to the rebels. Mindanao Marines commander Brigadier General Guillermo Ruiz and co-chairman of the joint cease fire committee has said that "minor violations" on both sides had been reported and that these would be addressed by the committee.
