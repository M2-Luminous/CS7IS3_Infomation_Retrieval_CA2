FR940607-2-00013 FR940607-2-00010 [C&hyph;549&hyph;811] Notice of Initiation of Countervailing Duty Investigation: Disposable Pocket Lighters From Thailand AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Elizabeth A. Graham or Kristin M. Heim, Office of Countervailing Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230; (202) 482&hyph;4105 or 482&hyph;3798, respectively. The Petition On May 9, 1994, we received a petition in proper form filed by the BIC Corporation on behalf of the United States disposable pocket lighter (``disposable lighters'') industry. In accordance with 19 CFR 355.12, petitioner alleges that manufacturers, producers, or exporters of the subject merchandise in Thailand receive benefits which constitute bounties or grants within the meaning of section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Injury Test Although Thailand is not a ``country under the Agreement'' within the meaning of section 701(b) of the Act, the merchandise being investigated is non-dutiable under the Generalized System of Preferences and Thailand is a contracting party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Therefore, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) is required to determine whether imports of the subject merchandise from Thailand materially injure, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Standing Petitioner has stated that it is an interested party, as defined in section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and that it has filed the petition on behalf of the U.S. industry producing disposable lighters. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition, such party should file a written notification with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, in accordance with 19 CFR 355.31. Exclusion Requests Under the Department's regulations, any producer or reseller seeking exclusion from a potential countervailing duty order must submit its request for exclusion within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice. The procedures and requirements regarding the filing of such requests are contained in 19 CFR 355.14. Scope of Investigation The products covered by this investigation are disposable pocket lighters, whether or not refillable, whose fuel is butane, isobutane, propane, or other liquified hydrocarbon, or a mixture containing any of these, whose vapor pressure at 75 degrees fahrenheit (24 degrees celsius) exceeds a gage pressure of 15 pounds per square inch. Non-refillable pocket lighters are imported under subheading 9613.10.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``HTSUS''). Refillable, disposable pocket lighters would be imported under subheading 9613.20.0000. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written descriptions of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. Initiation of Investigation The Department has examined the petition on disposable lighters from Thailand and found that it complies with the requirements of section 702(b) of the Act. Therefore, in accordance with section 702 of the Act, we are initiating a countervailing duty investigation to determine whether manufacturers, producers or exporters of disposable lighters receive countervailable bounties or grants. The following programs are included in our investigation. 1. Industrial Estates/Export Processing Zones 2. Preferential Short-term Loans Under the Export Packing Credit Program 3. Tax and Duty Exemptions Under the Investment Promotion Act 4. Tax Certificates for Exporters 5. Rediscount of Industrial Bills 6. International Trade Promotion Fund This notice is published pursuant to section 702(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 355.13(b). Dated: May 31, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;13807 Filed 6&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;M
