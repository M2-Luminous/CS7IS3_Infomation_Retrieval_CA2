FR940406-2-00098 FR940406-2-00050 Bureau of Land Management [UT&hyph;080&hyph;4410&hyph;02; 4310&hyph;DQ 4&hyph;00152] Proposed Plan Amendments to Management Plans AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: Notice of intent to amend plans. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given of intent to prepare Category I plan amendments to the Diamond Mountain, Browns Park, and Ashley-Duchesne Management Frameworks Plans (MFPs) and the Book Cliffs Resource Management Plan (RMP). The proposed plan amendments will be prepared in conformance with the planning requirements and policies of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The proposed plan amendments and accompanying environmental assessment will provide the basis for designating additional public lands to those lands previously identified for sale in the land tenure adjustment portions of the existing MFPs and RMP. The sale of public lands not previously identified in the above-referenced planning documents will be subject to existing planning criteria and will meet the disposal standards established in section 203(a) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (43 U.S.C. 1713; 90 Stat. 2750). DATES: For a period of May 6, 1994, written comments may be submitted to the BLM Vernal District Office listed below. All comments will be considered in preparing the environmental assessment for the proposed plan amendments. ADDRESSES: Send comments on these proposed plan amendments to David Little, District Manager, Vernal District Office, Bureau of Land Management, 170 South 500 East, Vernal, Utah 84078. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Peter Kempenich, Natural Resource Specialist, Vernal District Office, (801) 781&hyph;4432. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Vernal District's Diamond Mountain and Book Cliffs Resource Areas are situated in northeastern Utah near the Colorado-Utah border and include portions of Uintah, Daggett, and Duchesne Counties. The issue in completing the proposed plan amendments is the degree of potential adverse environmental impacts that may occur should the public land be conveyed into non-Federal ownership. As part of the proposed plan amendment process, an environmental assessment will be prepared to provide a detailed analysis of the following resource concerns: wildlife and fisheries habitat, recreation, watershed, paleontological and cultural resources, threatened and endangered plants and animals, and land uses. Upon completion of the environmental assessment and approval of the proposed plan amendments, additional public lands may be disposed of through public lands sales. The public, state and local governments, and other Federal agencies are asked to participate in the proposed plan amendment process. James M. Parker, State Director.
