Thomas Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, disclosed before the meeting that the working-level contact was being held upon the request from the North Korean side, thus strongly hinted that the North Korean negotiators have received instructions from Pyongyang. Hubbard, head of the U.S. side, when asked what is the biggest stumbling block in the talks, said it is an exchange of special envoys between the North and South, a condition for the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks. Prior to the working-level contact, an official of the North Korean mission to the United Nations revealed that something may happen and perhaps a conclusion may be reached today [local time], thus fueling speculations that a certain decision has been made in Pyongyang in connection with the exchange of special envoys. Attention is now focused on how the two sides will narrow their differences in today's contact over the exchange of special envoys. Diplomatic sources speculate that, if today's contact fails, chances are high that North Korea will buy time until 28 February, the date that the International Atomic Energy Agency will convene the special Board of Governors' meeting, and try to meet the U.S. side once more to tug out the final agreement.
