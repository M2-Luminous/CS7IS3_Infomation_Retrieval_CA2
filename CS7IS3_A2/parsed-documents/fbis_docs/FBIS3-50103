The letter reads: Yesterday afternoon shells fired from Serb positions killed six children playing in the snow in front of their houses in Sarajevo. Several other children were seriously wounded, and doctors are still fighting for their lives. Horror of this kind has been going on for 22 months in the besieged Sarajevo. Mr. President, is there an effective way to realize finally your proposal on lifting the arms embargo against our country and on the bombing of Serb positions around Sarajevo? You said that you would not tolerate the strangulation of Sarajevo. Let us hope that your country will not allow the international community's stand on Bosnia-Herzegovina to continue being influenced by countries that tolerate genocide and reward aggression. This is said in Ejup Ganic's letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton.
