Li Chunting, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and vice governor of the provincial government; and Chen Jianguo, standing committee member of the provincial party committee and vice governor of the provincial government, were present at the meeting. Li Chunting stressed in his speech: According to the requirements for deepening enterprise reform and changing managerial mechanism, on the premise of ensuring social stability, and according to different actual conditions, all localities should adopt various forms and open various channels to explore ways for arranging enterprises' surplus staff members and workers, gradually set up an enterprise employment system suitable to the socialist market economic system, strive to change the enterprise managerial mechanism, upgrade labor productivity, and comprehensively increase enterprises' economic results. This is also the province's general guiding ideology of arranging jobs for enterprises' surplus staff members and workers. Li Chunting pointed out: Reform, development, and stability are the overall work situation this year. The economic work should be submitted to and serve this situation. We should persistently grasp reform and development with one hand and stability with the other. This year, the state worked out a series of major reform measures with enterprise reform as its nucleus. Appropriately employing surplus personnel is an important content of the enterprise reform as well as a difficult and hot-debated issue. Realistically solving the problems in this regard is the internal requirement for deepening reform as well as an essential requirement for accelerating the pace of development. A calculation shows that so far, about 30 percent of the enterprises' staff members and workers are surplus personnel. The problems in some enterprises where production is totally or partially suspended are more prominent. This situation, if not changed, will seriously restrict and obstruct the deepening of enterprise reform and the setup of the modern enterprise system. Simultaneously, appropriately arranging jobs for surplus staff members and workers is a need for maintaining social stability. Therefore, we should enhance the sense of urgency and the sense of responsibility and be determined to achieve the work in this regard. Li Chunting said: This year, the enterprise managerial mechanism is being changed noticeably at a faster speed. The failure to solve the problems relating to surplus staff members and workers will affect reform and the trial implementation of the modern enterprise system. Therefore, the enterprises carrying out the modern enterprise system on a trial basis and carrying out the shareholding system should simultaneously expand the dynamics of reforming labor, employment, and distribution systems and regard the employment of surplus staff members and workers as an essential task. Simultaneously, according to the actual conditions of enterprises, we should study and explore effective ways and methods for arranging jobs for surplus staff members and workers. According to advanced and reasonable "dual standards," the enterprises with better economic results should boldly and resolutely reduce the number of surplus staff members and workers, solve the problems that enterprises take on heavy burdens to develop social undertakings, divorce themselves from the organizations providing auxiliary service to enterprises, expand service functions, and enhance the capability of assimilating labor forces. The enterprises with general economic results should combine the arrangements of jobs for surplus workers with the enterprise structural readjustment and technological transformation, reasonably distribute labor resources, and vigorously develop the tertiary industry with less investment and faster economic results. The enterprises suffering long-term deficits are allowed to adopt such methods as providing labor services, exporting techniques, and encouraging staff members and workers to engage in individual management and self-employment to arrange jobs for the surplus staff members and workers. Li Chunting stressed: The most realistic and basic way for arranging jobs for surplus staff members and workers is internal digestion. We should carry out the method dominated by the arrangements by enterprises and supplemented by social arrangements instead of the wait-and-rely-on method. In line with the reform of employment, labor, and distribution systems, we should rely on our own efforts to make development; develop new entities, tertiary industry, and a diversified economy; adopt various forms to encourage a portion of personnel to engage in self-employment; and try every possible means to distribute and arrange surplus personnel.
