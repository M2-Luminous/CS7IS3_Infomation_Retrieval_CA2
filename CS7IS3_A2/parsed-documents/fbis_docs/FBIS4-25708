During the first five months of this year, although industrial enterprises in our province encountered numerous difficulties in production and operations, statistics show that industrial production in our province is still advancing along a favorable path. Production and sales rates of our industrial enterprises increased each month. Their production and sales rate in May reached 95.8 percent, and the sales volume of their products on both domestic and international markets rose gradually. As a result of this year's implementation of the policy of unifying foreign exchange rates, the enthusiasm of enterprises and relevant departments has been aroused. This has enabled the increased output value of export products to exceed growth in total industrial output value for the first time, and the margin of the increase was 8.4 percentage points. At present, an electronics products structure has been formed in our province, mainly consisting of electric appliances, such as air conditioners and hi-fi equipment. The extensive application of high technology is gradually changing low efficiency.
