FBIS4-37116 "drnes117_o_94002" FBIS-NES-94-117 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 SYRIA Official Hits U.S., Others for Arming Israel Official Hits U.S., Others for Arming Israel PM1606134094 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Arabic 16 Jun 94 p 5 PM1606134094 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Arabic BFN [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Syria Criticizes Washington for Supplying Israel With Arms"] [Text] Damascus, Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Well-informed Arab sources in Cairo have said that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher intends to send Ambassador Dennis Ross, U.S. general coordinator of the bilateral negotiations, to the Middle East before the end of the month to make shuttle trips between Damascus and Tel Aviv before Christopher's new tour, which is expected to begin in July. The sources said that Dennis Ross will carry with him new Israeli proposals regarding the negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track and an amendment to the Israeli plan on withdrawal from "Majdal Shams First" so as to include in the first phase a withdrawal from five villages on the Golan Heights, then diplomatic relations would be established between Syria and Tel Aviv. The sources said that Syria has told the U.S. Administration that the guarantees offered to it so far under the Israeli plan are insufficient and conflict with the basic principles of the bilateral negotiations and the need for Israel's commitment to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights and the implementation of the land for peace principle, and that security guarantees concern not only Israel, but all the parties concerned. The sources pointed out that the U.S. administration is seeking to get Syria to agree to resume bilateral negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track, especially after Jordan's agreement to resume negotiations on the Jordanian-Israeli track. In the context of a new tour of the region for U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in a new bid to revive peace opportunities between Syria and Israel, Syria has expressed its indignation at the Israeli position and the Rabin government's continued refusal to withdraw, which, in the Syrian officials' view, freezes the peace process and keeps it at a standstill. A Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that what Rabin said, namely that there has been nothing new with regard to the talks with Syria and the existence of huge gaps between the Syrian and Israeli positions on the peace process, is attributable to the fact that the Rabin government continues to deal with the basis of the peace process from the angle of retaining the Golan and not withdrawing fully from the occupied Arab territories, thus exposing itself as a party that has no desire for a just and comprehensive peace. Meanwhile the Syrian position is fully responsive to the requirements of peace and to all the political efforts being made to achieve it on the basis of just and comprehensive foundations. Syria proceeds from its eagerness to achieve a secure and lasting peace that cannot be shaken by storms. The Syrian official said that, if Israel is really and seriously seeking peace, all it has to do is to withdraw fully from the Arab territories, implement the resolutions of international legitimacy in order to achieve peace in the region, and stop -- it and its leader -- swimming against the tide. Meanwhile a Syrian military official has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Israeli armament is a threat to the region's security and stability. And that Israeli military thinking -- regardless of the costs -- is working to make Israel a military state. It is not interested in peace. It is interested in war and in expanding the aggression. The source said that Israel is in the forefront of the states receiving arms, and it is the most prominent with regard to the purchase of various types of military equipment, despite what is being said about control of the arms race in the region. The military official criticized states that supply Israel with arms while they continue to talk about peace endeavors and efforts. He said that when the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which the United States believes is within the framework of peace, was being signed, Israel was supplied -- by airlift -- with 24 Apaches. They were supplied under U.S. military aid. These helicopters are among the best in the world. A squadron of these helicopters took part recently in shelling Lebanese resistance positions in Lebanon, causing great devastation. Israel has also a group of pilotless planes like Harvey Searcher Falcon, Eagle-eye, Kurns-2000, and modified Hunter "Binar" [names as transliterated]. There is information confirming Israel's possession of a group of Patriot missiles, which were supplied to the Israeli Army during the Gulf war. The Syrian military official added that the quantity and quality of the arms in Israel's possession and those which it is seeking to possess is not in line with the peace proposals and confirm that Israel does not want peace, but, rather, is preparing for war, as Washington continues to officially declare its eagerness to maintain Israel's military superiority over neighboring Arab states, safeguarding this superiority within the equations of military strategic balance and confronting the advanced weapons owned by some Arab states with weapons that are superior. The official pointed out that this military superiority represents a real threat to peace in the region, and no peace can last where the military balances of power are disrupted.
