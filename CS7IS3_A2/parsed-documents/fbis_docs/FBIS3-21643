He will serve this sentence at the Callao Naval Base where he will be Abimael Guzman's neighbor. According to a document circulated today by the Supreme Military Justice Council, Chavez was sentenced to life and will serve it at the maximum security prison at the Callao Naval Base, possibly in a cell next to or near terrorist leader Abimael Guzman Reynoso. Demetrio Limonier Chavez Penaherrera, alias El Vaticano, has been condemned for treason against the fatherland and the state, but he will be tried for illegal drug trafficking in a civilian court. El Vaticano, however, will not go to the Justice Palace offices. Instead, the penal judge will go to the naval base installations just as has already been done once, according to information given by a military spokesmen. El Vaticano was captured in Cali, Colombia, where he was living. According to what has been established, however, he continued handling the drug business in the Peruvian jungle. The criminal, who is now serving a life sentence, was considered Peru's most powerful drug trafficker due to the amount of drugs he collected and shipped to Colombia to be converted into cocaine for subsequent shipment to the U.S. and European markets.
