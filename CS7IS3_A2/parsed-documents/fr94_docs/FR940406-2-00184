FR940406-2-00184 FR940406-2-00097 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Notice of Intent To Prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, for the Defense Waste Processing Facility, at the Savannah River Site, Aiken, SC AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of Intent to Prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE) announces its intent to prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and to conduct a public scoping process pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ), to examine the environmental impacts of the modifications made to the Defense Waste Processing Facility and associated high-level waste facilities at the Savannah River Site. The Supplemental EIS will supplement the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that DOE issued in 1982 (DOE/EIS&hyph;0082), and will evaluate whether and how to proceed with the Defense Waste Processing Facility in light of the changes in processes and facilities that have occurred since the 1982 EIS was issued. That EIS, its Record of Decision, and a subsequent Environmental Assessment, Waste Form Selection for Savannah River Plant High-Level Waste (DOE/EA&hyph;0179), supported the preferred alternative for the construction and operation of the Defense Waste Processing Facility. The specific process and facility modifications that have been introduced or are being implemented in the Defense Waste Processing Facility system since the Record of Decision are discussed in the Supplementary Information section of this Notice of Intent. Background information on the Savannah River Site and issues proposed to be considered in this Supplemental EIS are presented in the Supplementary Information below as well. DOE also is announcing today its intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for Waste Management at the Savannah River Site. (See the notice in this issue of the Federal Register .) DOE invites individuals, organizations, and agencies to comment on issues to be considered, alternatives to be analyzed, and environmental impacts to be addressed in the Supplemental EIS. Written and oral comments will be given equal weight. Written comments should be directed to Stephen R. Wright at the address below. Oral comments may be presented by voice mail at the telephone number below. Interested parties are invited to present comments at three public scoping meetings to be held at the dates and places indicated below. Additional notice will be given in appropriate media. At the scoping meetings and at informal information sessions held one month earlier, DOE also will provide the public with an opportunity to engage in informal discussions with DOE representatives regarding the Defense Waste Processing Facility. The scoping process and procedures are described in the Supplementary Information below. DATES: The public scoping period for the Supplemental EIS begins with the publication of this notice and continues until May 31, 1994. Written comments submitted by mail should be postmarked by that date to ensure consideration. DOE will consider comments mailed after that date to the extent practicable. DOE will host a series of informal information sessions to provide the public with additional information on the Defense Waste Processing Facility and the proposed actions and alternatives discussed in this Notice of Intent. These sessions are intended to promote conversation with DOE representatives available to answer questions. These informal sessions are scheduled at the following times and locations: April 12, 1994; 1&hyph;4 and 6&hyph;9 p.m.; North Augusta Community Center, 495 Brookside Avenue, North Augusta, South Carolina. April 19, 1994; 1&hyph;4 and 6&hyph;9 p.m.; DeSoto Hilton Hotel, 15 Liberty Street, Savannah, Georgia. April 21, 1994; 1&hyph;4 and 6&hyph;9 p.m.; Holiday Inn Coliseum at University of South Carolina, 630 Assembly Street, Columbia, South Carolina. Information sessions on two related EISs_the Interim Waste Management of Nuclear Materials at the Savannah River Site EIS (Notice of Intent published March 17, 1994; 59 FR 12588), and the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS_will be held at the same dates and locations.
