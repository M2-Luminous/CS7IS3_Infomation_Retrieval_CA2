This is the way in which the former U.S. secretary of state and former ambassador to Belgrade commented on the failed air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. Thus, the only military option that is left is the massive shelling of Serbian positions in Bosnia and Serbia. In the United States, however, where the signals on the future course of policy on Bosnia are contradictory, readiness for military escalation is declining. Washington is desperately trying to find a way out of the foreign policy quagmire. Basically, President Clinton's "considerations" about "nondiplomatic methods" against the Serbian besiegers of Gorazde do not change anything. Encouraged by European reservations one year ago, and unable to lead the United Nations to a credible policy of strength, the Clinton Administration is trying to avoid responsibility -- particularly in the humanitarian-ethical sphere. Now that it is apparently too late to save Gorazde, Serbian hopes are being realized: Washington has neither the willingness nor the courage to intervene in Bosnia. The case of Gorazde has unmasked U.S. policy on Bosnia: The fact that the United States is now afraid of a loss of face is the result of a careless foreign policy. Just as in Somalia, when Clinton insisted on chasing Aidid, he also misjudged the situation in Bosnia. In fact, he gave rise to expectations, particularly among the victims of the aggressor, but shrank back from the consequences; he uttered threats, but he then withdrew with his hesitant attitude and readiness for compromise. As a result, doubts concerning the moral authority, the determination, and sincerity of the United States developed even before Gorazde. Above all, the Clinton Administration lacks cohesion. Senator Orin Hatch from Utah is critical: "We are referring to the United Nations, otherwise the U.S. policy is unclear." The fact that the United States continues to accept the UN Security Council as the supreme authority and does not take the initiative has become the subject of public criticism in Washington. Military planning, too, is characterized by a lack of cohesion. The Pentagon has apparently deviated from the Powell doctrine and forgotten the lessons of the Vietnam and Gulf wars. Colin Powell, general chief of staff under President Bush, linked the deployment of U.S. troops with the feasibility of military goals and massive superiority on the battlefield. Henry Kissinger believes that the air strikes are only a "symbolic tit-for-tat during the final phase of a completed operation." The realization that the Serbs are about to achieve the goal of "objective cleansing" in the territorial conquest in Bosnia also leads to a new realpolitik assessment of the U.S. role in Congress. Some in Congress have already called for the complete withdrawal from Bosnia, because it is not possible to force the Serbs to participate in negotiations by using bombs. Since the military options are exhausted, as Kissinger noted, voices calling for the abolition of the weapons embargo for the Bosnian Muslims are being raised. However, Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also warns that, in view of Russian resistance in the United Nations, an abolition is only conceivable as a unilateral act by the United States. But this would mean that Washington would have to enter the conflict and wage a large part of the war on the side of the Muslims.
