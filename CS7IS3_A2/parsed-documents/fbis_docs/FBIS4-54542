Such is the conclusion from the findings of polls conducted by CUP [Central Planning Office] at 133 industrial, construction, and commercial enterprises, both public and private, and at 39 bank branches. To be sure, this cannot be the basis for evaluating the entire economy, but it may be that general trends are similar. Since December, the proportion of enterprises at which output has been rising remained the same at 30 percent. A most important fact is the 9-percent decline in February, compared with January, in the number of enterprises at which output fell. The rapid decline in unemployment has been halted. The decline in exports has been halted after three months of a steady decrease. More than one-half of the enterprises reported that the demand for their products is close to their productive capacities. The respondents to CUP's polls also expected the favorable trends to persist in March. At more than 70 percent of the polled enterprises, average wage did not change, while at 30 percent (that is, fewer, compared with 35 percent in December) the "popiwek" [tax on wage increases] was paid. In February, 26 percent of the enterprises (compared with 26 percent in January and 21 percent in December) raised the prices of their products and services. Fewer than 1 percent of the enterprises reported price reductions. Prices are rising because of the rising costs of raw materials, energy, and producer goods. In Industry In February, output rose at 30 percent of the polled enterprises and declined at 31 percent. These proportions are better than in the previous months and, most importantly, the forecasts for March are favorable. Forty-one percent of the enterprises anticipate an increase in output, and only 4 percent expect a decrease. Despite these improved prospects, it was pointed out that reasons for restricting output remain numerous. At many plants, the output level is unstable, and output planning is for periods not longer than six months. However, numerous instances prove that enterprises are exploring ways of extricating themselves from their problems. Marketing, the application of new technologies, restructuring, and organizational changes generally produce favorable results. It would be worthwhile to consider these instances. The Amino Plant in Poznan is part of the U.S. concern CPC operating 116 plants in 52 countries. Following modernization and the introduction of new licenses, the products of the Polish factory successfully withstand competition with Western products. The Automotive Electronics Plant in Elk (branch of the Warsaw FSO Passenger Car Factory) exports one-half of its output. It manufactures wiring (electrical, brake cable, etc.) for various makes of cars, such as Mercedes-Benz, GM, Fiat, and Peugeot. The Herbapol Plant in Lublin is benefiting from the growing interest in herbs, syrups, herb medicines, and herb teas. A new shift was added, along with 40 new jobs, and employment rose to 500. But, as the questionnaires show, the situation is not as favorable everywhere. Many enterprises and even entire branches and subsectors face huge problems with maintaining production. This chiefly concerns the arms plants. Their workforces are demanding bigger orders from the Defense Ministry, funds for restructuring, a halt to the placement of orders with foreign suppliers for those armament components that can be produced in this country, and social protection. The dispute betwee the Defense Ministry and the Mielec Transportation Equipment Plant about the Iryda aircraft threatens a decline of the aviation industry. The situation of the entire shipyard industry is deteriorating. The cutbacks in production at Gdansk Shipyard Incorporated directly affect its principal engine suppliers--that is, the Cegielski Plant in Poznan and Zgoda in Swietochlowice. It is believed that, although the crisis of the shipping industry worldwide is passing, the expensive products of the debt-laden Polish shipyards are not likely to find buyers. In Foreign Trade Following three months of steady decline, in February the proportion of enterprises whose exports increased rose (from 24 percent in January) to 44 percent in February. Similarly, there was a decrease in the number of enterprises at which exports dropped. For March, a decline in exports is anticipated at only 6 percent of enterprises, and at 54 percent the existing level of exports will be maintained. In the opinion of the enterprises, exports will stabilize because the contracts concluded for 1994 will be implemented. Many producers are striving to conclude long-term trade contracts. For example, the Widzew Wifama Machinery Plant is negotiating a four-year contract with Iran. The Plock Mostostal Steel Bridge Structures Plant has long-term [construction] contracts in Africa and the Middle East. Cooperation and mutual trade are growing in the border provinces of Poland. Slovakia has agreed to restore border traffic based on personal identity documents. Although border crossings are being modernized and new ones added, the widespread opinion is that they are still too few. Moreover, the absence of superhighways, harbor transloading terminals, and ferry bases clearly hobbles foreign trade. In the opinion of those responding to the CUP poll, the transit of goods across Poland in all directions should become one of the foundations of our economic strategy. For example, the expansion of the Gdynia seaport and the [construction of the] North-South Trans-European Highway would serve to absorb transit traffic from Scandinavia to the Middle East. In addition, a project for laying a broad-gauge railroad line from the Belarus border to the seaports of the Gdynia-Gdansk-Sopot Tricity is being considered. For the time being, however, the planning of highway construction is limited by the lack of funds needed for preliminary work and the acquisition of land. Greater interest is shown on the regional scale; for example, a consortium for building the East-West Highway was formed in Wielkopolska. On the Job Market In February, employment declined at 22 percent of the enterprises polled. In March, it is expected to decline at only 11.5 percent and to increase at 6 percent. An adequate level of employment was reported by 64 percent of the enterprises, an excessive level by 32 percent, and an insufficient level by 4 percent. Following an initial period of restructuring and cutbacks in employment, the enterprises are beginning to expand, explore new markets, and hire needed experts. The pattern of the ownership structure at enterprises subject to voivodes [province governors] is steadily changing. In Leszno Voivodship, one-half of 56 such enterprises became privatized (chiefly through a leasing procedure), in Bydgoszcz Voivodship 22 plants, and in Torun Voivodship 27. In Lodz Voivodship, ownership transformations in the past four years extended to 110 plants, of which 80 percent became employee-owned companies. This undermines the notion that state assets are being sold out to foreign investors. However, such investors did participate in successful privatization projects such as those concerning the Dresso Knitwear Factory, the Lodz Papermaking Plant, the Pabia ZPO, Elta, and Wizamet. In some cases, the decision to privatize has met with protest and resistance from trade unions and workforces, as, for example, at the Szczecin Shipyard, the Ozarow Cement Plant, and the Tobacco Factory in Krakow. Disputes in such controversial cases are delaying privatization.
