Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian Federation president's special representative, before returning to Moscow after his latest tour of former Yugoslavia, said that the possibility of adventurist sorties and provocations against the "blue helmets" in Sarajevo is not ruled out. According to him, there are those among Muslim figures in Bosnia who are continuing to make neurotic and sometimes irresponsible statements. The Russian diplomat did not specify who said what, although it is known that people very close to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic have repeatedly called the Russian contingent in Sarajevo "occupiers." Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian Muslim government's representative at the United Nations, used the same word recently. According to a spokesman for the Russian Armed Forces General Staff, this "rebuke" should seriously worry both the Russian leadership itself and Russia's partners among the NATO countries. Neither the British, nor the French, nor any other national contingent in the UN force in Bosnia has been attacked in this way. And if the deliberate defamation of the Russian "blue helmets," who played a key part in relieving the tension around Sarajevo, does not stop, Russia, according to him, will be fully entitled to consider a range of independent measures to protect its soldiers. That is what France did, for example, by sending an aircraft carrier group to the Adriatic Sea when Paris believed the lives of the French servicemen in Bosnia to be in particular danger. Nonetheless, Russia's stance on the Bosnian conflict remains the same. No ultimatums or threats of intervention by force will help resolve the crisis, which has a considerable international as well as internal dimension. Russian diplomacy's aim at the present stage is to make the cease-fire in Sarajevo the breakthrough to peace in Bosnia as a whole. And this will be achieved through close cooperation with the United Nations and NATO. This is the aim of the new Russian initiative on a summit meeting to discuss ways of stopping the war in former Yugoslavia, to be attended by the United States, Russia, France, Britain, and Germany. The foundation for the success of the conference exists. At the Bonn meeting on Tuesday there was unanimity, according to observers, among the Europeans, Americans, and Russians on a number of aspects. Chiefly on the fact that all countries interested in a settlement of the conflict must use all their political authority to pressure the warring sides into accepting the terms of the EC peace plan with regard to the territorial division of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Western capitals' initial reaction to Russia's initiative varied. The British Foreign Office has so far refrained from commenting, traditionally deferring to Washington. The United States, in turn, is in no hurry to assess the initiative, believing that a "summit meeting would require a great deal of preparation." There was a neutral, "if not negative" reaction from Rome. "The fact that Italy was not named among the participants in the proposed meeting made a negative impression" on Italian Foreign Minister B. Andreatta.
