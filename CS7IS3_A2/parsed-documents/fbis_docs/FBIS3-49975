Movement orders addressed to the refugee "reservists" began arriving by mail 10 days ago, Montenegro Social Democratic Party official Milorad Raznjatovic said here. The call-up is being carried out in collaboration with the rump Yugoslav army and the Montenegro police, Raznjatovic said. Movement orders received by one refugee, sent by the "defence ministry" of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb republic, instructed him to report to a Yugoslav army barracks in Tivat, Montenegro, "in order to fulfil his military obligations in the Serbian republic army," he said. Should the draftee fail to report, he will be "questioned," the orders specify. Bosnian Serb authorities are apparently well-informed about the refugees in Montenegro, Raznjatovic said, as the movement orders were correctly addressed to each refugee. The head of the Montenegro Refugee Commission, Djordje Scepanovic, denied any collaboration with Bosnian Serb authorities. "The forced call-up of refugees by the country they fled from is forbidden by the Geneva Convention on refugees," Scepanovic told AFP. The Bosnian Serb forces have often called on the refugees to enlist, but "on a voluntary basis, not by call-up orders and warnings," he said. The movement orders call on the refugees to serve in Herzegovina, in southeast Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the Bosnian Serb army is fighting to take control of Olovo, a strategic site north of Sarajevo on the route to Tuzla [geographical information as received].
