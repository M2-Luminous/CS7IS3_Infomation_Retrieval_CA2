Human Rights Commission condemning the violation of human and civic rights in China." During Wednesday's vote in Geneva on the Chinese motion to give up voting on the resolution demanding that human rights be observed in China, the polish delegate abstained. "We demand a decisive change in the Foreign Ministry's stand on that issue as well as a policy that would prevent similarly discrediting actions from taking place in the future," a statement issued by the KLD said.
