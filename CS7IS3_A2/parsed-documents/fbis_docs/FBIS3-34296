Prime Minister Rabin, Chief of Staff Baraq, and other senior officers are to take part. Chief of Staff Baraq says reports of divisions between the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the Foreign Ministry over security agreements with the Palestinians are exaggerated. All of us share a common goal to achieve the best security arrangements possible, he said in Tel Aviv last night. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 4 February adds: "Chief of Staff Baraq said yesterday that in the recent discussions with the PLO, very promising working papers have been formalized. The IDF examines every draft and makes its comments because it will have to execute the agreement in the field."] Commenting on the gun battle between an Army undercover unit and Fatah members in Rafah yesterday in which one Fatah gunman was killed and two soldiers wounded, General Baraq said the IDF will continue to pursue anyone still engaging in armed attacks. The chief of staff, who was attending the annual dinner for wounded veterans of the IDF Engineering Corps, spoke with our reporter Alan Ben-'Ami: [Begin recording] [Ben-'Ami] There is an impression now that there is a conflict or an argument between the IDF, the Army, yourself, and the diplomats with regard to security arrangements and the agreement with the Palestinians. [Baraq] No, no; we do not have.... [pauses] Our negotiations are not with the Foreign Ministry or the minister of foreign affairs, but Israel is running negotiations with the Palestinians. We have, naturally, different perspectives, but a common cause and goal to achieve an agreement with the Palestinians where the security interests -- especially the personal security of Israeli settlers in the Gaza and Jericho area -- will be fully secured. We are responsible for it. These are arrangements that have to do with the security of the individual settler in Gaza and Jericho, and we feel fully committed to make whatever should be done in order to secure that. [Ben-'Ami] Does it look as if it is going to take a lot more discussion yet to reach the arrangement? [Baraq] No. It is quite natural that we are clarifying the details with our Foreign Ministry officials, but if it should take another two or three weeks, so let it be. [Ben-'Ami] General Baraq, has there been any change in the IDF policy toward Fatah members? There have been a number of gunfights, a number of arrests of Fatah people by the IDF? [Baraq] We do not discriminate them along the lines of organizational behavior, but along the lines of their personal behavior. Those who are taking part in active violence, even after the 13th of September, the agreements, we keep pursuing them. But, we are not dealing with those who let their arms down and are not participating in active violence, and were not participating in the past in murders. [Ben-'Ami] With regard to the violence, a number of young children have been killed in recent days on the streets in the Gaza -- an 11-year-old, a 13-year-old -- in shooting incidents with the Army. [Baraq] We are making whatever we can in order to reduce the fatalities among civilians, especially among children. Unfortunately, the sources of violence are in the behavior of the Palestinian population. We hope that they will be able to control the going out and activity on the street of the youngsters.
