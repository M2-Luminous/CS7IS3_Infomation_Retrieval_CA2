Sometimes conditions demand that certain questions remain unanswered but, unfortunately, Azerbaijan's public, which is used to viewing all questions from the point of view of relations between the rulers and the opposition views silence itself from the same point of view... We said above that sometimes conditions demand that some questions remain unanswered. Why? First, because a word written or an idea addressed to a wide audience creates a definite opinion and a certain behavior as a consequence of this. On one hand, the situation in the world is now such that to boast of strength is inappropriate, and advertisement or publicity of such efforts can only harm Azerbaijan; for more than five years the Armenians have attacked, taken new territories, driven hundreds of thousands of people from their lands and homes and made them refugees, and during these same five years the Armenians have turned to the world and said: "Help us, they are destroying us!" There is no need to transfer some positive qualities special to our nation (faithfulness, pride, etc.) to politics because the behavioral rules of politics are different... They say that the triangle is the most perfect, strongest figure. It is certain that politics resting on three points will also be strong and that from this point of view one must also view politics from its three points and determine if its "strength coefficient" is adequate. If one of these points is the ruling group, then the other two are the opposition and the public. Let us begin with the public... 1. What Does The Public Say? In order to get an idea of this it is sufficient to examine the results of a poll conducted in the last months of 1993. Eighty-three percent of those queried demanded that no status be given the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, and 12.4 percent mentioned the possibility of being satisfied with cultural autonomy. In resolving the problem, 35.2 percent preferred a military solution, 47.6 percent a military-political solution, and just 11.2 percent saw the way out through talks. It is natural that public opinion is not stable and that these numbers could change by going up or down. But the result is in front of our eyes: the feeling of no reconciliation is strong among our people and this feeling can be further strengthened through military operations. The ruling circles must take this factor into consideration in their policy. 2. The Opposition Is Not Impeded... We are not going to engage in classifying the opposition in Azerbaijan, but a cursory view of the political forces in Azerbaijan brings out an interesting detail: there is a lack of proportion between relations to the opposition forces and their "security coefficient." Essentially, traditional forces or, more correctly, forces which the ruling circle considers to be in opposition to them, do not make up the opposition of today. Leaders of opposition political forces have often said that they have organized their activities within the framework of the constitution and democratic principles, and have stated that they are taking Azerbaijan's military-political situation into consideration. The opposition today is only engaged in healthy criticism; as for the ruling circles, they must make the effort to make use of this criticism. The opposition cannot not accept a shortcoming of its own: a policy advanced on questions of war (in general, policy) must not be based on "temporary advances" but must advance a future-based policy by turning these into long-term, durable results. 3. Finally, The Government... It is impossible to advance a policy on wartime issues without clarifying the Armenian military-political doctrine (with regard to Azerbaijan). What goals are the Armenians keeping to in enlarging and widening its geography? One: The Armenian side understands well that talks will only be profitable and useful for their side by controlling an ever larger territory and they are expanding the geography of the conflict with this goal; they are trying to expand not only outside the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh, but of Karabakh as a whole, and, by this, gain "territories which could be compromised" in future talks; they also wish to build a security zone around Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan must not forget this side of the issue and try to guarantee a "useful geography" for the talks. Second: It is clear to everyone that Armenia is not only engaged in its own goals but also in realizing Russia's geopolitical plans. At one time many doubted that the Armenians would advance in the direction of Azerbaijan's southern borders and used the Iran factor as an argument. But the recent development of events has shown that the Armenians did advance toward the southern borders and met with no opposition. In our opinion, there is a reason for this: a situation had to be created wherein Azerbaijan stood before a dilemma. This dilemma consisted of to whom to give "control" over the southern borders: "Armenia" or Russia? From this point of view, although our military efforts have not been contradicted by definite "advances" in our relations with Russia, it is difficult to speak of real results. Azerbaijan was forced to define its own "security space." It became a member of the CIS. And perhaps it is a result of this that Azerbaijan's name (or the Transcaucasus, since Georgia is also a member of the CIS) is not mentioned in the talks between two superstates -- the talks are more about regions that have remained outside of "security zones" such as the Baltic and Eastern Europe. We have selected our own destiny...Now one road remains: making use of contradictions within the CIS and, with this objective, broadening some bilateral relations. Third. It was claimed at one time in Armenian propaganda that the Armenian community in our republic did not have the guarantees to "survive" in a totalitarian Azerbaijani state. Thus, the fact that Azerbaijan's name was listed among countries where freedom of speech was limited, human rights, etc., were violated could pose an obstacle to Azerbaijan's war policy. Unity between the ruling party and the opposition on the war issue has exceptional importance, and it is even necessary to proclaim and advertise this unity. Thus, it should refrain from accusations against the opposition: it could be that an irreconcilable relationship against opposition forces gives a certain effect domestically (even if this were the case, it would be impossible to attain longterm stability in this way), but from outside, from abroad, a polarized Azerbaijan as a political union lacks esteem; on the contrary, our "near abroad" can use this kind of polarization skillfully.
