Smirnova: "The Law in Camouflage Fatigues"] [Text] A naive people, until recently we consoled ourselves: This is it; we have exhausted, through our grandmothers and grandfathers, mothers and fathers, a full measure of wars and revolutions, night searches and cattle boxcars. We played hide-and-seek with ourselves: A generation without wars, we will certainly sail into a quiet old age, will tend to our grandchildren and contemplate eternity. Alas, one cannot sidle into history! The mayoralty was seized the second time. After correcting the minor flaps that had occurred during the first try. So you did not like the timing? You say: Why was the raid organized on a weekend; the people were not warned; and why did you stomp the floor, brandishing submachine guns? Our apologies--we all learn from our mistakes. Would Wednesday, in the middle of the week, be better for you? At 1800, after work? We can dispense with the submachine guns, too--are there any volunteers to go against the trained OMON [Special Purpose Militia Detachments] guys and their truncheons? Regarding the warning--that you also had! As early as on Monday, authorized comrades had been trying to break through into the mayoralty with the order to replace the authorities. And by Wednesday the kray leadership paid a visit to the "Gray House," with the mission of dethroning Mayor V.I. Cherepkov and his first deputy, the city administrator V.A. Gilgenberg. The action was carried out by kray governor's deputies I.P. Lebedinets and A.V. Gartman, as well as kray administration department chiefs A.I. Yegorov, V.F. Terekhov, and K.B. Tolstoshein. A decree by acting head of kray administration I.P. Lebedinets was read out, relieving from his duties V.I. Cherepkov and appointing K.B. Tolstoshein as acting head of the city administration. In short, the protocol was observed--according to eyewitnesses inside the building. As to eyewitnesses outside of it, they did not get to see much. OMON soldiers were behind the glass door, blocking it. The clank of that same door, letting out--in batches--mayoralty personnel. There were smiles on the faces of some ladies: Finally, real masters have arrived! Reinforcements arrived--an additional OMON group in camouflage fatigues. "I managed to slip into the building several minutes before the raid: I had been warned on the impending action," says P.M. Dovganyuk, a former kray soviet deputy, and a candidate for the kray duma deputy. I was in V.I. Cherepkov's waiting room. Heard stomping feet and noise downstairs. Someone in the waiting room ran to close the door. I interfered--it did not make sense to close the door, it would be smashed into pieces anyway. They agreed with me. At that very moment OMON charged in. The storm troopers were being directed by a man in civilian clothes. He introduced himself as Ivanov.... City administrator Vladimir Gilgenberg behaved with great dignity...." The closing scene of the city administrator's "dignified" appearance before the crowd milling in front of the building soon materialized. The door opened with a clank and Gilgenberg was thrown out, landing at the crowd's feet. "As of today, in keeping with the directive, I was the acting mayor, because Viktor Ivanovich is sick," Vladimir Gilgenberg began his street interview to the surrounding journalists. "As usual, we were busy with work on that day. Adopted an additional decision on procedures for use of public transportation--free for city residents. Were putting the final touches on financing with respect to sanitation cleanup of the city. There were numerous financial documents, directives, important papers on my desk. And suddenly--the raid; my office is broken into, door kicked off hinges, and a rude "hassle" begins.... They dragged me out of the building head down.... Among the things left in my office were documents, my passport, personal effects, 400,000 rubles issued to me for the election campaign as a candidate for kray duma deputy, plus an advance I had received...." Dusk was enveloping the city. Temperatures dropped to freezing. Many of those gathered at the mayoralty steps were stomping their feet, made short jogs to keep themselves warm--the cold was getting to people through spring-season short coats and jackets. Many were hatless but were afraid to leave. Against the background of the darkened building, the tenth floor was brightly lit. In his office, Mayor V.I. Cherepkov was bedridden, hooked to an IV. His wife was keeping watch at his bedside. The full "illumination" in Gilgenberg's office was easy to explain: A search was still under way there. The eyes of the people on the street were glued to this strip of light at the top. Cars with special license plates were lurking here and there around the building. An ambulance with the "03" telephone number on the hood. Minivans with tinted windows--"Black Nellies," picket members suspected. In those moments, many felt themselves lost, helpless, and.... unneeded. What do you do--shout in the middle of the night, in the center of the city getting ready to turn in for the night? Demand somebody or something? Deputy mayors, heads of rayon administrations were here; together with everyone else, shivering in the wind, these people stood outside their office building--now unemployed. They had been dismissed from jobs without any explanations, practically across the board--new bureaucrats, or to be precise, bureaucrats who had formerly held these jobs--already had been appointed. The circle had closed; the system had regenerated itself, rejecting a "foreign body...." Someone in the crowd kept repeating in amazement: "But why Tolstoshein? He had nearly the lowest rating during the mayoral elections--the people rejected him.... How can he, without blinking an eye, take the place of a person still there!" But nobody listened to these questions anymore--they were academic. "What do you intend to do now?" the indefatigable ones kept pressing Gilgenberg. "How will events develop, anyway?" "I remain a deputy to the kray duma. I will be meeting with my constituents. If necessary, right on the street. Let people see what can be done to the law here...." Cherepkov was carried out from the building at past 0100. "OMON soldiers were carrying the mayor feet first," said T.G. Romanenko, a candidate for kray duma deputy who kept vigil in the building until almost 0300. "There were so many people in camouflage uniforms that you could not see Cherepkov himself--only an occasional glimpse of sock-clad feet...." This is how the incident in the mayoralty was carried out. Promptly and successfully. In the morning, numerous documents were read on the radio, explaining that since the mayor was suspected of committing a grave criminal offense (bribes), he had been temporarily--until the investigation was completed--removed from duty. The "temporary" nature of the act of deposing the mayor elected by the people was emphasized in the official comments many times. Each step in the seizure of the mayoralty was dressed in argumentation. Everything apparently exudes legitimacy and only legitimacy. Nevertheless, it was all too thin. "Temporarily" put on the sidelines? Then why an equally rash destruction of the entire administrative structure created under Cherepkov? Such a hasty dismissal of personnel? Have they also been identified wholesale as criminals, or at least suspects? Cherepkov had not been able for months to get rid of obvious saboteurs--his deputies and rayon heads--because of all sorts of procedural red tape. Here, however, several minutes were enough--exactly as long as it takes to read out the personnel "sentence." And also, there is this disturbing bravura march, the coronation speech on the occasion of the mew mayor assuming his duties. It was as if a magic tablecloth had been spread before the stunned city residents--transportation, dacha, merchandise, social and charitable goodies.... Which horn of abundance did it all come from? In what warehouses had it all been hidden from the city residents, exhausted by adversity? What billions and millions are behind it? If only this could all be true. Except that somehow one feels sad at this promised feast....
