Tikhova; UDC 621.373.826] [Abstract] One of the main conclusions of published discussions of optical reconstruction of holograms is that it is impossible to achieve correspondence between the lengthwise and crosswise scales of transformation of the field. This fact is a serious obstacle in analyzing antennas' directional patterns with optical information processing equipment to reconstruct microwave holograms. The optical reconstruction of microwave holograms in the absence of constraints on coaxiality of the optical transparent and image has been considered in a mathematical analysis. The radiation spectrum has been calculated as a function of the reference wave's angle of incidence, and the possibility of undistorted modeling of the directional pattern of a microwave antenna based on its hologram in the Fresnel region zone has been indicated for the one-dimensional case. An analogous consideration of a two-dimensional hologram confirmed the violation of the equality of the scales of transformation in the plane of the image and, accordingly, in spectral frequencies. Scale correspondence may be achieved only in a single cross section of the directional pattern, which must be taken into consideration when measurements are taken. Tables 6 (Russian).
