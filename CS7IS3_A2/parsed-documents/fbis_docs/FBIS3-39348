But it speaks volumes for the manner in which Mr Clinton chooses to conduct American foreign policy and the sorry consequences it has had for the Anglo-American relationship. The president was advised by his secretary of state, his attorney general, his ambassador in London, his consulate in Belfast and even by the director of the FBI that there should be no visa for a man who talks peace but practices terror. Mr Clinton chose to overrule them on the pretext that Mr Adams' visit would help the peace process (though quite how it was to be furthered by allowing the greatest obstacle to peace to grandstand, largely unchallenged, for 48 hours on America's airwaves was never explained). This was a shamefaced deceit: the president already knew from his own intelligence reports that Mr Adams has no intention of signing up to the Anglo-Irish peace accord. But Mr Clinton had the Irish-American lobby to assuage. Some 40 members of Congress, including two of its most powerful senators from the Irish lobby, Edward Kennedy and Patrick Moynihan, wanted Mr Adams in and Mr Clinton needs their votes for his current political priority, his controversial healthcare reforms (Mr Moynihan has been a critic of the reforms and, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is in a key position to thwart them). So, for the sake of domestic political advantage, the president opened the gate. Presidential aides even coached Mr Adams on the weasel words of peace he should mouth to give the president cover for his shameful decision. The fact that it meant slighting America's closest ally and plunging the special relationship into its worst crisis since Suez counted for nought. The harsh fact for Britain is that in Mr Clinton's Washington that relationship does indeed increasingly count for nothing. This is an administration which, when it thinks of foreign policy (and that it does rarely), thinks of Asia. It does so because its foreign policy objectives are almost entirely conditioned by its domestic agenda. Candidate Clinton summed up his domestic priority with these watchwords: "The economy, stupid." Today, Japan is the yardstick by which America judges its economic success. The central thrust of Mr Clinton's international economic policy is at the heart of his foreign policy. He wants to open up the burgeoning markets of the Pacific Rim, particularly Japan, to American products, services and investment. Foreign policy is as much about job creation for Mr Clinton as it is about diplomacy. He thinks a lot about the economic opportunities for America in Japan, China, South Korea and Vietnam; he thinks very little about Europe -- and almost not at all about Britain. This is bad news for Europe because so many of the foreign policy challenges it faces, such as Bosnia and Russia, cry out for the leadership of an involved, confident American president. But Mr Clinton is not interested. It is particularly bad news for Britain. As the European country closest to the United States we have the most to lose from American disengagement. It is a plight made all the worse by personal rancour between Downing Street and the White House. It still rankles with Mr Clinton that Conservative Central Office worked with the Bush campaign during the 1992 election; and there is no forgiveness from the president or some of his closest advisers that the Home Office, at the behest of the Bush campaign, searched its files for the time Mr Clinton was at Oxford to see if there was anything juicy (there wasn't). "Bill Clinton does not have a great fondness for John Major," a senior presidential aide told THE SUNDAY TIMES this week, with evident understatement. A White House foreign policy adviser was more blunt: "Clinton hates Major." It was perhaps inevitable that there would be some cooling of the special relationship after Margaret Thatcher, who was a towering world figure and enjoyed especially close relations with Ronald Reagan and George Bush. It is inconceivable, for example, that Mr Adams would have won his visa during the Thatcher years. "The departure of Thatcher means that Britain is less on the American mind these days," says one senior White House official. "She was consulted on almost everything. Clinton does not really care what Major thinks, and never thinks of asking him. Major had to struggle to get a 10-minute bilateral meeting with the president at the NATO summit." The White House is also well aware that Mr Major is a prime minister in deep domestic trouble, which only adds to his lack of clout in Washington. Mr Major's particular problems in Washington, however, only give personal edge to greater forces that are pulling Mr Clinton's America away from Europe. It is, perhaps, inevitable that any American president, with the end of the cold war, would want to look east, where economic growth is often in double digits and growing affluence has created a gigantic market of several billion new consumers, rather than a sclerotic Europe, self-absorbed with its own problems, such as Maastricht and the European exchange-rate mechanism (unintelligible to most Enropeans, never mind Americans), and wallowing in a recession which has only reinforced the American view that, on the brink of the new information age, Europe is in the dark ages. Of course, long-standing transatlantic ties cannot be undone overnight. America and Europe are not about to cast each other adrift. The Anglo-American relationship may be less than special these days, but both countries remain bound by cultural, economic, intelligence and nuclear ties; and events could easily reverse Mr Clinton's eastward-looking strategy. There is at least an even chance within the next few years of a more authoritarian regime in Moscow, which would make the security of East Europe less secure; and there is the probability of serious strife between Russia and the Ukraine. Either would force Washington to look to Europe once more as the frontline of its national security, and breathe new life into the Atlantic alliance. In the meantime, Britain's politicians would be best employed giving some thought to where exactly this country's future lies, in a world in which the special relationship has diminished, but close relations with a Maastricht-style Europe are still suspect.
