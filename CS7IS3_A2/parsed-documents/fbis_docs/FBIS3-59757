Overview The important S&T-related measures of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) are 1) promoting pioneering R&D in the field of telecommunications; 2) "Telecommunications Frontier R&D," which promotes R&D of basic, advanced technologies in the field of telecommunications; 3) space communications technology R&D; 4) global environmental measurement technology R&D; and 5) radio-wave utilization technology R&D. 1) ¥193.00 million were newly approved this fiscal year for "pioneering R&D in the field of telecommunications" because the active promotion of R&D in telecommunications, a field in which technology is highly advanced, is essential in order to have an advanced information society in the 21st century. 2) ¥802.00 million are appropriated in this year's budget for "Telecommunications Frontier R&D," which involves basic, leading-edge R&D projects that will contribute to advancements in telecommunications. 3) ¥1.265 billion are appropriated in this year's budget for advanced satellite communications R&D, etc., the purpose of which is to establish Japan's future independent technology base in space development. 4) ¥378 million are appropriated for the R&D of technologies aimed at global-scale environmental conservation, e.g., remote sensing technology in which electromagnetic waves are used for environmental observations, and for surveys of developments relating to radio-wave utilization and information communications for global environmental conservation. 5) ¥94.00 million are appropriated in the FY93 budget for several R&D efforts to develop frequency bands not yet used and redevelop frequency bands that are already used, and the R&D of stratospheric radio relay systems. The R&D expenses of the Communications Research Laboratory account for most of the MPT's S&T general account budget. As the only national laboratory that handles information and communications, the Communications Research Laboratory does wide-ranging research, from basic to applied, that covers the fields of information, communications, and radio. The MPT set up a Kansai branch in May 1989 as a base for carrying out basic and advanced R&D centering on Telecommunications Frontier R&D, set up new government research offices, and outfitted a full-scale research system there that was completed in August 1991. The MPT's S&T general account budget is ¥7.882 billion, in which ¥7.298 billion are for the Communications Research Laboratory (see Table 1). As for special-accounts-related funds, money from the Industrial Investments Special Account will go toward new investments in communications and broadcasting facilities during FY93, and will provide the necessary funds for maintaining special R&D base facilities. And, as a measure for activating public-sector R&D activities, the MPT will promote financing and investment enterprises of the Japan Key Technology Center. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- B. Promotion of Pioneering R&D in the Field of Telecommunications R&D of Advanced 3-D Image Information Communication Technology The active promotion of R&D in the high-tech field of telecommunications is essential in order to have an advanced information society in the 21st century. However, it is a high-risk, high-burden field where it is difficult for the private sector to develop technology on its own. Therefore the government must actively promote pioneering R&D that bridges the gap between basic research and applications. To that end, since FY92 the MPT has been marshalling the technological strength and talent of industry, government, and universities to carry out R&D on technology for sophisticated 3-D-image information communications using holographic technology. The MPT will continue that effort during FY93 as well. C. Telecommunications Frontier R&D In order to establish the technology base to support an advanced information society in the 21st century, since FY88 the MPT in cooperation with industry, other government organizations, and universities has been carrying out "Telecommunications Frontier R&D," which is basic and pioneering R&D in the field of telecommunications . In FY93 the MPT will continue R&D efforts from FY92 on seven topics in three fields and will add one new topic. The MPT will also expand its selection of public-subscription research, which is broad and general research themes that the ministry offers for public subscription. In addition to setting up places for research exchange with the researchers of the world, the ministry will also promote international joint research by extending invitations to foreign researchers. The following is a summary of the individual R&D themes. 1. Super-High-Speed Communications Technology (1) R&D of Super-High-Speed, High-Performance Communications Technology Based on High-Temperature Superconductors The MPT systematically carries out basic research and development relating to various uses of the superconductivity effect in telecommunications. This effort involves the R&D of super-high-sensitivity reception technology based on superconducting elements, high-efficiency superconducting antennas, and technology to counter superconductivity EMI (electromagnetic interference). (2) R&D of Unexplored Electromagnetic-Wave Technology This involves the R&D of vacuum ultraviolet coherent light source technology, technology for generating squeezed light, electromagnetic wave technology based on semiconductor carriers (far-infrared laser light), and ultra-short-pulse, high-output light sources. 2. Bio-Intelligent Communications Technology (1) R&D of Super-Efficient Encoding Technology Based on Sensory Organ Models The objective of this R&D is to efficiently compress and reduce the increasingly larger amounts of information handled in telecommunications. This effort involves the development of information processing methods that model the excellent sensory mechanisms of humans (the feature extraction functions of vision, etc.), and the R&D of technology to encode sensory information, such as voice and image information. (2) R&D of Meta-Intelligent Functions for Next-Generation Communications This research involves modelling on a computer the high-level intelligent activities of humans, and building a voice-recognition/response system with advanced functions for inference, learning, association, conceptualization, etc. (3) R&D in Connection with Biofunctions This is to develop technology for making non-destructive measurements of the functions with which living organisms respond to biochemical stimuli and receive, transmit, and process information. The objectives of this effort are to elucidate the physical and chemical characteristics of the macromolecules, cells, cell membranes, and other such components of living organisms, and to elucidate the organic information system mechanisms of living organisms. (4) R&D of Molecular Element Technology for Advanced Information Communications (New) This is to research and develop basic technologies such as molecule manipulation technology, molecule assembly technology, and technology for evaluating those characteristics. The objectives of this effort are the development of advanced information communications elements that are a breakaway from conventional semiconductors, and the realization of functional, high-density, high-efficiency molecular elements whose base materials are biomolecules and organic molecules. 3. Highly-Functional Network Technology (1) R&D of Basic Technology for Super-Multiply-Changeable Networks This is the R&D of basic technologies for functionally optimizable changeable networks that have multiple information sources, i.e, the R&D of control technology for sophisticated integrated networks that integrate both cabled and wireless connections, and advanced communications processing technology in wide-area networks. (2) R&D of Network-Human Interfaces This is basic research to realize intelligent interfaces, with which networks can comprehend intentionally ambiguous human expressions, so that the advanced functions of next-generation communications networks will be easy to use. 4. Telecommunications Frontier Research Public Subscription The purposes of this effort are to supplement and perfect basic and pioneering R&D, to foster creative research by young and talented researchers, and to improve regional R&D capabilities. D. Major FY93 Research Efforts at the Communications Research Laboratory 1. R&D of Advanced Satellite Communications and Broadcast Technology This is the R&D of advanced migrator satellite communications technology that uses the Ka band and millimeter-wave band, and advanced satellite broadcast technology that uses the Ka band (21 GHz) in the communications satellites that will be launched by an H-II rocket in FY96 (COMETS). During FY93, the MPT will continue the development of repeaters that will be mounted on satellites, and will begin the development of on-ground experimental facilities. 2. Research on a Next-Generation Communications-Broadcast R&D Satellite Aiming for the realization of early-21st-century migrator digital voice broadcasts, high-volume inter-satellite communications, etc., the MPT is carrying out the necessary research for launching the next-generation communications-broadcast R&D satellite (COMETS) in FY99. The satellite will be loaded with high-output repeaters; a large, 10-meter, expansive antenna; and inter-satellite communications technology that uses millimeter waves and light. 3. R&D of Aviation and Maritime Satellite Technology This is the R&D of aviation and maritime communications technology that uses satellites, the objectives of which are to guarantee communications with ships and aircraft, and to establish systems that can handle on-land mobile communications. During FY93 MPT researchers will continue migrator satellite communications experiments using a type-V engineering test satellite (ETS-V). Then, based on the results of those experiments, they will develop ultra-small portable earth stations and equipment for circuit control experiments. 4. R&D of Inter-Satellite Communications Technology The expansion in space activities brings with it the need for new inter-satellite communication technology and technology for building large-scale antennas in space. For that reason, the MPT has developed equipment (repeaters and multi-beam antennas) for experimenting with S-band (2-GHz band), millimeter-wave and optical inter-satellite communications. That equipment will be mounted on a type-VI engineering test satellite (ETS-VI) that is scheduled for launch in FY94. During FY93 the MPT will be engaged in coordination and support tasks involving the satellite equipment developed thus far. In connection with the Space Station Program, which is an international joint project, the MPT will continue research on large antenna assembly technology. 5. R&D of High-Accuracy Time and Space Measurement Technology Using Cosmic Radio-Wave Emissions This is to develop "accurate space and time measurement technology" suitable for the age of manned space activities. The technology will be a fusion and evolution of the space measurement technology represented by very-long-based interferometry (VLBI), and time measurement technology represented by atomic clocks and precise time comparisons. To that end, during FY93 the MPT will continue VLBI experiments for observing plate movement around Japan and observing fluctuations in the earth's rotation, along with the R&D of space VLBI. 6. Research Involving Communications Satellite Experiments Although it is an era when communications satellites are actually being put into practical use, considerable technological development is needed in order for small- and medium-scale users to create advanced information networks that exploit the features of communications satellites and then to be able to directly access satellites on their own and thereby utilize their networks. For that reason, as a satellite communications advanced usage pilot project, the MPT will use a part of the CS-3 to conduct operational experiments on networks in a form that is close to actual use. 7. R&D of Space Weather Forecasting Systems Geared toward the age ahead of rapidly evolving space communications and manned space activities, this is research for the purpose of forecasting the main causes of danger in the space environment, such as cosmic radiation that affects humans and space equipment, and making practical space weather forecasting systems so that such dangers can be avoided. During FY93, the MPT will continue to maintain equipment for automatic transmission of remote data and equipment for solar magnetism observations, and carry out the basic development of space observation equipment for use on-board satellites. 8. Research on Communications Technology Based on Small Satellites Small, light-weight satellites are advantageous in that communications and observation systems using multiple satellites are easy to configure because small satellites are inexpensive and can be realized in a short period of time. In addition, such satellites can be used for demonstrating satellite-mounted equipment and technology in space. The MPT will develop communications technology that is suitable for these small satellites, such as store-and-transmit technology, inter-satellite data exchange technology, etc., and will work to establish the basic technologies for building communications systems and observation systems that use small satellites. To that end, during FY93 the MPT will develop a store-and-transmit communications device EM and inter-satellite radar. 9. Augmenting Related Observations During the Term of the STEP Program Elucidating from a global viewpoint the processes of solar energy transport that change the earth, oceans, and atmosphere is essential in order to accurately grasp global environmental changes. In combination with the Solar-Terrestrial Energy International Joint Research Program (STEP) that runs from 1990 to 1995, the MPT will carry out supplemental observations using the facilities of the Communications Research Laboratory to study planetary atmospheres, solar wind, the ionosphere and magnetosphere, etc., and through that research make an international contribution. 10. Research on Space Communications in Distributed Satellite Systems Highly reliable space communications systems will be realized by the development of technology for distributing several small to mid-sized satellites in close orbits and making them operate together in linked fashion as a group. To that end, the MPT will conduct research on technology for high-precision control of satellite orbits and technology for dynamic communications circuit control. During FY93 the MPT will develop and test a relative satellite tracking device of an orbit control system. 11. Research on Two-Frequency Doppler Radar for Observing Rainfall from Space The purpose of the rainfall radar that will be carried on the TRMM (tropical rainfall observation satellite), the polar orbiting platform, and the space station, is global-scale observation of rainfall distribution, which significantly affects the global environment. The MPT will trial produce rainfall radar and will mount that radar on aircraft for in-flight experiments, the purposes of which are to investigate the basic technologies needed for the development of rainfall radar and to study ways to gather and process the data. During FY93 the MPT will produce the reception part of the rainfall radar that will be carried on aircraft and will trial produce and test the data processing section of the rainfall radar that will be carried on the TRMM. 12. R&D of Global Environmental Measurement Technology Based on Sensors That are Active in Certain Optical Regions The MPT will develop active sensors that utilize light suitable for accurate global monitoring of the troposphere, which accounts for most of the earth's atmosphere. In particular, the MPT will develop laser radar for use on-board future satellites. During FY93 the MPT will research and develop methods of pumping solid-state lasers with semiconductor lasers that will lead to longer-life and higher-efficiency solid-state lasers. 13. Research on Global Environmental Measurement Technology Using Short-Wavelength Millimeter-Band Electromagnetic Waves In global environmental problems, the importance of stratospheric ozone layer formation and extinction, and trace amounts of gaseous components such as chlorine compounds and nitrogen oxides, which effect the condition of thermodynamic stability in the upper layers of the atmosphere, are cited. The MPT will research and develop millimeter and sub-millimeter wave spectroscopic reception technology that is helpful in observing trace amounts of those gaseous components. During FY93 the MPT will continue working on the production of 200-GHz-band and 270-GHz-band radio-wave meters, which started in FY92, and will develop small, light-weight spectrometers for those frequency bands. 14. R&D in Connection With Constructing Global Environmental Measurement Information Networks The MPT will carry out R&D in connection with a global environmental measurement and information network for collecting global environmental data from observation points scattered over broad areas and converting that data into databases. Through that network, environmental researchers will be able to use the global environmental data and information obtained by research and government organizations within and outside of Japan. To that end, since FY91 the MPT has been researching and developing technology for retrieving global environmental data and information, and technology for interconnecting different kinds of networks. 15. International Joint Research on Advanced Electromagnetic Wave Utilization Technology for the Global Environment In a joint effort with the University of Alaska in the U.S., the MPT will develop equipment for measuring the mid-level atmosphere, and, joining in with the U.S.'s high-output radio-wave emissions facilities and other such observation and experimental facilities in Alaska, the MPT will conduct comprehensive observational research of the polar mid-level atmosphere to elucidate the mechanisms of global environmental fluctuations. In FY93 the MPT will develop an imaging rheometer to measure horizontal electron density distribution, a Rayleigh Doppler rider for air temperature and wind measurements, and a wide-area milliwave radiometer to measure trace amounts of ozone gas in the atmosphere. 16. Research on Global Environmental Measurement Technology Based on High-Resolution 3-D Microwave Imaging Radar The MPT will develop high-resolution 3-D microwave imaging radar that will be carried on aircraft and technology for related experiments, data processing, and analysis, the purposes of which are to deal with environmental damage and natural disasters in a quick and mobile manner and to effectively predict environmental changes resulting from that damage. Unlike conventional composite-aperture radar from which only flat images can be obtained, clear 3-D images can be obtained with this system by using the strength of scattering between two antennas and multiple polarized waves, and polarimeter functions that accurately measure changes in scattering phase. In FY93 the MPT will develop the main compound polarized-wave antenna. 17. Development of Frequency Resources (1) Research on 40-GHz and Higher Radio-Wave Propagation This frequency band is characterized by the facts that systems utilizing it can be made smaller and lighter, and that it enables wide-band, high-density, multi-channel communications. In addition, this frequency band has applications in remote sensing. The basic atmospheric propagation characteristics that take into account attenuation due to atmospheric particles (rain, fog, snow, etc.) and the scattering due to objects must be adequately grasped. To that end, during FY93 the MPT will continue work from FY92 to maintain a 90- to 100-GHz scattering meter, standard scatterers, and a scattering meter calibration device for the purpose of conducting scattering meter calibration experiments. (2) R&D of Optical-Region Frequency Bands For the purpose of utilizing the optical regions in which huge amounts of information can be transmitted with one beam, this effort involves elucidating the characteristics that electromagnetic waves have in optical regions, and the R&D of optical communications using spatially propagated signals that do not degrade under poor atmospheric conditions, such as fog. During FY93 the MPT will maintain the receiving sections that will be used in model communications experiments and begin the trial production of an antenna for both optical and radio-wave use. (3) R&D of Technology for Intelligent and Effective Utilization of Radio Waves In order to cope with the increasing demand for on-land mobile wireless communications and the diversification of transmitted information, since FY85 the MPT has been involved in R&D for using the quasi-microwave-band in on-land mobile communications. During FY93 the MPT will research and develop technology for intelligent and effective utilization of radio waves that is based on the research results obtained thus far. The technology involves dynamically changing system configurations in correspondence with the usage of frequencies in the quasi-microwave band in order to use radio waves as effectively as possible. (4) R&D of Millimeter-Wave Private Communications Technology Concomitant with the development of an advanced information society in recent years, the demands for high-speed, high-volume wireless transmission and private transmission are rapidly expanding. To deal with that, MPT's efforts during FY93 involve the maintenance of a system for experimenting with millimeter-wave radio-wave propagation, fading-related R&D, and trial producing a flat millimeter-wave antenna. (5) R&D of Mobile Microwave-Band Communications Technology (New) To cope with the tightness of frequencies concomitant with the increased demand for mobile communications and the introduction of sophisticated services in recent years, the MPT will research and develop the technologies needed for realizing microwave-band (3-10 GHz) mobile communications systems. During FY93 the MPT will maintain devices for measuring microwave-band reception electric field strength characteristics and multipath propagation characteristics. (6) R&D of Technology for Effective Utilization of Broadcast Frequencies (New) To cope with the tightness of ground-based broadcast frequencies, the MPT will carry out R&D relating to the basic technologies for effective utilization of broadcast frequencies: basic technologies relating to the introduction of digital technology in broadcasting systems, i.e., achieving narrower bandwidths by means of efficient compression, achieving faster transmission by efficient modulation, reducing ghost and noise trouble, and reducing the electric power needed for transmission. Efforts during FY93 include the investigation of information compression technology using encoding methods that are suited to broadcasting, and the R&D of technology for efficient compression and encoding of high-detail moving images that is also applicable to transmission routes where problems such as ghost signals are severe. (7) R&D of Millimeter- and Submillimeter-Wave-Band Device Technology (New) To cope with increasingly greater radio-wave demand from now on, the MPT will comprehensively and systematically research and develop functional device technology that will become the key technology in realizing systems in the as yet unused 70-GHz and higher millimeter- and submillimeter-wave bands. During FY93 the MPT will prepare basic film-forming devices (sputter devices), etc., and will conduct research on basic thin-film formation techniques, etc. 18. R&D of Stratospheric Radio Repeater Systems If unmanned aircraft can be floated in the stratosphere at altitudes of about 20 km, where the currents in the upper atmosphere are relatively stable, and used as radio repeater bases, they would cover broad areas of about 300 km in diameter. More so than in the case of satellites, that would also enable mobile communications using simple terminals. Aiming for the development of such stratospheric radio repeater systems, the MPT has been developing radio repeaters, antenna systems, and radio control systems, and will conduct R&D in connection with electromagnetic environmental measures. During FY93 the MPT will maintain the receiving sections of a microwave power transmission experiment system and will equip the data storage section of an electromagnetic environmental measurement device. E. Summary of FY93 Industrial Investment Special Account 1. Maintenance of R&D Base Facilities To maintain the large facilities used in the R&D of advanced telecommunications technology, large sums of money are needed in comparison with the frequency of usage, and there are difficulties in single-handedly maintaining such facilities. These kinds of facilities and equipment are maintained as "special R&D base facilities" by government support through communications and broadcasting organizations, and are provided for joint use to people engaged in R&D pertaining to telecommunications technology. During FY93 the MPT will continue to maintain advanced image communications facilities, etc., as special R&D base facilities. 2. Japan Key Technology Center Funding and Investment Enterprises Established in 1985 in accordance with the Law for Facilitating Research in Key Technologies, the Japan Key Technology Center was instituted for the purpose of supporting private-sector research in key technologies that is difficult for the private sector to promote on its own. Through the Japan Key Technology Center's loans and investments, the MPT provides support so that telecommunications R&D in the private sector will be energetically and smoothly facilitated. Table 3 shows new telecommunications R&D efforts that the MPT started as investment projects in FY91. As for financed projects, 11 efforts in the field of telecommunications were started in FY91. The contents of the research cover many branches: radio and satellite communications, transmission, image communications, networks, etc. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 3.
