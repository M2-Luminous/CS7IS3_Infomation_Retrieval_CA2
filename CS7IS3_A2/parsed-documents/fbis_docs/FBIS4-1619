At present, special precautions should be taken against the trends of soaring prices, boasting and exaggeration, and corruption, as well as against the massive flood of migrant workers. Lu said: Judging by the price increases in the first two months of this year, it will be very difficult to keep this year's price increase index below 10 percent. For this reason, it is absolutely necessary to keep down the scale of capital construction and the growth rate; we should not be impatient. Provided China can maintain an annual progressive growth rate of 9 percent, and even 7 percent in the future, its absolute economic strength will reach the world standard quickly. According to his analysis, the problem this year will focus on commodity prices. If the increase rate can be contained within a double-digit figure, there will not be big problem. It is only the peasants, the unemployed urban workers, and young people who have just joined the work force who will be hard up. Lu pointed out: There is a very serious trend of boasting and exaggeration going on. He cast doubts on the credibility of some important statistical figures. He took up a list of last year's total industrial output indices from various localities, saying that, calculated in terms of comparable prices, the township industrial enterprises in 10 provinces registered a growth rate of 60 and even 100 percent. He said: How was this possible? China has come to grief on account of boasting and exaggeration. He said: If we are not clear about our rice output last year, there will be problems when we need rice, but it is unavailable. Lu said: According to an anticorruption report by the procuratorate, some 110,000 cadres at or above the department-head level have economic or other problems. This represents a large proportion of in-service cadres at or above the department-head level in China. The public, however, does not know this proportion; There are a lot of complaints against the public security organs, procuratorial organs, and people's courts. If we fail to step up supervision over law enforcement, it will adversely affect social stability. Lu said: Now people have eventually come to realize that civilian workers play an irreplaceable positive role in economic construction and have stopped calling them "blind migrant workers." For this reason, it is necessary to guide them and ameliorate their situation. It is not good for the economy to grow either too rapidly or too slowly. If it grows too slowly, many of the capital construction projects will have to be stopped and the civilian workers will be the first to bear the brunt, which is likely to cause social instability.
