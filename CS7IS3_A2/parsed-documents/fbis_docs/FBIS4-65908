This statement was made by Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias after meeting with his Bulgarian counterpart Stanislav Daskalov, who began an official visit to our country yesterday. Mr. Papoulias said Mr. Daskalov's visit is a big step forward in Greek-Bulgarian relations and noted that Bulgarian Prime Minister Lyuben Berov will soon visit Athens, while he himself has accepted an invitation by his Buglarian counterpart to visit Sofia. One of the important problems in Greek-Bulgarian relations is the Nestos River water, and the binational committee will meet in the first half of June to discuss the issue, Mr. Papoulias said, adding the hope that progress will be made. At the meeting, which was held today at 1030 in the Foreign Ministry, the two sides also discussed bilateral cooperation on the basic highway routes of Alexandroupolis-Svilengrad and Thessaloniki-Sofia as well as the north-south Egnatia Highway. These are significant large projects for improving the infrastructure as well as a contribution to future inter-Balkan cooperation. Finally, Mr. Papoulias said concern was expressed over the war in Bosnia, where the two countries' appraisals coincide that hostilities must stop and negotiations begin immediately. Both sides feel that Greek-Bulgarian friendship constitutes a firm basis for all developments in the Balkans. Responding to a question about the Greek position on the Albanian issue and whether he raised the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue at the meeting with his Bulgarian counterpart, Mr. Papoulias said he told Mr. Daskalov that the question of respect for the Greek minority's rights is the cornerstone of any development in the Greek-Albanian relations. The Skopje issue was also discussed; both Greece and Bulgaria hope this crisis will be overcome. Mr. Papoulias will visit New York in mid-June, where he will meet with Cyrus Vance. The meeting between Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis and Vance might prepare the ground for good results in his own visit, Mr. Papoulias said. The Bulgarian foreign minister said that at the meeting they agreed on the mutual desire to develop friendly Greek-Bulgarian relations to the benefit of both countries as well as peace and stability in the Balkans. Mr. Daskalov concluded: We appreciate Greece's support for Bulgarian ties with European organizations, particularly with the European Union. We agreed to form various groups of experts who will work to solve specific problems in all sectors of bilateral cooperation.
