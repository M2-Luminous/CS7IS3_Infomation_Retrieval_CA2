In an article today, AL-THAWRAH, mouthpiece of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, expresses confidence that fulfilling the promises made by Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin would be positively and quickly reflected in various sectors of the Turkish economy, which has been suffering from serious defects and obstacles since the blockade was imposed on Iraq in 1990. [passage omitted] AL-THAWRAH says that if Mrs. Ciller's government fulfills its promise to reopen the al-Khabur border post, then the way will be open for the Turkish economy to acquire the same privileges attained during the prosperous trade exchanges with Iraq. These exchanges used to refresh not only Turkish areas adjacent to Iraq but all of Turkey as well. This was achieved by pumping Iraqi oil into Turkish markets and promoting trade and economic activities along the path of the oil pipeline, in addition to supporting the Turkish lira, expanding the scope for businesses, and establishing dozens of joint Iraqi-Turkish ventures and firms.
