According to the same source the former Soviet leaders would be invited to Groznyy for consultations on the issue. A senior presidential spokesman said the Chechen leaders recognized the legitimacy and legal acts of only the Soviet Union. "As for the legitimacy of the Belovezh agreements that caused the USSR to fall apart, the Chechen leaders have big doubts about them", the source told Interfax. "The Chechen people have the full right to this, because when for the first time in their history they took part in the referendum on preserving the USSR, they voted "yes"." "If Russia, which does not have a legal reason for statements that Chechnya is a member of the Russian Federation, keeps saying so, Groznyy will reserve the right to call in question the legitimacy of the Russian Federation and its leaders", the senior source at the Chechen presidential staff said.
