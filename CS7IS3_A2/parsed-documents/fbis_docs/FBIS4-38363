"Starting from this day," he stated, "the strategic missiles of Russia, the United States and Great Britain will no longer be aimed at targets in the three countries. This means that the agreements reached by Boris Yeltsin, Bill Clinton and John Major, aimed at consolidating world peace and international security, are going into effect." Leader of the U.S. delegation Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, noted the extraordinary character of the current meeting between American and Russian MPs. He said that the meetings he had with members of the Supreme Soviet during his numerous visits to Moscow over the past 20 years were purely formal, protocol-type functions, while the current one was marked by cordiality. He said that his delegation wanted to have serious talks with the Russian parliamentary committees, dealing with military matters. Nunn added that his delegation also planned to meet representatives of the executive branch of government, but would focus mainly on talks with parliament members. Dwelling on the nature of the forthcoming contacts with representatives of the U.S. Congress, Yushenkov told ITAR-TASS that the parliamentarians of the two countries wanted to discuss matters linked with the work of the Duma Committee on Defence and the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services to adopt military budgets and ratify international treaties, primarily the START-1 and START-2 agreements. Yushenkov said that the sides would also discuss problems linked with the expansion of relations between Russia and the United States, and also problems of security. "Of course, we shall discuss also the all-embracing NATO Partnership for Peace programme," Yushenkov stated. He expressed the hope that some common approaches to those problems would be determined, and "we shall be able to reach agreement on further cooperation within the frameworks of the agreements reached as a result of Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin's recent visit to the United States". Yushenkov said that he hoped the visit of the American delegation would turn a new page in the cooperation of the two parliaments.
