Vasiliy Svirin, the head of the Russian delegation, maintains that the Estonian diplomats: [Svirin] ...tried to accuse the Russian delegation of artificially seeking some kind of reasons that would allow Russia not to withdraw its troops from Estonia. The invention and groundlessness of such conclusions, I am convinced, are well-known. [Khabarov] Russia really is refusing to give Estonia a detailed schedule for the withdrawal of its troops, but only because the Estonian side is not prepared to simultaneously sign an agreement on the social security of military pensioners remaining in Estonia. The talks are also barely making progress on other issues as well. [Svirin] Today we were unable to initial a single document. [Khabarov] The Estonian delegation was once again asked to begin discussions on the land border with Russia. If this does not happen Moscow intends to unilaterally reinforce its borders. Russian Foreign Ministry representatives would like to hear a reply to this warning at the next, 19th round of talks. According to preliminary information the next meeting between Russian and Estonian diplomats will take place at the beginning of May in Tallinn. So, if this round of talks has finished like the majority of the others in failure, then the Russian diplomats can be sure of one thing at least -- that rooms have already been booked for them in a Tallinn hotel.
