During that meeting, Mr. Christopher announced that subject to "some fine-tuning" Washington was accepting Jordan's proposal to replace the sea-based inspections by American-led warships with an on-shore sanctions verifications regime. Dr. al-Majali, in a meeting with Egyptian reporters ahead of Thursday's meeting here of the Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee, said that despite the acceptance announced by Mr. Christopher no further steps had been taken to place the sanctions-verifications regime at al-'Aqabah. The fact that no ship was intercepted after the London meeting does not automatically mean that the inspectors have called off the maritime interceptions, Dr. al-Majali said. At the same time, Dr. al-Majali reaffirmed Jordan's position that it would not allow any "inspection" of cargo at al-'Aqabah. Lloyds Register, the international neutral agency nominated to take over the sanctions-verification regime, was free to "observe" incoming and outgoing cargo at al-'Aqabah when Jordanian customs inspectors open them as required by the Kingdom's laws and regulations, he said. The agency, he said, could report to the U.N. Sanctions Committee on its observations. Beyond that, Dr. al-Majali added, Jordan would not accept any arrangement that would infringe upon its sovereignty. In his comments to the Egyptian journalists, Dr. al-Majali welcomed the resumption of meetings of the joint Jordanian-Egyptian committee and expressed hope that the meeting would lay the cornerstone for restoring Arab cooperation and coordination. He said that the committee will also discuss means to bolster political relations. The prime minister underlined the need for ending inter-Arab differences and "to open a new chapter, particularly at this criticial stage..." Dr. al-Majali said it was essential that the Arabs assume an effective role in any regional order. He said features of the "new world order" were not yet clear enough, nor are those of the regional Arab order. "The only clear thing is that the United States is dominating the world under the new order," he added. Dr. al-Majali said "There is no room under the new order for spectators" and emphasised the need for effective Arab input in shaping this order. Dr. al-Majali said Jordan's participation in the multilateral peace talks has been reduced to an observer status to protest the continued blockade of al-'Aqabah port. He noted that multilateral talks are meant to address economic and social problems. On the Palestinian-Israeli accord, Dr. al-Majali said what was taking place between the Palestinian and Israelis was an affair concerning the two parties. "We shall accept what the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, accepts," he said. "However, we do not want the result of any accord to negatively affect us." He added that Jordan had hoped for greater Jordanian-Palestinian coordination, given the unique brotherly, historical relations between the two peoples.
