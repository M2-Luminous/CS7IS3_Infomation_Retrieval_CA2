The new coup was allegedly being prepared against President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. It is worth noting that the rumor again had as its main actors Deputies Francisco Jose de Vargas and Hermes Rafael Saguier, two legislators characterized by their regular reports of preparations being made for coups d'etat. The rumor, which did not make clear its origin, the reasons supporting it, or who was behind it, rocked congressional circles. Following a series of meetings behind closed doors it then finally dissipated. Military, government, and ruling party officials categorically denied the alleged existence of a coup. The calm congressional morning was broken when a meeting of the Chamber of Deputies special commission created to analyze the social priorities for the year was abruptly curtailed to allow De Vargas, Euclides Acevedo, and Nery Filemon Gonzalez to walk to Government Palace. The delegation returned to the Congress building a few minutes later, and continued their closed door meeting. Then suddenly the meeting was ended and legislators withdrew from the premises. The first report, which was later denied, indicated that the legislators drove to the 1st Army Corps headquarters in Campo Grande, or to the U.S. Embassy. De Vargas denied the rumor, as well as his having visited any of the above mentioned institutions. He also denied the existence of a coup plot.
