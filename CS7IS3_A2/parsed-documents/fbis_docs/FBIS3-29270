"South Korea has done a lot in acquiring advanced Western technologies and we want to learn from their experience and see what Koreans could do for our high-tech efforts," said Monji Safra in an interview with THE KOREA HERALD yesterday. The Tunisian secretary of state to the prime minister in charge of scientific research and technology is here on a three-day visit to prepare a general agreement on science and technological cooperation with South Korea. He met with Science and Technology Minister Kim Si-chung and other South Korean officials and heads of research institutes to discuss such an agreement yesterday. Safra named biotechnology, nuclear research and computers as potential sectors for bilateral technological cooperation. "We want to see what our biotechnology centers could do in joint efforts with their South Korean counterparts to improve seeds and increase agricultural productivity," he said. Tunisia also has an ambition of becoming the chief provider of computer software for Arab and African countries, especially software adopted for the needs of small businesses. The country is investing heavily in telecommunications. For example, it is interested in developing software needed to monitor satellites because one of the Arabsats is monitored from Tunis, Safra said. The Tunisian official also said his country is planning its first nuclear research center to promote the peaceful use of nuclear technology for medical, agricultural and industrial purposes. "And we hope South Korea will help us by sending experts to give us advice on building nuclear laboratories, which are urgently needed," he said. Although some private South Korean companies are already operating in Tunisia, Safra's visit marks the first big commitment to establish bilateral technological ties at an official level. During his stay here, Safra visited Taedok Science Town and six research institutes, including the Korea Institute of Science and Technology, to discuss an exchange of researchers. Korea International Cooperation Agency has agreed to offer three scholarships for Tunisian researchers to attend seminars and study in research institutes here. "This cooperation on the official level will certainly help lay the foundation for more cooperation in the private sector," Safra said. Samsung is already in Tunisia assembling microcomputers and Goldstar is producing household electric appliances there. For foreign investors, there could be little doubt about the importance of Tunisia's geographical location, Safra said. The North African region has 60 million people and Europe is directly across the Mediterranean Sea. "By being in Tunisia, foreign companies will be in a position not only to expand into the North African market but also to use it as a gateway to the European market," Safra said. Tunisia plans to open two free trade zones this year where foreign investors can work without any taxes and use cheap local labor on a contract basis so that they will not have to pay social taxes or comply with local labor regulations. As long as the local value added is more than 40 percent of the value of a product, the product is considered Tunisian, and almost all Tunisian products get free access to the European market except for a few agricultural products. Safra leaves the country today. His visit here included a meeting with Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong, where he said he made clear his country's position that every country in the world, including North Korea, must allow nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Tunisia is a member of the board of IAEA.
