Why has it happened this way? What will be next? BELINFORM has addressed these questions to the following people: Anatoliy Maysenya, director of the "East-West" Strategic Initiatives Center: "As a matter of fact, the `NOVAK' laboratory for axonometric research, which had made forecasts concerning the election course at our request, had predicted Alyaksandr Lukashenka's victory. Still, we did not expect such an overwhelming lead over the prime minister. I believe that this happened because Kebich and the current political elite were unable to develop a comprehensive platform. Due to that, during the campaign the Cabinet of Ministers chairman's team placed emphasis not on convincing the people, but on forceful methods. This boomeranged. All attempts to discredit Lukashenka brought to him people who had been undecided until the last moment. Thus, just as in all post-socialist countries, the election results in Belarus were a specific form of the people's protest against the drastic deterioration of living standards." Alyaksandr Potupa, chief of the Future Research Center: "According to my forecasts, which are known to television viewers and readers of many newspapers, Prime Minister Vyacheslaw Kebich should become president. I am still convinced that I am correct. "No one expected such an anomalous outcome. Nevertheless, it must be taken into account that this was only the first round. Moreover, such results are very beneficial for our people. They will serve as a stimulus for `a second brain convolution' to appear. I believe that our team has every chance for victory in the second round." Yevgeniy Babosov, director of the Belarusian Academy of Sciences Sociology Institute: "I link such a large margin between Alyaksandr Lukashenka and Vyacheslaw Kebich to the poor organization of the prime minister's last appearances on Belarusian television. I had the impression that Vyacheslaw Frantsevich was afraid of direct contacts with his opponents, and that he dodged urgent issues. However, I know that he can hold out pretty well even during an unbiased conversation. Therefore, this insignificant slander against Lukashenka, made public on the eve of the election, had a completely reciprocal effect, and increased the number of votes cast for the latter. "I think that there are three options for the second round. Either, having united, candidates who lost in the election will appeal to vote neither for Lukashenka nor Kebich, and in this way they will `blackball' both of them; or the team, which lost in the first round, will mobilize its ranks and analyze mistakes, and as a result, will avenge itself; and the third option is a landslide victory for Lukashenka." National Bank Chairman Stanislaw Bahdankevich, member of Stanislaw Shushkevich's team: "Such a huge margin between first and second places is really a big surprise. "Based on the preliminary results of the first round of voting, one can also make forecasts for the final return." Asked whether his statement, made in an interview published in NARODNAYA GAZETA, that he is ready to work with any president still remains in force, Stanislaw Antonavich replied: "The statement has been made, and I do not renounce my words. I am ready to cooperate even with Lukashenka, but such cooperation should be based on principles. In general, I believe that the Belarusian leadership needs to be reshuffled."
