Thus, relative scarcity values of .01 are assigned to each since zero values would theoretically mean infinite supplies of each exist. 5. Petroleum Equivalency Factor Calculation The Petroleum Equivalency Factor terms, including the driving pattern factor term, average national electricity transmission efficiency term, accessory factor term, and the electric generation output, input and relative scarcity term, are multiplied together to determine the proposed Petroleum Equivalency Factor (Table V). The three different Petroleum Equivalency Factor values reflect the three possible values of the accessory factor.
