Every material has some characteristic physical properties. According to recent research performed by French material scientists, it will be possible in future to plan materials so that they possess several properties which can be built into them in a deliberate and controlled way. Thus it will be possible in a single material to combine magnetic properties with specific non-linear optical properties which do not occur in nature and which it has hitherto been impossible to produce. The basic principles for the production of such new materials were discovered and investigated at the Laboratoire de Chimie Inorganique of the French Universite Paris Sud. In the view of the French scientists, the combinatorial possibilities are unlimited, and this means that it will in future be possible to go about creating completely new materials on the basis of requirement profiles. One of the first such materials they were able to obtain was crystallizing compounds which combine a very high magnetic value with the capacity to double the oscillation of light frequencies, that is, to produce light oscillations of the second upper harmonic oscillation in passing through the layers. At the same time the material possesses permanent magnetic properties. The combination of these two important properties is brought about by deliberate construction of interconnected molecular structures, of which one component is responsible for the magnetic properties and another for the non-linear optical properties. But in order to achieve this, the atomic lattices of the individual components must be made to interconnect. In the process, the structure of an inorganic compound determines the alignment and the intercalation of an organic compound. The developers say that the design gives rise to interconnected hybrid compounds which consist of both organic and inorganic molecules. For continuing experiments the scientists are using "DAMS," short for dimethyl amino-N-methyl stilbazoline, as an organic compound. Because of its structure, it possesses non-linear optical properties if there is no domain formation with symmetry centers in the dipolar-type compound. In order to prevent this, these organic, color-bearing molecules are combined as chromophores with cations of a manganese salt and anions from phosphide sulfide. In the process a complex hybrid compound arises (MnO.86S3(DAMS)0.26), whose inorganic components take care of the incorporation of the organic molecules in the requisite interstitial structure, and thus causes the molecular orientation for the optical behavior. The new material created is permanently magnetic up to a temperature of 40 ï¿½K and doubles incident laser light over a relatively wide frequency range. The new material is available in crystalline form, but at the moment the question of whether it can be drawn out into thin films for frequency filters, for example, or applied to glass substrates in a few atomic layers, has not yet been thoroughly investigated. The scientists are consciously refraining from investigating any practical applications more thoroughly yet, preferring to research the principles according to which the formation of such combinations of properties must proceed. For if these rules are known, a very large number of coumpounds can be synthesized which unite several properties, perhaps even opposing ones. In some ways this method of synthesis may represent a complement to the sol-gel procedure which is commonly used today to build up new compounds from nanometer-sized components. In comparison with materials currently in use, which are designed to optimize a single property, the developers speak of a new generation of "two-dimensional" materials. If more than two properties can be combined in a material, "multidimensional" materials are also theoretically possible.
