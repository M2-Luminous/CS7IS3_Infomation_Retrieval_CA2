In the Kragujevac radio program "The Hallmark of Time," Gen. Perisic said that Albania is in a certain way getting involved in a struggle against Yugoslavia by expressing certain territorial aspirations. Planned infiltration of their people, sent to carry out certain activities, into our territory is a part of the scenario. According to Perisic one of the main parts of the scenario is "to cause border incidents in order to present a false picture to the world of the suffering of innocent Albanians. Our border guards use weapons in accordance with the regulations of their service and gravest consequences have occurred," he said. "The ultimate aim is to achieve one thing only -- to create conditions for the international community to demonize the Serbs in this area too, as has been done in the Srpska republic and in the republic of Serb Krajina," the chief of the Yugoslav general staff said. Asked to comment on increasingly frequent statements by politicians from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia that the Macedonians are under threat from the north, Gen. Perisic said that "the creators of the new world order were not sure that Yugoslavia would be securely sealed in this region, so -- under the pretext of preventing incidents -- they sent their forces." Perisic said incidents in this region "happen periodically, but increasingly often." "Incidents at the Yugoslav border with Albania and Macedonia are aimed at creating the impression that it is Yugoslavia that causes them, while in fact it is just the opposite. The aim is clear -- to demonize the Serbs and Yugoslavia in the world's eyes in order to achieve the West's strategic objectives," Gen. Perisic concluded.
