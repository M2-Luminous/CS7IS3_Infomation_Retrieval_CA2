The latest reports from Sarajevo show that, following the accord on a cease-fire reached between the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims, and with the mediation of the UN forces command, both sides have begun the process of withdrawing heavy artillery and placing it under UN supervision. Hailing these positive movements, Ukraine calls on the conflicting sides to continue their efforts, the final aim of which should be an agreement on transferring all weapons to UN control, full withdrawal of Serbian formations from Sarajevo, and the occupation of their positions by sub-units of the peacekeeping forces. The demilitarization of Sarajevo and transfer of the town to UN management will stop the senseless bloodshed and serve as a starting point for reaching a fair and peaceful settlement. Ukraine considers that refusal by any side in the conflict to cooperate further with the UN with regard to implementing the accords reached should be viewed as a challenge to the world community and disregard for UN decisions, and may lead to the use of force, as envisaged in the UN Charter and Security Council resolutions 836 and 844. Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs appeals to the political leaders of the conflicting sides and to the peoples of Bosnia-Herzegovina with an insistent call to show political wisdom namely now, and notwithstanding insults, reproaches, and distrust, to adopt a definitive stance for the benefit of peace in the region.
