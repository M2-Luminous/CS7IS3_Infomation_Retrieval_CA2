Here is Melisa Soto with details. [Soto] The officers who received the presidential pardon are Lt. Col Francisco Arias Cardenas, Major Marisela Arevalo, Lt. Ramon Rodriguez Chasin, Aviation Lt. Juan Carvajal Mas, Technical Sergeant 3d Class Tony Armas, Army Captain Frank Rafael Morales, Army Capt. Juan Carlos Hidalgo Pandare, Lt. Jose Gregorio Vielma, and Lt. Jose Felix Alvarez. All of them were tried and convicted and are now serving sentences in the San Carlos Garrison and Lino de Clemente Battalion, except for Lt. Col. Arias Cardenas, who is still confined in a military hospital after undergoing dental surgery. It is also worth noting that today Lt. Colonel Hugo Chavez Frias did not appear at the military court as is customary. According to his legal advisers, who are also temporarily serving as the attorneys for General Carlos Diaz Rangel [name and title as heard], Chavez will not appear in court to be handed a warrant for his arrest [as heard] because he feels the proceedings contain a series of irregularities. As his advisers explained, the president is being deceived because some of the convicted officers have received manipulative offers to get them to request discharges, including offers of scholarships and cash. [Begin recording] [Defense attorney Tomas Noriega, identified by caption] We feel that this officer, or, rather, these officers who have come to talk to Major Carlos Diaz Reyes about this subject are hampering his right to a defense, and the position of these officers undermines the defense of those patriots who rebelled against corruption and the awful situation in the country. The time that has passed since then has proven -- and President Caldera has admitted this -- that if it had not been for the 4 February events, he would never have been elected president. [Defense attorney Jesus Bello, identified by caption] In public remarks made during the election campaign, and later after being elected president, Dr. Caldera offered to release these officers without any conditions or restrictions. This is why I feel the president must know that these officers fulfilled their duty. He must also know that his public promises, as well as the promises he made over the telephone to Col. Chavez and Maj. Diaz Reyes when they were held in Yare -- promises that he would release them once he was elected -- are the reason why the people are still clamoring for their release, and the president must heed the people and help these officers be reincorporated into the National Armed Forces. [end recording] [Soto] According to Lt. Col. Chavez Frias' legal advisers, other officers who are being tried for the 4 February and 27 November coup attempts have received similar promises.
