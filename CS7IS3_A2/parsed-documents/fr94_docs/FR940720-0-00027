FR940720-0-00027 FR940720-0-00001 The allocation of the NRC's $16.8 million in budgeted costs to the individual fuel facilities is based, as in FYs 1991&hyph;1993, primarily on the OBRA&hyph;90 conferees' guidance that licensees who require the greatest expenditure of NRC resources should pay the greatest annual fee. Because the two high-enriched fuel manufacturing facilities possess strategic quantities of nuclear materials, more NRC safeguards costs (e.g., physical security) are attributable to these facilities. Likewise, more of the safety licensing and inspection costs are allocated to the HEU facilities because more of these resources are used for HEU facilities as compared to other facilities. However, safety program assessment and safety event evaluation costs for fuel facilities are uniformly allocated to HEU and LEU facilities because these activities apply equally to each of the HEU and LEU facilities. Using this approach, the base annual fee for each facility is shown below. ‚ê£ 1Type of facility 1Annual fee_safeguards and safety High enriched fuel: Nuclear Fuel Services $3,176,000 Babcock and Wilcox 3,176,000 n,s Subtotal 6,352,000 n,d Low enriched fuel: Siemens Nuclear Power $1,429,000 Babcock and Wilcox 1,429,000 General Electric 1,429,000 Westinghouse 1,429,000 Combustion Engineering (Hematite) 1,429,000 General Atomics 1,429,000 n,s Subtotal 8,574,000 n,d UF 6 conversion: Allied-Signal Corp $1,114,000 Other fuel facilities (3 facilities at $254,000 each) 762,000 n,s Total 16,802,000 One of Combustion Engineering's (CE) low enriched fuel facilities has not been included in the fee base because of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision of March 16, 1993, directing the NRC to grant an exemption for FY 1991 to Combustion Engineering for one of its two facilities. As a result of the Court's decision, the NRC granted an exemption to one of CE's low enriched uranium fuel facilities for FY 1994. The NRC has therefore excluded this facility from the calculation of the FY 1994 annual fees for the low enriched fuel category. Of the $2.1 million attributable to the uranium recovery class of licensees, about $1.5 million will be assessed to the Department of Energy (DOE) to recover the costs associated with DOE facilities under the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA). These costs were previously recovered from operating power reactors because DOE was not an NRC licensee prior to September 1993 and therefore could not be billed under 10 CFR Part 171. In September 1993, DOE became a general licensee of the NRC because post-reclamation closure of the Spook, Wyoming site had been achieved. Approximately 44 percent of the remaining costs of $639,000 for uranium recovery is attributable to uranium mills (Class I facilities) and facilities that dispose of 11e.(2) byproduct materials, approximately 39 percent is attributable to those solution mining licensees who do not generate uranium mill tailings (Class II facilities), and the remaining 17 percent is allocated to the other uranium recovery facilities (e.g., extraction of metals and rare earths). The resulting annual fees for each class of licensee are: 2.A.(2)_Class I facilities: $74,500 2.A.(2)_Class II facilities: $41,200 2.A.(2)_Other facilities: $36,200 2.A.(3)_11e.(2) disposal: $67,000 2.A.(4)_11e.(2) disposal incidental to existing tailings site: $8,700 The annual fees for FY 1994 for the uranium recovery class of licensees are less than the FY 1992 fees and are higher than the FY 1993 annual fees. The total amount of fees that must be recovered from uranium recovery commercial licensees has decreased by about 10 percent compared to FY 1993; however, the annual fee per facility has increased for two basic reasons. First, the amount that is expected to be recovered through part 170 fees has decreased as a result of completing the licensing of the Envirocare 11e.(2) byproduct disposal facility. This requires relatively more costs to be recovered through annual fees. The second cause of the increase is a decrease in the number of licensees in the class to be assessed annual fees for FY 1994.
