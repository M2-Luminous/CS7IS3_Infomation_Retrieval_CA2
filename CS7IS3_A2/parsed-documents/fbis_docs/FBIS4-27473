For the initial stage, the (Spy) Company, a Canadian firm specializing in satellite technology, will be assigned to provide technical assistance and training courses for Thai officials. Pricha disclosed that Thailand has set up a satellite division under the jurisdiction of the National Research Institute. The division is unable to cope with the work load, however, and thus Thailand has to depend on other countries for satellite information on natural resources, environment, forestry, and telecommunications. Pricha said that Thailand needs a specific agency at the national level to handle satellite issues and coordinate with other countries. The Ministry of Sciences, Technology, and Environment will soon propose to the cabinet the establishment of a national independent satellite agency. Pricha added: "In the future, it also will be necessary for Thailand to have its own satellite launching pad, and the most appropriate site is in Narathiwat Province. Canadian assistance in setting up a satellite data center will be useful to both Thailand and the neighboring countries."
