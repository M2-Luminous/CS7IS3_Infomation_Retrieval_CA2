Deputy General Director Stanko Zivkovic enumerated several problems which make the start up of the factory's operations difficult and expressed hope that they will not be insurmountable. The greatest problem is the delivery of crude oil through the Iriski Venac, where the traffic is difficult, especially for heavy tank trucks. Matroz does not even have the minimum supply of crude oil and is unable to start the production. Six tank trucks were supposed to arrive yesterday, but only four did, and today only four of eight scheduled trucks arrived. "Just putting the machines in operation is not without risk," Zivkovic says. "The machines were idle for an entire month, and it is not easy to start even a car if it has not been operated for that amount of time. But there is hope that everything will be okay." In the early afternoon hours the factory had still not started to operate. Three to four hours are needed to start producing the first quantities of paper. Zivkovic says that some paper could start to be delivered to the newspaper publishing houses as early as tomorrow.
