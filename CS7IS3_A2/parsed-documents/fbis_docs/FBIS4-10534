FBIS4-10534 "drlat072_c_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-072 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 MEXICO Presidential Candidate Cardenas Interviewed Presidential Candidate Cardenas Interviewed PA1204162594 PA1204162594 BFN [Editorial Report] Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish at 0530 GMT on 7 April broadcasts a live or recorded 120-minute interview with Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate of Mexico's Party of the Democratic Revolution, PRD, during the "Let Us Speak Clearly" call-in program hosted by journalist Lolita de la Vega. After a brief introduction and a video clip of Cardenas' biographical data, de la Vega begins receiving calls from people shown on video who are identified by caption. She asks Cardenas if his party agrees with some of the ruling party's policies, to which he replies: "We may agree in certain areas." He says: "we are pleased with the initiation of the negotiations in Chiapas, which in our opinion was necessary. Fortunately, the government sought negotiations to prevent a military resolution to the Chiapas conflict. We are also happy to see inflation is under control. We recognize the government's positive steps, but it is also our duty to point out those things with which we disagree or which we believe are negative." When a caller asks Cardenas if he is running for president again to serve Mexico or to satisfy his personal ambitions, Cardenas replies: "I was asked by my fellow party members," adding, "we are seeking profound changes in the country. It was not a personal decision. I can serve my country as a candidate, as a president, or as a simple citizen but will always struggle for democratic changes." When de la Vega asks if he would be willing to invite members from other parties to participate in the changes he proposes, he says: "Yes, of course. The only condition is that the person should have a real commitment to make democratic changes, should be someone known for his desire to serve, should have a proven honor, capability, knowledge, and, as I said, a willingness to make changes and to serve the country." Concerning corruption, de la Vega asks what actions he would take to ensure dishonest officials would be punished; he says: "Certain mechanisms would have to be implemented, because as it is the comptroller general's office does not function, because it is both judge and defendant." He adds "this position should be in the hands of the opposition." Regarding his approach to tackle the problem of unemployment, he says: "I see the country's reconstruction as a joint effort of many forces, not just of the government, private enterprise, or workers. I believe private enterprise, workers, and the state can work together to achieve common objectives. We all want to create jobs, to increase production, to improve productivity, to have better salaries, more purchasing power, more tax revenues, more investment funds." He adds: "We must use our resources. I believe one of our main acts should be to reactivate our energy policy, to build electricity plants, to develop our oil industry, to improve our highway system." In response to a caller who asks him what would be his first steps to separate the executive and judicial branches, Cardenas says: "First of all, through a different policy; in other words, by effectively complying with the law and the Constitution and not by interfering with or intervening in areas where we are not supposed to. The president should not go beyond his constitutional and legal capacity. We should effectively advance to guarantee the autonomy among the government branches. I am confident the next Congress will be different, because the majority of deputies and senators will not owe their election to the president." A caller asks Cardenas if he fears an attack similar to Colosio's by members of his own party; he says: "No, much less from within my party." Cardenas is asked what he would do to resolve extreme poverty, especially among Indians throughout the country. He says: "We must spend more funds for this purpose and realize the problem of poverty is affecting more than 50 percent of the country's population; that is, more than 40 million Mexicans." He adds: "We must encourage employment, better salaries; this cannot be done overnight, but we must make great efforts to revert current practices, to strengthen the educational system, and to improve our health system." A caller from Monterrey asks if he plans to unify health service and improve salaries of professionals in the health sector. Cardenas says: "We must make a great national effort, both economic and political, to improve the salaries of all workers." He adds: "How? Through a better distribution of expenses, making better use of the country's resources, and by managing those funds better." De la Vega asks Cardenas what he thinks would be the best solution to improve salaries; he says: "We must generate economic activity, jobs, and better salaries." Asked to be more specific in explaining his economic policy, he says his economic proposal is "making the economic policy more social; in other words, we must realize economic measures affect the people, their standards of living, job opportunities." He adds: "We will have to reduce interest rates, make our banking system more efficient, create a climate of confidence for domestic and foreign investors, and create the conditions to strengthen our markets." When asked why there should be international observers in the elections, he replies: "We believe if there is nothing to hide, there can be observers both from inside the country and from abroad who can contribute to cleaner elections, which is a national demand that has become stronger after Colosio's death." A caller from Mexico City asks Cardenas what actions he would take against the mafia and manipulation of the public through television stations. He replies: "I believe it is absolutely necessary to open new opportunities in television, to create the possibilities of opening television stations at universities and higher centers for education, stations handled by community organizations, opening more opportunities for artistic creativity, for the film industry." He adds: "We believe it is necessary to break the monopoly in the country, specifically concerning Televisa, as it is unfair for one station to have excessive coverage, which is what is happening today." When asked by a caller: "What lesson did all Mexicans get from the problem in Chiapas?" Cardenas answers: "It showed us there are problems of misery, arbitrariness by authorities, land evictions, a lack of democracy, elections that are not held. Those problems must be attacked at their roots. I believe this is one of the main lessons we have received from the Chiapas conflict, which also indicates what the solutions are: If we attack misery, strengthen the productive sectors in that region, if we end arbitrariness, we will surely prevent a similar problem in Chiapas or any other part of the country." De la Vega continues to read letters received from viewers. She reads a letter from a Mexico City viewer who asks: "What is your opinion of Subcommander Marcos?" Cardenas replies: "We do not know much about him. He is a fighter. He is definitely a fighter who defends his ideas. He risks his life for his ideas and the people in whom he believes and those who believe in him. We respect that position. We have followed different paths in the hopes of solving similar problems or reaching similar goals. We hope we will have the opportunity to meet him during a future visit to Chiapas. Perhaps we can sit down and talk and exchange views so that I can have more firsthand information on what he wants and what we can do to contribute to a stable peace in Chiapas and throughout the country." De la Vega then asks Cardenas what he will do for retirees. Cardenas says: "We have suggested increasing pensions. During the first phase of the plan we would like to increase them to at least the minimum wage. We hope to later increase pensions to the same salary the retired person earned while he was working." De la Vega reads a letter from listener Rene Ortiz who asks: "If the PRD wins the elections, what kind of a cabinet will you have?" Cardenas answers: "With people from the various political forces that support a democratic change," adding "honest people who will honor their commitments. It will be a pluralist government." De la Vega then asks: "Do these people have a name?" Cardenas responds: "In certain cases I can say yes, and I hope I will be able to disclose those names shortly." An unidentified speaker then asks Cardenas about Mexico's economy and "how he plans to solve those problems?" Cardenas says: "We have already said how we would solve certain problems. As I said earlier, productive investment must be boosted. We must stress job creation. We must reduce interest rates and make loans more accessible so that more investments can be made." Cardenas goes on to say: "We must improve our road systems and build hydroelectric plants. The construction industry must serve as a guide toward economic recovery. That is what we must do to ensure the economy will begin to recover, but everyone must contribute to this. We need the help of the businessmen, the state, and workers." Caller Juan Villagran asks Cardenas about changes to the Constitution. The caller wants to know if Cardenas agrees with the changes made. Cardenas responds: "We do not agree state education is no longer free. I believe this is something we must reinstate. Only elementary and high school education are free today. I believe if the state is funding education, all education, from kindergarten to the university, should be free. We oppose other changes to the Constitution. We are against changes made to Article 16 of the Constitution. This change grants the Attorney General's Office the right to be judge and jury. This office no longer needs a warrant issued by a judge to arrest someone. We also oppose changes to Article 27, because with these changes the people lose their right to demand land that is in the hands of large landowners. These large landowners have land that surpasses the amounts legally allotted to one person. We oppose these changes and believe a review of these changes would be appropriate and more changes made." De la Vega reads a letter from viewer Elina Perez Gomez who asks: "Mr. Cardenas, are you aware you have provoked violence in our country? If you love Mexico and the memory of your beloved father, you would not do the things you do. There are mercenaries of war, and I believe you are involved with them." Cardenas responds: "I do not agree with that opinion. We are not seeking violence; quite the contrary, we have been victims of violence. The PRD has lost more than 250 members. We do not want more violence, and this is precisely why we are struggling for a change in the country." Viewers continue to ask questions on education and the PRD's plans for those women who head households. Cardenas says: "We want to offer these women the many rights and services the state can offer. For example, they should have equal rights when requesting a home; they should not be discriminated against when requesting a job. They should also have the opportunity to train for specific jobs so they can provide for their children. That is what we must do." Another viewer comments on the issue of ideological violence and asks: "Don't you think that with your way of being you contributed to Colosio's assassination?" Lolita de la Vega says: "That is terrible." Cardenas replies: "I do not believe I did." De la Vega says: "I am sure you did not." De la Vega continues to read letters sent in by viewers. A viewer from Veracruz wonders where Cardenas will get the money the Mexican people need. He wonders if Cardenas will borrow the money as other presidents have done. Cardenas answers: "No. We will have to work with a budget. We can only spend what we receive." De la Vega asks: "What if that is not enough?" Cardenas responds: "We must find a way. We must better distribute our resources. We must boost production. We must ensure greater production, resources, more taxes." De la Vega says: "But the people will not like the idea of more taxes." Cardenas responds: "Not higher taxes. We need to get more people to pay taxes. It does not mean we will increase the taxes for those already paying taxes." An unidentified caller asks Cardenas about his plans to promote foreign investment in Mexico. Cardenas replies: "As I said earlier, we must bring back trust and create the necessary conditions for foreign investment to return to Mexico. Foreign investment must be mainly in the production sector. It should promote new projects that will create new jobs." Cardenas continues to say this is possible with "an honest government, a government that does not accept bribes and commissions, a government that does not demand a share in investment, a government that will treat everyone alike and give advantages to those who wish to come to the country and take the risk to help the country progress." Again on the topic of women, Cardenas is asked about his plans for women should he win the elections. Cardenas reiterates women should have the same rights as men to an education and a job. He adds many people must understand the rights of women must be respected. Cardenas adds: "We must be aware women will need special work schedules. We have made women responsible for the care of children, old people, and the sick, and something must be done to help them." Lolita de la Vega then asks Cardenas how many women candidates for the Senate his party will nominate, and he says at least 30 percent of the nominees will be women. When she asks why only 30 percent when women constitute 52 percent of the Mexican population, Cardenas responds: "Because we are advancing slowly. There are parties which do not even have that many women candidates. This is a first for the PRD, and I hope we will be able to do this. It is often not easy to find people to work with." A caller asks Cardenas about differences between the political platform he had when he was a PRI member and his current platform. Cardenas replies: "If you read the two platforms carefully, you will find that there are not too many changes." "This platform states the need to make democratic changes; the need to build a democracy in the country." Cardenas continues: "The only difference is that we are opposed to corporate unions and corruption. We want a pluralist government. We believe in changing political and economic policies. We believe in seeking other social opportunities. That is the basic difference between the two platforms." Asked about the budget he plans to allocate for education, Cardenas says: "We must strengthen the budget for higher education. We have said that the education system should receive at least 8 percent of the budget, but it would be great if we could allocate more than 8 percent." Regarding the loan U.S. President Clinton made to Mexico the day after Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated, Cardenas said: "It was done to save the country's economy. It was to keep our currency, which is already weak, from falling. The U.S. Government undoubtedly gave political aid to the Mexican Government. That is the existing relationship between the two governments, and I hope that this help, whenever it is positive help, will continue once another administration assumes office." Lolita de la Vega reads the final question for the evening: "Will you accept the elections results even if you lose? Cardenas responds: "The important thing is that we have clean elections in the country. This is not something we should see only on election day. We must begin to see it today. If observers are allowed to come and observe, if all political parties have access to the data on the electoral lists, if we see that mistakes in the electoral lists are corrected, then we will see that the conditions are right and that there is a willingness to guarantee that the results are accurate. At that point we will all have to admit that they were clean elections. These changes, however, must begin right now. They cannot wait until the last day. It is a process that takes months to conclude."
