Russia has proposed to continue the interstate talks and evidently Estonia will accept this proposal, the Prime Minister said. Taking into account the latest statements from top Russian officials there is reason to sit down around a talks table again. If Russia also gives up the additional conditions set for the withdrawal of troops there is hope that quick progress will be made regarding agreements, Laar claimed to BNS. Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on 11 March on his visit to Finland that Russia will withdraw its troops from Latvia and Estonia by the agreed deadline, 31 August 1994. Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, too, has gone back on his previous statements and stated in Germany that Russia will honor the 31 August deadline for the troop withdrawal. Russia had previously stated that it does not view the troop withdrawal date as binding. Russian representatives have also claimed that they will take time out at Estonian-Russian talks. Mart Laar sees Chernomyrdin's and Grachev's latest statements as positive. According to the [Estonian] prime minister, Estonia does not intend to make any changes in the delegation and will continue with the existing team. At the same time Mart Laar is convinced, as before, that it is necessary for the Estonian and Russian top officials to meet.
