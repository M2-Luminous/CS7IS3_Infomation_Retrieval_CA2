At approximately 1215 the negotiations broke off with the intent to resume an hour later. Meanwhile, the trade union delegation went to the Bucharest headquarters of Romania's Mining Trade Union Confederation. At 1400 correspondents waiting for the resumption of talks at the Ministry of Industry were asked to go to the headquarters of Romania's Mining Trade Union Confederation, where Mr. Dumitru Leonte, vice president of the confederation, said that since the delegation did not have the mandate to sign the protocol in the drafted form, it renounced to negotiate any further and left for Targu Jiu to present the document and discuss it with the other trade union leaders. A commission of the Ministry of Industry is expected to arrive in Targu Jiu next Monday, 21 February, to investigate -- in the light of repeated demands made in this respect by the miners -- the activity of the management board of the Brown Coal Public Corporation. Mr. Dumitru Leonte emphasized that the commission should include experts of the control bodies of the Ministry of Industry, the Prime Minister's Office, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, and the Ministry of Finance. He ruled out the presence in the inquiry commission of any member of the management board of the Targu Jiu Brown Coal Public Corporation, our correspondent Catalin Trandafir reports. At the request of the correspondents, a news conference was held at the headquarters of the Targu Jiu Brown Coal Public Corporation, with the participation of Messrs. Gheorghe Marculescu, prefect of Gorj County; Radu Mironovici, general manager of the aforementioned public corporation; Colonel Constantin Codica, chief of the Police Inspectorate of Gorj County; and Gorj Deputy Nicolae Mischie. After a presentation of last week's events, following the strike launched by the Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation of Targu Jiu, the speakers pointed to the illegal nature of that labor action and emphasized that in the coming days, a governmental commission will begin its inquiry into accusations brought against the management board of the public corporation, while representatives of the Court of Public Accounts will conduct their own inquiry. We are open to any kind of checks, General Manager Radu Mironovici said. Answering the correspondents' questions, he gave details about the relationship between the trade unions and the public corporation. On the other hand, the management board of the Targu Jiu Brown Coal Public Corporation will conduct its own inquiry into damages caused by the strikers over the past five days of labor action and will take steps to recover these damages and punish the guilty ones. The head of the Police Inspectorate of Gorj County again emphasized the illegal nature of the strike and said that the leaders of the Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation of Targu Jiu have been penally punished in the past for violating the law. He said that legal steps had been initiated against Miron Cosma, who will be sued for serious abuse [ultraj] after the indictment is finalized by the Targu Jiu Prosecuting Magistracy and forwarded to the appropriate court, our correspondent Titus Stoichitoiu reports.
