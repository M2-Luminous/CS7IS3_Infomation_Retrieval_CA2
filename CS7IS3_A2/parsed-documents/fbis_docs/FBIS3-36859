Laaneots said the Army will mainly get 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm guns. The 7.62-mm PKT standard machine guns, received from Israel as a gift, will be used on armored vehicles. The same shipment's 23 mm anti-aircraft cannons will add strength to the Army's anti-aircraft weaponry. The only weapons in the consignment that fail to correspond to NATO standards are 23 mm cannons. NATO uses the 20 mm version. The Defense Union paramilitary's arms list will comprise 7.62 mm Soviet-made guns, as well as RPD machine guns of the same caliber received in gift from Israel. Laaneots said the Defense League will also get anti-tank bomb throwers, which will make the volunteer league a "notable military force" in 1994. The police will have 9 mm guns, mainly Mini-Uzis. An emergency task force will get 5.45 mm Soviet-made machine guns. Part of the Israeli weapons will go to the border forces. The Chief of Staff said border guard forces had also received light anti-tank weapons. Laaneots said the division of the weapons as made now was of temporary character, adding that the system was needed to ensure proper servicing and right ammunition supplies. He also assured that the country was facing no problems in obtaining ammunition for the guns purchased from Israel, as cartridges for the respective sizes are manufactured in most of Europe's industrially developed countries.
