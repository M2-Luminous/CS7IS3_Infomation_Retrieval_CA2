"The electricity per worker ratio in the agrarian sector of Russia is less than one-tenth of that in Western Europe, while the low productivity is at present predetermining the depth of the abyss where the agrarian sector is quietly rolling," said Vyacheslav Zvolinskiy, chairman of the Agrarian Policy Committee of the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament. The "wrong course" for Russian agriculture has been charted not by science but by politicians, "who are carrying out their reforms, both in the countryside and elsewhere, at the expense of the people, above all the peasantry," Zvolinskiy, who is an agricultural scientist, said in an interview with Interfax on Saturday. "What we are witnessing in Russia today is a struggle among foreign spheres of influence forced on the country by the world community," he continued. For this reason, the Agrarian Policy Committee is determined "to defend the interests of the Russian peasantry to the end" and do its best to have "the executive branch carry out unconditionally and as accurately as possible" Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha's April 27 directive on the agrarian reform.
