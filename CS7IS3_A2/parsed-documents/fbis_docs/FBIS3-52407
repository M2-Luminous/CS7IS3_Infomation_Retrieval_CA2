What did Christians do in Bosnia? It is Christians who are committing massacres and genocide. They really want Islam and Muslims not to exist there. They are Christians. Does that pope, who takes those stances regarding Israel and recognizes Israel, see what is happening in Bosnia, and what they are doing there? Of course, they are not Catholics, but they are nevertheless Christians. He should see what his fellow Christians are doing. There are some Catholics who act in the same way; they are not all that innocent of that sort of thing. Then they should work out what they are going to do next year, how much corruption there is in those societies, moral corruption, financial and economic corruption, political corruption. Various kinds of corruption have penetrated the depths of Christian society. Are they contemplating reforming themselves? Are they thinking about bringing the growth of corruption under control? They are galloping toward doom and destruction, and they are unaware of it. We hope that, God willing, Islam will proceed as fast as it is advancing all over the world at present, and before long, thanks to the blessings of this Islamic revolution and the blood of these martyrs, Islam will conquer those countries. [crowd chants "God is great," "Khamene'i is the leader," "Death to America," "Death to Israel"] One of our non-Iranian friends who resides in Europe traveled to Iran recently. Yesterday he was telling me some very optimistic things. He said Islam is growing in Europe in a spontaneous fashion. The youth there are showing their inclination toward Islam by growing beards, while the women are increasingly wearing Islamic dress. It seems, therefore, that Islam in Europe is growing naturally. Perhaps these Muslims do not even know the reason for their inclination toward Islam, but what they do know is that they are enthusiastically interested in Islam. The attraction of the Islamic revolution and Islam has influenced them, and unwittingly they are being drawn toward Islam. The other side, the non-Muslims are resisting this trend. But the more they resist, the stronger the Muslims will become. He also said that the imam's decree on Salman Rushdie, and the shameful stances adopted by Europe toward the issue, has made Islam grow. These issues have caused a rejuvenation of Islamic spirit in Europe at a time when the European Muslims had all but forgotten their identity. Our friend said that in Europe there are about 30 million Muslims, who came to that continent from various countries and faced degradation, ignorance, and suppression. They were fast losing their identity, and although they were Muslims, they had very little Islamic integrity in themselves. When the Salman Rushdie affair occurred and the imam issued his decree, these Muslims suddenly recovered their forgotten existence. They returned to their origins, and found out once again what Islam is all about. The women became intensely interested in Islamic dress. This was to such an extent that certain governmental organs said they would not employ women wearing Islamic dress. This caused the Muslim women to protest and ask: What do you exactly require? If you want specialized knowledge, expertise, and academic qualifications, we possess them all. What inadequacy do you find in us that induces you to reject us? This issue in itself has turned into something which on the one hand has brought disgrace to the governments, and on the other hand has served to strengthen the resolve of the Muslims. This is the process which is currently in progress in Europe. In the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina, no matter how much they try to cover up the atrocities, they will not remain hidden. The people are beginning to understand what is being wreaked on Muslims. They are understanding that the problem is over Islam. Let me tell you this on the occasion of this very week in which relief was going to be collected for the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The issue there is not that of a group of hungry Muslims. It is quite right that they are hungry; it is quite right that they are living under the hardest conditions from the point of view of the cold weather and shortage of fuel; that they are living under astronomical high prices. All that is correct. But if we give assistance and say that one must help it is not merely because they are hungry, unclothed, and cold; it is because of the issue of Islam and atheism [kofr]. That is, there Islam and atheism are confronting each other. And they have resisted bravely for 20 months, are still resisting, and have not yet surrendered. Bravo to those people; bravo to that Islam which has given them so much strength! In that situation we say that Islam must be helped. They want Islam to cease to be. If those very people, the Bosnian Muslims, let their Islam go and say they no longer want to be Muslims, that they have an ethnicity and nationality that goes beyond Islam, just like you -- rest assured the problem will then end. Neither will Bosnia be dismembered, nor will the Serbs aggress. The international policymakers and the players on the stages of international politics will put an end to the problem then. But they are suffering all that because they are Muslims. We say that because they are Muslims Islam must be helped. The issue is not one of individuals and human beings; the issue is one of values. What is being said is that in that same Bosnian war the people are coming to understand what crimes are being perpetrated. And what resistance they are putting up. And automatically the leaning of the pure-hearted youths there toward Islam increases and their loathing against those policymakers -- who have created that situation and given support to the aggressor -- especially Britain which is giving support in such a way -- will be heightened. Let's move away from that issue as well. I hope all Muslims will be roused with fervor; all have a sense of responsibility, all support Islam and not be so negligent. Is it not shameful that there are more or less one and a half billion Muslims with all those resources while so many Muslims are being suppressed by a bunch of brutal Serbs? Would they not be able to put an end to the problem by working together? May God awaken them from their slumber. [passage omitted] The position of Islamic authority should be maintained and the Koran expresses the same meaning: People should be in absolute obedience to this religious authority. [passage omitted] This position is the hand and shadow of God and is generally responsible for maintaining divine values. [crowd chants approval] And as Ayatollah Khamene'i said: Things that have been achieved by the great religious personalities throughout history, in terms of power, glory, dignity, and greatness for Muslims, were because of this absolute obedience. When an order was issued, Muslims would not hesitate; they would submit. It was the same with the imams, peace be upon them, and their followers. In the same manner, the Muslims were obedient to the sixth Shi'i Imam Sadeq, peace be upon him, and other imams, peace be upon them, and the ulema and their successors. You have seen this and subsequent miracles in the 1892 Tobacco rebellion and other events, when the ulema ordered a holy war. This must be maintained without damage. This is not a personal issue. It is not an ordinary human, governmental, or organizational issue; it is an issue of divine authority. Obedience to this authority is obedience to God. A sin against it is a sin against God. [passage omitted] Of course, this does not mean no one should not make any comments; not at all. Nor does it mean that the religious scholar or the just jurisprudent are sinless like the imams. Everybody can express his view and make suggestions. But obedience must be totally maintained so as to maintain the power of Islam and Muslims, so as to allow the divine authority to fight against the worldly powers, as did our honorable imam [Khomeyni]. There is another issue regarding our honorable and dear brother, the president, who has been highly praised: Khamene'i has said that in this country, in the past 60-70 years, we have not had a leader as capable, honest, and sincere as the president. In all honesty this was lofty praise. May God also guard him for us. There is also an economic issue, and I would like to concentrate on it. Ayatollah Khamene'i has said: Compare our situation with those in neighboring countries and see how much better we are. This is the truth. In analyzing our daily affairs we should have two perspectives. We should neither deny the positive points, for this would mean a denial of God's blessings and would be followed by great punishment. If someone has truly served, in whatever post, his services should be recognized and praised. We should also see any possible problems and act to solve them with all sincerity, honesty, and without malice. If we maintain the two perspectives, society will move toward well being, otherwise it will not. If we only see the good and fail to notice the problems and shortages, we will naturally error. If we only see the shortages we would be making another mistake. [passage omitted] Another issue which his eminence mentioned and to which we should pay attention was that we should think of a solution to our economic problems. He explained the issues of production and consumption. These are issues that do not concern just the government or just the nation; all must invest in them together. Production should increase and there is no other way than that, and consumption should decrease and there is no other solution. If production does not increase and remains as it is, our situation will get worse day by day. If consumption is not controlled and does not decrease, no matter how much more we produce we will still engage in waste. [passage omitted] If we stop wasting bread we will be $365 million better off each year. A great deal can be done with that, and many problems can be solved with it. A report also mentions that a third of foodstuffs are wasted in Iran. [passage omitted] What should be done about that? Who should observe such issues? That is where imports should be controlled, and that is not a joking matter. Why should luxury goods be imported? His eminence the leader also mentioned the same thing. Why should illegal goods be imported? [passage omitted] Another issue is the control of luxuries, control of extravagance, control of foreign travel, and control of overspending, which should be implemented. Everyone is responsible. [passage omitted] Of course, it is possible that some officials might not be aware of things. Not everyone is aware of the details. But those who know should feel responsible to confront the issue and also inform the authorities to say what goes on in such and such place; what comings and goings are taking place; what kind of entertaining is going on and what kind of travels take place. This kind of thing should be stopped and should be decisively confronted. When a decisive action is taken, a network begins operating to stop the implementation of that decisive action. The same corrupt persons have formed a chain; when one of them is about to be grabbed by the neck, pressure is exerted from here and there, telephone calls are made, letters are written, recommendations are made and strings are pulled saying that that he should be released. Sometimes they defend him saying that it is a disgrace to prosecute such a person. Is it a disgrace to implement justice? Who is disgraced if someone who has committed an act of treason is arrested? Yes, it is possible that someone might be disgraced. Yes he should be disgraced, but the grace of Islam, the country and authorities has been safeguarded and others will be more careful not to commit such acts. If there is negligence, all become bold. If decisive action is taken, all take notice. [crowd chants slogans] On the same subject of prices, I would like to say one more brief sentence. Alongside all our other preoccupations, we must also do something for the low-income strata. Some of the high prices are inevitable, and nothing can be done about them, as in effect they have been imposed on us. No one, therefore, can be blamed. However, under the present circumstances, we must do something about the strata with no income, who cannot endure the impact of these bone-crushing high prices. We hope, God willing, these issues are taken into consideration when policies are being formulated. We know, of course, that these matters are being attended to. At the same time, prices must also be controlled, and people should not be left free to sell whatever they want at any price they wish. [passage omitted] I wanted to say a few words about the issue of marja'iyat [the status of being a source of emulation], but I have run out of time. Very briefly, however, I would like to say I am very happy that the issue of marja'iyat is at present personified by His Eminence Grand Ayatollah Araki. We hope that, God willing, attempts made by others to take it to places [ja-ha] which are at odds, to say the least, with the system, the state, and the position of the guardianship of the Muslims' cause, may prove fruitless, which I am sure they will.
