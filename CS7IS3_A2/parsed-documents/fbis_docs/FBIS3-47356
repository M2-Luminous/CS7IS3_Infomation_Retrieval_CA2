For any bonds the government might float to pay for a tax cut, "a firm guarantee of repayment that everyone can understand" is necessary, Fujii told a regular press conference. The timing must be concrete and dealt with in the same legislation as the income tax cut, he said. Fujii seemed to leave open the possibility that the debt from an income tax cut could be covered by funding means other than a consumption tax hike, which socialists in the ruling coalition oppose. "I have never used the term `consumption tax,'" he said, but he praised a report by the government's Tax Commission, which calls for reducing the income tax burden and increasing direct taxation, which includes the consumption tax. He said government and ruling coalition party leaders have not discussed specifics of funding an income tax cut.
