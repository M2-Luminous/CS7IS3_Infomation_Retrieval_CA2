They really want to cause a final show-down with NATO forces. The chetniks are continuing the offensive on Maglaj, using all weapons and targeting everything. [passage omitted] The aggressors tried to use aircraft again at 0915 GMT but failed to achieve the desired result. They let out their rage on civilians in the town, dropping tonnes of their deadly load. Howitzers, mortars, and tanks are pounding the town, and they have fired more than 400 shells on residential areas. We have learned that three civilians have been killed and six wounded. The shelling of Maglaj is going on as I speak. The best witnesses to the intensity of the shelling are NATO pilots who have been actively patrolling the air space above Maglaj since 0900 GMT. The war presidency of the Maglaj municipality has sent a request to Michael Rose [UN commander for Bosnia] to immediately dispatch UN Protection Force units to Maglaj to stop the further killing of civilians and protect material goods from the bestial shelling.
