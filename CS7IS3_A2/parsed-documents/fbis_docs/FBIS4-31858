Party Chairman P. Weiss said at a news conference held after the meeting that the Republican Council will decide on the definitive form of the list of candidates and on the themes for the election program at its session in Bratislava on 9 July. He emphasized that, apart from an election program, the SDL would also like to submit a government program to the voters--that is, a concept for the kind of government there would be if the left-wing coalition were to win the elections. According to him, the SDL's policy will not change in the principle policy issues. The party has banked on a high level of expertise and on ensuring that the changes needed in the economy are implemented in a socially tolerable manner. It has banked on its ability to cooperate with other political entities and would like to make good use of its foreign political contacts to resolve Slovakia's problems. Weiss rejected the rumors about an alleged split within the SDL and said that they are purposefully nourished during the preelection period. "There are no disputes within the SDL; there are just differences of opinion on the tactical measures, and we are discussing them." The preelection coalition with the Slovak Republic Farmers Movement, the Social Democratic Party of Slovakia, and the Green Party in Slovakia has merely cemented our party. Weiss also rejected the SDL's alleged drift away from the workers. "I do not understand speaking to the workers in such a way that we make them unfulfillable populistic promises. We are merely saying to them that our party offers a policy based on expertise. We have a program for economic recovery; we have a concept for changes in the social system," he underlined and added that the offer of postelection cooperation with the Association of Workers of Slovakia, which the association turned down, still stands.
