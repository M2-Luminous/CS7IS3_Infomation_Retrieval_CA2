Most of the allegations presented by the Muslim authorities, from the allegations about the number of dead (68) and wounded (197) to those about the causes of the explosion, have been disproved by photos from the scene of the tragedy and subsequent analyses of technical details by experts who have warned that the incident has no doubt been stage-managed. There is always a motive for every crime, including the one in Sarajevo. It is completely overlooked that the effect of the massacre has not been the same in the case of all the interested sides. Croats, who have been on the brink of coming under the blow of international sanctions because of their military intervention in Bosnia, now breath more easily. Zagreb is no longer the focus of international criticism. As for the Muslims, they have temporarily quieted the mounting dissatisfaction in the world over their increasingly clearer commitment to the continuation of the war and not peace talks. After the joint visit to Sarajevo of the Turkish and Pakistani prime ministers, conceived as a political propaganda attraction, failed to produce the desired effect, Muslim strategists in Sarajevo once again decided to apply the earlier tested formula -- blood and carnage -- as the most effective and efficient means of the battle for domination in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The strong inclination of the Muslim leadership to resort to the above formula was clearly recorded on July 14, 1992 by the then U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Commander in Bosnia Lewis Mackenzie in a letter to the then UNPROFOR commander, Indian General Satish Nambiar and ranking U.N. official Marrack Goulding, according to a decoded text of the letter, a copy of which TANJUG has. Canadian General Mackenzie described in the letter, among other things, his conversation with Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic. ``My conversation yesterday has convinced me once and for all that the president will only accept intervention or death for `his' people as final solution (his words). There have been many opportunities for negotiations over the past few days, which he has rejected, including an overture by his SDA party, who wanted to meet with the Serbs...he (Izetbegovic) indicated that if the international community was not prepared to intervene, than he was prepared to "die twice," rather than deal with the "aggressor." "Indications in Sarajevo point to a desire by the presidency (Muslim) to perpetuate the current crisis." General Mackenzie was compelled to withdraw from his post and go into retirement, among other reasons, because he wrote in the letter, "They (Muslims) could target us, and try to make it look like the Serbs did it." It is more than obvious that the Bosnian Muslim policy has not changed and it is, therefore, not at all surprising that Muslims prevented unbiased experts from conducting a regular investigation at the scene of the event, from performing autopsies, and examining wounds. According to the latest indications by reliable sources, UNPROFOR has this time again mustered the strength to send to the U.N. headquarters a report saying that the Muslim side is reponsible for the crime at the Sarajevo market. It remains to be seen whether an extra effort will be made and the report be published. If so, it will be a headway compared with the case of the concealed report about the massacre in Save Miskin Street (in 1992), which was used as a prelude to the introduction of the sanctions against Yugoslavia. The concealing of the latest facts, or their possible forging, could be used as a pretext for air strikes against the Serbs. Not only Croats and Muslims have emerged as "winners" from the massacre in Sarajevo, but also western media, which have again a priori and in chorus condemned the Serbs as the side responsible for the crime. The tragedy at Sarajevo's Markale market was given high priority by media, especially CNN TV, which will bring new clients, higher circulation or rating, and more advertisements to those advocates of war while they await the next media attraction, if possible air strikes against Serbs, which they have openly been calling for. It is most likely for that reason that foreign news agencies on Tuesday evening said nothing about TANJUG's report that there exists of an UNPROFOR report which says that the Muslims are reponsible for the latest massacre in Sarajevo. What a paradox. The only losers have been Serbs, because, even if they are not bombed, they have again been satanized before a large part of the world public and have a priori been charged as criminals and the guilty side. The only consolation is that it is beyond doubt that "lies have short wings" and that in the long run, no matter how long it takes, the anti-Serb propaganda will boomerang. It is up to the world public to decide whether the latest Muslim-staged incident will, despite all the available facts, including the UNPROFOR report, and without a serious international investigation, be used to launch air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. If it is, many things could become so complicated that they would get out of control. It is for that reason that the United Nations, that is, those who rule the world organization, should at least this time follow the advice of Canadian General Mackenzie that Izetbegovic "must be forced to the table" to negotiate. For as long as that it is not done, there will be new Markalas and unnecessary innocent casualties.
