This "democratic celebration of death, both given and received," has marked the history of the two last centuries, he continues. However, it is as if those countries that first invented this "bloody baptism" have distanced themselves from it to the point of considering it a "negation of their own ideals." Democracies, Dupuy comments, no longer want to see blood, beginning with that of their own people. This "fear of death" is one of the fundamental rules of the modern political contract and can be "intuitively" understood when applied to domestic policy. The inherent contradiction is only revealed when crossing into foreign policy, for the principle in no way dovetails with the most gigantic accumulation of the means of death ever seen. However, the public's "detestation" of violence and blood does not lead it to pacifism and the "virtues of passive resistance." Leaders are thus confronted by a strange demand: obtain the results of war without exposure to the damage it entails. The Persian Gulf War was a "remarkable interpretation" of this demand, Dupuy argues, since it aimed at winning without risking soldiers' deaths, not even the enemies', which were reduced to "collateral damage." The "new world order" could thus be imagined, since it possessed the adequate instrument for regulation. Since then, however, various peoples "have not given up killing each other," Dupuy writes. The horror of bloodshed has brought back the old contradictory need to use naked force while refusing to bear its effects. The term "cowardice" has been used a little too quickly, he adds, as if leaders needed "courage" to send soldiers to their deaths--for which "a good dose of cynicism is sufficient." "Cowardice" is apparent among those who advocate an open intervention in full awareness of its bloody consequences, because they know that even a genuinely concerned public is not ready to witness the shedding of its own soldiers' blood, just as it is unprepared to bear passively the image of the violence they may have to inflict. In reality, neither side is a coward, Dupuy concludes. "They are powerless because of internal limitations, and paralyzed by a contradiction no one can understand." In his 23 April editorial in the Paris weekly LE POINT, Claude Imbert notes the West's powerlessness in preventing massacres around the world. While an "American-inspired sudden burst" of NATO may temporarily erase the UN's "humiliation" in Bosnia, it will not bring any lasting change to Europe's inability to have those principles it wishes to export respected at home, Imbert writes. While the French must certainly defend their values, notably in their own country, the state cannot ignore its limitations with regard to "international policing." Thus, when this "cold monster" wants to impose French values on others, it must secure the means--even if military--to do so, "lest it offer an image of bravado." It is thus "audacious" to affirm the "universalism of our mission," Imbert continues, especially when the West is tolerating the death of hundreds of thousands in Africa, where "our compassion does not suggest peacemaking expeditions." France's "universalism," he notes, "evaporates in the tropics," and for good reason, since "the rice sacks seen on television destined for Somalia had to be delivered by the military which in turn needed a state apparatus to humanize the Somalian crisis, and that, then, implied the restitution of a colonial order." At this point, Imbert comments, "we silently stole away." Of course, he continues, Bosnia is in Europe and while European interests there are more closely engaged, it is not as if European nations would declare war against Belgrade, given that Europe is faced with the local populations' "rabid" desire to carve out a niche of their own. "Our European duty," Imbert continues, is to prevent the worst massacres and pave the way for a political settlement. The United Nations, he writes, "can do only what a Tower of Babel can, that is, very little." As for NATO, "it does what U.S. public opinion dictates," and Europe, the most directly concerned, "does almost nothing because it is a body with a divided head and no arms." French foreign policy "circulates as it can in this political-military maquis." Imbert asks his readers not to condemn it, but rather condemn "our people and our guides who for 40 years have rejected a military Europe." "Between what is happening, what is expected and what can be done, words should conform to acts," he concludes.
