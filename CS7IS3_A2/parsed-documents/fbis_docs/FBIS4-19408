He said the troubled airline would announce the figure "within a few days," adding that airline "officials informed the government after a substantial delay." The most recent official forecast was for a loss of 7.5 billion francs last year. Bosson added that the government would grant 20 billion francs' worth of aid to the company in three installments over three years, "depending on concrete results" of the airline's recovery efforts. The first half (10 billion francs) will be paid after the European Commission in Brussels approves the company's restructuring plans, he said.
