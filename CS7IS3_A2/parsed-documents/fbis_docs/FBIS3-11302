I have nothing to say to somebody who is not credible -- Salomon must respect the chain of command, Evans Paul stated. [Begin recording, in Creole] [Paul] I am not in an election campaign with Salomon. I have no show to put on with Salomon. I am taking an administrative step. It is within the scope of the administrative step that I was trying to see if he could understand that he had a responsibility. But I will not engage in demagoguery with somebody with no credibility like Salomon. What would I discuss with somebody who does not believe in democracy, who does not believe in principles, who maintains an anarchical stance, and who rejects the work of an institution? What would I say to somebody who is setting obstacles despite all my efforts? What would I say? I have already said all that I have to say. I said it in the letter I wrote. Salomon has said that he does not want dialogue, that he does not want compromise. If he does not want dialogue and compromise, what would be the reason for a meeting in front of the press? (?Because) if you cannot submit yourself to the discipline of the administration, what would I have to tell you? I have no time to waste. I have much work to do. I can compromise. I can make concessions. I can hold a dialogue, but first of all there must hope that the dialogue will produce results. [Valet] Furthermore, Paul has required guarantees before sending money to the Port-au-Prince City Hall, fearing that this money would be misused, as was the case this past December, he says. [Paul] We explained thoroughly that Salomon has created any and all impossible situations so as to allow us to carry out the payroll properly. [sentence as heard] Normally, we have a responsibility toward city hall funds. We cannot allow ourselves to send money to a city hall where a lot of people arbitrarily do whatever they want with this money, as happened with the payroll we made in December when a lot of people -- not the least, I can cite the name of Assistant-Mayor Jocelyne Sablon -- did not receive their salaries. We have state employees who are ready to issue the payroll. But we must be able to make sure that the persons to whom we give the checks are really those entitled to them. Then they will give us a signed receipt. [end recording]
