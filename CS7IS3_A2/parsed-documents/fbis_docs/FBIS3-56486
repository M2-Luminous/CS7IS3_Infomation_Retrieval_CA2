Serhiy Kolesnyk, a member of the Commission for Defense Issues, and Andriy Pecherov, a member of the Supreme Council presidium, have refused to comment on the fact of the signing of the document. Volodymyr Shcherbyna, leader of the "New Ukraine" faction, assessed the fact of the signing of the treaty positively, on the whole. Giving the reasons for his stance, he asked his opponents to reply to the question of whether they could re-aim the Ukrainian missiles from facilities in the United States to similar facilities in Russia? People's deputy Vladyslav Nosov, secretary to the Constitutional Commission, said that by signing the agreement in Moscow today the president of Ukraine had exceeded his authority, because in accordance with the current Constitution he does not have the right to dispose of Ukraine's state property (in accordance with the Vienna Convention, the 176 missiles and nuclear warheads on Ukrainian territory are Ukraine's property). According to Nosov, Kravchuk's actions can be assessed as an act of "brutal arbitrariness." As regards impeachment, noted Nosov, the Constitutional Court, if there was one in Ukraine, would have to institute proceedings against the president of Ukraine. Nosov mentioned the vagueness of Ukrainian legislation as one of the reasons for Kravchuk violating the Constitution. Mykhaylo Shvayko, deputy chairman of the Commission for Economic Reform, noted that the discussion of this treaty in parliament would be very stormy. It is not ruled out, emphasized Shvayko, that Kravchuk will provoke "impeachment" in the Supreme Council. Volodymyr Kryuchkov, a member of the Commission for Issues of Defense and State Security, believes that implementation of this treaty is unrealistic both for Russia and for Ukraine. It has been learned from informed sources that America is proposing compensation to Ukraine for the dismantlement of the missiles, which comes to approximately $1 billion. But the dismantlement of one complex of SS-24 missiles costs not less than $10 billion according to approximate calculations, and there are 46 such complexes in Ukraine. In addition, Ukraine currently has 136 (?SS-18) missiles.
