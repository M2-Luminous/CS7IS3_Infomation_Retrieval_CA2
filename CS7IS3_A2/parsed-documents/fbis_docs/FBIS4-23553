Rather, they said, their ardent desire was to return the country to a democratic rule in the shortest time possible. This assurance was given by Lieutenant General Oladipo Diya, the chief of general staff, at a meeting in Lagos last night with traditional rulers and leaders from the western part of the country. Explaining that the meeting was to brief the traditional rulers and leaders of thought on the current political situation in the country to allow them to judge for themselves, Gen. Diya said the situation did not call for them to fold their arms and wait for government to slug it out with its detractors -- the so-called democracy groups. Gen. Diya said the government would continue to talk with the reasonable ones among the agitators, but would ignore the radical ones within the groups. The chief of general staff repeated his condemnation of certain people, whom he accused of mobilizing some news media to publish things that would not advance the cause of peace and unity in the country. Earlier yesterday, Gen. Diya had addressed a similar meeting of traditional rulers from Edo and Delta states in Benin. The general had told the traditional rulers that the planned constitutional conference remained the only platform left for Nigerians to articulate their different political interests. He discounted a newspaper report alleging that the government had given 10 million naira to some traditional rulers and stated that the present administration had never and would never sell anybody.
