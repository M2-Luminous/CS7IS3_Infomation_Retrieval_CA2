After the commission finished its work, the colonel general, as he had promised, met with representatives of the local mass media. The new commander of the Ciscarpathian Military District, Colonel General Petro Shulyak, and the commander of the formation, Major General Anatoliy Kalashnykov were also present at the news conference. The deputy minister pointed out that it was the first time that such an inspection was conducted in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. It so happened that the inspection started precisely with the formation whose headquarters is situated in our oblast. The goal of the inspection was to see the actual state of combat readiness of our troops. According to Colonel General I. Bizhan, proper attention is being given to combat training in the formation. The units are ready to fulfill their tasks, although things are not in perfect order everywhere. However, there are objective reasons for that. For example, this year, the funds allocated for combat training were quite limited. It is, therefore, difficult to expect good results from those servicemen, who, for example, could not take the complete course of training due to the shortage of fuel. At the same time, there are commanders who, on the pretext of difficulties, do not do their work at all. Consequently, organizational measures will also be taken based on the results of the inspection. The deputy minister pointed out that he was very familiar with our formation and that, after new commander Major General A. Kalashnykov took over, the situation in the troops changed for the better. There is every reason to believe that the shortcomings revealed by the inspection will be eliminated. Then Colonel General I. Bizhan answered the following questions by journalists. [Question] How do the Ukrainian Armed Forces compare to armies of other states, for example, Russia? [Bizhan] I wouldn't say that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are trained worse than the Russian ones. Just two years ago, they were within the same army. Nor are there, so far, any problems with up-to-date weapons or military technology. However, I am concerned about the future. We do not have funds for developing new types of weapons or technology. That is why, in about five to 10 years, the Ukrainian Army may find itself in quite a difficult situation. [Question] At present, the question of creating some independent armed forces is being raised in the Crimea. What is your attitude toward this? What is, in general, your attitude toward the problem of the [Crimean] peninsula? [Bizhan] Both we and leaders of other states, in particular, the United States and Russia, regard the Crimea as a constituent part of our state. After all, this question is political rather than military, and armed forces must an external party. At the same time, we take into account the situation in the Crimea and the way in which it may change. The creation of any militarized formations there is at variance with the laws of our state. Well, this is, so far, at the level of talk and plans. However, we are alarmed by the fact that these ideas are voiced by Crimean leaders. That is why, if they start doing anything for the implementation of those ideas, I think that it will also be necessary to take practical measures to counter their activities. [Question] What specific assistance could our oblast render to the units of the formation stationed on its territory? [Bizhan] The shortage of housing is one of the most painful problems of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. More than 80,000 of Ukraine's officers and warrant officers have no apartments. Military construction bodies would be able to build housing, but the lack of funds prevents them from doing that. I know that other people are also confronted by this problem, but if we could get local help in this question, the army would greatly appreciate it.
