At 1605, following a deafening explosion at the emulsion explosive plant, a black mushroom-like cloud, mixed with blood, flesh, machine parts, and rubble, soared hundreds of meters into the sky. The powerful blast pushed workers and staff members in factories some two km away to the ground and shattered the glass of many windows in the Shuangpai County seat five km away. Even people in Yongzhou City 30 km away heard the blast, and their doors and windows shook. After the huge blast, the survivors witnessed a pitiful sight: A workshop of several hundred square meters had been leveled. The factory building, flowers, and trees were all gone; so were the workers and staff members, who had just been working intensely and in an orderly fashion. Four cadres from the Lanzhou Military Region, who had come to Shuangpai County to fetch soldiers, as well as the wife of a company commander, were unfortunately killed in the accident after visiting the plant for less than five minutes. At another workshop some 100 meters away from the explosion point, the workers were "pushed" down to the second and third floors by the blast. As a result, 22 people were hurt, three of whom died despite being given emergency treatment. After the accident, leaders and experts from Shuangpai County, Lingling Prefecture, and Hunan Province, as well as the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of National Defense, and the Guangzhou Military Region, rushed to the explosion site. The aftermath of the accident was carried out in a tense and orderly manner. According to an initial estimate, the accident caused over 2.5 million yuan in direct economic losses. With the death toll currently standing at 61, this is the deadliest accident in the history of Hunan Province. Emulsion explosives are widely used in national defense, economic, and other fields. Its explosive force is the same as high-explosive TNT, but it cannot be detonated by shooting at or burning it unless with a detonator. In the course of production, only when several kinds of material are mixed and stirred does it pose a danger, and the finished product cannot be detonated without a detonator. To ensure production safety, the factory manually operates all processes relating to the setting and packing of finished products to avoid collisions with machinery. To prevent sparks caused by friction in the nails of shoe soles, all workers are required to wear special shoes when going to work. To show considerations for smokers, a smoking area was set up some 50 meters from the factory gate. Professional safety personnel constantly shuttled back and forth in the workshop to inspect safety conditions. However, unexpectedly, the incident still occurred and took place in the setting and packing workshop for the finished product. As for the mixing workshop, only half of its building was destroyed in the explosion. II Was the case of the exceptionally large explosion at the Nanling Chemical Factory an accident due to a safety lapse or a criminal case of artificial sabotage? The Ministry of Public Security conducted a lot of meticulous work on this core issue in an attempt to find clues. After talking with the factory director, workshop chiefs, and some workers, the public security personnel found an important clue. At 1800 on 26 November, accompanied by his father, a young worker named Liu from the No. 1 workshop told the workshop chief that the accident was probably caused by a young worker, Tan Zhixin, from the same workshop. Two days earlier, Liu, another young worker named Wang, and Tan took some detonators and fuses from a young worker named Su at the Hunan Equipment Factory. The workshop chief also said that Tan repeatedly spread word that he wanted to blow up the No. 1 workshop. After comparing and analyzing the circumstances, public security personnel concluded that Tan was an important suspect because he had both the motive and the tools to commit the crime. To make the origin of the detonators and fuses absolutely clear, four public security policemen were ordered to rush to the Hunan Equipment Factory, which is over 100 km away, in the small hours of the morning to investigate. Su admitted supplying Tan with detonators and fuses. Facts proved that Tan was the principal culprit in the fatal incident. The criminal was a careless and casual worker. He was punished by the factory and the public security management department for causing an accident while driving a motorcycle and for participating in gambling. Later, he was refused a transfer from the packing workshop to become a factory driver. As a result, he harbored a grievance. In early November, he told a coworker that since the No. 1 workshop had treated him badly, he wanted to blow it up. On 24 November, taking advantage of a workshop holiday, Tan, Liu, and Wang went to the Hunan Equipment Factory to obtain 17 detonators and two fuses. They returned to the factory the following day. While drinking wine at coworker Zhang's home that evening, Tan again grumbled: I don't want to work at the No. 1 workshop any longer. I want to be transferred to the factory car transport department. If they agree, that's fine. If they don't, I'll blow up the No. 1 workshop. Saying this, he pulled out some detonators from a brown paper envelop stuck in his belt and displayed it. After eating, he deliberately took two detonators to a single-persons' dormitory to try them out. At noon on 26 November, while eating lunch at the food stall of a self-employed person in the factory, he revealed to workers sitting at the same table with him the idea that a person should eat his fill and eat well before he dies. He again threatened to blow up the No. 1 workshop. At 1600, when arriving at the No. 1 workshop, Tan first greeted a female worker and then, catching sight of Wang, asked repeatedly: "Why are you still here?" Catching his meaning, Wang immediately left the workshop. On eventually seeing Liu, Tan asked: Why are you still here? Liu said: I haven't finished packing the explosives. Tan gave him a hint by showing him the detonators in his trouser pocket, and the latter immediately left the workshop. A few minutes later, Tan unscrupulously committed the horrifying deed. He also ended his criminal life in the explosion.
