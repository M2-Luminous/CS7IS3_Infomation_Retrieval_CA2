FBIS3-30055 "dreas038__a94014" FBIS-EAS-94-038-A Document Type:Daily Report 25 February 1994 ANNEX Japan *Tug of War Between Posts Minister, Bureaucrats 942B0033A Tokyo KANKAI in Japanese Nov 93 pp 152-159--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942B0033A Tokyo KANKAI Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Article by KANKAI editorial staff: "Good or Bad Minister--All Depends on How Much Budget He Can Acquire"] [Text] Bureaucrats Bewildered by Non-LDP Minister Within the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT], bureaucrats are unable to conceal their bewilderment at the inauguration of its new minister, Takenori Kanzaki. The ministry has been so used to serving LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] ministers that the appearance of the new Komeito minister seems to be causing constant bewilderment over how to cope with him. Not to mention such operational activities as mail, savings, and postal life insurance, the ministry also administers telecommunications-related policy fields such as electric communications and broadcasts. These telecommunications-related activities are the infrastructure for the upcoming information-oriented society; therefore, for the time being, the ministry does not have any task over which the ruling and opposition camps have to confront each other. The Ministry of Education and the Environment Agency have been causing sharp ruling-opposition confrontations, the former by producing textbooks which show different positions on the "war of aggression" as expressed by Prime Minister Hosokawa at the Diet and the latter by taking up in its administration the position of avoiding Minamata disease [an organic mercury poisoning stemming from eating fish polluted by mercury discharged into the Minamata River, Kumamoto Prefecture] compensations against the will of the coalition cabinet. However, such is not the case with the MPT. Yet the appearance of a minister from a somewhat mysterious party called Komeito is bewildering to MPT bureaucrats who have been accustomed to the one-sided rule of the LDP's 1955 system. . Minister Kanzaki is a high-ranking official who is rumored to be next head of Komeito. What delights the MPT officials is that they have a new minister who has a great future as a politician. The MPT has been hailed as a government office that has handled telecommunications for the last 10 years or so, and the status of its ministers has kept rising under the LDP regime. For example, its ministerial post has been assumed by those becoming a minister for the second time. However, before then, many of its ministers were rather secondary in status who retired from the political world with service at the MPT as their last post. For that reason bureaucrats are not particularly unhappy about the young and promising Minister Kanzaki, although he is from a different party. Mr. Kanzaki was born in Tianjin, China, in 1943 in the midst of the Greater East Asia War. After the war, he returned to Japan and was brought up in Chiba City. He was such a brilliant student that he passed the national bar examination while he was still a junior at the Law Department of the University of Tokyo. He has an exceptionally clear head, and at a press conference after his first cabinet meeting, he spoke of accumulated deficits in posts and telecommunications activities, citing exact figures by simply relying on a lecture he had received from the administrative staff without a note. Agape with surprise were reporters who were used to the notion that it was sufficient to remember only approximate figures. Reportedly in the same class with him in the Legal Research and Training Institute were reportedly Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi and United Social Democratic Party Representative Satsuki Eda. His judgment as a politician is sharp, and he moved up at high speed from the post of deputy secretary general to the post of Policy Board chairman, then to that of Diet Affairs Committee chairman, and to the post of MPT minister. However, as to his career as a Diet member, although he was elected to four consecutive terms after his first victory in 1983 in the Fukuoka first district, his residence, if he were an LDP member with this much experience, he would probably have barely become a parliamentary vice minister at best. In the Justice Ministry, he worked as a public prosecutor for 14 years at district public prosecutor's offices in Yokohama, Naha, etc. He wrote books such as A Ban on Offering Profits. Partly because he was temporarily transferred to the Foreign Ministry, he is conversant with the European and Middle East affairs. He is thus a man of international perspectives who once served as director of Komeito's International Affairs Bureau. As mentioned, the minister has a career with which nobody can argue, and he is a hope of Komeito; however, he has constantly bewildered MPT bureaucrats whose contacts so far have been only with the LDP. First, concerning his religious belief, when he was asked at a press conference, "Are you a member of Soka Gakkai [a Buddhist organization whose connection with Komeito has been a subject of controversy]?" He quickly responded with the following clear-cut answer: "I became its believer when I was a middle school student. My parents did not get on well, but they reconciled after joining Soka Gakkai. Seeing them restoring their good relationship, I also joined it. It was fortunate for me to meet Honorary Chairman Taisaku Ikeda. He is my teacher of life." No LDP minister revealed his religious beliefs as clearly as he did, and so the administrative staff was startled all the more. The administrative staff's bewilderment began with its preconceived notion that Soka Gakkai rejected the existence of other religions. Concerning the NHK [Japan Broadcasting Corporation] morning radio gymnastics program, it, in fact, began in the beginning of the Showa era at the instruction of the MPT (then the Ministry of Communications) to its subordinate organization NHK. For this historical background, it is said to be customary that the MPT minister attends the "National Radio Gymnastics Festival" held every year during the summer. The festival this year opened in Hiroshima City, and as customary Minister Kanzaki attended it. Local organizations such as the Chugoku Regional Bureau of Postal Inspection, the Chugoku Regional Bureau of Postal Services, and the Chugoku Radio Regulatory Bureau, and NHK opened a welcome banquet to thank the minister for coming all the way from Tokyo to visit Hiroshima. This annual banquet is usually held at a first-rate restaurant within the compounds of a Shinto shrine in the city. However, in consideration of the minister's special background, they are said to have changed the place of the banquet to a next-class restaurant in a business district in the city. Soka Gakkai is a congregation of the Nichiren orthodox sect of believers. The Buddhist monk Nichiren criticized other Buddhist sects, saying that "the Shingon sect leads the nation to a ruin; the Zen sect is a demon; and the Jodo sect deserves no mentioning." However, he did not criticize Shinto. On the contrary, he adopted the manifestation-of-the-prime-noumenon doctrine [which regards Buddha and the national goddess as one body], even viewing that the national deity is a guardian spirit for Buddha. There is a mountain called Shichimenzan near the Kuon Temple built by the Buddhist monk Nichiren on Mt. Minobu in Yamanashi Prefecture. It is said that there is even a shrine dedicated to this guardian spirit in Shichimenzan. Therefore, people say that we should be careful not to hurt the feelings of Soka Gakkai when handling Buddhist sects except the Tendai sect where the monk Nichiren practiced asceticism; however, we need not worry about its feelings too much when handling other religions. There are so many religions around the Japanese people that they are rather insensitive to them. They should be careful in this regard. For example, Daruma, whose formal name is Bodhidharma, is the symbol of the Zen sect. Some specific post offices place an "eyeless" Daruma statue in an "indoor Shinto altar" and pray for achieving savings campaign goals. Because "the Zen sect is a demon," Soka Gakkai members dislike this practice, and we may say that it is rude to them to follow the practice. Minister Kanzaki does not appear to be that sensitive, though.... Need To Change From Manipulated Marionette What has bewildered bureaucrats next is the fact that, unlike LDP ministers, he is independent, individualistic, and active. The LDP ministers studied along a course provided by officials and answered at the Diet as instructed by them. Minister Kanzaki is different from past ministers in that he is a new minister of the Hosokawa coalition cabinet and that he is exhibiting his own colors like Prime Minister Hosokawa. The places which MPT ministers usually chose to see in their observation visits were local post offices in Osaka, etc. Except islands in Okinawa, they never visited any remoter places. However, Minister Kanzaki expressed the desire to visit both the largest and smallest post offices in his local observation trip. This indeed startled officials. He thus inspected the "Tokyo Central Office," the largest post office located in Ariake, Tokyo. Perhaps, this is a common place that a minister would like to visit and observe. It has modern zip-code reading machines, and one can learn how things flow rationally in the mail processing work. Therefore, past MPT ministers unfailingly visited this place. This time, too, Minister Kanzaki observed the office at the guidance of Ms. Tomoko Samura, director of the Postal Division of the Tokyo Regional Bureau of Postal Services, who is now climbing the ladder of success ahead of others among career women within the MPT. Minister Kanzaki reportedly looked quite pleased. However, what annoyed bureaucrats was his visit to the smallest post office. It is said that after making extensive inquiries, they finally decided to visit the Tomiyama Post Office in Tomiyama-mura, Aichi Prefecture, noting that the post office could be reached without taking very much time. This village has a total population of 210 in 83 households, and this means that the Tomiyama Post Office is in a village with the second-smallest population in the nation. As if squatting flat on the ground, the houses are clustered together in the folds of mountains standing along the Sakuma Dam (Sakuma-cho in Shizuoka Prefecture), an artificial lake. The visit was reportedly realized by the desire of the minister who said that "large post offices are important, but I would also like to see with my own eyes how usefully very small post offices are working for the livelihood of the people." In the early morning of 8 September, the minister and his party left the Yudani Hot Spring in Aichi Prefecture where they stayed overnight. They drove north and stopped to observe the Sakuma Dam. Then they drove the winding lakeside road for about two hours. Driving the bumpy road and watching timber-carrying trucks running past them on the opposite direction, they finally arrived at the village. MPT Minister Kanzaki is the first minister to visit the area since the village was built in the ninth year of Meiji [1876]. It is said that even LDP ministers elected from the local Higashimikawa District have never set foot in the village. The Tomiyama Post Office is located in front of the village office and has three members, including the office chief. The minister observed the activities of the post office and was briefed on the conditions of the area under its jurisdiction. As for mail collection and delivery, this post office is reportedly so situated that the mail-collecting job is quicker if the collector comes from the post office in Iida City, Nagano Prefecture, rather than from a nearby post office in the same Aichi Prefecture. Among those who accompanied the minister was Tokai Regional Bureau of Postal Services Director Hideki Teranishi. Since not even its own regional bureau director has ever visited this post office before, Minister Kanzaki's actions, full of vitality, were all the more encouraging and, at times, bewildering to MPT bureaucrats, whose stamina was no match for that of the minister. The minister and his party also observed a domed playground at the Tomiyama Primary and Middle School. This is a playground equipped with a dome system which spreads overhead in case of rain. It was built with funds from the MPT postal life insurance program. Unfortunately, it rained so hard that the dome's spreading and closing operation was not demonstrated, but Minister Kanzaki reportedly looked deeply moved upon learning that postal life insurance funds were being used for developing such a mountain village. For the village, this was indeed the first visit by an incumbent minister, and so village chief Yukio Kawakami attempted to take this occasion to lodge an appeal. However, the regional bureau prevented him from doing that on the instruction from the ministry. Yet Minister Kanzaki eagerly listened to him. The village chief said: "Ours is a small village, and so we need the post office all the more. Not to speak of a city bank, we do not even have a regional bank. The post office is the only banking institution in this village. We want the post office to remain with us forever." Reporting on the present village conditions, he added: "Please apply rays of hope equally to the countryside as well. Being a village nestling in the folds of mountains, radio signals do not reach smoothly, and therefore we cannot use pocket pagers or portable phones. The television, too, does not throw clear pictures." If the visitor were an LDP minister, he would have not lent his ear to the remarks of the people in accordance with a scenario prepared by officials. At the appearance of a non-LDP minister who actively intends to hear the voice of the ministry's service customers, the bureaucrats seem to feel that their job has become harder. After finishing about two hours of his inspection, the minister expressed the following view: "As a nation, we have to value such a village in the underpopulated area. I would like to treasure such a contact in the future as well." In response, village chief Kawakami reportedly revealed with joy that "the mere fact that the minister has visited us is enough to make us happy." Astounded at Unexpected Eagerness To Learn The minister is so eager to learn things that the places he visits are quite beyond expectations, and therefore it seems that MPT bureaucrats are busy chasing him in hot haste and confusion. For example, in mid-September the minister even inspected the "library" on the eighth floor of the ministry building. The library of an office is its brains. A library does not show the list of readers to the public. This is because one's creed and ideology can be guessed by learning what books one reads. Likewise, a government agency's course to take and intellectual level can be guessed by what books its library has. Minister Kanzaki, who inspected the library, is indeed no ordinary person. We cannot but say that he is a man whose intellectual level is high. He also took MPT bureaucrats aback by choosing the MPT's Communications Research Laboratory in Kodaira City, Tokyo, as the first place to visit among subsidiary organs. An MPT minister usually visits such facilities as NHK, NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation], and KDD [Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co.] as his course of study. A leading member of the Communications Research Laboratory joyously said that visiting the laboratory first of all showed him to be not an ordinary minister. This laboratory is the eighth-largest among government research organizations, but as the saying goes about piquant though small, it has now become an indispensable organ. It contributes to foreseeing huge earthquakes by measuring warps of the Japanese Archipelago through the length of time in which power sources arrive from a volume of radio waves. It also tackles a program to develop a system for preventing crashes between cars by having weak power sources released from the car front. It is thus carrying out varied researches. Deserving particular attention among them is the "atomic clock" under the jurisdiction of the Frequency Standard Section of the laboratory's Standard Measurement Division. It is believed that everyone learned in social science courses at primary and middle schools that Japanese standard time defines as its noon the moment the sun crosses the meridian line of the Akashi Astronomical Observatory located at longitude 135 degrees east. We call this the astronomical time. This astronomical time was good enough for our use in a mere agricultural/industrial society. The length of time when the earth revolves on its axis once was decided to be 24 hours. As it is, the center of gravity is not the center of the earth, thereby causing a one-second lag every several years. However, we have now stepped into an "information-oriented society" in which computers are mutually connected by communication circuits, and so the astronomical time with such large lags is no longer usable as the standard time. In the first place, the computer can make several million calculations per second, and astronomical time can no longer cope with this tremendous speed. Such being the case, it is said that the length of time in which the cesium-133 atom vibrates 9.192631770 billion times has been defined as a second. It is this MPT laboratory that is taking custody of the "atomic clock" which used the cesium-133 atom. NHK's timecasts, etc. are said to originate in this laboratory and the time signals are sent from NTT's shortwave transmitting station in Sanwa-machi, Ibaragi Prefecture. Now is an information-oriented society in which computer networks constitute the infrastructure, and this is the very reason that the atomic time becomes standard and the MPT's Communications Research Laboratory controls it. Astronomical observatories come under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education. Time in the agricultural/industrial society was controlled by the Ministry of Education; however, it comes under the MPT's control in the information-oriented society. MPT Minister Kanzaki is indeed no ordinary man because he chose the Communications Research Laboratory, which is so important to the ministry, for his first observation visit. However, not many MPT bureaucrats understand the significance of the Communications Research Laboratory. They "Stuck Fast" to LDP, and Are Now Paying for It The fourth reason for the bewilderment of the MPT bureaucrats regarding Minister Kanzaki was that they could not clearly understand his personality at the beginning. High-ranking bureaucrats, many of whom are graduates of former imperial universities, cannot but view those who passed the national bar examination with respect. Many of them, graduates in law, once dreamed of taking the examination, but chose the path of career bureaucrats because they lacked in both mettle and ability to take the examination. Therefore, they cannot hold up their heads before Minister Kanzaki, a prosecutor turned politician, in that he passed the national bar examination while they could not realize the dream of passing it. They are thus "serving him with a feeling of awe" (a division chief in the Communication Policy Bureau). It is said to be clearly observable among MPT bureaucrats at the beginning that they politely shunned him, suspecting that he would be a stern man in view of his past service as a public prosecutor considered a symbol of "relentlessness." What is more, like a public prosecutor, he has a sharp look in his eyes and speaks in a resolute tone; therefore, his image rather strongly generates the feeling that he is a "fearful minister." However, this impression completely changed during an overnight stay in a hotel in the Yudani Hot Spring before his visit to the Tomiyama Post Office. He held a social gathering with accompanying reporters from private broadcasting stations, and is said to have let loose and offered great service as a merrymaker. The occasion was also participated in by Mr. Teranishi, director of the Tokai Regional Bureau of Postal Services, and others. It was the bureaucrats who should have made the gathering hilarious, but it reportedly was Minister Kanzaki who delighted the attendants by exhibiting his very entertaining talent. He appears to have really played merrily as indicated by the following remarks by a leading official: "We did not expect a prosecutor to make the place that merry." Since then, he has been reputed within the MPT to be an understanding person and a man of refined tastes. However, when he has something to say, the minister minces no words and assumes a resolute attitude. For example, at Diet committee meetings in the past, bureaucrats in respective ministries and agencies concerned answered questions in place of their ministers in the capacity of government members of the committees. However, the Hosokawa cabinet adopted a system which halted the practice of government committee members answering in place of their ministers and made the ministers or newly established deputy ministers (parliamentary vice ministers) answer all questions. Reacting to this step, Minister Kanzaki started posing questions and expressed his doubt about the system at a ministerial discussion after the 31 August cabinet meeting. He asked, "Was the abolition of the government committee member system decided at the meeting of the leaders of the government and coalition ruling parties on 30 August?" As this questioning indicates, he says frankly what he has to say and discloses his course of action clearly. On this score, his reputation is said to be rising within the ministry. However, the fourth [as published] factor contributing to the bewilderment of bureaucrats is the fact that they cannot clearly understand Komeito policies. In this regard, it is bureaucrats who are wrong. It is because they only stuck fast to the LDP government and did not study the other parties' policies. MPT bureaucrats used to say that "the party's thought is...," but when they mentioned the "party" it meant the LDP, not any other party. They have thus far ignored the other parties, and they cannot but pay for it. Komeito has put forward its proposal to the MPT with regard to the budget for this fiscal year, and the proposal clearly reveals Komeito's policy directions. First, in Paragraph (A) on "the Expanded Improvement of the Information/Communications Foundations," the party asks the ministry to: "subsidize the local governments' CATV [cable television] establishment programs in order to remove multiple radio disturbances"; "plan to expedite the improvement of relay stations in order to eliminate fringe areas where radio reception is poor"; "strive to put to practical use broadcasting and communication systems in the underground zone so that people there can hear broadcasts and use portable phones without reception problems"; "work to strengthen the radio surveillance system and step up control on illegal radio waves"; "study and develop new frequency resources and their utilization technique"; "promote the practical use of the vehicle information communication system (VICS)"; "study and develop ozonosphere protection through the use of radio waves"; "enlarge expenditures for developing the tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM)"; "develop a pioneer research on highly advanced home medical diagnosis and treatment system, etc."; and "develop the communication and broadcasting technology satellite (COMETS) and the next-generation COMETS." Next, in Paragraph (B) on "the Improvement of Telecommunications Projects," the party asks the ministry to: "review the NTT's local-call rate system," "take measures to prevent tapping of car and cordless phones," "step up measures to support the production of various broadcasting media and software," "expand sign-language broadcasting programs as well as the character/voice multiplex broadcasting programs," "increase broadcasting program libraries," and "improve and consolidate international broadcasting." Then, turning to the sector of operational activities, in Paragraph (C) on "Postal Services" the party calls on the ministry to: "promote the installation of delivery mailboxes"; "study and develop a complete automation system in mail processing"; "furnish information to local residents through the expansion of the post office satellite communication network"; "promote diversified use of postal conveniences in a highly-advanced manner at each post office in large cities"; "build complex facilities including welfare installations"; and "develop low-pollution automobiles like methanol-fueled cars." Moreover, in Paragraph (D) on "the Improvement of Postal Savings Corresponding to Financial Deregulation" which became an issue when Mr. Junichiro Koizumi, former minister, was serving, the party asks the ministry to: "improve and consolidate a system for lending postal savings to individuals"; "raise tax-exemption ceilings for interest income from postal savings for aged people, etc."; "expand the framework for independent working funds in postal savings"; "work to increase operational funds for local bonds and provide loans to local governments"; "establish new annuity-type savings"; "abolish the measure to impose taxes on the interest from the part of contributions in international volunteer savings"; and "install automatic remittance machines for exclusive use at windows." Last, with regard to postal life insurance, the party calls for "development of new commodities," "improvement of the tax system," etc. Minister Kanzaki is expected to make decisions in line with these policies. Nagata-cho Report Card for Minister Kanzaki Just one month after the Hosokawa coalition cabinet started, ASAHI SHIMBUN in its 4 September [1993] evening issue rated respective ministers under the title, "Report Cards for Children's Class in Nagata-cho School." The article, carried by the newspaper as its special weekend feature, was quite interesting. As to the question, "Does he speak clearly in easy language," Minister Kanzaki was rated "average." He was asked to "make further efforts" on the following three questions: "Does he carry through what he has decided?" "Does he move at another's beck?" "Is he willing to tackle new things?" He was rated "very good" regarding the last question, "Does he act big or do things without much ado?" We might say he received an "average" mark as a whole. In the overall estimation, the marker appraised him rather severely, saying: "He is a lawyer, and so it is understandable that he is prudent. Yet it is hard to rate him because all of his utterances show his failure to leave the framework of bureaucrats' ideas. His efforts for learning is good, but we hope that he will be able to speak in his own language as soon as possible." Conversely, this means that he enjoys the trust of bureaucrats. As stated in the beginning, he has no confrontation with bureaucrats, and so it appears that his mistakes do not show. However, as a former bureaucrat, he must be aware of bureaucrats' tricks. A voice has been rising among mass media calling on him to see through their tricks. For example, concerning the issue of easing regulations, Keidanren [Federation of Economic Organizations] and others are requesting that "measures be taken for CATV businessmen so that they can operate business by leasing circuits from telecommunications enterprises." A responsible division director made the following answer in this regard: "There are no CATV businessmen who want that kind of thing. So there is no need to ease regulation." There can be no need because it is the very division director who has carried out the administrative guidance, saying that "they must not lease circuits." There is a strong voice saying that, as an ex-public prosecutor, the minister should have an eye with which to see through those deceptive answers by bureaucrats. When he develops such an eye, the low rating he received from ASAHI SHIMBUN will be obliterated. There is a strong voice of the people who pin hopes on MPT Minister Kanzaki, a nice fellow.
