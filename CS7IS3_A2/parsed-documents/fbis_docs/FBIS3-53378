It is a continuation of its previous meetings which it devoted to discussing the current political crisis in the country and the very negative repercussions it imposes on other aspects of life, foremost among which is the deterioration in the economic and monetary situation and its reflections on the daily lives of citizens who are suffering from an increase in prices, deterioration of the exchange rate of the national currency, paralyzation of life in general, and frustration of people's interests and transactions. Moreover, the repercussions of this crisis did not stop when they threatened people's livelihoods. Indeed, they escalated to the point of threatening the homeland and its people and served to warn of sedition and war--a war bound to cause sweeping devastation, falling into the claws of the schemes hostile to unity, democracy, and independent development. This would result in the loss of our cultural plan to build a country of order, law, and constitutional institutions, and to establish a civilian society based on righteousness and equality and the recognition of human rights. Our great Yemeni people are fully aware that the GPC has always sought to deal with this crisis with wisdom and even-handedness, arming themselves with the spirit of national accord, and placing national interest above all other considerations. The General Committee blessed the national dialogue and reaffirmed its commitment to the results of this dialogue. Today, it values the efforts of all the forces taking part in the national dialogue, and their continuous work toward arriving at solutions to the crisis. Moreover, it was concerned about dealing with a great sense of responsibility with all opinions, ideas, and proposals presented for discussion in all political, media, security fields, as well as issues dealing with building the country. The General Committee very regrettably noticed a host of daily acts and practices that contradict agreements and resolutions reached through the National Dialogue Committee. This clearly creates more complications and obstacles to reaching a national agreement to solve the ongoing crisis, end its repercussions, and contain its social, security, and psychological effects. These practices, for example, have taken the following forms: First, failure to return the military to pre-crisis locations. Indeed, moves and infringements contradicting the spirit of national unity and political accord and threatening social peace have taken place. Second, divisive measures that do not serve the interests of all sectors of the Yemeni people, that entrench factionalism and parochialism, and lend a party coloring to most activities, thus rendering them totalitarian and undemocratic. Third, acts of demobilization and mobilization, the creation of armed units and militias, and parading military forces in a manner that shocks the average citizens' sentiments; not to mention the tension and suspicion and doubt it creates within the military and security institution, the cohesion, solidarity, and unity of which is one of the guarantees of national unity, and is an aspect of security and tranquility among the people. Fourth, violating the document of the government coalition and parliamentary coordination, which stipulates that cooperation must be demonstrated by the government members and agencies. A deliberate failure to attend meetings has been noticed. This has confused the government's performance, thus creating clear confusion in the daily administration of the state's executive body. The GPC General Committee is aware, with a great sense of responsibility, of the difficult and complicated circumstances created by the crisis and warns against the dangers of what is taking place on the ground in terms of practices that could harm the results of the national dialogue and obstruct the implementational measures and executive programs. Indeed, they could pave the way for another crisis and serious repercussions of which only God Almighty knows the magnitude and destructive ramifications. From this premise, the General Committee calls on all the unionist national forces to shoulder their high national responsibility to maintain the safety of our Yemeni homeland and our unionist democratic struggle against these practices which are harmful to our great unionist accomplishment and to the progress, growth, prosperity, security, and safety of our country. At the same time, it reaffirms the following: First, the GPC's commitment to the results that are reached through national dialogue. Second, demanding that the national dialogue expose the facts to the people and define every party's responsibility in the dialogue and its seriousness and determination to allow the country to reach the shores of safety, as well as its concern about social accord and peace. In due course, the general committee will reveal to the public a host of facts that deal with the background and developments of the crisis. Third, any procrastination or prevarication about efforts to resolve the crisis will only create further serious repercussions that will jeopardize the survival of the homeland as well as the citizens' lives, particularly since such procrastination or prevarication would be accompanied by attempts to obstruct the functioning of constitutional institutions to show them as impotent and drive the homeland into the unknown. Fourth, the General Committee condemns terrorist practices, kidnappings, and mysterious assassinations, as well as security violations, which are masterminded and used for political purposes. Furthermore, it demands that full investigations of these violations be conducted, and also that the circumstances surrounding them, as well as their poisoned purposes be made public. While observing the serious deterioration in the citizens' daily lives, the GPC cannot allow itself to view the people's sufferings, their livelihood problems, as well as their daily pains and hard living conditions as food for rhetorical one-upmanship and media vituperations, or as a means for winning over the hearts and minds of people to promote partisan or political purposes. This is because the GPC is well aware that the people's feelings and views are their own property. Only the people know the reasons for the crisis, know who stands to benefit from it, and who stands to benefit from its continuation. Moreover, they are well aware of the GPC's bright and honorable record, which is replete with national, humanitarian, and social contributions. The General Committee views the initiative of their eminence the ulema and the favorable response to it by Lieutenant General brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, secretary general of the GPC and chairman of the Presidential Council, by his agreement to attend their meeting at the Mu'ad Bin-Jabal Mosque in the Janad area in the Ta'izz Governorate as an indication of the importance he attaches to Arab and Islamic traditions. This move by the brother GPC secretary general was meant to defuse the crisis, put minds at ease, promote trust among unity orientated leaders, and launch steps to achieve national accord and agreement. It is also proof that the brother president and GPC secretary general has a great sense of responsibility. It is an expression of the GPC's sincere desire to take the lead in showing selflessness in order to safeguard our Yemeni homeland's higher interests, the people's choice, as well as their free will regarding unity and democracy. This move is also proof that he is willing to aid our people's efforts to walk the path of revival and construction. This move also shows his support for the sincere national efforts to safeguard the future of the homeland and citizens alike. The General Committee also hails the initiatives launched by the Yemeni revolution strugglers, the Armed Forces commanders, as well as their sincere and honest contributions to spare the homeland fragmentation and collapse. The General Committee is extremely satisfied with the results shown by popular gatherings in the Republic's governorates, for they have shown an eagerness to safeguard national unity, and called for resolving crises through dialogue, which is a manifestation of civilized conduct. Besides, this is the only option for achieving progress in the country through broad popular participation, and also through the introduction of further practices, measures, and regulations that would recreate the administrative relationship between the state's central authorities and local administrations. This new relationship must produce the largest possible degree of participation in decisionmaking with regard to facilitating daily life in administrative units, as well as local development. The GPC cannot but highly value these sincere national stands. As a matter of course, it finds itself on the side of these masses, supportive of their demands, and appreciative of their good initiatives. Meanwhile, it salutes them for their great concern to safeguard national unity and the democratic march. Concluding its periodic meeting, the General Committee appreciated all the sincere national efforts made by political and social forces to cope with the crisis, as well as the Arab and international efforts, which showed an eagerness to safeguard the soundness of the unionist and democratic march in Yemen. For, this reflects Yemen's standing, as well as its importance for regional security and stability, not to mention its role in peace and development. This also reflects the desire of these parties to see Yemen involved in the efforts to build a new world order that would produce security, stability, and prosperity for it, and for the region at large. And say: Work righteousness: Soon will God observe your work, and His Apostle and the believers." [Koranic verse] Issued by the GPC's General Committee, Sanaa, on 11 January 1994.
