"The Serb side allows the forces to be replaced at any moment because they arrived there with our permission," Krajisnik told Radio Yugoslavia in response to the NATO summit in Brussels, which ended yesterday. Concerning the request to open Tuzla's airport, Krajisnik stressed that the Serb side has nothing against that, so long as peace is signed first. "We cannot allow Tuzla's airport to be opened because it would be used for the arming of the Muslim side," Krajisnik said. He recalled the negative experience with Sarajevo airport which the Serbs handed over to the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] on 1 July 1992. "We clearly let UNPROFOR know that they abused the opening of Sarajevo airport because they allowed the Muslims to dig a tunnel under the airport," Krajisnik said. "The United Nations and the forces deployed at the airport and other areas allowed the Muslim forces to arm themselves through channels exclusively controlled by UN forces." A request for the reopening of Tuzla airport -- at a time when peace and the signing of a peace plan for former Bosnia-Herzegovina are in sight -- can only prolong the war, Krajisnik concluded. As for the decision on NATO's involvement if Sarajevo is attacked, it is superfluous in Krajisnik's view, because the Serb side "is not the one strangling Sarajevo, as they keep saying." He also denied accusations that Serbs are obstructing convoy movements and humanitarian aid deliveries to the Muslim side. "We are letting the humanitarian convoys through all our checkpoints. All that is needed is that those who are bringing in the humanitarian aid do this according to the agreement and protocol signed between humanitarian organizations and the Srpska republic authorities," Krajisnik stressed. Despite these unjustified conditions conveyed to the Serb side from the NATO summit in Brussels, Krajisnik said that a new approach to the Bosnian crisis gained ground, since the ultimatum-style tone, used until now to constantly force the Serbs to make territorial concessions to Muslims, has been abandoned.
