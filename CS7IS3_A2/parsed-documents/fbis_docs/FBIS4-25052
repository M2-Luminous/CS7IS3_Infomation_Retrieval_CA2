I would like to take this opportunity to brief you on some current developments in Tibet's antisplittist struggle, to analyze the current antisplittist struggle situation, and to lay down a plan for our next-step work. My purpose is to enable party and government organizations and leading cadres at all levels to gain an in-depth understanding of the antisplittist struggle situation currently facing Tibet, to further unify their thinking, to increase their initiative and enhance their self-consciousness in carrying out the antisplittist struggle, and to strengthen their confidence that we will win the struggle, in order to further stabilize Tibet's situation and to ensure that our reform, opening up, and economic construction are carried out smoothly. Comrade Zicheng just briefed you on the new developments in Tibet's current antisplittist struggle. According to the guidelines of a study conducted by the regional CPC committee, I would like to offer a few opinions on Tibet's current antisplittist struggle situation and our task of stabilizing the situation. 1. An Analysis of Tibet's Current Antisplittist Struggle Situation This year is a critical one for the country to take an important step toward building a socialist market economic system, to achieve breakthrough progress in attaining reform, and to further speed up economic development. This year also is one for Tibet to raise its reform, opening up, and economic development to a new level. The central authorities have decided to hold this year the third meeting on work related to Tibet to study important principles and policies on Tibet's economic and social development and stability in the new situation. The meeting will have extremely great significance for maintaining Tibet's long-term stability. Next year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region; starting in the second half of this year, the party Central Committee and the State Council will assist Tibet in building a number of key projects to accelerate Tibet's economic development. All in all, a new climax will emerge this year in Tibet's economic construction and socialist development -- Tibet's development prospects are encouraging. As for Tibet's antisplittist struggle situation, over the years, the CPC Committee, the government, military, police, and people of Tibet, under the correct leadership of and the timely guidance provided by the party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, have done a great deal of antisplittist work and have won important victories. Currently, Tibet's antisplittist struggle situation is good in general -- the whole region is enjoying political stability, social stability, and nationalities unity; people feel assured, and our border defenses are strong, thus providing a good social climate for smoothly carrying out the region's reform, opening up, and economic construction and for continuing to improve the people's living standards. Nevertheless, the hostile international forces and splittists both inside and outside the country, due to their class nature, will never take their defeat lying down. They have done everything they can to step up their splittist and sabotage activities; therefore, the antisplittist struggle situation facing us is severe, and the task is quite arduous. The main reasons for this are: The hostile international forces have adopted a hostile attitude toward the socialist system and consider China's unification and power to be threats to themselves. Splittists outside the country have stepped up their collusion with Western hostile forces, have distorted the facts, have spread rumors to mislead people, and have attacked China's domestic and foreign policy, vainly attempting to exert international pressure on us. Splittist elements at home have colluded with the splittist forces outside the country and have stepped up their splittist activities in cities, agricultural and pastoral areas, and temples in some localities in Tibet. Some localities have opposed slogans and handbills, the numbers of witches and sorcerers have increased in some localities, and rumors of various sorts have been spread widely, causing anxiety for people in some grass-roots areas. Due to infiltrations and instigations by splittist elements outside the country, a small number of our cadres and workers have wavered in their political stand. Party and government organizations and leading cadres at all levels should be prepared for danger in times of peace and should have a sober understanding of the problems and the intense and complicated antisplittist struggle we are facing. We should have a clear understanding of the situation and our tasks, do our work well, and stand in combat readiness, in order to foil possible dangers. Being indifferent and in a state of inertia will bring serious and unmendable damage to the party's work and the nation's interests. II. It is Necessary To Look Squarely at Tibet's Weak Links in Stabilizing the Situation In recent years, party and government organizations at various levels in Tibet, particularly the broad masses of cadres and policemen on the judicial, procuratorial, and public security fronts including public security organs and armed police, and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet have always upheld the principle of "promoting economic construction, reform, and opening up, as well as engaging in antisplittist struggle and stabilizing the situation." They have vigorously and actively launched the antisplittist struggle, forcefully dealt a blow at the swollen arrogance of the splittist forces inside and outside the region, and made fruitful contributions to consolidating the frontier defense, maintaining the unification of the motherland, enhancing national unity, maintaining a stable situation in Tibet, and ensuring the smooth progress of economic construction, reform, and opening up. While fully confirming these achievements, however, we should also have a clear understanding that there are still some problems and inconsistencies in our work for combating splittism and stabilizing the situation. They are mainly the inconsistencies in ideology and work which are not suitable to the situation and remain to be further settled and corrected, so that we may better gain the initiative in the antisplittist struggle and more effectively intensify the work in stabilizing the situation. First of all, we should look into the inconsistencies in ideology. We have talked about the importance and significance of a stable situation for years and it should be confirmed that the vast majority of our leading cadres have a fairly clear understanding of this issue and have attached more importance to the work in stabilizing the situation. However, we should also be aware that there are, actually, some comrades who do not pay enough attention to this issue. Upon hearing the regional party committee's repeated emphasis on the work in stabilizing the situation, some comrades believed it was just an exaggeration to raise an alarm and took exception to it. They lowered their guard and became careless in ideology, paid no attention to their work, did nothing to implement measures, and paid lip service only; even if they did do something, they did it in a perfunctory way, just enough to satisfy the demand of the higher authorities. Some people even showed disgust at and turned a deaf ear to the talk about launching antisplittist struggle and stabilizing the situation. Some comrades also maintained: "We should concentrate our strength on economic construction at present; repeated emphasis on the work for stabilizing the situation will affect the economic work; stability and unity will naturally be achieved once the economy is developed." Such a perception that antagonizes the stable situation against economic development and that simply stresses economic work is untenable in theory and very harmful, even dangerous, in practice. In Tibet, the party's central work is economic construction; strengthening a stable situation is exactly the work to offer a powerful guarantee for economic construction, reform, opening up, and the creation of a good milieu. Stability is the premise, reform is the driving force, and development is the foundation; the relations among the three should not be ignored at any time. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping put it: "China's problem is the need for stability, which overrides everything else. Without a stable environment, we would achieve nothing and lose the achievements we have made. The key to our promotion of four modernizations, reform, and opening up lies in stability." These expositions of Comrade Xiaoping's have incisively expounded the dialectical relations among stability, development, and reform. The splittist activities and sabotage conducted by splittists inside and outside Tibet are a reality independent of our will; only through conducting a firm antisplittist struggle and incessant work in strengthening a stable situation can we guarantee and promote economic development. Meanwhile, only by doing a good job in reform and development can we create a material foundation for social stability and enhance the cohesiveness among the people. General Secretary Jiang Zemin has noted: "Everybody must understand the importance of social and political stability in an attitude that he or she is highly responsible to the party, the state, and the nation, uphold the principle of promoting material civilization and socialist ethics at the same time, eliminate the factors causing instability in a timely manner, continue to maintain the stability of milieu, and ensure the smooth progress of the reform, opening up, and modernization drive." Party, government, military, and police leaders at various levels should all treat deepening reform, accelerating development, and maintaining stability as the overall interest of the entire party's work. Next, we must be aware of the problems existing in our work and measures. Due to subjective and objective reasons, a number of problems still exist in our antisplittist struggle and in our work to maintain stability. Some of them are comparatively serious. For instance, comparatively serious problems exist in the propaganda of public opinion and border control. They are extremely serious in smoothly waging the struggle against splittism, maintaining stability, safeguarding the unification of the motherland, and strengthening unity among nationalities. Therefore, we must on no account drop our guard against these problems or become insensitive to them; we must take strong measures to solve them; we must guard against recurrence of similar phenomenon. Third, we must be aware of some problems concerning impurity and ineffective work on the part of our party members and cadres. Because the splittist forces inside and outside Tibet use religion to conduct infiltration, some of our party members and cadres have lost the ideological consciousness that a communist should have. They make concessions and become weak in the antisplittist struggle. We must deal with the problem in earnest and make vigorous efforts to successfully solve the problem existing within the contingents of cadres, staff, and workers, so as to ensure their purity, and to guarantee that our contingents are invincible in the antisplittist struggle. III. Take Effective Measures and Practically Improve the Work To Maintain Stability At a work conference held by the regional party committee and the regional people's government in August last year, I proposed measures for and raised requirements on improving our understanding of the protractedness, complicatedness, and arduousness of the antisplittist struggle; improving education as well as our ideological and political work; promoting development of the party and government organizations at the grass-roots level; stepping up propaganda to the outside world; improving comprehensive management of public security; giving full play to the dictatorship functions of judicial and public security departments; strengthening control over temples and religious activities; and strengthening leadership over the work to maintain stability. These measures and requirements are still suitable now. It is necessary for us to further practically pay close attention to their implementation. Based on these measures and requirements, I would like to express my views as follows which are directed against the new situation of antisplittist struggle in Tibet. We must further have a clear understanding of the situation, seek unity of thinking, and enhance our initiative for the antisplittist struggle. So long as the international hostile forces and splittists inside and outside Tibet exist, the antisplittist struggle shall be carried on for a protracted period of time to come. This is an objective law independent of our will. Our struggle against splittists inside and outside Tibet is, in essence, a class struggle under the new situation. The reactionary forces they represent will never resign themselves to stepping down from the stage of history. They vainly attempt to regain the dominant position they have lost. We must keep a clear head against this; we must not, in the slightest degree, lower our guard or tend to underestimate the enemy. All our party and government organizations at all levels must continue to implement in depth the principle of "grasping two links at the same time"; always treat the work to maintain stability as an important matter and handle it earnestly and painstakingly; conscientiously shoulder the political responsibility of maintaining stability; and pay close attention to doing a good job of waging the antisplittist struggle and maintaining stability in a down-to-earth manner while successfully carrying out economic construction. The key to the success of our work to maintain stability lies in leadership. The regional party committee requires party and government leaders in all prefectures, cities, and units to personally concern themselves with the work to maintain stability; to constantly study the situation and problems confronting their respective localities and units; to draw up plans; and to lead the broad masses of cadres, staff, and workers to vigorously wage the antisplittist struggle. In the face of cardinal issues of right and wrong, leading cadres must take a clear-cut stand and adopt a resolute attitude. The attitude of leading cadres to the antisplittist struggle is the fundamental political criterion for judging whether they are qualified or not. It is necessary to strengthen ideological and educational work for the masses. Splittist elements at home and abroad are good at covering up their real face, confusing and poisoning people's minds, and influencing public opinion by flaunting the national and religious banners and by making a pretense of so-called "human rights," "democracy," and "freedom." They are notoriously deceitful and inflammatory. We must use various public opinion tools and propaganda techniques to make the following points clear: the people of Tibetan nationality can enjoy happiness today and glory tomorrow only under the leadership of the party and inside the great family of the motherland; the splittist elements at home and abroad are old Tibet's ruling clique who represent the interests of a few serf owners and exploiting class; they cruelly oppressed and exploited the Tibetan people in the past; they try in every possible way to resume their ruling position of the past by advocating "Tibet independence"; and the activities engaged in by splittist elements at home and abroad will bring about damage to the Tibetan people and the development in Tibet. We must help the broad masses of the people obtain a better understanding of the true class nature and political motivation of these people. Resolute efforts should be made to fight against their attempts to split the motherland. Tibet is under the rule of the Communist Party and will stay that way forever. We must resolutely foil splittist elements' attempts to infiltrate into the region through various channels. All reactionary propaganda materials brought into the region by splittist elements at home and abroad through various channels should be confiscated in accordance with law. Any one who brings, sells, disseminates, and spreads reactionary propaganda materials should be severely dealt with in accordance with law. We should take quick action to crack down on severe criminal activities. It is necessary to strengthen investigations into severe criminal cases such as murders, robberies, drug trafficking, and thefts in a bid to increase the case-solving percentage, and deal out quick and severe punishment to the offenders in accordance with law. We should comprehensively consolidate public security and order, and conscientiously carry out the principle of "those who are in charge of the affairs should be held responsible." Each department should perform its own functions well and make sure that all of its personnel are honest and integrated. We should conscientiously improve the social security order in our region. All localities and units should strengthen ideological and political work under their jurisdiction, improve inner management, and plug all loopholes. In the light of ideological problems existing among workers and staff members, proper efforts should be made to conduct, in a timely and thoroughgoing fashion, an ideological and political campaign among them. Before introducing a reform measure which has great bearing on the interests of the people, all departments concerned should conduct a propaganda campaign to explain the necessity of the measure. No measures should be introduced to the public and put into force unless they are approved by the regional CPC committee and the government. Under no circumstances shall we allow any department or unit to take selfish actions at the expense of the people's interests. It is necessary to strengthen price supervision so as to invigorate circulation and safeguard the interests of the people. We should provide more employment opportunities for youths, improve business management, enhance economic performance, and increase the income of workers, staff members, and residents. Departments concerned and governments at all levels should make efforts to show their concern about the enterprises experiencing financial losses and about workers, staff members, residents, and retired personnel with difficulties in their livelihood. These organizations should try their best to help them. They should try in every possible way to help poverty-stricken households in agricultural and pastoral areas, and the people who cannot afford to buy grain or medicine. Relevant departments and units should try to solve the problems which the people complain about strongly, as well as reasonable requests put forward by them. If such problems and requests cannot be solved immediately, these departments and units should explain this to the people and, at the same time, report them to higher authorities. Comrades, we are facing a grim situation in the fight against splittism, and the arduous task of promoting stability, reform, and development. For each and every member of the communist party, and leading cadres in particular, this is a severe challenge. It is also a test of our party spirit. Every member of the Communist Party should take a firm and clear-cut stand in the front line of the struggle against splittism. They should bring into full play the vanguard and model role as a member of the Communist Party by carrying out resolute struggle against all moves that try to split the motherland and sabotage the unity among all nationalities. We should unite with all the forces that can be united, mobilize the enthusiasm of all social sectors, strengthen the patriotic united front work on the basis of closely relying on the people, and bring into full play the special role of patriotic personages of all nationalities and all circles, as well as personages in religious circles, in the work of fighting against splittism and maintaining stability so as to guarantee the healthy and smooth development of reform, opening, and economic construction.
