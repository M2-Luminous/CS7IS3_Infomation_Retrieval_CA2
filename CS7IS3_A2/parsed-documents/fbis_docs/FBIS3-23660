"To paraphrase the words of the well-known song, it could be asserted that the aircraft come first, first the aircraft, and the hardware, well, the hardware later... Such is life. We have not received our special clothing or gloves for two years now. The `clothes people' have moreover said that the service lives of the fur articles have been increased due to difficulties with supply. "The motor vehicles are completely worn out. The TM-59 heating vehicles, for instance, have already served more than one decade, and have undergone several overhauls. We have to manufacture the heating vehicles using whatever's lying around, in homemade fashion. There is a chemical method for fighting surface ice build-up, of course, but the concrete surface gets ruined from it, and the ecology will weep bitter tears as well. "It's bad enough that the hardware sits in unheated tents. Try and drive out after you start it up -- the heaters don't work, and there are not enough blowtorches to heat up the oil in the crankcase. And that's not to mention the worsening supply of fuel, oil, spare parts and other matériel for flights because of the unbalanced state of the economy. "Now everyday living. We are living in a single-story wood-panel barracks. The steam heating radiators leak. The roof is falling apart. The electric lighting goes out sometimes. Only fragments remain, if you will pardon me, of the lavatory. After flights you are so `drained' that you want to take a bath and a steam in the bathhouse. Go right ahead... 20 kilometers away. It is simpler if you are not married. But what about those with families? The children are taught in the same barracks in three shifts. When they finish, what then? The library is closed -- there is no job slot for it. They show films from the times of the Khrushchev thaw. The commissary is stuffed with scarce goods, but the prices really sting. It is difficult to maintain a family, since most of the wives are not working. There are no jobs. So the specialists are running away. Those who are a little older and have nowhere to go simply toil in silence, and endure the drudgery. Those who are a little weaker in spirit take to drink, since there is plenty to be had. They cry on someone's shoulder, and that is enough. In short, I still have faith in future changes. But will that faith last for long?" --Senior Lieutenant Andrey Skorobogatov. The author's indignation regarding the increasingly difficult problems in the servicing and maintenance of aviation equipment is understandable to us. Most technical specialists, to all appearances, share his opinion as well. This can be seen from their letters to the editor and from the materials that have been published on this topic in the journal. Yes, the situation is a difficult one. We could sit with arms folded and wait for our last breath, on the one hand, or we could ask determinedly, doggedly and inventively at all levels to see that the technical services survive in these difficult economic times, and support the process of combat training for the fighter pilots to the full extent. That is indeed the approach to matters that has been planned, in our opinion, in the aviation rear-support services of the PVO [Air-Defense] Forces. Here is what the corresponding officers had to say in answer to the angry questions of the author. PVO Forces Rear-Support Directorate Chief of Staff Major-General F. Klus Background: Frants Iosofovich Klus was born in 1944. He completed the Military Academy for Rear Support and Transport. He has served in the Baltic Fleet, the Transcaucasus and the Moscow PVO District. Major-General F. Klus has been chief of staff of the Rear-Support Directorate of the PVO Forces since July 1992. Airfield technical flight support is a crucial, multifaceted and complex process. It demands highly trained specialists and the use of diverse technical equipment. Specialists of the aviation-technical, airfield-engineering, and electrical and gas services, along with the aviation weaponry service, are occupied with these problems in the Rear-Support Directorate of the PVO Forces. The spectrum of tasks they perform is most diverse. They include those that Senior Lieutenant Skorobogatov names in his angry letter to the editors. It is bitter and disappointing read such "epistles" (and they are being encountered more and more often in our own mail as well, and not just in letters to the editor), but there is no way to get away from them. And if we approach this voice from the field more seriously, we detect a grave paradox: The heads of the chiefs of various ranks are still more worried about getting the aircraft up and hitting the target than about whose hands are "reviving" that equipment. I repeat -- all of this is distressing. But we will be realists. It is difficult for the rear-support services to reach each flier. That is the prerogative of the commanders of the aviation technical units. The tasks of flight support, including the organization of food for flight and technical personnel, clothing for officers and warrant officers, bath and laundry services for the conscript soldiers and NCOs and the maintenance of the housing and barracks stock, are resolved in those units as a group. The aviation headquarters, detached airfield technical-support battalions and aviation-technical bases, aside from the enumerated tasks, support the combat alert duty of fighter aviation. They perform this latter task with more and more difficulty each day. This is caused, first and foremost, by the low manpower levels of the units. They are at 35-40 percent today, while the amount of tasks they perform remains the same! I would add, with profound regret, that this problem is not always taken into account by the staffs of the aviation regiments, making the resolution of these problems even more difficult. I have in mind here not a decline in exactingness toward the quality of flight support, but rather the fact that the capabilities of the aviation technical units are not always taken into account when planning flights, and they are not given the necessary assistance. The crisis in the economy, on the other hand, has had a sharp impact on logistical support for PVO aviation. A number of enterprises that were producing and performing overhauls on flight ground-support equipment have ended up outside our borders. These include those producing the AMK-24/56 airfield air-conditioning equipment in Baku and the TM-59MG heating vehicle in Minsk, among others. And what can one say about the supply of aviation technical matériel anyway, when we are left without a quarter of the enterprises that produce spare parts and assemblies for the aircraft? Aircraft engines for transport aviation have stopped coming from Zaporozhye, and Il-76 aircraft and spare parts for them from Tashkent. The question of repairs for MiG-25 aircraft engines has not yet been resolved. Matters are no better with the training of specialists. The well-equipped detached training regiment for aviation support has ended up, strictly speaking, abroad. The funds are gone, as they say, while we are left with our own interests. We are putting the question point-blank. But easier said than done... The creation of such a training regiment on territory of Russia is still in the decision stage. Financing spending for the procurement of aviation technical flight-support equipment and aviation technical matériel has become much more difficult. The funds initially allocated for the aviation rear-support services have been redirected to solving other problems. The placement of orders with industry has been disrupted. The departure of the logistical-support service from the composition of rear support has disrupted the structure of logistical supply, servicing and repair of weaponry and hardware right in the field that had been operating without problems. The aviation rear-support service does not have the legal rights or monetary means to conclude contracts and acquire products for production-engineering purposes. All of this is resolved according to the "whatever's-left-over" principle. As a result, whereas in 1992 the requirements of PVO aviation for products for production-engineering purposes were only 50-percent satisfied, only 10 percent of contracts have been concluded for 1993. This, of course, reduces the quality of airfield technical support for aviation flights. Whence all of the other misfortunes, including those they are writing about from the field. We still see no end to the problems. I hope the chiefs of the services will talk about them more concretely. PVO Forces Rear Support Aviation Weaponry Service Chief Lieutenant-Colonel N. Tarasov Background: Nikolay Anatolyevich Tarasov completed the Perm Military Aviation-Technical School in 1978, and seven years later the Military Aviation Engineering Academy imeni N.Ye. Zhukovskiy. He has served in the Southern Group of Forces and the North Kazakhstan Military District in various positions in the aviation armaments service. He has been chief of the aviation armaments of the Rear-Support Directorate of the PVO Forces since November of 1990. The uninterrupted support of units with aviation armaments (ASP) is known to be one of the basic conditions for their fighting ability and combat readiness. The pursuit of the necessary measures to maintain ASP in constant readiness, and competent servicing and storage are entrusted to the specialists of our service. We strive with all of our might to provide cover and reliable protection for ASP stores at air bases and storage areas for missile armaments and ordnance, both in the rear and at the engineering stations in the zones of dispersion of the squadrons of air regiments. This is especially topical of late. There have been instances of penetration by outsiders in certain regions. They continue to attack ordnance stores. There are also other matters affecting the normal operation of the armaments soldiers. There is a catastrophic shortage of storage space. New storage is being built at an exceedingly slow pace, owing to the reduction in appropriations. Moreover, effective measures are not always taken in the field to avert violations in the organization of storage or the handling regimen. Inspections conducted by officers of our service show that there have been virtually no attempts at the penetration of stores areas by outsiders in the units where they approach these matters with all seriousness. I would like to note the creative and purposeful work of the chiefs of the aviation armaments services of the formations of Colonel A. Kuzmin and Lieutenant-Colonel A. Zvonov. There are, unfortunately, still more negative examples in our service than positive ones. They are unable to equip facilities for the storage of armaments and ordnance with technical security devices in some units. There have been instances of unprincipled behavior and a failure to perform their duties by officials. All of this is not facilitating any improvements in the matter. The question of servicing and technical maintenance is meanwhile becoming exceedingly important. I am not exaggerating at all. The very process of maintaining contemporary guided aviation missiles has become considerably more difficult. The servicing of ASP has become very expensive. Other factors could be cited as well. The old maintenance system is nonetheless being used even on new types of missiles to this day, where the basic operations are performed at certain time intervals. This was justified with regard to missile armaments in which mechanical and electro-mechanical structural elements predominated. The elemental base of recent models is completely different. The proportionate share of electro-mechanical assemblies and systems has been reduced considerably. It is thus essential to move from calendar-based technical maintenance [TO] to servicing based on condition, with the volume and frequency of monitoring stipulated by the servicing documentation therein, and the start and amount of TO determined depending on the technical state of the missiles. The technical condition of the ASP is determined in this context either using the method of monitoring the level of reliability, in which the constituent items are operated until fail-safe with the performance of planned operations to detect and eliminate the defects, or by means of the monitoring of parameters characterizing the technical condition of the units. This would scarcely be understandable to everyone, but it makes no sense here yet and would be very difficult to expand the bounds of the customary and usual. Matters are also not being improved by the organizational separation of the specialists in aviation armaments at all levels of rear support and aviation of the PVO Forces that exists today. They are performing a uniform combat task, after all. The functional ties of rear-support and aviation elements supporting combat readiness that were prescribed at various times by the guiding documents are complex and contradictory, owing to the varying subordinations. The lack of a unified command and control element or responsibility for the combat readiness of aviation missiles and their maintenance, storage and servicing is not promoting the quality of missile-engineering support. The servicing of aviation armaments, by analogy with aviation hardware, should be a stage in the life cycle from the moment of its acceptance in the unit from the manufacturing plant or repair element until its shipment for repair or write-off. The creation of the structure of a unified service for aviation armaments at all levels of PVO aviation would make it possible to eliminate drawbacks and instill order and organization into the support of combat readiness for aviation units. PVO Forces Rear-Support Directorate Aviation-Technical Service Chief Colonel L. Preobrazhenskiy Background: Colonel Leonid Mikhaylovich Preobrazhenskiy has been in the armed forces since 1973. He is 42 years of age. He completed the Military Academy of Rear Support and Transport. He has been chief of the aviation technical service of the Rear-Support Directorate of the PVO Forces since April 1992. It does not seem possible to cover the whole range of tasks facing the aviation-technical service in a short journal article. Suffice it to say that the service annually orders and delivers to the units more than 180,000 types of items of aviation matériel essential for maintaining the aircraft inventory in combat readiness and supporting the everyday activity of the flight, engineering and technical personnel and the flights of the aircraft in PVO aviation. The service performs all of these tasks in constant interaction with the directorate of aviation and the aviation-engineering service [IAS] of the PVO Forces. Experience shows that aircraft are inevitably standing idle, and that the personnel do not receive the matériel that is due according to the standards in a timely manner, at aviation garrisons where constant and businesslike contact and mutual understanding are lacking among the officials of the aviation, aviation-engineering and aviation-technical services. This can be seen very well from the letter of Senior Lieutenant Skorobogatov. Questions of providing aviation matériel are resolved in most stable fashion by the department for aviation support in the formation headed by Lieutenant-Colonel G. Kovko, who has achieved fulfillment of the plan for expeditionary deliveries to the regions of the Far North. The financing allocated by the government of the Russian Federation for the provision of aviation matériel in 1991-93 remains at the same level. The prices for it have meanwhile gone up a hundredfold or more. All of this has forced a review of the whole system of ordering, and a concentration of the principal efforts on obtaining and delivering as fast as possible to the units the spare parts and assemblies only for the aviation hardware that is standing idle and the latest models of aircraft, with the rest of the requirements for them satisfied only through available reserves and aviation matériel obtained from repair and after the write-off and cut-up of aircraft being removed from service. The situation is complicated by the fact that a considerable portion of the aviation matériel is being produced only at aviation enterprises in Ukraine and Uzbekistan. An intergovernmental agreement between them and Russia on mutual deliveries has not been signed, and the output of this matériel at aviation plants has not been organized. It follows from this that only the correct determination of the quantity of aviation units, engines, assemblies and other matériel that has served out its stipulated service life, the ascertaining of existing stockpiles in warehouses and their efficient utilization and timely redistribution among the units will make it possible to maintain the aircraft inventory in good working order and support the vital activity of flight, engineering and technical personnel. Significant difficulties have arisen lately with the delivery of matériel to the consumers as well. Some 22 units of rolling stock were plundered on railroad lines in the last half year alone. The railroad returns the money as compensation for the damages, but as is well known, that does not support the flights or clothe the people. The involvement of transport aviation, continuously occupied with accomplishing the task of evacuating personnel and matériel from the Transcaucasus, Baltic and Central Asian regions, in the delivery of matériel would unjustifiably drag out the time frames for the delivery of the matériel, as well as waste the "precious" service lives of aircraft engines. I would like to dwell separately on the question of providing flight personnel with flight and technical clothing. Owing to the lack of raw materials, the constantly decreasing number of enterprises operating and the constant price increases, the enterprises in the woolen industry fulfilled the plan for certain items only by 45-60 percent in 1992, and they have not produced any leather jackets since May of 1991. The command was forced to impose a series of restrictions for that reason. The supplying units were thus temporarily issued directives as special instructions to issue fur-lined gloves, leather gloves without liners and leather jackets only to pilots, and to issue one pair of fur-lined leather gloves to engineering and technical personnel for four years and an additional pair of fur mittens for one year. These items are not being issued to other categories of servicemen who receive flight and technical clothing. The service lives of map holders, navigator's cases, inclined map tables, unlined fur trousers and fur-lined cotton items have been doubled. The service lives of shrouds for aircraft have been increased considerably under all climatic conditions. Taking into account the organizational measures being carried out to cut back the armed forces, the officers, warrant officers and servicemen on conscript service are permitted, (when they wish and by intercession of the commander of the unit), to keep for themselves items of flight and technical clothing regardless of their wearing times, for a fee, when being discharged into the reserves, retirement for years served or under personnel cutbacks. The prices for the items obtained before 1 January 1992 are defined therein proceeding from their retail prices in 1991 with an increase of 20 percent (value-added tax), while transactions for matériel issued to the personnel after 1 January 1992 are made on the basis of prices from the reference for 2 February 1992 adjusted for retail and increased by 20 percent. Servicemen who have expressed the desire to continue to serve in the armed forces of member nations of the CIS that have declared the creation of national armies, shall turn over items of flight and technical clothing (owing to the shortage of them) to supply. A delay by servicemen of more than one month in turning them over is considered to be their appropriation (theft). The measures enumerated are of course forced; the need for them will recede to the extent of the convergence of the defensive interests of the countries that make up the near abroad today. PVO Forces Rear-Support Directorate Electrical and Gas Service Chief Colonel V. Khokhlov Background: Colonel Vladimir Ivanovich Khokhlov was born in 1948 in the city of Temirtau. He has been in the armed forces since 1966. He completed the Kiev Higher Engineering-Aviation School in 1971. He was in the department for training supervisory engineering personnel of the VVIA [Military-Aviation Engineering Academy] imeni N.Ye. Zhukovskiy. He has served in Uzbekistan, Turkmenia, Moscow Oblast and Moscow. He has served in positions from the engineer of a fighter regiment to the chief of the electrical and gas service of the Rear-Support Directorate of the PVO Forces. A great many tasks are entrusted to the "toilers" of the airfields. The safety of the flights of aviation depends to a considerable extent on the quality of their fulfillment, the timely ordering and delivery of electrical and gas equipment and matériel, the organization of the servicing, repair and storage of the equipment, the production of oxygen and nitrogen and the training of the specialists in this service. There are 150-170 vehicles being operated in every aviation technical unit, 70 percent of which are special ones. These are the oxygen- and nitrogen-producing stations, the transport tanks for liquid oxygen, the gasification installations, the standardized compressor and gas-charging stations, the equipment for electric-power supply and the start-up of aircraft, the check-out and recharging of hydraulic systems (airfield mobile electrical units, electric-motor/generators, electro-hydraulic systems and installations for checking out the hydraulic systems), as well as the means of cooling and heating air (airfield air conditioners and standardized motorized heaters). The aviation batteries -- which, as opposed to motor-vehicle batteries, have large capacity, are difficult to service and are very expensive -- also have to be serviced. The specialists of this service should thus possess profound knowledge. The chief of the electrical and gas service of MO [Ministry of Defense] PVO, Lieutenant-Colonel A. Beletskiy, and the chief of the unit's electrical and gas service, Major Yu. Tizengauzen, have labored hard and fruitfully this year to retrofit the fighter air regiment at the Dorokhovo airfield, equipping the regimental technical position with a centralized system for electric-power supply and training the personnel in the operation of the new type of electrical and gas equipment. Eleven units of new electrical and gas equipment have been shipped to this unit from the centralized supply of the PVO Forces rear support, and the UGZS-63OK gas-charging station has been put into service for the first time. Support for the air regiment is difficult, however, owing to the shortage of specialists. There are only 16 people out of the 59 there should be in the electro-technical company, for example, and only three out of seven at the oxygen-producing station. The physical demands that these people have to bear are not difficult to imagine. This misfortune unfortunately applies to most of the aviation-technical units of the PVO Forces. I see the way out of this situation in service on a contract basis and in the replacement of military specialists with civilian ones. The commander of the aviation technical unit must be given more independence to hire specialists from the wage fund, and not on a fixed salary. He should determine what specialists are needed first and foremost. This would make it possible to make more efficient use of the personnel and raise the quality of aviation support. The question of junior specialists in the service has also not been resolved. They were trained up until 1992 in the detached training regiment for aviation rear support in Kerch. The training of aviation specialists has been organized at one of the schools for junior aviation specialists, with the transfer of that regiment to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Classes could be organized in the future on the basis of that regiment with warrant officers and other specialists of aviation rear support, for example in the fuel services, airfield-engineer service, aviation armaments service and aviation technical service. The performance of these organizational measures would thus best be accelerated to the benefit of the matter. The necessity has arisen, in connection with the transition to a 1.5 year term of service, for a proportionate reduction in the training and retraining periods of drivers for army conditions. Drivers in the ranks have been trained in the field since July 1992. The quality of training for specialists, I think, would go up if the DOSAAF schools were assigned to the PVO Forces in various regions, depending on the requirements for driver personnel. We would in that case have a vital vested interest in strengthening those schools with cadres and improving their physical plant. An experiment would seem possible here -- assign several schools to the rear support of the PVO Forces. We have the capability of equipping those schools with new electrical, gas and airfield equipment, the more so as it is constantly being improved. The drivers and other specialists, after completing such a school, would have been purposefully trained and would be engaged while in the aviation technical unit only with studying the specific features of the principles of the special vehicles and their operation at airfields. The personnel have to master various types of hardware under varying climatic conditions. The advance, careful preparation of hardware and service facilities for the harsh winter and the creation of conditions for the performance of technical servicing, routine maintenance and repairs of vehicles are required in the northern regions and in Siberia. The failure to fulfill the requirements for the preparation of the equipment leads to the disabling of the special systems and a reduction in combat readiness. Additional spending is required in the northern regions for the capital construction of heating facilities for the service, and locations for the personnel to warm up in the motor pools and on the airfields. These requirements are not always being met. Only 15 of the 180 vehicles are in heated tents, for example, in the aviation technical unit at Berezovka, and there are no heated enclosures for servicing and repairing the equipment. There have been disruptions in flights in that unit as a result, owing to the lack of readiness of the airfield technical support equipment; the technical readiness factor of the vehicle fleet is too low. We have been forced, despite what is stipulated by regulations, to maintain increased stockpiles of electrical and gas matériel and a dual set of oxygen-producing station in remote and difficult-to-reach areas, in order to support autonomous operations. One of the principal problems in the Far East remains the supply of oxygen and nitrogen. Many aviation garrisons are stationed large distances from industrial centers, or on islands or peninsulas. Gas is supplied under those conditions using standard oxygen and nitrogen producing stations, and standard electric-power stations are moreover used at five out of twelve owing to the absence of industrial electric-power supply. There are not enough warrant officers because of the lack of housing. Half of them are missing at six stations, and there are none at all at two in the garrisons of Dzemga and ten sections. Women, who after the appropriate training are permitted to perform practical work by order of the commanders of the units, are coming to the rescue. One way of solving this problem is to reach direct, bilateral contract obligations with plants in industry for the delivery of gas. Even those, however, are often not fulfilled. The Daltekhgaz joint-stock company had failed to ship 100 of the planned 200 tonnes of liquid nitrogen as of 1 January 1993. We are experiencing serious difficulties in financing owing to the unrestrained rise in prices for gas. The price of one tonne of oxygen was 1,550 rubles, and nitrogen 2,450 rubles, as of 1 January 1992. Those prices have increased significantly today. The spending of monetary resources on payments for gases in the field totaled about 20 million rubles in 1992, which is tens of times higher than in 1991. The chiefs of the oxygen and nitrogen producing stations in Yelizovo, Captain A. Yermakov, in Burevestnik, Captain A. Dikiy, in Postovaya, Captain O. Pakhvashchev, and shift chiefs warrant officers Aksenov, Bilenok and many others are meeting their obligations in organizing the gas-production work successfully in the face of all the difficulties. The repair of the airfield technical-support equipment remains a problem. Two of the five plants for performing major overhauls are on the territory of Ukraine. Our requirements are only met 35-40-percent of the time, and matters are especially difficult with regard to gas-producing and gas-charging equipment. There are no subunits in the field to perform intermediate repairs on electrical and gas equipment, as a result of which the vehicles are operated from routine through to major repairs. This question has been put before the command more than once, but has not been developed. The development of the production base of existing repair enterprises in the larger units and detached repair and rebuilding battalions and formations would be expedient, in order to carry out comprehensive intermediate repairs on electrical and gas equipment. The diversity of the tasks facing the service and how they are performed determine the nature and intensiveness of the utilization of the vehicles. The expenditure of motor-vehicle resources is a problem under these conditions. The personnel are working under greater demands with the intensive utilization of the equipment, and there is not enough time for technical maintenance and routine servicing operations. The consumption of servicing materials increases, and the danger increases of the appearance of preconditions for flight accidents through the fault of the personnel. The officers and warrant officers of the electrical and gas service, despite all of the difficulties, are devoted to their difficult profession and, in interaction with the other services of rear support, are doing everything they can to see that the equipment entrusted to them is in combat-ready condition. PVO Forces Rear-Support Directorate Airfield-Engineering Service Chief Lieutenant-Colonel A. Kozhin Background: Lieutenant-Colonel Anatoliy Yuryevich Kozhin was born in the city of Kursk in 1955. He has been in the armed forces since 1972. He completed the Voronezh Higher Military Aviation-Technical School. He has served in airfield-engineering units in the Moscow and Far East districts. After completing the Military Engineering Red Banner Institute imeni A.F. Mozhayskiy, he was assigned to the apparatus of the commander-in-chief of the PVO Forces. He has been chief of the airfield-engineering service of the Rear-Support Directorate of the PVO Forces since September 1992. The servicing of flight fields, artificial coverings and complex and expensive airfield structures has become markedly more difficult with the appearance of aircraft that have high takeoff and landing characteristics, large flight weights and high tire pressures. Whereas the length of runways usually did not exceed 1,200 meters by the start of World War II, today their dimensions have increased several times over, and the materials used to construct and maintain them have changed as well. The length of taxiways, aircraft parking areas and the ground portions of flight fields have increased accordingly. Many different structures and systems to support flights have appeared at airfields. A whole series of problems is arising in connection with the preparation and operation of airfields in the regions of the Far North. This pertains first and foremost to the vehicles that fight ice buildup on airfields. The TM-59 vehicle, developed as long ago as 1959, is still in service in airfield-operations subunits. The inventory of these vehicles is completely worn out, with each of them having been subjected to a minimum of 5-6 major overhauls and in service for some 16-18 years now. The jet engines used on these vehicles, from older types of aircraft, are not produced by industry today. The new vehicles coming to the aviation technical units are equipped with the same engines, which have been rebuilt and assembled from several parts, which in turn reduces their service lives considerably. There has long been no stockpile of these engines in the armed forces, while the development of a fundamentally new vehicle with a new and accessible engine is still not under consideration; this forces the independent manufacture of homemade heating vehicles, with new aircraft engines, made from whatever is available in the field. All of this pertains to the other vehicles used for the operational maintenance of airfields as well, on which only the base vehicle has actually changed, as a rule, while they essentially remain the same as before with the same production capabilities. The delivery of new vehicles, especially with the transition of the economy to market relations, is limited and difficult in view of their high cost, the shortage of jet engines, the lack of an adequate quantity of appropriations and the locations of the principal supplier plants of airfield operational equipment in now-sovereign states. Their overhaul is also performed on the territory of the independent state of Ukraine, which often leads to unwarranted delays in the performance of repairs and their shipment to the units, also reducing the technical-readiness factor of the airfield-operation subunits. There is also another way of battling the formation of ice on artificial surfaces -- chemical-mechanical methods, consisting of melting the ice buildup that has occurred with the subsequent removal of the by-products of the interaction of reagents with the ice. But this does not have full impact in fighting the ice, especially when the temperatures of the surrounding air are considerable, and has a negative impact on the quality of the concrete and the ecology of the environment. These methods can thus be used only in extremely limited instances. There are other problems connected with providing the aviation technical and airfield-engineering units with the engineering equipment supplied through military-district channels as well. The shortage of specialists able to work with that equipment is also causing enormous unease. The engineering equipment levels in rear-support unit are currently less than 50 percent, and the same goes for specialists. They are being trained in the units, and their professional level clearly does not meet requirements. There are also not enough junior specialists for the airfield-operation equipment, since the rear support of the PVO Forces has been left without the training regiment that is now on the territory of Ukraine. Another nuance that complicates the operational maintenance work of airfields is the removal of the logistical-supply service from the composition of rear support; the procurement of national-economic equipment, tools for the performance of operations on the artificial surfaces and operational materials for the maintenance of not only the surfaces of the airfields, but also a host of buildings and structures in the service and technical infrastructure, was carried out through them until quite recently. The rear support of the PVO Forces now does not have an independent body that has the right to order products for production and technical purposes. These are far from all of the problems arising today in airfield engineering support for PVO aviation. We could talk a great deal more about the extremely low manpower levels of the airfield-operations and airfield-engineering subunits with conscript personnel, or the shortage of officer cadres. No difficulties, however, remove from the "field" specialists their crucial duties for the reliable airfield-engineering support of the aviation of the PVO Forces. From the editors: The problems that were raised in this correspondence roundtable cannot be resolved in an instant. Many of the issues, after all, cannot even be removed by the specialists "on high." But they, invested with authority, are nonetheless able to ease the service of those who are below, on the ground, preparing the equipment to go up into the sky. They need only alter somewhat their psychology in relation to the specialists of the supporting services, and focus on the paraphrased words of that well-known song, "The aircraft come first, first the aircraft, and the hardware, well, the hardware later..."
