Spokesmen for right-wing parties have indicated that certain attitudes recently displayed by the Carabineros could be viewed as signals this institution is sending to the Interior Ministry. [Begin recording] [Reporter Miriam Leyman] Right-wing politicians have interpreted recent actions by the Carabineros as a clear signal to the Interior Ministry. Carabineros used only water cannons during the incidents that took place in front of the former Pedagogical Institute, while the dwellers of Villa Francia were repressed in a much harsher manner. Independent Democratic Union [UDI] Deputy Andres Chadwick said that this kind of behavior could be interpreted as a warning, and pointed out that there are the seeds of a conflict between the Carabineros and the Interior Ministry. The motives behind the friction are many: first, the reshuffling of Carabineros high echelons, with which former Interior Minister Correa [as heard] openly interfered; second, the intentions of the current interior minister to transfer the Carabineros from the Defense Ministry to the Interior Ministry, against the wishes of the Carabineros; and third, the lack of clear-cut guidelines concerning the extent of the institution's powers to deal with public security matters. Chadwick explained that all these motives could prompt the Carabineros to send warning signals. [Chadwick] All these actions can be considered signals. I have no idea what the Carabineros could be thinking, as I have not been in touch with them, but I can put myself in their position. Whenever the Carabineros act harshly they are immediately criticized, and steps were even taken to reshuffle their upper echelons. On the other hand, when the Carabineros take no action or get bored with all the complaining and avoid harsh measures, they are criticized just the same. Their attitude could be therefore interpreted as a sign that they need the Interior Ministry to clearly establish what the Carabineros are supposed to do, how far they can go, and what their responsibilities are. [Leyman] Center-Center Union Senator Francisco Javier Errazuriz asked the Carabineros and the Interior Ministry for an explanation of the lack of action under certain circumstances. [Errazuriz] I believe that the situation is very serious. Undoubtedly the Carabineros must explain why they stood by and did nothing, but President Eduardo Frei must also explain himself. He should make it clear whether this will be the policy of his administration. [Leyman] Both legislators agreed that the administration has not defined the Carabineros' role as far as public order and the security of citizens is concerned. This situation may be irritating the Carabineros. [end recording] The Interior Ministry has repudiated the violent incidents that took place near the former Pedagogical Institute and in Villa Francia. It announced that it would file lawsuits against those who are found responsible for such incidents. In response to articles published in certain media, the Interior Ministry explained that it has not given the Carabineros any special instructions for the handling of the incidents in question. This is what Interior Ministry Under Secretary Belisario Velasco had to say on the issue: [Begin Belisario Velasco recording] The Interior Ministry neither directs operations nor orders them to be carried out. This is the Carabineros' job. As to general guidelines, the administration obviously has a policy, and this policy calls for preserving public order and security through the appropriate constitutional mechanisms. These mechanisms are the Carabineros and the Investigative Police. They have their own charters and procedures which they must follow. Talks are under way with the Carabineros so that every possible measure may be taken to prevent clashes and to make sure that the Carabineros' reaction will not be out of proportion with the actions of the demonstrators. [end recording] [passage omitted] Carabineros Director General Rodolfo Stange -- who went to La Moneda Palace for separate meetings with Interior Minister German Correa and President Eduardo Frei to invite them to the festivities marking the institution's anniversary -- explained that the instructions for dealing with the incidents in question were issued by Carabineros Metropolitan Headquarters. [Begin recording] [Stange] Unlike what some people have claimed, neither the Interior Ministry nor any other agency has issued instructions for dealing with these incidents. I want to make this absolutely clear. [Unidentified reporter] General, aren't you afraid that a softer approach will make the people lose respect for the Carabineros, and that those who will suffer from the consequences of this approach will criticize you? [Stange] I do not believe so. I really do not believe so. Because of this change of approach, the so-called day of the combatants -- and I would like you to analyze what the word combatant means in this context -- did not develop into something much more serious. I really believe that this was due to the Carabineros' calm attitude. [end recording] Asked about the Carabineros' hostile attitude toward journalists covering the Villa Francia incident, during which Carabineros hurt a cameraman and damaged his equipment, Gen. Stange answered that he knew nothing about it. [passage omitted] The Interior Ministry has filed a lawsuit against all those who may be found to be responsible for the incidents that took place on 29 March near the Metropolitan University for Educational Sciences, formerly called the Pedagogical Institute. During these incidents a supermarket and a service station were damaged. [passage omitted] New incidents broke out again on 30 March in the neighborhood of the former Pedagogical Institute, along Jose Alessandri Avenue in Macul District. The demonstrators blocked the avenue and created a traffic jam. No arrests or injuries were reported during this incident. Carabineros cordoned off the area. Their plan of action appeared to be similar to that which they implemented the day before in the same area. General (Luis Pulgar), deputy chief of Carabineros Metropolitan Zone, arrived at the site and talked to journalists. Gen. Pulgar explained that the idea was to avoid appearing to be provocateurs. [Begin recording] [(Pulgar)] The Metropolitan Headquarters issued very clear instructions: We must not appear to be provoking the demonstrators. Yesterday's incidents were resolved, nobody was injured, and very few people were arrested. Unfortunately, there were damages. We have made an evaluation and our police procedures will have to change according to circumstances. [Unidentified reporter] Does this mean that the Carabineros have a new strategy? [(Pulgar)] Of course, we are changing our way of handling various circumstances. [end recording]
