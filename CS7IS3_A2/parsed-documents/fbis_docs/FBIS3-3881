Hsu said prior to his departure he will meet with officials of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) on three issues -- repatriation of illegal mainland immigrants and hijackers as well as a solution to cross-strait fishing disputes. The talks will begin Friday and continue through March 30. If necessary, Hsu said, the schedule may be extended for one or two days. "We are hopeful the talks will be fruitful and help pave the way for closer bilateral cooperation in the future," Hsu noted. It will be the fourth round of SEF-ARATS talks on the three thorny issues since the heads of the two semi-official intermediary organizations met in Singapore last April. The first three rounds were held in Beijing, Xiamen and Taipei during the second half of last year. Hsu said although the two sides managed to reach consensus on some points in the previous rounds of talks, fundamental political differences still hinder the signing of a final agreement on the three non-political issues. Nevertheless, Hsu said, the two sides reaffirmed their commitment to resolve the problems during a high-level meeting between SEF Vice Chairman Chiao Jen-ho and his ARATS counterpart Tang Shubei in Beijing in early February. Beijing's reluctance to recognize Taiwan's jurisdiction over the territories now under its control has been the greatest obstacle to reaching an agreement on the three basically administrative issues, local political observers said. Hsu said he believes the Chiao-Tang meeting will speed proceedings at the coming talks. "I also hope Beijing will show its sincerity so that the talks can produce concrete results," he added. According to a joint news statement issued at the end of the Chiao-Tang talks, if the two sides can reach agreements on the three topics, Tang Shubei will visit Taipei to sign a formal accord. Many illegal mainland immigrants have been forced to remain at two detention centers in northern Taiwan for long periods of time because of Beijing's recalcitrance. Repeated hijackings of mainland commercial airliners to Taiwan have also created problems for Taiwan. Eleven hijackings took place since last April. Taiwan hopes the two issues can be resolved soon.
