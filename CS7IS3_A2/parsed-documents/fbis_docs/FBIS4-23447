After meeting with the government yesterday, the Federation of Chadian Trade Unions [UST] has decided to suspend its general strike. Here is Rene Dila Yombirim with a report. [Begin Yombirim recording] After intense negotiations last night, the government and the labor unions were able to sign a joint communique stating that the 37-day general strike launched by the UST has been suspended. The UST has therefore asked its members to return to work today. In return, the government has undertaken to suspend the notorious decree governing strikes in Chad until the establishment of institutions with the competence to abrogate or retain the decree. The negotiators also said that the signing of the social pact -- the bone of contention -- will come into effect within a period not exceeding one month. The social pact, according to the UST, notably provides for a 35-percent salary increase, the payment of salary arrears, and the abrogation of the ordinance responsible for salary cuts since 1992. A unanimous agreement has not yet been reached on the terms of this social pact and the country has been paralyzed for more than a month now in order to have it signed. Although the situation has only been temporarily defused, this is the first victory scored by the new government, which held its first meeting only yesterday. The president of the Republic said at yesterday's meeting that he would like the social pact to be concluded rapidly to enable the country to progress economically. [end recording]
