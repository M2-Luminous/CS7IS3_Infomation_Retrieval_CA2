The Department's Negative Determination was issued on March 9, 1994, and was published in the Federal Register on March 25, 1994 (59 FR 14215). The union submitted additional import information and the names of additional customers. Conclusion After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted. Signed at Washington, DC, this 24th day of June 1994. Stephen A.
