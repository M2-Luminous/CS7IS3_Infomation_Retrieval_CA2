FR940622-1-00067 FR940622-1-00029 Section 674.4␣Allocation and Reallocation The Secretary proposes to amend §674.4 to incorporate the requirements in section 462(j) of the HEA that the Secretary shall reallocate 80 percent of the available funds to institutions that participated in the Federal Perkins Loan program in the 1985&hyph;86 award year but did not receive an allocation for the award year for which the reallocation determination is made. The reallocated amount may not exceed the institution's fair share shortfall amount. Section 462(j) of the HEA requires that the remaining 20 percent must be reallocated in accordance with the regulations. The Secretary proposes to amend §674.4 to provide for the flexibility to reallocate the 20 percent of unexpended funds. This change would allow the Secretary to assist students who suffer financial harm from a natural disaster such as a flood or hurricane. Section 462(e)(2) of the HEA requires the Secretary to establish an appeals process by which the anticipated collections required in section 462(e)(1) may be waived for institutions with ``low default rates'' in the Federal Perkins Loan program. The Secretary proposes to amend §674.4 to incorporate an automatic appeals process. The Secretary would waive the calculation of anticipated collections in section 462(e)(1) for any institution with a cohort default rate that does not exceed 7.5 percent and would instead use an amount equal to actual collections during the second year preceding the beginning of the award year. Section 674.5␣Federal Perkins Loan Cohort Default Rate and Penalties The Secretary proposes to add new §674.5 to the regulations. This section establishes, in accordance with section 462(f) of the HEA, the Federal Perkins Loan program cohort default rate and penalties for an institution with a high cohort default rate for the 1994&hyph;95 award year and subsequent award years. This section includes the definition of which loans are to be included in the cohort default rate calculation and provisions detailing how the cohort default rate would be calculated for an institution with more than one location or undergoing a change in status, in accordance with section 462(h)(3)(G) of the HEA which requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations designed to prevent an institution from evading the application of the cohort default rate because of situations such as changing control of the institution. These provisions on calculating a cohort default rate for locations of an institution are the same as in the FFEL Program. Section 674.6␣Default Reduction Plan The Secretary proposes to add new §674.6 to the regulations. The proposed requirements in §674.6 describe measures that an institution participating in the Federal Perkins Loan program must take to reduce its cohort default rate. Section 462(f) of the HEA now requires that beginning in the 1994&hyph;95 award year, if an institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 15 percent, the institution must establish a default reduction plan. It is the Secretary's intent that an institution be able to coordinate its default reduction efforts in the Federal Perkins Loan program with its default reduction plan under the requirements of the FFEL program. To that end, the Secretary is proposing to require institutions with a cohort default rate that equals or exceeds 15 percent to implement a default reduction plan that is similar to the plan established by the FFEL program in appendix D of part 668. Any substantive differences from appendix D are related to characteristics specific to the FFEL program. Section 674.6(b) describes the plan that an institution will be required to establish to reduce Federal Perkins Loan defaults by its students in the future. Section 674.7␣Expanded Lending Option (ELO) The Amendments, in section 463(a)(2)(B) of the HEA, established the Expanded Lending Option (ELO) beginning in the 1993&hyph;94 award year for institutions with default rates of 7.5 percent or less that have executed an ELO participation agreement with the Secretary. The Technical Amendments further amended that section to provide for a cohort default rate of 15 percent or less to participate in the ELO for the 1994&hyph;95 award year and subsequent award years. This was necessary because a default rate will no longer be calculated for an institution. Instead, as required by the Amendments the default rate calculation has been replaced by a cohort default rate calculation for the Federal Perkins Loan Program.
