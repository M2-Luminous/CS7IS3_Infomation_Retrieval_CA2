Diplomatic sources contacted from the United Arab Emirates said a plan to evacuate Western nationals could be put into action later in the day. No southern units are normally deployed in the capital, but a Western diplomat was unable to say whether the gunfire round the palace of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was between factions of the northern troops. One source said Sanaa airport had been closed to air traffic after being bombed by southern warplanes but that "the runway was usable." Anti-aircraft guns blazed into action in Sanaa as southern fighter planes loyal to Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid dropped bombs in a raid on government buildings and the radio and television centre there, an AFP correspondent there reported.
