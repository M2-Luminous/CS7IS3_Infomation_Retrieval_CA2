In a nutshell, the MOF release answers the question of "who should pay the new tax" in great details while the MAF announcement dealing with "what it will be spent on and how" is full of "abstracts and ambiguities." This is not to say that the MOF has done a good job or that the MAF has made a blunder but that the plans clearly unveiled the procedural problems involved. In other words, even before arriving at a firm decision on future uses of the money from the taxation in the light of the fundamental purpose of the new tax, officials came up with numbers on the amount of collection, e.g., "15 trillion won [W] over 10 years." Because of the "original sin" inherent in the tax, the principle of "measuring the need first, then tailoring the levy to it"--stated in the first chapter of the textbook on public finance--was ignored from the very beginning. The MOF, which originally opposed the levying of the farm relief tax, an earmarked tax, evidently took great pains to find the revenue sources for it, which are not many to begin with, while the MAF, which gained an annual W500 billion revenue source as a result of the upheaval over the rice issue last year, apparently prepared "in haste" the list of uses for the money for honor's sake. There is no denying that the rice issue was a big political burden--so big that it drew the president's apology [following the Uruguay Round settlement]. However, at a time when a water pollution incident would easily lead to discussion of an environmental protection tax, it is undoubtedly the taxpayer's position that the process of establishing the new earmarked tax and priorities involved should be put to a review before any further steps on it are taken. In this connection, the MAF explains that it is just "prudent with options." It maintains that it needs to find a consensus of farmers and fishermen and their interest groups on how they want the money to be spent, and that it will finalize its plan before the collection begins in July. The explanations, however, cannot convince the public of how it came up with such a number as W1.5 trillion and why it is needed. The government should not handle tax business in a "surprise show" style as it did when issuing the decree outlawing financial transactions using aliases or borrowed names. A glance at the MOF-released "Plan for the Farm-Relief Special Tax" clearly indicates how difficult it is to collect W1.5 trillion in additional tax a year. The plan, covering six large branches, shows traces of a hard struggle to find revenue from the already limited sources. It is known that the original MOF plan focused on sectors profiting from the marked opening under the Uruguay Round settlement and on absorbing the profits as tax to finance the relief program, but that it was turned down in the course of interministry consultations. Specifically, it was pointed out that profits from farm imports at cheaper prices are already absorbed into the Farm Prices Stability Fund and used to finance support programs for farm and fishing communities, and that therefore, renaming the levy and collecting them as tax would only be tantamount to "moving the money from the husband's wallet to the wife's." So, the MOF was compelled to look for revenue sources elsewhere. The result was "irrationalities" as seen everywhere in the announced plan. For example, the earlier tax cuts for technology development, plant and equipment investment and for savings incentive will be rescinded; the corporate tax will be increased at the risk of weakening competitiveness; the acquisition tax will be increased on houses and cars, even though it could mean contradicting the existing long-term tax reform plan designed to gradually reduce the net worth tax. The unanimous hopes of the public for relief to the farm and fishing communities must not be reduced to a daydream. The important thing for the government to do right now is to try to come up with a blueprint both specific and future-oriented and showing how much money it intends to spend and on what, as soon as possible. Farm-Relief Special Tax Plan (unit: billion won) Levy Anticipated 94 Anticipated 95 Major Payers Revenue Revenue 20% on earlier 80 550 transfer tax cut tax cuts recipients, plant/equipment investors, corporations having increased capital 10% on earlier 80 230 savings interest savings interest recipients cut 0.1% on 70 220 securities securities sellers/buyers transactions additional 2% 270 12% of all point on 32% corporations (about bracket of corp. 12,000 firms) tax 10% on 90 210 acquisitors of real acquisition tax estate, cars, etc. 20% on race, 10 20 Korean Horse Affairs parimutuel taxes Assn. total 330 1,500 The tax money thus collected will, according to the MAF plan, be used for: --improving competitiveness in the rice markets, by readjusting farm land partitions to promote agricultural mechanization; providing large-type farm machines including tractors, sowers; setting up combined rice processing plants in areas where land readjustments have been carried out; giving financial support to management innovation efforts. --improving competitiveness of basic farm produce, by creating high-tech complexes such as those of glass greenhouses, complexes exclusively for exports, and complexes exclusively for the processing of farm produce. --training technical workers, by developing capabilities to utilize advanced technology and information; building special colleges of technology (a school in each province). --developing advanced technologies, including direct sowing by aircraft, new breeding, cloning of Korean cattle, and low-pollution farming materials. --developing farm and fishing villages, by creating tourist villages in mountains and fishing villages and marine products processing complexes; expanding and/or paving 50,000 kilometers of roads. --promoting rural regional developments, by expanding agricultural-industrial complexes, public health and medical facilities; building public halls in towns and townships. Meanwhile, the projected Farm-Relief Special Tax will, according to the MOF plan, be paid by: --beneficiaries of the various tax cuts, who will be required to pay 20 percent of the cuts. But the levy will not be on every earlier tax cut but only on the cuts in the income and corporate taxes under the Regulation Law on Tax Reduction and Exemption [RLTRE], in tariffs under the RLTRE and the Customs Tariff Law, and in the acquisition, registration, property, and integrated land taxes under the RLTRE and the Local Tax Law. Cuts in the income and corporate taxes under the RLTRE mean the special investment tax exemption for plant and equipment investments by businesses; the deduction allowed of the income from a capital increase when an enterprise has increased the capital to improve its financial structure, and the cut in the capital gain tax applied to cases of land expropriation by the state. Percent cuts in tariffs under the RLTRE and the Customs Tariff Law mean those applied to imports of ship and aircraft parts and automation equipment. Local tax cuts under the Local Tax Law and RLTRE include tax exemption benefits for real estate acquired and retained by nonprofit organizations. Excluded from the foregoing cuts under the RLTRE are those for state and local autonomous bodies, and for farmers and fishermen (such as the transfer tax benefits on farmer-owned land and the exemption granted farming cooperatives); tax benefits authorized by international conventions (such as exemptions for diplomats and tourists by international usage). In the case of the transfer tax exemption under the one-family-one-house program or the deduction allowed in the earned income tax withholding from the monthly salaries, it is not under the RLTRE but the Income Tax Law;, therefore, it is excluded in principle from the new taxation. The exemption for houses below the "national house" in size is indeed under the RLTRE, but it involves neither an income tax nor a corporate tax but a value-added tax and, therefore, is also excluded. --earners of interests on tax-free or tax-cut savings deposits. Currently, 18 types of savings deposits are either free of the interest income tax, which is 20 percent of the income (or 21.5 percent with the residential tax included) or subjected to a 5 percent tax rate. Under the plan, all these savings deposits are among the objects of the new tax. The rate will be 2 percent on currently tax-free deposits (such as the Worker Long-Term Savings Deposit), while small-amount, family-type savings deposits, currently subject to a 5 percent tax rate, will be assessed an additional 1.5 percent. Therefore, the current tax burden of 20 percent (or 21.5 percent with the residential tax included), 5 percent and 0 percent will respectively be changed to 21.5 percent, 6.5 percent and 2 percent. However, the long-term savings deposits to prepare for the purchase of a house and the individual annuities--to which the government had decided to give tax benefits to induce long-term savings deposits--will not be taxed under the plan. --others: --sellers of securities, currently paying 0.2 percent of the proceeds from the sales in the securities transaction tax. They will be required to pay a separate 0.1 percent in the new tax. Therefore, the tax burden at the time of transaction will increase from 0.2 percent to 0.3 percent. --corporate tax payers, currently paying 18 percent for the taxable amount less than 100 million won and 32 percent for that in excess of 100 million won, will be required to pay an additional 2 percent for the amount in excess of 100 million won in the new tax for two years, a time-limit measure. --acquisitors of houses or cars, currently paying 2 percent of the acquisition cost in the acquisition tax, will be required to pay 10 percent of that payment (0.2 percent of the acquisition cost) in the Farm-Relief Special Tax. Houses smaller than the "national house" in size will be exempted from the new taxation, however. --those who buy parimutuel tickets, currency paying 10 percent of the ticket price in parimutuel tax and 2 percent in education tax, will under the plan be required to pay another 2 percent in the new tax, and the total tax burden will be 14 percent.
