According to the president, this should be regulated by law, through negotiations with the trade unions, that "not everyone strikes and not everyone must pay for strikes." Thus Lech Walesa, the symbol of the Polish strikes, has become their opponent today. Everything seems to suggest, then, that increasingly more politicians in Poland come to the conclusion that staging a strike is not the best method of changing subsequent governments. Many stress that strikes fulfilled their role in 1988 because they were a weapon in the fight for changes in the political system. Today they are an obstacle in the economy which is striving to overcome the crisis. According to the president, the current strikes threaten the country's security. When asked by TRYBUNA whether the president's statement might mean that the President's Office is conducting work on a draft law which would limit the right to strike, especially in areas that are strategic for the country, Minister Andrzej Drzycimski stated that Lech Walesa directed the question to the unionists and to the government, and that he is waiting for a response. As we found out unofficially in the Office of the Council of Ministers, so far no work has been conducted on a draft law restricting the right of the employees of the strategic sector to stage a strike. Asked for a comment on the president's statement, Marian Krzaklewski, chairman of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity" ["S"], said that Lech Walesa would define his attitude toward strike actions by signing or not signing the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] law. On the previous day the "S" leader stated that it would be one of the last chances for the president. [passage omitted] Wit Majewski, deputy chairman of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement, commenting on the president's statement, said that it is not known what the president was thinking when he mentioned strategic branches. "Well, it is obvious that every branch influences the stability, security, and defense system of the country. I understand that the president means chiefly the power industry, transport, and the defense industry. One can start negotiations on limiting the right to stage strikes in these branches --- however, only if we were able to guarantee wages and good work in these sectors." In Poland there are certain limitations in the rights to strike. They comprise the Office of State Protection, police, the Armed Forces of the Polish Army, Prison Services, and the Border Troops. The law on the settlement of collective bargaining also includes a provision saying that it is inadmissible to stop work as a result of strike actions in workplaces with machines and installations where such a stoppage threatens lives or the health of people, or where the country's security is jeopardized.
