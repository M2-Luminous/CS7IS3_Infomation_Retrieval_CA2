Figueroa added that both foreign ministries continue to be in contact to try to find a definitive solution. During a meeting with the local press, Figueroa said the basic discussion on the issue is "the upholding of international law," which has always characterized Chilean foreign policy. Foreign Minister Figueroa said the Cuban citizens, who have been occupying the Chilean Consulate since 15 June, are not under asylum. He said this is a humanitarian gesture on the part of Chile and the situation will continue until a reasonable solution is found. Figueroa added that because of the Cuban Government's refusal to grant safe conduct papers to allow the refugees to abandon the island, Chilean Consul Patricio Pozo has urged the refugees to leave the consulate peacefully. Figueroa stated that Pozo also has assured the refugees that the Cuban Government has promised not to take reprisals against them. Asked whether the Chilean Government has established a certain deadline for solving the issue, Figueroa said no deadlines have been established, only objectives. He said that one of these objectives is to achieve a peaceful solution and the other is to offer guarantees for the eight Cubans occupying the building. Foreign Minister Figueroa stated: "We want to avoid making any explicit statement encouraging the occupation of other consulates or embassies." Asked whether the Chilean Government will require Cuba to "adopt steps toward democracy" as a prior step before resuming diplomatic ties at the ambassadorial level, Figueroa said: "At no time has the Chilean Government made such a proposal to Cuba." Chile and Cuba severed their diplomatic ties on 11 September 1973. They restored diplomatic ties at the consular level in July 1991 after then-Chilean President Patricio Aylwin met Fidel Castro within the framework of the first Ibero-American Summit, held in Guadalajara, Mexico.
