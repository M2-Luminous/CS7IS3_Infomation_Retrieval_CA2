Our region, however, is looking to 1994 with a ray of hope created by the decision to hold a summit meeting late this month between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton. Much has been said about the importance of this meeting to peace prospects in the region, especially since it will take place in an atmosphere of foundering unilateral deals -- deals which are being sought by Israel as an alternative to the comprehensive peace that Syria and the whole world are calling for. Indubitably, U.S. President Bill Clinton would not have arranged this meeting if he does not have anything new to justify efforts to push the peace process forward and to revive the peoples' hopes that the required peace will prevail. Syria has always been eager to know if the U.S. Administration, which has opted to play the role of a full and effective partner in the peace process, has anything new to offer, especially since Syria has clarified its firm positions, as well as reiterated its adherence to peace and its refusal to relinquish any right. This prompts many in the region, and throughout the world, to pin great hopes on the results of this summit. Many also fear, at the same time, that intrigues may be contrived before and during this summit to hamper efforts to reach such results. This, in fact, explains the expectations being spread these days that Israel may fabricate incidents, create tension before the summit, and prevent the realization of the hopes pinned to it. Everyone knows that Israel will not be pleased to see efforts to strengthen relations between Syria and the United States or efforts to activate the U.S. role in achieving what Washington has committed itself to in accordance with the initiative it launched in Madrid, namely, the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace in accordance with the resolutions of the international legitimacy and the land-for-peace principle. Everyone also knows the identity of those who are launching a feverish campaign against Syria, as well as the lies that these sides, which are known for their loyalty to Israel and the Zionist circles, are spreading against Syria in order to distort its reputation and affect world public opinion. They are particularly interested in damaging U.S. public opinion, which has begun to show more understanding of Syria's positions, its seriousness about peace, and its eagerness to establish peace on firm bases that will perpetuate the peace. This cannot be achieved without the comprehensive and just approach that Syria has been stressing. These sides have been spreading their poisons since the summit was announced. The beginning of the campaign appeared in the questions journalists posed to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher when he announced the planned summit during a news conference in Damascus. The Syrian foreign minister described the questions at that time as prefabricated, and Christopher refused to answer them. In light of the failure of that campaign, which, as we have said, is backed by Israel and the supporters of its deception abroad, and amid the confusion and failure of unilateral deals, we are seeing expectations and fears that Israel and its supporters may resort to more wicked and effective ways to fabricate problems and create tension in the region in order to block the ray of hope emanating from the upcoming Syrian-American summit. By this, we do not want to overestimate Israel's capability and potential. However, paying attention to such possibilities will certainly help contain them and deprive Israel of any chance. Israel appears determined to continue its policy, which has proven to be a total failure, and to abort the great prospects that the Syrian-American summit will provide by opening the door for a just and comprehensive peace in the region.
