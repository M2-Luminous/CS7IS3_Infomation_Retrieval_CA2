FBIS4-4562 "dreas064__a94013" FBIS-EAS-94-064-A Daily Report 2 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Tokyo `Welcomed' UNSC Statement on DPRK Tokyo `Welcomed' UNSC Statement on DPRK OW0204145094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 2 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0204145094 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Unattributed article: "Government Feels Relieved by UNSC's Statement To Continue To Persuade North Korea"] [Text] As for the issue of the DPRK's suspected nuclear weapons development program, the UN Security Council [UNSC] adopted the chairman's statement to seek the complete carrying out of nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In this regard, the Japanese Government welcomed the decision, saying that the "international community was able to express its strong determination to North Korea" (according to a senior Foreign Ministry official). There was a possibility that Japan would be forced to make a hard decision if the UNSC adopted a resolution to impose economic sanctions on the DPRK. Because of this, the government was relieved by the statement, which was designed to continue to persuade North Korea. Japan Holds Ministerial Meetings One After Another To Exchange Views With the United States and South Korea In positively evaluating the fact that the UNSC member states, including China, unanimously approved the chairman's statement which was designed to demand that North Korea accept the resumption of nuclear inspections, Japan will cooperate with the United Nations in strengthening pressure on North Korea to accept inspections. Although the chairman's statement does not specify a deadline for accepting the IAEA's inspections, the Foreign Ministry understands that "it will be done in accordance with a report that the IAEA director general submitted to the Security Council on 22 March" and that the UNSC indirectly demanded that North Korea "accept a reinspection within about six weeks," as the same report states. A Foreign Ministry source said, "Perhaps North Korea also understands that around mid-April is the deadline." China is the key to North Korea's agreement. The Foreign Ministry analyzes the situation by saying: "Now that China has agreed with the chairman's statement, we have laid the groundwork to work on China to make North Korea respond in a positive manner. In this sense, China was given a heavy task." South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will come to Japan on 3 April. U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry and South Korean Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae will visit Japan in late April. During the series of visits, the three countries will demonstrate their cooperative ties to indirectly urge North Korea to accept the inspections. Many Obstacles in Supporting the U.S. Military Government officials are studying the measures that Japan can take on the supposition that the UNSC approves economic sanctions against North Korea and the so-called naval blockade. The reality is that they are still discussing the issue of revising the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] Act to enable Japan to send SDF aircraft during emergencies to rescue Japanese living abroad. It seems that Japan has no choice but to adopt concrete measures to deal with the situation if the naval blockade becomes a reality. The Maritime Safety Agency will respond first if the UNSC decides to impose a naval blockade on North Korea. It is possible for SDF vessels to patrol within Japanese territorial waters if the Defense Agency director general, after obtaining approval from the prime minister, instructs them to take "action to patrol the sea" in accordance with Article 82 of the SDF Act. It is generally believed that Japan cannot take further actions "because the right of collective self-defense is involved." The issue of logistical support for military vessels of the United States and other countries is also a focal point. The Defense Agency thinks that, under current laws, Japan cannot supply fuel to U.S. warships, for example. To supply fuel to U.S. warships, Japan must sign an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement with the United States and to revise the SDF Act. As for logistical support, some people think that the "scale of cooperation that Japan will be able to provide depends on the wording of a UN resolution regarding sanctions and on the trend of public opinion." Because of this, it seems that Japan will choose "the most suitable method" of the following three choices: 1) to introduce a new law similar to the UN Peacekeeping Law, which was discarded during the Kaifu administration; 2) to revise laws such as the SDF Act; and 3) to interpret the current laws to meet the circumstances. Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Plays Central Role in Forming Strategies The government and the ruling parties feel a sense of crisis over the DPRK issue. However, no prospect is in sight for starting Diet deliberations on a draft budget for fiscal year 1994. In addition, they have to deal with the issue of Prime Minister Hosokawa's loan from the Sagawa Kyubin firm. They are far from working out carefully thought-out arrangements. Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishihara summoned the responsible officials of each ministry and agency to the prime minister's official residence to talk about measures that Japan can take if the UNSC decides to impose economic sanctions on North Korea. However, it is said that they are still "sorting out measures which it is possible to take" (according to a government source). Some bureaucrats at Kasumigaseki are beginning to doubt the Hosokawa administration's crisis-management capabilities, asking, "Will the administration, which lacks centripetal force, be able to make political decisions?"
