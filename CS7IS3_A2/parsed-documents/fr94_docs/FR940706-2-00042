SUMMARY: In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and comment. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected cost and burden. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before August 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For further information or to obtain a copy of this ICR contract Sandy Farmer at EPA, (202) 260&hyph;2740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: . Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response Title: Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plans (EPA No. 0328.04; OMB No. 2050&hyph;0021). Abstract: This ICR is an extension of an existing collection for Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) planning requirements in support of the Clean Water Act at paragraph (1) Section 311 (j), and described at 40 CFR 112. The information will be used by the EPA to ensure that oil spill prevention planning occurs, thereby ensuring compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR 112. Under this ICR, owners or operators of affected facilities must: (1) Prepare the SPCC plan (40 CFR 112.3 and 112.7), (2) maintain the plan and appropriate records (40 CFR 112.3 and 112.7(e)) if they begin operations or significantly modify their facilities during the approval period, (3) submit the plan in the event of certain discharges of oil (40 CFR 112.4), (4) revise the plan following modification of the facility (40 CFR 112.5(a)), and (5) conduct a triennial review of the SPCC plan (40 CFR 112(b)). The SPCC plan should describe: (1) possible equipment failures that could lead to a discharge of oil from the facility (40 CFR 112.7(b)); (2) the use of required preventive measures such as appropriate containment and/or diversion structures or equipment (40 CFR 112.7(c)), or if containment is not available, an oil spill contingency plan and a written commitment of manpower, equipment and materials required to expeditiously control and remove any harmful quantity of oil discharged (40 CFR 112.7(d)); and (3) a discussion of the more detailed planning requirements (40 CFR 112.7(c)). In addition to these general requirements, onshore facilities must maintain records of maintenance and usage of bypass valves and comparison records on past inspections of aboveground storage tanks. Offshore facilities must maintain written procedures for inspecting and testing pollution prevention equipment, keep records of well shut-in valves, prepare written instructions for contractors and subcontractors, and maintain records of inspection of submarine pipelines. Currently there are 450,360 facilities subject to this regulation, with an estimated increase in the regulated universe of 4,549 facilities per year over the next three years. Facility records related to compliance must be maintained for three years. Burden Statement: Public reporting burden for new facilities subject to this collection of information is estimated to range between 39.6 and 100.6 hours per response, with an average of 40.5 hours including time for reviewing the Oil Pollution Prevention regulations, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining data, and preparing and reviewing the SPCC plan. The annual recordkeeping burden for existing facilities is estimated to range from 5.0 to 13.9 hours per respondent, with an average recordkeeping burden of 5.5 hours including time for maintaining. reviewing and updating the SPCC plan. Respondents: Owners or operators of subject facilities as defined at 40 CFR 112. Estimated Number of Respondents: 4,549 new facilities will be required to prepare a plan; an annual average of 454,878 existing facilities over the next three years will be required to maintain records and submit amendments as needed. Estimated Number of Responses Per Respondent: 1. Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 2,662,506 hours. Frequency of Collection: On occasion (as described at 40 CFR 112.4). Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to: Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (21346), 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. and Jonathan Gledhill, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 725 17th St., NW., Washington, DC 20503.
