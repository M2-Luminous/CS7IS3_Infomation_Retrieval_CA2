Indeed, the things are clear even without any clarifications, because the basic theses that the president recently expressed in London continue to specifically express the same thoughts of his he has been trying to impose on our public in the last few months. According to Zhelyu Zhelev it is not the prime minister, Lyuben Berov, who is sick, but rather the Bulgarian Government and the formula on which it is based. Therefore, according to him, it is necessary to change the formula, find a new parliamentary configuration, or go to new elections by the end of the year. He even warned the sovereign Bulgarian voter not to reach out for the red ballot, because if the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] wins the elections it would not know what to do with this victory and could not succeed to form a government. If those words would have been uttered by another Bulgarian citizen, public figure, or deputy, they would have hardly impressed anyone. Under conditions of political pluralism everyone has the right to an opinion, and the rest can agree or disagree with this opinion. This applies to everyone but the president. Assuming the grave constitutional burden of personifying the unity of the nation, he also assumes the commitment to the people to limit his public statements to the framework of those strictly defined functions and obligations which the constitution prescribes. He does not have the right to jabber everything that comes to his mind, because every word he publicly utters has a political effect which also is the subject of constitutional assessment. What is disturbing in Zhelyu Zhelev's London revelations? First of all the fact that the president allows himself to determine the date of eventual early elections and engage in reshaping the parliamentary configuration, despite the fact that all this is not a part of his constitutional prerogatives. In this case Zhelev crudely and unceremoniously interfered with the prerogatives of the parliament and the parliamentary forces, which are the only ones empowered by the people to assess the cabinet, approve its composition and policy, and determine its fate. In this case I do not mean to defend the government and its policy, but defend the fundamental and constitutional principles of a parliamentary and not a presidential republic. In this republic the president only has the right of setting new elections if the parliament fails to form a cabinet, rather than the right of expressing an opinion whether there should be new elections and when should they take place, while the hypothetical situation described in detail in the constitution, which allows him to do this, does not exist. It also is scandalous that the president finds it possible to call his country's cabinet a sick cabinet, and declare the country's legislative and executive powers provisional powers at a moment when difficult and delicate negotiations are being conducted with foreign governments, international institutions, and commercial banks, and decisions of fateful importance for the national economy and the future of the reforms in Bulgaria must be adopted. This is not only a violation of the constitution, but also an act that contradicts Bulgaria's interests. This reminds one very much of 1990, when the political configuration led by Zhelyu Zhelev was prepared to destroy the civic peace in the country in order to prevent the successful completion of the negotiations which the government at that time conducted with the international financial institutions and the Western partners. Now Zhelyu Zhelev decided to speak in London -- one of the world's basic financial centers, and thus ensure maximum response to his suggestions. For some time already Zhelyu Zhelev usurps the right of evaluating one of the legitimate political and parliamentary forces in Bulgaria, supported by no less than one-third of the country's mature citizens. This testifies not only to the lack of political and civic culture, but also to an insurmountable prejudice, which obviously contradicts Zhelev's claim to be the president of all Bulgarians. Instead of reading lectures abroad on the topic of tolerance, the president should grasp his constitutional duties and understand that he could implement his functions of an honest arbiter and guarantor of national unity only if he equally respects all public forces and conducts a tolerant and equal dialogue with them, while at the same time he does not forget even for a moment the limits of his rights and prerogatives. Otherwise he could turn, and indeed he already has turned into a factor of public destabilization and national division. If he heads along this way he alone would relinquish the responsible role that the constitution assigns to him. I would like to stress again that those infringements of the Constitution are not an accidental matter. They outline a consistent and insistent line of the president, which becomes ever more a threat to the constitutional order in Bulgaria. I will remind the readers of Zhelev's claim that the specific character of the transitional period in the postsocialist states justifies the establishment of a presidential rule. Thus those states would have faced the serious threat of restoring authoritarianism. Let me also remind the readers of his anticonstitutional interference in the progress of the agrarian reform, whose essence it was to restrict "from the top" the rights of the owners of the agrarian land and maximally extend the life of the liquidation councils, despite their lethal effect on the national economy and the normal supply of the people with acceptably priced foodstuffs. We would hardly forget soon the other anticonstitutional act of the president -- his attempt to create parallel structures to lead the Armed Forces outside the legitimate structures envisaged by the basic law, and as a counterbalance to those legitimate structures. Without claiming that we mentioned everything, we could not ignore his comment on the upcoming extraordinary elections, which he made for the national mass media after visiting Professor Berov in the hospital. In addition to its anticonstitutional character, this comment also impressed with its lack of political tact and elementary human ethic. Those are grave words and harsh conclusions, but the president must hear them, also because his post involves special moral, political, and constitutional responsibilities, and because in the final analysis, we are discussing here the fundamental rules and principles of democracy and the democratic public culture. There was a moment during the president's term of office when the hope emerged that Zhelyu Zhelev would overcome his political bias and would really assert himself as the president of the entire nation, as a uniting figure capable of contributing to overcoming confrontation and asserting civilized social habits. Unfortunately, the last public statements of the president are far from those expectations. His thesis regarding him being a "president of the transition period" is also insolvent. Obviously, this thesis justifies in his own eyes and the eyes of his advisers his recent and repeated liberties with the constitution. There is not and cannot be a "president of the transition period." We have a legally elected president of the Republic of Bulgaria, whose functions and rights are clearly spelled out in Chapter 4 of the Bulgarian Constitution. If Zhelyu Zhelev does not want to comply with the text of the Constitution by which he was sworn in, the National Assembly would have no other choice except invoking Article 103 of the Bulgarian Constitution, which envisages the procedure of terminating the presidential mandate ahead of time.
