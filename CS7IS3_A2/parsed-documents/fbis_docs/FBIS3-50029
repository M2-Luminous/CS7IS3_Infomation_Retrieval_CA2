The Saturday [15 January] session resulted in considerable weakening of the position of SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak, after his party rivals headed by Slovak Deputy Premiers Marian Andel and Jozef Prokes pushed through the dismissal of the present party leadership. The chairman himself (Cernak) remains in the post. In its resolution the meeting expressed disquiet about SNS disintegration "at the time when Hungarian irredentists jeopardize our country's integrity in south Slovakia." SNS First Deputy Chairman Igor Uhrik resigned from his post at the meeting, while Cernak was expressed no confidence and asked to resign, and Deputy Chairmen Anton Hrnko, Andrej Findo, Jan Hurny, Anna Malikova, and Central Secretary Jozef Hrabina were dismissed. The Council rejected the split of the present SNS parliamentary group of deputies by the establishment of the National Democratic Group, and asked the six deputies of this group headed by Cernak to rejoin the "only legitimate" SNS group (now comprising 8 members) or to offer their resignation from their deputies' posts so that they can be replaced by other SNS members. The Central Council charged Cernak, Andel, Prokes, and Miloslav Kona, chairman of the SNS Group of Deputies, to held talks with the SNS coalition partner, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). So far it has been only Cernak who has negotiated with the Premier Vladimir Meciar-led HZDS. A press conference which took place in the night only confirmed the controversies between the SNS two factions over the further functioning of the HZDS-SNS government coalition, and the future identity of the SNS. Prokes criticized Cernak's leadership for behaving alternately as coalition and opposition body, which impaired the image of Slovakia's stability abroad. Cernak expressed his reservations about the so far functioning of the government coalition.
