Some twenty journalists, including correspondents of the leading U.S. newspapers questioned Kwasniewski about the situation in Poland, his attitude to President Lech Walesa, Poland's strivings to join NATO and his views on Russia. Kwasniewski declared that Poland is a politically stable country of a mature democracy, in which ruling teams change but the main elements of implemented reforms remain unchanged. He pointed to the development of market economy in Poland and its openness to the world. He also stressed that there is a consensus among Poland's main parties as to the basic principles which should be included in the future constitution. The SLD leader criticized the Solidarity trade union for the present strike action. He said that Solidarity is using frustration and disappointment for political purposes which can be dangerous for Poland. "Solidarity is trying in this way to return to the political scene after (...) its defeat in the parliamentary elections," he said. Kwasniewski declared that Poland wants to become full member of NATO and added that he shares the opinion of Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott that the "Partnership for Peace" should be the road leading Central European countries to NATO. He stressed that Poland's efforts to join NATO are being wrongly interpreted by Russia as an attempt to form a bloc directed against that country. "We want to cooperate with Russia and we want to have the best possible relations with it," he stated. Asked for his opinion about President Lech Walesa, the SLD chairman stressed that although there are many differences between his party and the president "we share the great responsibility for Poland and we have to jointly find some compromise." Kwasniewski criticised the president for wasting the chance of "strategic changes" instead of concentrating on many detailed issues. In his opinion the president in Poland should have a position strong enough to be able to act in time of crisis. He thought that the American model of presidency is not possible in Poland. Kwasniewski is staying in the United States with a delegation of Polish parliamentarians. On Tuesday, the delegation met with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, held talks in the Congress and met with the Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia. On Wednesday, the Polish parliamentarians met with influential Democratic Senator Paul Simon of Illinois and on Thursday they are to meet with Ambassador Richard Shifter, director for East European affairs in the Presidential National Security Council.
