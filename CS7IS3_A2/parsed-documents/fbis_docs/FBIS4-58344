The five-day fair is organized by the Iraqi Agricultural Engineers Association at the Baghdad International Fair. Taha Yasin Ramadan delivered a speech on the occasion. He said the contribution of the Arab brothers to this fair expresses their siding with their Iraqi brothers who are facing a brutal aggression, led by the United States, represented in the continuation of the unjust blockade, after the U.S. dreams to undermine Iraq through its savage military aggression vanished in thin air. Taha Yasin Ramadan said the Arab fair for agricultural and irrigation technology and food and medicine industry has exceptional importance under the current circumstances. It is also an important step to thwart colonialist policies that use food as a weapon against nations. The participation of Arab and foreign companies specialized in all fields of agricultural production is a practical method to stand in the face of the forces of evil and aggression.
