It was said that he would discuss with John Major and Douglas Hurd the issue of setting up a "Human Rights Committee," as proposed by the report of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the British Parliament. This shows that Patten is going further and further along the course of confrontation. He has not only ripped up the rails for convergence with the Basic law and tried to unilaterally set up a political structure and impose it on the government of the Special Administrative Region [SAR] beyond 1997, but also plans to set the time bomb of a "human rights committee," revise a series of laws in Hong Kong, and broaden the room for maneuver for international forces in an attempt to create discord, turmoil, and confrontation after 1997. Patten's "three violations" are aimed at establishing a pro-British and anti-China political body in Hong Kong and then imposing it on the SAR. The plan for establishing a human rights committee is also aimed at resisting China's sovereign power, expanding the room for political maneuver, introducing international political forces into Hong Kong, and thus turning Hong Kong into a "political city." In this way, Britain may continue to control Hong Kong's politics in reality after it returns Hong Kong to China nominally. The report of the British Parliament "proposed" that the Hong Kong Government set up a "human rights committee" and a "human rights supervision organ" before 1997 so that they might continue to exert international pressure on China after 1997 through "joint supervision over the development of the human rights situation in Hong Kong after 1997" by the British Government and the UN Human Rights Committee. China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as of 1 July 1997. Britain has no right to influence anything on China's territory and within the scope of China's internal affairs, still less can it exercise any "supervision" over Hong Kong affairs through a so-called human rights committee. In addition to the attempt to maintain its influence in Hong Kong, the plan to establish a "human rights committee" also shows that Britain has the ambition of changing China's current system and territory. The report by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee not only meddles in Hong Kong's post-1997 affairs, but also has a hand in Taiwan and Tibetan affairs. Britain tries to harbor such people as Han Dongfang and allow them to use Hong Kong as a springboard to enter the mainland for setting up liberal trade unions and overthrowing the socialist system. Britain also repeatedly interferes in such cases as that of Xi Yang in order to support and protect people who use Hong Kong as a base for buying, prying into, and stealing China's political, military, and economic secrets and thus endangering China's security. Britain continues to support such organizations as the "Alliance in Support of the Patriotic and Democratic Movement in China," which is hostile to China and attempts to disrupt Hong Kong's stability, and allows it to continue its "yellow bird action" and stretch its sinister hand into the mainland. There also exist human rights problems in Britain. People of Asian and African origin cannot enjoy equal treatment there, and the demand of the people in Northern Ireland for independence is suppressed cruelly. International human rights organizations and the United States have interfered in and criticized such events. However, Britain has not enacted its own "human rights law" or set up a "human rights committee" in order to meet the needs of guaranteeing human rights in its own country. Why so? Britain fails to give any explanation, but it has formulated a human rights law and is planning to set up a human rights committee in Hong Kong shortly before its withdrawal from Hong Kong. Obviously, it harbors sinister intentions when doing this. An ancient Chinese saying goes that "one should not impose anything one does not like on other people." Britain does not want to see other countries interfere in affairs within its own sovereign power, does not want to see foreign forces interfere in the Northern Ireland issue, and does not want to see any international organizations supervise its human rights situation. Why did it do all this against China? Over more than 100 years of British rule in Hong Kong, Britain declared that some provisions of the international human rights convention which it had signed were not applicable in Hong Kong, and Britain also opposed deleting Hong Kong from its list of colonies. Historical facts show that Britain had no sincerity on giving democracy and human rights to Hong Kong. Obviously it was for sinister purposes that it began to introduce such things only when it would soon withdraw from Hong Kong. Many countries in the world do not have a "human rights committee." The United States, Britain, Japan, and many other countries have not set up human rights committees. However, such committees have been set up in Canada and Australia, two of Britain's former colonies. The practical results there are not commendable. Enterprise management is made a mess of; large numbers of suits pile up year on year; large amounts of public money are wasted; right and wrong are lumped together; even gangsters and tax evaders can enjoy various strange "human rights" and can even make a fortune by filing countercharges. Now Britain is trying to impose on Hong Kong such a human rights committee, which has proved unsuccessful and which may produce many side effects. This is completely another political trick before its withdrawal from a colony. The Basic Law includes sufficient provisions guaranteeing human rights. In all countries, the guarantees of human rights of their own people can only be effected through their own sovereign power and their own legal systems. The establishment of a human rights committee in Hong Kong outside the framework of the Basic Law before Britain's withdrawal will only disrupt the administrative, judicial, and legislative operation of the future SAR Government, and may even throw things into chaos. Therefore, such an organization illegally set up by the colonialists is out of line with the Basic Law and is bound to be disbanded after 1997. People have noted that when the British side was talking about the improvement of relations with China, Patten again began to play the "human rights card." What is his political purpose? How far does he plan to go along the course of worsening Sino-British relations?
