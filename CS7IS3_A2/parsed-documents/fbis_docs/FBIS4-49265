A number of policy-related banks will be set up to engage in policy-related business. Prior to 1978, the People's Bank of China was the only one in the nation. It was not only the bank for monetary issue, but also the center for credit, settlement and cash receipt and payment. Therefore, it was dubbed a monetary issue company or state treasury. At the end of 1978, China embarked on its reform and opening policies. Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's reform and opening, instructed in 1979 that "banks should be real banks," which raised the curtain on the country's financial system reform. Between 1979 and 1985, the Agricultural Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China were set up; the Bank of China was separated from the People's Bank of China as a specialized exchange bank engaging in international settlement and foreign trade credit; the People's Construction Bank of China became independent from the Ministry of Finance to handle part of credit business. In 1984, the People's Bank of China began to act as the central bank. From 1986 to 1993, China established nine commercial banks, including the Bank of Communications, the CITIC Industrial Bank, the Merchant Bank, the Shenzhen Development Bank, the Fujian Industrial Bank, the Guangdong Development Bank, the Everbright Bank, the Huaxia Bank and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. Their emergence put an end to the monopoly of state specialized banks and promoted competition in China's banking industry. However, economic operations over the last 10 years have exposed undeniable shortcomings in the existing financial system. The central bank does not behave like a central bank, and neither do the commercial banks act accordingly. With its macroregulation and control measures still characteristic with those of a planned economy, the central bank fails to play its due role in implementing the state monetary policy and in managing and supervising national financial activities. It handles its own policy related loans and runs investment and trust companies. In the interim, the specialized banks handle commercial as well as policy-related business. With fund operations conducted in accordance with planned indicators and administrative instructions, the specialized banks have no autonomy to choose where to put money and therefore credit risk does not exist. The still not thoroughly reformed financial system certainly failed to withstand the pounding of the socialist market economy and the rapid development of the national economy after 1992. In the first half of 1993 chaotic phenomena like fraudulence in money raising and loan calling cropped up in the financial market. This aggravated the excessive growth of investment in capital construction and fixed assets, inflation and steep price increases. The Chinese government shifted the focus of reform and opening onto finance. On July 2, 1993, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji was appointed president of the People's Bank of China, a post concurrent with his existing one. As soon as he took office, Zhu called a working conference on national finance. Zhu put forward the 14 measures for macroregulation and control, trying to reverse the chaotic situation in finance through rectifying the financial order and strictly enforcing financial discipline so the national economy could revert to the road of continuous, rapid and healthy development. The efforts have created favorable conditions for smooth formulation and implementation of supporting financial reform measures in 1994. At the press conference of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on March 17, Zhou Zhengqing, vice president of the People's Bank of China, introduced the main points of financial reform in 1994. Major points of his introduction are as follows: Establishing a central bank macroregulation and control system under the leadership of the State Council that will independently implement the monetary policies; Establishing a financial organizations network in which policy related finance is separated from commercial finance, and under which state-owned commercial banks are the main body, while various financial institutions coexist; Establishing a market system featuring openness, orderly competition and strict management; Turning the People's Bank of China into an actual central bank and specialized banks into the real commercial banks; Further opening up finance to the outside world, and unifying the exchange rate so the Renminbi can gradually become a convertible currency. Macroregulation and Central Bank Control Since it became the central bank in 1984, the People's Bank of China has carried out independent monetary policies. It has employed international practices such as reserve deposits, rediscounts, interest rates, central bank loans and credit limits to control the money supply and adjust the credit structure. Major function of the central bank Vice-President Zhou Zhengqing pointed out at the branch head conference of the People's Bank of China held in December last year that a real central bank should lead and manage national financial undertakings, scientifically devise and carry out monetary policies and maintain essential currency stability; and exert strict supervision and administration over financial organs and ensure secure and effective operation of the financial system. "Only the head office of the People's Bank of China has the right to create monetary policies," Zhou emphasized. Specific Reform Measures Zhou said major reform measures include the following: -- Transforming and defining functions of the People's Bank of China. The head office of the People's Bank of China has the rights to issue money, manage basic monetary policies, regulate and control total credit, and regiment bench mark interest rates, in order to guarantee the face of monetary policies throughout the country. Usually, the head office of the People's Bank of China only allows provision of temporary credit to head offices of national commercial banks. The basic duties of the bank's branches include: financial supervision and management investigation and statistical analysis, adjustment of horizontal money supply, state treasury operation, cash allocation, exchange management and interbank settlement -- Reforming and improving monetary policies. The ultimate goal of the monetary policy of the People's Bank of China is to maintain currency stability and thus promote economic growth. In line with the macroeconomic situation, it will flexibly use monetary policy tools such as legal deposit reserve rates, central bank loans, rediscounts, interest rates, open-market operations, central bank foreign exchange operations and credit lines to regulate and control the money supply. It has started from this year to handle separately funds and business of commercial and policy-related banks, cut off the direct connection between the central bank's basic money supply and policy-related loans, and to practice asset liability ratio and asset risk in managing the Renminbi and foreign currency credit in commercial banks. -- Fortifying the supervision and management of the central bank over the national banking industry. Drafts of the Law of the People's Bank of China, the Bank Law of the People's Republic of China, the Law of Negotiable Instruments and the Law of Insurance will be submitted to the National People's Congress for examination and approval in 1994. In the interim, rules and regulations managing various financial institutions will be drawn up and refined. According to Zhu Xiaohua, vice president of the People's Bank of China, China will soon make up and enforce 22 laws, regulations and methods relating to the banking industry. The drafting has absorbed some common articles from foreign bank laws and related regulations under the market economy. Starting from the reality of China, these statutes will be made similar to international practice so the Chinese financial market can be linked with global financial circles. Financial lnstitutions Within the financial institutions network, policy-related finance should be separated from commercial finance. With the state-owned commercial banks as the main body, the network should accommodate financial institutions of various kinds. Policy-related banks: Beginning from the second half of 1993, three policy-related banks were founded and formally put into operation in 1994. They are the State Development Bank that accommodates funds for key state construction projects; the Agricultural Development Bank that provides policy-related loans for the country's reserves of grain, cotton and edible oil, contracted purchase of farm and sideline products, and agricultural development; and the Bank of Import and Export Credit. Policy-related banks are geared to the needs of state policies and do not aim at making profits. They provide special loans that are beneficial to overall stability, such as specific loans for infrastructure construction, stocks of key materials, and poverty aid and disaster relief. Their interest rates are much lower than those of the market. Policy-related banks do not participate in commercial banking competition but receive the supervision of the central bank. Conventionally, policy-related banks do not absorb social deposits. Therefore, they have no direct debt relationship with the public. The main sources of funds come from financial allocation, central bank reloans, bonds issued to the public, regular sums left in social security funds, and indirect use of post office deposits. In establishing the policy-related banks, China has drawn on foreign experience as a reference, especially that of the United States and Japan. Still in their preliminary stages, China's policy-related banks are not as detailed in function as their foreign counterparts. State-owned commercial banks: As policy-related banks take over policy-related financial business, the existing state-owned specialized banks (including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank of China and the People's Construction Bank of China) will be transformed into state-owned commercial banks. They will operate with the mechanisms of modern commercial banks, featured by autonomous management and assumption of full responsibility for profits and losses. State-owned commercial banks, though rivals, can undertake interlocked business. All their operations must strictly abide by the Bank Law of the People's Republic of China and other financial rules and regulations. They must receive the supervision of the central bank. Other financial institutions: In addition to the People's Bank of China and the above-mentioned four state-owned specialized banks, China's financial institutions include nine commercial banks such as the Bank of Communications, 12 insurance companies, 387 financial trust and investment firms, 87 securities bodies, 29 financial houses, 11 financial and leasing concerns, 59,000 rural credit cooperatives and 3,900 urban credit cooperatives. All these constitute the Chinese financial network. All commercial banks and other non-bank financial institutions will operate in line with the Bank Law of the People's Republic of China and other related financial rules and regulations. In this financial reform, rural and urban credit cooperatives will change into rural and urban cooperative banks, whose major task is to develop the local economy and provide services to small and medium-sized enterprises and agriculture, animal husbandry and the fishing industry. Financial Market System Diversification of credit forms and financial tools have boosted the development of China's financial market. In 1986, fund markets were established in the five cities of Shenyang, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing and Changzhou. Over the following several years, various kinds of financial markets were established across the country. They included inter-bank, short and long-term funds, corporate bond, national debt, note discount, foreign exchange swap and stock markets. This resulted in floating interest rates and commodity capital. In 1993, China successfully set up its first-class national debt dealer system. This symbolized the move by China's national debt market toward standardization and international practice. From this year on, the Ministry of Finance stops borrowing from the People's Bank to amend the financial budget, and therefore, the financial deficit shall be met through the issue of national debt. During his visit to Japan in early March, President Zhu Rongji said that China, in order to control inflation, will adopt tight currency and strict financial policies to control money issuing and expenditure. Specifically speaking, China will issue national debt to replace its previous practice of meeting deficit by borrowing money from banks and by money issue. This is a significant reform. This year, the proportion of national debt in the financial budget in China is about the same as that in Japan. Another major measure in this year's financial reform is the unification of the exchange rate. The unitary floating exchange rate based on the exchange market price was put into effect from January 1. Coinciding with global practice, this move will have far-reaching significance on Sino-foreign economic exchange. It will help attract foreign investment and pave the way for China to restore its status in GATT. In addition, it opens a path for the free convertibility of the Renminbi, the ultimate goal of the reform of the exchange management system. Experts say that only when China has sufficient exchange reserves, Chinese commodities occupy a significant share in the world market, Chinese enterprises are internationally competitive enough, and Chinese legal conditions improve, can the Renminbi's free convertibility finally materialize.
