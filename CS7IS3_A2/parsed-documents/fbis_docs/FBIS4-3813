This is the first state-owned enterprise under the jurisdiction of the city government, which has publicly announced its bankruptcy to society. The plant was heavily in debt due to sustained mismanagement. It was informed that the plant had just 2.7 million yuan or so in assets at its disposal but its debts mounted to over 4 million yuan. It was unable to repay debts which had become due. By 15 April, 56 creditor units from Guizhou Province and other parts of the country had applied to the intermediate people's court for creditor's rights, of which 45 were granted those rights. Yesterday, in accordance with the relevant legal procedures, the court appointed 14 working personnel from 14 units, such as the Guiyang City Financial and Auditing Bureau, to form an enterprise bankruptcy liquidation group to clear the plant's accounts.
