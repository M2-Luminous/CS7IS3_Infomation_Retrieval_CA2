The Rajya Sabha passed the bill, the Chief Election Commissioner [CEC] and other Election Commissioners (conditions of service) Amendment Bill, 1993, which replaces a presidential order of October 1, this year. The Lok Sabha had passed the bill last week. Replying to a discussion on the bill, the minister of state for law, justice and company affairs, Mr H.R. Bhardwaj, justified the presidential ordinance and said the government was willing to hold discussions on electoral reforms with all political parties. He said there were no political motives behind the ordinance which was in accordance with constitutional provisions and the supreme court directive. Members belonging to the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] and the Janata Dal [JD] opposed the bill saying the government should await the supreme court judgment on the issue and then bring a comprehensive bill on electoral reforms. The bill was passed by voice vote after amendments by opposition members were negated. Alternatively, the two parties suggested that the government should accept the amendment moved by Mr S.P. Malaviya of the JD(S) [Janata Dal-Samajwadi] to refer the bill to a select committee till the supreme court gave its final verdict. Mr Mohd Afzal (JD), however, supported the bill. He expressed concern over reports that about one million people in the capital were being divested of their voting rights by the election commission by labelling them as foreign nationals. Mr Sukomal Sen (CPM) supported the bill to make the election commission broad-based. He was, however, critical of the election commission's directive to the West Bengal government to issue photo identity cards to voters by next year. Mr Chaudhary Hari Singh (Congress) said all members of the commission should be of equal status and should enjoy parity in service conditions. Opposing the bill, Mr Triloki Nath Chaturvedi (BJP) said as the matter was sub-judice, the government should not pass the bill in haste. He said though his party was in favour of a multi-member election commission, the primacy of CEC should be maintained.
