At an SDF reviewing ceremony last fall, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa declared that "Japan will take the initiative in disarmament." Under the leadership of the Prime Minister's Official Residence, the government is promoting the process of reviewing the "National Defense Program Outline." Although there are some unstable factors in Japan's neighboring countries, including the DPRK, which is faced with the issue of nuclear inspections, the fact that the cold war has ended following the collapse of the Soviet Union has significant importance. The "final battle," on which is staked the survival of SDF organizations, has begun. Seiki Nishihiro, adviser to the Defense Agency [DA], frankly said: "Although it did not have enough members, the SDF was trying to make it look as if there were enough members. The SDF was like a paper tiger." He also said: "Because it had responsibilities as a member of the West, Japan so far has been trying to do things that were beyond its capabilities. Now that the cold war is over, we should have weapons that we can afford to have. How about reducing the number of Ground Self-Defense Force [GSDF] divisions from 13 to about five?" Nishihiro is an influential member of the "Panel for Defense Issues," which is an advisory organ to Prime Minister Hosokawa. Its task is to review the National Defense Program Outline. Nishihiro was chief of the Defense Planning Division of the Defense Agency's Bureau of Defense Policy 18 years ago when the outline was prepared. After that, he acted as a leader of the team that prepared the current midterm defense buildup plan. Although he was deeply involved in mapping out the defense buildup plan, Nishihiro now advocates a plan to reduce the size of the SDF. Looking back at when the midterm defense buildup plan was prepared, General Yusuke Matsushima, commanding general of the Middle Army, said: "Nishihiro has not changed. It has been his cherished wish to reduce the size of the SDF." Matsushima, who is called "the soldier of soldiers in terms of his ideology, and his looks as well" and the "bravest general" in the GSDF, was GSDF chief of staff. He had heated arguments with then Vice Minister of Defense Nishihiro, who called for a scaling down of the GSDF. Gen. Matsushima said: "Only 10,000 service members are available in case of an emergency, and none of them can be dispatched outside of Tokyo. We could protect up to the Tsugaru peninsula if we had 100,000 men. If we reduce the number of SDF members, then we will be able to have a national defense commensurate with its size. I repeatedly advised Nishihiro to hold a Diet debate on this issue to see if the people will accept it." The dispute between Nishihiro and Gen. Matsushima indicates the difference of opinions between the DA and the GSDF Staff Office. DA officials have different opinions over the issue of reviewing the outline of the current defense buildup plan, too. As a group of bureaucrats, the DA is sensitive to the prime minister's intentions. However, SDF uniformed officers, who normally base their thinking on military rationality, are opposed to the idea of reducing the size of the SDF, and such an idea is preceded by a general mood favoring a reduction. Gen. Matsushima even advocated expanding the size of the GSDF, saying: "Properly speaking, the size of the SDF should be determined taking into account what is the actual threat to the nation. Even if it is determined simply by being compared to the national population, the current size of the GSDF is still too small." On the other hand, Nishihiro said: "A unit becomes unable to fulfill its duties when it loses 30 percent of its troops; however, the active strength of the entire GSDF is currently less than 70 percent of its permitted level. It will be meaningless to maintain such an organization which is bound to lose even before the actual start of a battle. It is impossible to discuss Japan's military independence because Japan does not have nuclear weapons. The primary concern must be to maintain favorable Japan-U.S. relations." The "Nishihiro theory" is often regarded as a proposal for limiting the SDF's size to the required minimum based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, and this is attractive to many civilian officials in the DA. Nishihiro is still regarded as a charismatic leader of defense policy, and Prime Minister Hosokawa relies on him greatly. When Hosokawa hit upon the revision of the National Defense Program Outline, he brought the plan to Nishihiro before showing it to the DA. The final report by the "Defense Issues Council," which is to be submitted this summer, is expected to advocate drastic arms reduction policies. In preparation for this, the DA and the GSDF Staff Office secretly began to formulate a plan for "downgrading some divisions to brigades." The GSDF Staff Office is now trying to make sure that there will be 15 units--13 divisions plus two combined brigades--even if several divisions are downgraded to brigades. This is because the GSDF Staff Office believes that if the number of units is kept unchanged at 15, there will still be opportunities for expansion in the future. Now that the GSDF Staff Office has decided to resort to this "ultimate tactic," its antagonism against the DA has disappeared.
