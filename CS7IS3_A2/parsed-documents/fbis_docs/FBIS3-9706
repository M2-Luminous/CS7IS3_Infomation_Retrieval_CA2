Which grouping would be willing to support Lech Walesa in next year's presidential elections? The conflicts with the government (over Rosati) and the National Council of Radio and Television (over Solorz), in which Lech Walesa has recently taken part, and the coming presidential campaign were an occasion for politicians to specify their attitudes toward the present head of state. Walesa can no longer count on support from the Solidarity ["S"] camp, unless we include the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR] in it. Even though he has not yet formally confirmed that he wants to run in the 1995 elections, he is the official candidate of the BBWR. The bloc has so far been... Unconditionally Loyal ...to the president. Incidentally, the bloc's voters include the greatest number of people who approve of the way in which the president is now fulfilling his duties. However, it is really difficult to say today to what degree Walesa himself believes in the possibility of transforming the BBWR into a nationwide movement supporting him. The Polish Peasant Party [PSL] has a fairly positive attitude toward the president. In the conflict over Dariusz Rosati, the PSL is trying not to take an unequivocal stand on the issue. Even though Prime Minister Pawlak has maintained Rosati's candidacy, he did that through Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] Chairman Aleksander Kwasniewski. None of the PSL leaders officially backed Dariusz Rosati, which gave rise to suspicions that Pawlak was playing a double game: He was said "not to discourage" Walesa from rejecting the SLD candidate. The possibility cannot be ruled out that some PSL leaders think it would be a good idea to remove the SLD from the government and to establish a minority PSL government that would be supported by the president. However, extension of the cooperation between the PSL and the Belweder to next year's elections seems rather unlikely. It is difficult to suppose that Waldemar Pawlak will not want to take advantage of the period of his premiership and will not run in the presidential elections against Lech Walesa. It should be added here, however, that the president is very... Popular Among PSL Voters In line with the research carried out by the Sopot Public Opinion Research Institute [PBS], as many as 46 percent of rural area inhabitants declare support for him. So far, the Confederation for an Independent Poland [KPN] has not demonstrated its reluctance toward the president. KPN deputies backed (along with the Democratic Union--UD--and the BBWR) the presidential bill on the procedures of passing the Constitution; they also do not conceal the fact that their, just like Lech Walesa's, greatest enemy is the SLD. They would be ready to take part in establishing a new government under the patronage of the president. UD wants to take a position above the dispute between Walesa and the SLD. As it often happens in this grouping, one unequivocal stand has not been specified; it is known, though, that UD is rather on the side of the SLD, whose finance minister would probably be inclined to continue the policy of economic reforms carried out so far. However, neither UD (rather dissatisfied with recent decisions made by Walesa) nor the KPN (approving of the activities of the current president) will decide to support Walesa in the elections. UD and KPN leaders have presidential ambitions themselves. Leszek Moczulski even stated officially that, in 1995, he would run for the Belweder. Lech Walesa, who frequently refers to traditional values and calls himself a man of the right wing, cannot count on support from a party that is so definitely leftist as the Labor Union [UP]. Even though we may suspect that Ryszard Bugaj's party would not accept some proposals made by Dariusz Rosati (lowering taxes, for instance), in the prestige dispute between Aleksander Kwasniewski and Lech Walesa it would side with the former. Artur Smolko, one of the UP leaders, even called Walesa "a president of destabilization." Also, one cannot rule out the possibility that, in the coming elections, UP will field its own candidate--for example, Aleksander Malachowski. An entirely open war is being waged between Lech Walesa and the SLD; some observers believe that this is... The Initial Stage of the Presidential Campaign ...in which the most dangerous counter-candidate of the present head of state may be Aleksander Kwasniewski. Social Democracy of the Polish Republic does not intend to be grateful to Walesa for "strengthening the left pillar" for a long time; it is more likely to remember his "Solidarity" past and his fighting against the SLD in the present government. The extraparliamentary right (which the president called "screwups") does not intend to back Walesa even in a situation where his opponents are postcommunists. Both the members of Jaroslaw Kaczynski's bloc and the members of the alliance in which Aleksander Hall participates consider Walesa's activities to be punishable and likely to cause destabilization in the country. However, according to the PBS, the voters of the "Fatherland" belong to those who support the way Walesa is wielding power. The issue of the future connections between "S" and its former chairman is also not clear yet. "S" voters often do not have a clear-cut opinion about the president. The president, however, has recently been leaning toward "S": Through Lech Falandysz, he implied that it was especially for his former union that he had proposed "the civic constitutional initiative." It is possible that the president, who has rejected the free-market-oriented Rosati and who may veto the "continuation budget," wants to regain popularity among radical union leaders and... Stand at the Lead of the Mass of People ...marching toward the seat of the government. No one knows to what degree the anticommunist "S" will believe in the sincerity of Lech Walesa, who is announcing file-checking and decommunization; nonetheless, it is one of the few forces that might launch a fairly effective campaign supporting the president in the elections. Whether or not any of the political groupings will cooperate with Lech Walesa depends to a considerable degree on reshuffles in the president's closest entourage. When the election campaign starts, the Chancellory of the head of the state is bound to become a clear political center, which may mean that it will gain a party character. It is no secret that, in order to win the support of one the parties, such as a large part of the right wing or UD, the president would have to abandon the services of some of his aides, such as Minister Mieczyslaw Wachowski. The Public Opinion Research Center asked its respondents about who would make the best president. In line with the data published in February, 17 percent of the respondents believe that the best president would be Kwasniewski. Walesa came fourth, with 9 percent, after Waldemar Pawlak and Krzysztof Skubiszewski (both 11 percent). Walesa's supporters are largely young people with elementary and secondary-school educations, peasants and white-collar and blue-collar workers, people with low salaries who evaluate their material situation as average or good. They are believers and church-goers, not very interested in politics. Asked about their political views, they say they support the right wing or answer: "It is hard to tell.
