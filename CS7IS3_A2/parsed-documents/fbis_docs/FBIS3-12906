[Begin Quray' recording] We have made some progress on banking and financial issues but we are having a real dispute over trade and customs duties. I wish to point out that, first of all, a new reality has come into being and we must handle issues on the basis of this. The Palestinian territory cannot remain in the same condition during the transitional period as it was during the occupation phase. A new reality exists that should apply to all spheres of activity, be they political, economic, or social. This is the new reality. Another issue is the following: According to the Declaration of Principles there will be economic cooperation with Israel but the Palestinians will continue to have strategic economic relations with their larger Arab homeland. Israel must understand the Palestinian trade relationship with the Arab homeland. The Palestinians must make their own decisions on this matter. A third area of dispute is connected with our determination to decide the level of customs duties and taxes to be imposed on economic development projects. We must also be the only authority to determine how much tax is paid on certain basic commodities. [end recording]
