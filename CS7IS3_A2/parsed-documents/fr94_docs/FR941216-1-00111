Consult applicable regulations and, if necessary, other authorities or publications for determination of toxic siting criteria. 2All propellants in a compatibility group are considered compatible. Groupings are not to be confused with ammunition and explosives compatibility groupings with like letters. 3Under certain conditions, this propellant can detonate. However, its sensitivity to detonation is not greater than that of a standard energetic double base solid propellant under the same conditions. 4Nitromethane is chemically compatible with compatibility storage group C liquid propellants, but due to differences in hazards should be stored separately. 5Technical grade nitromethane in unit quantities of 55 gallons or less in DOT 17E or C drums may be stored as Hazard Group II provided the following apply: a. Drums are stored only one tier high. b. Drums are protected from direct rays of sun. c. Maximum storage life of 2 years, unless storage life tests indicate product continues to meet purchase specification. Such tests are to be repeated at 1 year intervals thereafter.
