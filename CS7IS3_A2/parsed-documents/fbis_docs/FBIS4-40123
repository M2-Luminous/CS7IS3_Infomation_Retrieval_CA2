The main question is: Was that decision scientifically grounded from economic and ecological points of view or will it lead to the situation when, in 10 years, we will have to build several "sarcophaguses" like the one we have in Chernobyl today? To answer this question, I will try to briefly analyze the state of affairs in our nuclear power industry and the prospects of its development in Ukraine and elsewhere. There are 14 nuclear power units in Ukraine which are located in five sites, involving 10 VVER-1000 reactors, two VVER-440 reactors, and two notorious RBMK-1000 reactors of Chernobyl type. As far as the unit number is concerned, Ukraine occupies the seventh place in the world and the fifth in Europe. As for the nuclear capacity, equalling 12,880 MW [megawatts], Ukraine exceeds Great Britain, being inferior in Europe only to France, Germany and Russia. Despite that, our country remains part of the once single nuclear power complex and cannot exist outside it. Having become an independent country, Ukraine had a unique opportunity to set up the state of the art nuclear safety system allowing for domestic and world experience. However, unwillingness of the Ukrainian officialdom to solve this problem in a comprehensive manner, also the pressure on the part of pronuclear parliamentarian lobby created the situation when today we have the same obsolete system of the bodies responsible for nuclear and radiation safety, the system that existed in the USSR. This fact, also inadequate industrial infrastructure and scientific-technological support prevent Ukraine to ensure adequate safety of its NPP's. On the other hand, almost complete dependence of this country on Russia in the NPP operation domain makes it possible for the latter to regulate the development of Ukrainian nuclear power industry in its own interests. This is very important for Russia today when there appear cardinal changes in its nuclear power complex characterized by drastic labor cuts and closure of nuclear industry enterprises as a result of reduction in financing of military nuclear programs. Given this, the Russian Government tries to reorient its nuclear industry to fulfillment of civil programs. This is proved by the latest decisions of the Russian Government on financing of construction of new NPP units. The Russian Nuclear Engineering Ministry is going to promote both Russian and Ukrainian nuclear power programs, to support the relevant decisions taken by the Ukrainian parliament involving continuation of Chernobyl NPP operation and completion of construction of six new VVER-1000 units. Why? Because such decisions help provide new orders for the Russian nuclear complex and said ministry. So, it is hard to answer for whom our NPP's work -- Ukraine or Russia? Ukraine boasts rich deposits of uranium. We also have zirconium, hafnium, niobium, other rare-earth elements required for nuclear fuel cycle. The Ukrainian plants produce "heavy water" as well. We have a powerful scientific potential. It is worth underscoring that the fulfillment of the Ukrainian nuclear program depends on solution of the following main problems: - Improvement of competitiveness of domestic nuclear industry; - Raising the nuclear safety to the level excluding the possibility of grave accidents at the Ukrainian NPP; - Safe handling of radioactive wastes. It is more profitable for our NPP's to use not enriched but natural uranium. For instance, fuel cycle of the Canadian reactors of CANDU type, that utilize natural uranium, is much simpler, cheaper and ecologically safer versus that of VVER or RBMK reactors which employ enriched uranium. There is no need to enrich uranium while the waste fuel in such reactors has a very small number of fissionable isotopes thus facilitating solution of the fuel storage and burial problem. Besides, CANDU reactors can be used to burn the fuel from VVER reactors. Usually, service life of nuclear reactors is 30-40 years but, in fact, it is about 15-20 years taking into account the safety requirements. For instance, today in the world, some 80 reactors, that had worked 17-20 years, have been removed from service. The nuclear boom of the 1960's has been replaced in many countries by a "terrible hangover" in the form of closure of quite a few NPP's. This involves the growth of relevant expenses and the problem of nuclear waste utilization. According to the State nuclear power committee, removal of Chernobyl NPP from service will cost $2 billion. If this is true, the idea of nuclear power engineering development in Ukraine becomes rather doubtful. In the NPP's with VVER-type reactors, steam generators should be replaced in 7-12 years. As regards the CANDU reactors, their horizontal fuel channels must be replaced in 11-12 years, not in 40 years as the reactor designers believed. The RBMK reactor requires full replacement of fuel channels after 20 years of operation. We annually spend 10-15 percent of our budget to fight against Chernobyl aftermath. One should also take into account the huge contaminated area and Chernobyl hazardous effect on human health. Chernobyl proves that there exist certain critical economic and geographic dimensions when the accident of such scale is capable of ruining the country's economy. NPP's heat discharges twice exceed those of ordinary heat and power stations since their heat cycle efficiency is 30 percent versus 50 percent of heat and power stations. This fact and the necessity to use the closed water circulation systems require creation of big cooling water reservoirs near NPPs which change ecologic balance there. An example of this is location of the Zaporizhya NPP close to a heat and power station which enhanced the negative effect of sulfur oxide and nitrogen discharges. Situation with radioactive wastes in Ukraine is a real catastrophe. Huge amounts of such wastes were produced by Chernobyl. There are over 100 radioactive sources whose use in national economy is not controlled adequately, more than 70 million cubic meters of wastes stored in mining industry dumps. Such wastes are used as the fuel for NPP's but, at the same time, they are a powerful source of environmental contamination. Most radioactive wastes are generated by NPP's. Experts warn that absence of adequate technologies and national centers for treatment and burials of such wastes prevents to ensure proper safety of NPP's. The problem is aggravated by absence of the state strategy and infrastructure for handling the wastes. Solution of such problems is the chief prerequisite for development of domestic nuclear power industry. First of all, it is necessary to define the notion of the waste nuclear fuel. Experts from some countries (Russia, Great Britain, France, China, Japan etc.) maintain that this notion includes such valuable materials as uranium, plutonium, isotopes and rare-earth elements. Other experts (Canada, Sweden, United States) regard this fuel as radioactive wastes. It is evident that in the first case it would be unprofitable for Ukraine to give such valuable [materials] to Russia free of charge. On the other hand, at any time, Russia may refuse to accept such materials from our country. Should this happen, we must construct our own temporary "dry" storages where the wastes may be kept from five to 120 years. Then we can start thinking about the ways of wastes utilization and burial. Our efforts today should be channeled to raising the NPP safety and wastes utilization. Urgent measures in this field include: replacement of Chernobyl reactors by more reliable and safe VVER-type reactors in Zaporizhya, Rivno and Khmelnytsky NPPs; construction of temporary storages for nuclear wastes; production of fuel assemblies by the Ukrainian enterprises that will help improve the NPP safety. All of us are responsible for "nuclear future" of Ukraine -- either it will be bright or covered with radioactive clouds.
