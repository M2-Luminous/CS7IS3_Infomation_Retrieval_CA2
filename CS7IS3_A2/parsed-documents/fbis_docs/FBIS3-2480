The 8th lecture entitled "(Reform of the) Foreign Trade System" is presented by Shi Guangsheng, vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation. Shi Begins by saying: Profound changes have taken place in China's foreign trade system after 15 years of reform. Reform of the foreign trade system effectively promotes the development of China's foreign trade. In 1978, China's total import and export volume ranked 32d in the world; it rose to take the 11th rank in 1992. The ratio represented by China's total import and export volume in its gross national product has increased by nearly 40 percent. After enumerating various shortcomings of the old foreign trade system, Shi points out that reform of the foreign trade system became imperative especially in the face of keen international competition after China implemented reform and opened its doors to the outside world. The State Council carried out two major reforms after 1984: first, the implementation of the contract management responsibility system among enterprises specializing in foreign trade from 1988 to 1990; and, second, beginning from 1 January 1991, the readjustment of the exchange rate mechanism to create an environment for competition on equal terms and the cancellation of export subsidies for foreign trade enterprises. However, Shi notes, certain undesirable aspects still exist in China's foreign trade system which must be improved to meet the needs of the drive to establish a socialist market economy. "The resolution adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee determined the orientation for reform of the foreign trade system, namely, seek unity of policies, delegate management power to enterprises and institutions, compete on equal terms, integrate industry and trade, and implement agency systems," states Shi. The objective of China's reform of its foreign trade system is to establish a new foreign trade system that conforms to the international economic norms and meets the requirements of a socialist market economy. Major points of the reform are as follows: 1. The exchange rate control system will be reformed to bring into full play the important role of exchange rates in regulating and controlling foreign trade. The State Council decided to merge the dual exchange rates used in the past and to implement a controlled, unitary floating exchange rate system for the renminbi on the basis of market supply and demand, starting 1 January 1994. Shi stresses: "We really grasp the key issue by reforming exchange rates under the circumstances. It will surely promote development of China's foreign trade. Reform of the foreign exchange system will create a favorable environment for competition on equal terms among various export enterprises; is conducive to reasonably compensating enterprises' export cost and to enhancing the competitiveness of China's export commodities; will greatly accelerate transformation of export enterprises' operating mechanisms; will effectively bring into full play the function of exchange rates as an economic lever in regulating foreign trade; will make China's foreign exchange and foreign trade system meet the requirements of a socialist market economy and conform to the international economic norms; and, therefore, will play a positive role in promoting the process of China's entry into GATT and its participation in the international economic activities. In addition, the reform enables the renminbi to take an important step forward to gradually becoming a convertible currency." 2. Legal and economic means will be employed to improve management of foreign trade. These means, such as expediting the legislation of a foreign trade law, regulations on control of import and export commodities, anti-dumping provisions, and so forth, will be supplemented by necessary administrative means. Shi urges all departments in charge of foreign trade to enhance consciousness of legal system and to exercise control strictly in accordance with the laws. Efforts will be made to establish a relatively complete system of laws on foreign trade in about three years. The state will implement a quota system to control huge quantity of important import and export commodities that have a bearing on the national economy and on the people's livelihood. The state will adopt policies on duty drawback and export loans to encourage export and to stimulate its growth. Foreign trade management power will be delegated to state-owned manufacturing enterprises and scientific research institutions. Shi urges enterprises to make the growth of exports their conscious action. Control over imports will also be reformed through economic means, such as gradually reducing administrative intervention to give play to the role of import in promoting national economic development, adopting anti-dumping measures, and so forth. In addition, it is necessary to establish a relatively good system for management of enterprises' overseas branches to increase economic returns and to achieve healthy development of foreign trade. 3. The following measures will be taken to enable foreign trade enterprises to accelerate the transformation of operating mechanisms. First, state-owned foreign trade enterprises will be reorganized in accordance with the modern enterprise system to turn them into business entities really responsible for their own decisions about their operations and expansion and for their own profits and losses, to bring into full play the initiative of such enterprises and their employees, to keep expanding imports and exports, and to ensure that the value of state-owned property is maintained and increased. The import and export agency system will be vigorously implemented. Second, foreign trade enterprises whose conditions are ripe will be gradually reorganized into limited liability companies or liability stock companies. Foreign trade enterprises, manufacturers, and scientific research institutions are encouraged to cooperate with each other and to form large enterprise conglomerates on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. All areas and departments must not interfere in voluntary associations and mergers among enterprises. As the pace of the formation of regional economic blocs has quickened and as trade protectionism is on the rise in the world today, the merger among enterprises and the formation of large enterprise conglomerates is necessary for China to cope with international competition. Third, supervising bodies will be set up at all large and medium-sized foreign trade enterprises owned by the state to supervise their business operations and the increment of the value of state-owned property. They will not interfere in enterprises' normal operations or decisionmaking. Fourth, we must bring into full play the role of chambers of commerce of importers and exporters in providing coordination, guidance, and services for foreign trade. All enterprises authorized to conduct foreign trade are required to participate in a chamber of commerce and to comply with its coordination activities. Arbitration bodies, information service networks, and necessary lawyer, accountant, and auditing offices will be set up across the country to provide foreign trade-related services for enterprises. All administrative departments must strive to create a favorable environment for fair competition among enterprises. And, fifth, we must maintain unity among varous foreign trade policies. Implementation of unified policies, rules, and regulations on foreign trade across the country is a necessity for the establishment of an integrated big market nationwide, and conforms to one of the norms of international trade. "Aside from those that must be promulgated by the National People's Congress and State Council, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation is authorized by the State Council to announce all laws, rules, and regulations on foreign trade in a unified way and to organize their implementation." "During the negotiations on restoring China's status as a signatory to the GATT, some signatories doubted if China is able to maintain unity in its foreign trade policies and management system." It presents an issue that merits our close attention, Shi stresses. "All laws, regulations, and policies on foreign trade and economic relations as well as all relevant provisions on services for foreign firms shall be promulgated so long as they do not involve national security and industrial secrets," Shi says. Finally, Shi calls for joint efforts to promote development of foreign trade and solicits supervision over and assistance for the work of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. The lecture concludes at 0638 GMT.
