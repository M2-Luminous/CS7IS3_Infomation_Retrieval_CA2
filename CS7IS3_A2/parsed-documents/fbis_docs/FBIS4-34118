Referring to relations between Cuba and Washington, the legislature released a communique on Tuesday stating that differences "are not solved by unilateral and interventionist means." Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) Deputy Fernando Charleston read a statement stressing that the blockade of Cuba is a violation of essential principles of international law, especially nonintervention. Charleston also confirmed that the document issued by the Chamber of Deputies expresses solidarity with the Cuban people in defense of their sovereignty and self-determination. A state's decision to establish commercial ties with another state, the deputy added, is an expression of its sovereignty and should not be subordinated to the will of a foreign government. For Mexico, nonintervention in the domestic affairs of another nation and respect for ideologies are aspects that should rule their relations, he said. Meanwhile, Luis Beauregard, also of the PRI, announced that the statement approved on Tuesday by the Chamber of Deputies will be sent to governments friendly with Mexico as well as to those nations that are currently discussing an end to the commercial blockade of that island.
