In the largest-ever seizure of Indian manufactured heroin, the narcotics cell of the city police recently seized 11 kg of the drug, valued at Rs 22 lakhs in the Indian market, and Rs 15 crores in the international markets. This seizure of heroin, the third in the city within a month, strengthens the suspicion that the trafficking in Indian heroin is a rapidly growing component of the drugs trade whose terminus is Bombay. Acting on a tip-off, the police arrested Mohammed Usman Gulam Husein Chhipa, 35, a resident of Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh, at Cotton Green, with 23 packets of the drug. He was on his way to deliver it to a customer. Interrogation has revealed that the drug was supplied to him by Mohammed Ahsan, a well-known dealer in the illicit drug trade. Ahsan, granted bail by the Madras high court in a DRI [Directorate of Revenue Intelligence] case involving a 300-kg seizure of opium, visited that city last month. He is now absconding, according to the Madhya Pradesh police. "Greed," is Usman's one-word reply, when asked what made him do it. He is a garment dealer. He used to purchase used clothes in Bhendi Bazaar and sell them in Mandsaur, and has been a carrier for the last eight or ten months. "Through the grace of God, I was comfortably off. But it was sheer greed that led me into this." The load he was arrested with was the largest he had carried. Previously he had only carried around five kg. According to Usman, the contraband was to be delivered on April 27, by a truckdriver named Rashid. However, the delivery was delayed because Rashid's truck broke down along the way, and Usman finally received it on May 4. It was to be delivered by him to two men, identified only as Fazal and Ravi, both residents of Kanjarpada in Agripada. His interrogation has given the police tantalising clues to an ongoing territory squabble between two groups of M.P. drug dealers. Ahsan is stated to be in competition with one Fazal over which group will supply the gangsters who run the Agripada distribution network. "Earlier the drug used to be rough and granular," says the deputy commissioner of police in charge of the narcotic cell, Mr. Rahul Rai-Sur. "Now it is smoother and more powdery. That indicates a greater degree of refinement, and therefore, the increasing technical expertise of the clandestine chemists operating there." Mr. Sur estimated that about 110 kg of opium probably went into the manufacture of the present load. In Mandsaur district, he said, there were as many as 68,000 cultivators of the poppy, and a total of 6,800 hectares under cultivation. One of the earlier seizures consisted of a load of two kgs of heroin, seized from a chawl in Kurla. In that case Rafiq Mohammed Jullaiya, and Abdul Hamid Mansuri, were arrested. It was revealed to have been manufactured in Ujjain. The other load, of 2.2 kgs, worth around Rs 4.4 lakhs, originated in Chittorgarh in Rajasthan. A man and a woman, from Jogeshwari and Santa Cruz, respectively, were arrested. It was learnt that the drug had been bought from two residents of Jawra, also in M.P., Irad Khan and Ramesh. Irad Khan has been arrested by a police team.
