FR940606-1-00048 FR940606-1-00008 The quantity of organic HAP emissions from depainting operations at several commercial rework facilities was readily available. However, very limited emissions data were obtained through the section 114 questionnaire responses for military aircraft depainting operations. The EPA considered several parameters to establish which facilities were the best performing ones. The most simple method would be to determine the pounds of organic HAP emissions per aircraft. This would not, however, take into account the difference in outer surface area from one model of aircraft to another and, hence, the difference in stripper volume required for each aircraft. Another basis would be to determine the organic HAP emissions per square foot of outer surface area actually painted. This method would not distinguish between the total emissions for stripping an aircraft that has only a portion of the outer surface area painted, and the total emissions for stripping the same aircraft with the entire outer surface area painted. Therefore, both methods were rejected. Another basis for determining the best performing operations relates the pounds of organic HAP emissions to the total outer surface area of the aircraft. This effectively takes into account the effectiveness of all methods used to depaint aerospace vehicles and distinguishes the lower emissions achieved when only a portion of the outer surface area is painted from the emissions when a larger portion is painted. However, insufficient data were obtained through the section 114 questionnaire responses to develop an emission rate for military aircraft depainting operations. A fourth consideration was to identify the basic techniques being used and rank them according to their relative effectiveness in reducing organic HAP emissions. The EPA elected to use this as the measure for identifying the best performing facilities. The different depainting techniques were also evaluated as to their applicability throughout the industry. Three basic depainting techniques are used by the facilities for which the EPA has information: Methylene chloride based chemical strippers, chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP, and blasting methods. (Although blasting methods are very effective in reducing and essentially eliminating organic HAP emissions from depainting operations, they do produce particulate inorganic HAP emissions. However, these emissions are typically well-controlled with particulate filters, which are almost always integral to the blasting systems. In addition, the proposed standards would require such control on inorganic HAP emissions, as discussed in section II.B. of this preamble.) Based on section 114 questionnaires, site visits, and information provided by the industry, the EPA has information on depainting methods at 20 facilities. Of these facilities, 14 were identified as using either a blasting method (i.e., wheat starch or plastic media) or chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP. The EPA then determined the aircraft models being stripped at each of these 14 facilities. This analysis showed that military fighters and transports, military and commercial helicopters, civil aircraft, and nearly all models of commercial airliners are currently being stripped with one or more of these non-HAP methods. Given the wide applicability of these processes throughout the industry, the EPA determined the MACT floor to be equivalent to the use of either media blasting or chemical strippers that do not contain organic HAP. This analysis also showed, however, that some organic HAP emissions from depainting still occurred at facilities using blast methods or chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP. This is due to the fact that certain parts (e.g., wing flaps, engine nacelles, and radomes) are removed from the aircraft and depainted separately. This is primarily due to the fragile nature or specific depainting needs of these parts. Due to the wide range of parts removed and the inconsistency in the type of parts removed from one model of aircraft to another, the applicability of using blast techniques or chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP on these parts could not be determined. Consequently, these parts are exempted from the proposed standards.
