The Crimeans, Averkin noted, are currently offered a poor medium in Ukrainian state television, meaning the Crimean Broadcasting Company, which, in his opinion, protects the interests of Ukraine, rather than Crimea. The new broadcasting company -- says the chairman of the association Impact 55 that has a criminal record -- will serve the Crimean people and protect their interests. Averkin suggests that the new broadcasting company be financed by the Crimean budget, all revenues of which now remain in Crimea. We will establish and finance our own broadcasting company, the businessmen-politician said, and later we will assess how Crimean television is doing. Averkin's idea, in the correspondent's opinion, will undoubtedly be backed by Crimean President Meshkov, who has asked Valeriy Astakhov, the current president of the Crimean Broadcasting Company, to resign. There are, however, no legal grounds for dismissing the latter or any other inconvenient radio and television journalists.
