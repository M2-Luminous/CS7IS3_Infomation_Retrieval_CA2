President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has sent a message to US Secretary of State Warren Christopher and received Bill Clinton's special envoy. All of this on the same day that the conference of the Angolan and Sao Tomean episcopate has again urged the warring parties to allow peace to return to Angola once and for all. So, international pressure is growing, with the UN Security Council due to pronounce on the future of UNAVEM-2 [United Nations Verification Mission] in four days' time. Our colleague Mario Ribeiro has heard the views of the two sides: [Ribeiro] [passage omitted] President Jose Eduardo dos Santos had a meeting today with Stephen Morrisson, President Bill Clinton's special envoy. No statements have been forthcoming but we have learned that Bill Clinton's envoy expressed the United States' commitment to helping Angola, but only after a nationwide cease-fire has been signed. Angolan presidential spokesman Aldomiro da Conceicao told Renascenca that the government is committed to the success of the Lusaka talks, but that UNITA is not: [Begin Conceicao recording] The government has made the concessions necessary for making it [success] possible, but, on the other hand, there must also be goodwill, and above all sincerity on our adversaries' part. [end recording] [Ribeiro] In Luanda today, at the close of the General Assembly of the conference of the Angolan and Sao Tomean episcopate, the bishops urged UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] and the government to come to an agreement and stop fighting once and for all. From Lusaka, UNITA's Jorge Valentim said this was precisely his movement's goal: [Begin Valentim recording] This appeal speaks of a big heart with room for all the Angolans. That is the kind of Angola we want, an Angola that does not discriminate against anyone. We want no more ostracism of the kind we endured last year. This is why national reconciliation must be discussed in great depth, and the exclusion law [as heard] must be abolished. And in government too, there must be no posts barred to UNITA.
