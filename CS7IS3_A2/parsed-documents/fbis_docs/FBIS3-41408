They spent a long time preparing to catch the drugs manufacturers. A KRIM-PRESS correspondent was told by Vasiliy Varlamov, a staffer at the Tatarstan Internal Affairs Ministry press center, that, having developed an original method, with no analogue abroad, for obtaining a very powerful narcotic--trimetilfentonil [as transliterated] (China white), the criminals shipped it from Russia to Azerbaijan and beyond. During the investigation new facts are continuing to be uncovered and additional arrests made. A new type of crime is on the rise in Tatarstan: Over the past year 300 people have been arrested in the republic. Confiscated from them were 400 kg of poppy stems, 10 kg of grass [zelenaya massa konopli], 15 kg of marijuana, 90 kg of opium, and medicines containing narcotic substances. The most terrible aspect of crime of this type is the participation of juveniles, who make up one tenth of those arrested.
