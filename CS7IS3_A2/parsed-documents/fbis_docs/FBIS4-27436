Members of the Minshu no Kaze intend to gather about 60 Dietmen from such parties as the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the Sakigake [Harbinger], and the Group Seiun. Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi, who recently announced his decision not to pursue his third reappointment as the governor, is also invited to the group to encourage his return to the Diet. The group probably intends to receive Yokomichi as a leader of liberals. The policy group is expected to be called the "Council on Concept of Democrat Government" (tentative name), and the first preparatory meeting will be held on 1 June. Members of the Minshu no Kaze and SDPJ Deputy Secretary General Masanori Goto have informally asked Governor Yokomichi to join the group. Some of them want to receive Yokomichi as the leader of the group when he comes back to the Diet. Asked about this at the Hokkaido Prefectural Government on the morning of 30 May, Governor Yokomichi avoided making clear comments on his own position in the group, saying: "They are not asking me to become the leader (of the policy group). Since the group is designed as a gathering of Diet members, I am not going to do something special in the group."
