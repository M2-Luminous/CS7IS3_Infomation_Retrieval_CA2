These lines of support were increased 500 percent after President Bill Clinton issued instructions to U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to bolster President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's monetary and economic policy. The finance secretary explained that the transactions revolving around Mexican foreign debt shares abroad experienced quite a drop when stock market operations opened in New York and London. This drop, however, was attenuated during the course of the day, in what was interpreted as a sign of confidence in the country's prompt stabilization. He said he felt conditions are right for national financial market operations to resume today after having been closed yesterday because of the decree declaring a national day of mourning. The stock market, banks, and money-exchange offices will observe regular hours today. The Mexican official explained that the reciprocal support agreements allow for granting lines of credit up to $1 billion, but that Secretary Bentsen advised him that this had now been increased to $6 billion. Aspe Armella noted that this aid strengthens the country's international foreign exchange reserves, which he regarded as "sufficient." He said "real stability is obtained at home" and noted that this year there will not be any fiscal deficit, according to the directives issued by President Salinas de Gortari aimed at ending his administration with an economy that is "growing, with solid reserves, order, vision, and direction." Analysts of Salomon Brothers, one of the five most important brokerage firms of the world, anticipated that they will recommend that U.S. and Mexican investors "not overturn the Mexican market" on account of the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate. They noted that in the coming days the Mexican Stock Market will experience "hectic days" with a low tendency, which will annul the progress achieved in the past two days. The offices of Standard and Poor's and Duff and Pheps in Mexico called an urgent meeting of their analysts to study the country's current situation so they will be able to orient investors' criteria in the coming days. Adequate Reserves To Avoid Speculation After meeting with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari yesterday, Miguel Mancero Aguayo, the general director of the Bank of Mexico, and Roberto Hernandez, the president of the Banamex [National Bank of Mexico] Accival [not further identified] Group, said the level of foreign exchange at the Central Bank is adequate and will avoid any speculation or disproportionate increase in dollars in the country. Interviewed at the official Los Pinos residence, both officials maintained that the country has the necessary stability. This stability is supported by its foreign exchange reserves and the certainty created by the ratification of the Stability, Competitiveness and Employment Pact (PECE). Roberto Hernandez asserted that rumors about an over demand for dollars are baseless and only seek to trigger speculation. The country's reserves are sufficiently strong to allow it to react to any factor that attempts to destabilize our economy. There are no real conditions that can weaken our currency, he said. When he spoke, Miguel Mancera Aguayo, who will be the first governor of the Bank of Mexico as of 1 April, said they are preparing an evaluation on the country's level of reserves to guarantee greater stability. In this way, he said, if there is a disproportionate demand for dollars today, Friday, we will have the necessary support to avoid abrupt movements that could hinder the country's economic growth. Furthermore, both officials stated that the Bill Clinton administration had begun a program yesterday to support any abrupt movement of foreign exchange in the country. Roberto Hernandez stated: "At this time, I would make a call to maintain our tranquility and objectivity with what is happening in the country. The advances and achievements are there and are supported by our economy. There is no reason to be concerned." They noted that there is a financial backing of up to $6 billion that will allow banking operations in the entire country to be carried out regularly today. Finally, Roberto Hernandez noted that Mexico's entry into OECD is recognition of the advances made by Carlos Salinas de Gortari in the area of economic policy.
