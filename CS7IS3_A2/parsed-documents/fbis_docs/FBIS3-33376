At the end of the first verifications they made of the Brazilian public accounts last week, they came to the conclusion that not even the zero operational deficit was achieved. The operational deficit includes financial spending, and to have a zero deficit it is necessary that the country achieve enough primary surplus to compensate for paying the debt interest. The government promised to achieve the zero operational deficit. The IMF really wants an operational surplus that, honestly speaking, is an unobtainable goal. But according to the verifications made by the IMF team, not even the promise made by the government is being fulfilled despite all the effort for the fiscal adjustment being debated in Congress. There is a good possibility that the Social Emergency Fund will be approved in the second round this week. Even the opposition congressmen admit they will have problems in bringing the 293 deputies needed to debate any amendments. The economic team only admits one problem: If new negotiations are needed, the government has nothing to yield. The team is preparing charts to clarify the Social Emergency Fund's final version. So many changes were made that even the deputies who take care of this matter in detail are confused about how the fund is made up. The charts will be distributed to the deputies by leader Luiz Carlos Santos. If this effort does open the way for an agreement with the IMF, part of Finance Minister Cardoso's strategy will be ruined.
