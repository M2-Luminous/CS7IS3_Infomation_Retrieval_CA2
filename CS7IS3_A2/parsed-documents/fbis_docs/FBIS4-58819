It was held at the al-Husayni Club in the town of al-Qusaybah in al-Nabatiyah. The seminar was attended by a member of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party's regional command, 'Ali Zayn Ghandur, who headed a delegation of the party's command in the south. The central labor representative of the Amal movement, Bassam Tulays, also attended, as did the members of Amal's command in the south; a delegation from the Syrian Social Nationalist Party; a number of officials; representatives from clubs and societies in the region; and the residents of the township. Minister al-Amin delivered a lecture in which he discussed the Arab-Israeli negotiations that started with the Madrid conference. He explained the various stages of these negotiations. Minister al-Amin then discussed the U. S. position, which promised to play the role of (?honest) broker in the talks. But the Israeli stand insisted that there cannot be negotiations with all the Arabs, but rather with every Arab country separately. Minister al-Amin added that President Hafiz al-Asad tried to rectify the situation by balancing out the negotiations after Yasir 'Arafat stepped out of the peace equation, took sides with Israel, and dealt Arab solidarity a blow in one of its most sensitive areas. The fact that 'Arafat stepped out of the peace process clearly weakened all the peace courses at every stage. In a public Israeli attempt to absorb the results of the Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton, Israel started trying to abort the results of this summit. The summit had concluded with one very clear fact: that the solution needs to be comprehensive and include all the occupied Arab territories. In other words, Israel must withdraw from all the occupied territories so that we can progress one step forward toward peace and eventually toward comprehensive peace. Yasir 'Arafat signed the agreement in Washington and does not have any idea what is awaiting the Palestinian people, added al-Amin. All that Yasir 'Arafat has gained is that Rabin, after a public appearance on TV, agreed to shake Yasir 'Arafat's hand after Clinton put pressure on him. During the second signing ceremony, the various stages of which we saw in the auditorium of the Conference Center in Cairo, a real theater piece was being acted out in front of us. This play has greatly harmed Palestinian and Arab dignity. Yasir 'Arafat, this great leader who compared himself to Mandela--the leader who has defeated the British Empire and realized independence for South Africa, all the rights for his people, and the world's recognition, as opposed to a dwarf called 'Arafat--has succeeded in acquiring an area of six square kms for the self-rule authority. This is the person who did not work in the interest of his own people who died in Lebanon. Minister al-Amin added that Gaza and Jericho will not be able to absorb the mortal remains of the Palestinians. The Israelis have given 'Arafat cemeteries, not dignity or a state. This is one aspect of the negotiations. The other aspect which pertains to you in the south since you are suffering daily from the destruction and effects of the aggression, the Lebanese Government--that is the cabinet and the Chamber of Deputies--still clings to its previous stand which says that Resolution 425 is the basis for every solution. As regards the part on Lebanon which is outside the framework of Resolution 425, no one can accept just any solution. If we find a solution that guarantees the dignity, security, freedom, sovereignty, and independence of our country other than Resolution 425, then we will abandon Resolution 425 and adopt this new resolution. But so far, we have not found anything that can guarantee the dignity, security, freedom, sovereignty, and independence of Lebanon other than Resolution 425. This is why we adhere to it. It is a clear text and has very clear articles and paragraphs. It is a text that stipulates the full, comprehensive, and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Lebanese territories to the internationally acknowledged borders of 1949. Resolution 425 sets a mechanism for implementing this solution by sending the UN Interim Force in Lebanon to supervise the Israeli withdrawal and the deployment of the Lebanese Army in place of the withdrawing Israeli army. In the past, the Israelis along with the West in general and the Americans in particular have found the excuse that Lebanon, as a result of the civil war, lost its state, authority, and the Army and is not capable of implementing Resolution 425. In other words, there is yet no Army in Lebanon capable of implementing Resolution 425. Minister al-Amin continues: Now the war has ended and there are no militias at all. If by militias they mean the Resistance, then we answer that the Resistance is not militias. It is Lebanon's peace-keeping force. It is the real peace force. The victory of the Resistance will undoubtedly be a victory for peace. The Resistance is not a militia nor does it have anything to do with militias.
