The summit may well come this or early next year after a series of inter-Korean exchanges across all sectors, after which the United States, Japan and other Western nations could improve relations with North Korea, he said. "The summit between the rulers of South and North Korea, President Kim Yong-sam and leader Kim Il-song, must be realized as soon as possible," Kim said in his keynote speech inaugurating his peace foundation for the Asia-Pacific region. "They must have the sense of spirit that a nation is the most important of all and erase misunderstanding and distrust to open the way for reconciliation and cooperation," he said. The very fact of the two leaders meeting some 50 years after national division would be a dramatic event, a monumental success, said Kim. People must solve all pending issues between them as fellow human beings of the same nation once the nuclear problem is resolved, Kim said, neighboring countries can only cooperate, not lead the Korean reunification process. Inter-Korean exchanges should start with possible economic tieups, then build up to family reunions, cultural and social exchanges, Kim suggested. "Peaceful coexistence requires continuous arms reduction and scrutinous inspection," said Kim. "It's important to create the conditions for peaceful coexistence and national reconciliation through these measures instead of military confrontation."
