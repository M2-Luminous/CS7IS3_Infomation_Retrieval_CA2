FBIS3-50031 "dreeu014__a94037" FBIS-EEU-94-014-A Document Type:Daily Report 21 January 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Weiss Comments on Hungarian Parties' Actions AU1701175894 Prague CTK in English 1319 GMT 17 Jan 94 AU1701175894 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Bratislava, Jan 17 (CTK) -- "The Party of the Democratic Left (SDL) is the most serious rival of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) and the Egyutteles movement in southern Slovakia, therefore all our efforts at solving the minority problem are unacceptable for their representatives," SDL Chairman Peter Weiss told CTK today. The MKDH and Egyutteles are Slovak parliamentary opposition parties representing the country's Hungarian minority (14 seats in the 150-seat Slovak parliament), the SDL is the strongest opposition party (28 seats). Weiss was reacting to the statements made recently by MKDH Chairman Bela Bugar, who had accused the SDL of being insincere. SDL representatives allegedly present accommodation stands on the ethnic minority problem, but on the other hand, "even after one year and one month, they were not able to take as stance towards the draft constitutional law on ethnic minorities presented to them by its creators from the MKDH and the Egyutteles" Bugar said at an MKDH press conference. "We have declared publicly that we could not accept the draft law due to its legal shortcomings. We agreed on bilateral talks with Hungarian representatives in order to consult our reservations at the level of experts. However, they submitted a bill to the parliament last June without consulting with us," Weiss said. He stressed that the ethnic minority problem could be solved neither if the parliamentary majority outvoted the minority, nor if the Hungarian minority tried to "make the remaining part of the parliament accept its views as the only correct and possible, and complained with the Council of Europe in case of their rejection." Weiss said he was surprised by the statement of Erno Rozsa, a deputy from the MKDH-Egyutteles coalition, that "all demands of the Hungarian minority will be met." Weiss asked whom the MKDH and the Egyutteles wanted to cooperate with, when they do not create conditions for cooperation with the SDL, the parliament's second strongest party, or with some other party. Slovakia would not be in the limelight abroad if the ethnic minority claims had been solved in a comprehensive way, on the basis of a certain state concept, which would have resulted in passing the mentioned constitutional law, Weiss said. "Representatives of the MKDH and Egyutteles made use of the Slovak Government's incoherent position to push through demands which will meet with political support in the Slovak parliament only with great difficulties," Weiss said, referring to the results of the meeting of Slovakia's ethnic Hungarian representatives in Komarno, south Slovakia, earlier this month. About 560,000 ethnic Hungarians (11 percent of the country's total population) live in southern Slovakia.
