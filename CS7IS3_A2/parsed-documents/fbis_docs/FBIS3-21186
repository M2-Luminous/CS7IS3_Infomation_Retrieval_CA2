(Naohiko Kumagai, president) will offer patent information services. It has developed KISPAT, a patent information service system using ISDN. It will begin a gazatte of patent applications in December and a patent announcement service in April 1994. This is related to the Patent Office's allowing re-publishing of its patent applications gazette as of January 1993 and its patent announcements as of January 1994. Kokusai Information Services, a joint venture between Mitsui and the telephone company KDD, will sell the database services. It will be the first patent database transmission service using ISDN in Japan. Most users of patent information only need about one to two percent of the available patent information. The Patent Office's CD-ROM includes much unnecessary information and time is needed to find the necessary information. Under the new system, the necessary information will be entered two days after the publication of the CD-ROM at one-third the cost. Moreover, not just the patent division, but also laboratories and individuals can access the original database from a PC. Japan is a ``patent kingdom.'' Our annual total of more than 500,000 patent and utility model applications make up about 40% of the world's total. The Patent Office has already been moving toward eliminating paper. In October 1992 it accepted the report of the information subcommittee of the Patent Office's Industrial Property Council and it began electronic publishing in CD-ROM form in January 1993 as well as allowing re-publishing of the electronic gazette. Mitsui decided this was a promising business, so it began developing a new system. The service will begin in December with the patent gazette which publishes patents one and a half years after application. In April 1994, following the Patent Office's permission granted as of January 1994, it will add the patent announcements which appear three months before a patent is granted.
