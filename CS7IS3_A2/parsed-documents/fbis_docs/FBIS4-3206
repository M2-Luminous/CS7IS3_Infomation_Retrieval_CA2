FBIS4-3206 "drchi075_n_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-075 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 Economic & Agricultural Economy Grows 9-10 Percent in First Quarter Economy Grows 9-10 Percent in First Quarter OW1804135494 Beijing XINHUA in English 1347 GMT 18 Apr 94 OW1804135494 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- In the first three months of this year, China's economy has grown at a rate of 9 to 10 percent. Ye Zhen, spokesman for the State Statistics Bureau, giving this figure today, said that basically the economy had reached the expected goal of the government's macro control efforts. Ye said at a press conference that in the first quarter the gross domestic product was 862 billion yuan, up 12.7 percent, in terms of constant prices, on the same period last year. But the proportion of agriculture was usually fairly low in the first quarter, while that of industry was comparatively high. If this seasonal factor is taken into consideration, the present growth rate of the economy should be 9 to 10 percent. He said that the comprehensive appraisal of the country's economy has shifted from the juncture of "red light" and "yellow light" to the present juncture of "yellow light" and "green light" -- meaning that the economy has cooled down to a proper condition. The speeds of production, construction and sales, which had been increasing too fast, have begun to fall to some extent. In the first quarter, the industrial increased value is 533 billion yuan, an increase of 16 percent over the same period last year, with light industry increasing faster than heavy industry. Energy production increased steadily, and the coastal areas increased faster than inland areas. Due to the slowing down of industrial production, the strained conditions of energy and raw materials supplies, as well as the "bottle-necks" in transport, have been alleviated to different degrees, Ye said. He said that state-owned enterprises completed investments of 81.5 billion yuan in fixed assets in the first quarter, up 36.2 percent over the same period last year, but it is 34.5 percent lower than the growth rate of the same period last year. By the end of March, the total volume of retail sales of social consumption goods was 352.2 billion yuan, up 25.2 percent on the same period last year. With the factor of price rises considered, the actual increase was 4.2 percent. He said that in the present market, about 90 percent of the goods were enjoying balanced supply and demand, except some agricultural produce and by-products which are in short-supply. With the country's economic development and the processing of wage reform in administrative departments and institutions, the income and living conditions of urban and rural residents have been constantly improved. In the first quarter, the per capita monthly income for urban residents increased 35.5 percent over the same period last year, while the cash income of rural residents increased 31.1 percent. With the factor of price increases considered, the actual rises were 9.3 percent and 13.1 percent, respectively. Ye said that at the moment there was no centralized, large-scale "hot spot" for consumption. As a result, many residents have been using their spare money to buy stocks, bonds or simply put it in the bank.
