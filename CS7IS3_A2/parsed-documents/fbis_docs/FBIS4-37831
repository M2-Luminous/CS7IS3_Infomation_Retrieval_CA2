Good morning, Mr. Yitzhaq Rabin. [Rabin] Good morning to you and to the listeners. [Engel] Sir, two years ago you spoke about the need to change the national order of priorities. If not a top priority, at least the most talked about issue at the moment is Syria. You warned yesterday about what might befall us if a peace agreement is not reached with the Syrians. We would like to hear from you this morning about what is happening in reality rather than about what might happen. Do you foresee a development on the Syrian channel in the next few weeks? [Rabin] I believe the dialogue with Syria will continue. I am sorry, though, that it will continue indirectly, through the Americans, in a bid to reach a direct dialogue. I doubt that the Syrians are currently ready for any other form of contacts, which would be the best way to advance the political process. [Gazit] Sir, having said that, you uttered very harsh words yesterday about Syria and the possibility of war within a few years if there is no change in the situation. Should we infer from it that the Syrian channel is still stuck and going nowhere? [Rabin] The problem is not that we want war. We want peace, and in order to attain it, we are prepared to make painful compromises. At the same time, I am sorry to hear that in an address to the Zionist Executive, a Likud leader asserted that the Arab world no longer has a military option. This is an illusion. We had better learn from our bitter experience: Three months before the Six-Day War, nobody thought there would be a war in 1967; two weeks before the Yom Kippur War, nobody thought there would be a war. Those who think a military option no longer exists have no right to apply for the generous U.S. aid and should not put everything into building up the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] in order to have a strong army. Although we must first and foremost prevent a war, if it is forced on us, we must win it. The government's policy, therefore, is to search for any possible way to attain peace from a position of strength and by nurturing Israel's military might, which is a condition for its existence and the security of its population. This is also the condition for peace, because nobody will negotiate with a militarily weak Israel. That is why we act on both levels. Two years ago today, Labor emerged from the elections to the 13th Knesset as the largest party in Israel. The factions affiliated with it in the Knesset constitute a buffer against the establishment of another government, even if all the right-wing and religious parties were to unite. Moreover, we changed the national order of priorities. We stopped throwing money away on the political settlements in the territories and transferred it to education. The education budget was augmented by an amount unprecedented in the past 15 years, because education is the key to the future of our sons, the future of the young generation, and the future of the State of Israel. We invested in the transportation infrastructure in order to make up for 25 years of neglect. Israel lagged behind every modern country in terms of its transportation infrastructure. Without such an infrastructure, it will be impossible to bring the Negev and the Galilee closer to the center of the country. The problem is not bringing Ari'el closer to the center of Israel, because it is already close geographically. The issue is expanding and developing the Galilee and the Negev. We fought unemployment. When we assumed power two years ago, the rate of unemployment among Soviet immigrants stood at 29 percent, while in May 1994 it was 14 percent. General unemployment in Israel totaled 11.2 percent two years ago and 8.2 percent in May 1994 -- a 3-percent decrease. We are almost back to the level that existed prior to the wave of immigration that started in 1989. [Engel] Sir, is there anything you regret, any disappointing moments in the past two years? [Rabin] There always are unpleasant moments, but when I look at the general picture, I would say that we scored many achievements. This does not mean that we achieved everything. If there is anything I regret, it is the enormous gap between what has actually been achieved by the government and the way this is being perceived by the people, either through the media or the feeling among various sectors of the population. I think this government will bring about reforms, new approaches, and an organizational restructuring of many spheres of life in Israel. [Gazit] Sir, you may be reaping the fruit of the I-will-lead government [alluding to Rabin's victory speech in June 1992] in the political sphere, but you are paying a very high price in the domestic arena. Your party is experiencing a very serious crisis. Do you think there is room for reaching any conclusions? Should we expect a more serene and reconciled second half? [Rabin] I hope so. I am not blaming anybody, except some of our institutions, which worked in a certain way for many years; I am primarily referring to the Histadrut labor federation. By not voting for us as they did in the past, the people seemingly wanted to teach us a very painful lesson. Lessons must be learned from such a blow. It is a pity that instead of everybody learning their lesson, there is bickering. We will learn our lesson and rectify what can be rectified. [Engel] Your party colleagues talk about an erosion in your standing and a drop in the government's popularity. What is your response to this? [Rabin] I was given a mandate in the Knesset elections. I have no doubt that the results of the Labor's primaries, which determined that I should lead the list, brought about a result Labor was not able to obtain in 17 years. I will not judge our policy and its implementation according to weekly, monthly, or bimonthly public opinion polls. My criteria is what we will achieve in our term, in our full four years in power, and not the transient moods reflected in public opinion polls. The voters will test us in the next scheduled elections. We will be judged in the next Knesset elections, which will be held as scheduled. [Engel] Sir, thank you very much for this interview. [Rabin] Thank you.
