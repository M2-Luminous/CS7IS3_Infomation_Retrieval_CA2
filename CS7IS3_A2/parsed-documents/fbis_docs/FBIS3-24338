The people of Russia, who in 1991 elected a president in a nationwide election and then reaffirmed their confidence in his course in the April referendum, in October 1993 once again rejected the reactionary alternative for our country's development. They expressed their support for Russia's transformation into a law-governed state and for making democracy and peaceful aspirations the basis for our country's domestic and foreign policy here on the eve of the 21st century. Only affirmation of a democratic state can provide a reliable guarantee for citizens' rights and the dynamic social and economic development of society. Only by this means is it possible to affirm that our country is a normal great power and to realize its interests not through confrontation but instead through cooperation in the West, East and South. From the very start, the new Russia's diplomats have turned sharply away from service to the totalitarian system and attempts to restructure it, going instead in the direction of aiding the radical transformation of society and protection of our state's national interests and human rights and liberties, especially those of our countrymen. This change has taken place under difficult circumstances. These included not only the understandable difficulties of carrying out economic and political reforms in a gigantic country with a multiethnic population and serious regional differences. We also faced the task of coping with major foreign policy tasks: to eliminate in actuality and not just in words the heavy burden of the Cold War, which divided humanity into opposing blocs; to ensure foreign political and economic support for Russian reforms; and to surround Russia with a zone of good-neighborliness and cooperation. And all this had to be done in extremely short order. This was dictated by the logic of struggle against the forces of the past. It was essential that reforms be quickly carried through to the point at which a return to the old system would become impossible. The dynamic nature of events and the element of spontaneity in their development necessitated a constant readiness to engage in tactical maneuvers which by their very nature assume not only gains, but also the possibility of losses, even including the loss of former allies in the struggle for reform. However, the most important things are confidence in the correctness of the chosen path and a strategic course toward consistent transformation of society and entry on that basis into the community of the most developed democratic states -- all that remains unchanged. The first three years of the new Russia's foreign policy have been a major historical period that combines its stages with the specific objectives and tactics inherent in each of them. The chronology begins with B. N. Yeltsin's election as RSFSR Supreme Soviet chairman on 28 May 1990. The main thrust of political and diplomatic activity by Russia's leaders at that stage was the struggle to achieve state sovereignty and independence for the Russian Federation. It was necessary to create a new state based not on the monopolistic dominance of any one ideology, but rather on the supremacy of the values of democracy and law. Russia's declaration of state sovereignty on 12 June 1990 falls within this period. I clearly recall numerous discussions at the time about a concept of Russia's national and state interests and about the orientation of its foreign policy. The discussion stage passed quickly. By approximately October 1990 Russia's leaders had set a course toward ensuring Russia's independent entry into the international arena, something that proclamation of our country's sovereignty was intended to reinforce. The foundation chosen for the concept of Russia's security and foreign policy was the goal of reviving our country as a great power by overcoming the dominance of the imperial-totalitarian system and creating a law-governed, democratic and federative state. In the process we assumed that the vital interests of Russia's people include, firstly, development of friendly relations with the people of the other republics in the renewed Union and, secondly, accession to a proper place in the community of civilized peoples in Eurasia and America. One distinctive feature of Russian foreign policy was to be a common sense-dictated renunciation of ideological schemes and messianic ambitions on a global scale in favor of realism in the assessment of Russia's needs and in favor of specific appropriate actions. The support for this would come not only from our country's own strength, but also from its commonality of interests with the interests of the other republics which at the time comprised the USSR. It was precisely these objectives that determined the nature of the first foreign policy steps taken by Russia in 1990. On 19 November the RSFSR signed a treaty with Ukraine, on 21 November with Kazakhstan, and on 18 December with Belarus. The signatories to those treaties recognized each other as sovereign states and stated their intention to develop their interstate relations based on the principles of equality, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, renunciation of the use of force, and other commonly accepted standards of international law. The signatories also agreed to exchange diplomatic delegations. Even at this stage in the emergence of relations with the future members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Russia strove to orient its treaty relations with them toward comprehensive development, not toward disintegration of ties within the boundaries of the then-existing USSR. This was expressed in treaty stipulations concerning the importance of a collective security system, interaction and coordination on foreign policy, creation of a common economic space, and close cooperation in the fields of transportation, communications, migration policy, the environment and anti-crime efforts. At that time revival of the Russian State was envisioned within the framework of a renewed Union of Sovereign States. Therefore there is no way that it can be claimed that by Russia seeking its own voice in the area of foreign policy it radically departed from the international course of the then-existing USSR, with perhaps the exception of the area of human rights. On the contrary, that search was actually aimed at preserving unity of interests among the republics of the USSR. Renewal of the Union, we sincerely believed at the time, could be made to fit quite well within the framework of the Novoogarev process. Russian leaders' approach during that period was notable for its great flexibility and a willingness to tolerate even a lack of complete internal sovereignty for Russia, even though by that time its sovereignty in international affairs in no way differed from the sovereignty of the central USSR government. Russia played a constructive role in maintaining common ground between the independent states that subsequently established the Commonwealth. This active binding role on the part of Russia during the emergence of the CIS appears even more obvious as that turbulent period in history recedes into the past. But even then the idea that Russia could and to all appearances would become the successor to the USSR gradually came to have practical meaning for our foreign partners. Meetings and talks with the heads of the world's leading countries at their initiative during visits to Moscow began to occupy a large part of B. N. Yeltsin's work schedule. The theme of a majority of these talks was acknowledgement of the efforts made by Russia to achieve understanding of the realities of a nuclear world on the part of the union republics with weapons of mass destruction deployed in their territory. The importance of those efforts increased against the backdrop of the then-unclear effects of the Union's likely disintegration. The counterparts also approved of Russia's willingness to assume the role of the only state to have nuclear weapons deployed within its territory in the event that the USSR collapsed. This upsurge in the Russian leadership's foreign policy activism helped improve its international standing. This prompted the increasing displeasure of and then resistance from the central USSR government. In addition, more and more open resistance began to be offered by reactionary forces in the state apparatus. Even at that stage the Russian leadership was very concerned over the emergence, with the active assistance of those forces, of conflict situations in various regions of the USSR, in particular in the Baltic region, South Ossetia, Azerbaijan and Armenia. Statements and decrees by the highest governmental bodies in the RSFSR concerning the situation in the Baltic region (12 January 1991), the situation in South Ossetia (31 March 1991) and the situation in Azerbaijan and Armenia are evidence of the Russian leadership's efforts to resolve those situations by legal, democratic means. The conflict between the forces of democracy and totalitarianism increased sharply in the summer of 1991. B. N. Yeltsin's election by a nationwide vote on 12 June 1991 to serve as president of a sovereign and independent Russia was perceived by those supporting a return to the old order as an alarm signal. At this stage the primary orientation of the Russian leadership's foreign policy course was protection of Russia's international standing and its ties with foreign states against attacks on them by domestic political opponents. It was important to neutralize the threat of Russia's isolation in the event of an attempt to set up a dictatorship and to prevent an eruption of international confrontation, which could well have happened as a result of the bitter clashes between the forces of democracy and totalitarianism in the USSR. These objectives also determined the orientation of the tactical course in Russia's foreign policy up to the time of the coup. Critics then and now of the new Russia's foreign policy course have accused the RSFSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs of seeking to "break up the Union." Such claims could not be any farther from the truth. Russia's leaders were actively involved in the drafting of the "Treaty on a Union of Sovereign Republics." However, the negotiation process leading to establishment of a union of independent, democratic states was interrupted by the coup of August 1991. The forces of the past sought to halt democratic reforms, take the country back to Cold War-era confrontation and essentially place it in a position of international isolation. Those alarming days in August clearly demonstrated the resolve and energy of Russia's first president, who organized and headed democratic forces' repulse of the coup plotters' actions. Around the world the symbols of those events were B. N. Yeltsin's appeal to the people of Moscow from atop a tank in front of the White House and the president's meetings with foreign politicians and diplomats seeking to demonstrate the democratic world's solidarity with the people of Russia. The situation became so difficult that by the end of the day on 19 August the decision had been made to dispatch the RSFSR minister of foreign affairs to France with instructions to form a "government in exile" if necessary. Fortunately the crisis ended in the complete defeat of the coup plotters and reinforcement of the democratic trend in our country's political life. In international terms the most notable fact was that during the coup virtually all the developed countries supported Russia. In the period immediately following the coup the primary objective of Russian diplomacy was to win broad international support for the actions of the Russian Federation's leaders, who found themselves virtually the only real power in the country. A clear trend toward disintegration of the Union appeared. The reason for this was the collapse of its old structure and the weakness of the new, democratic institutions that were still just emerging. Under these conditions only Russia could prevent the uncontrolled collapse of ties between the republics that comprised the USSR. Until the last possible moment Russia's leaders fought for a union treaty and attempted to keep the Novoogarev process going. Those who blame Russia for the "collapse" of the USSR are blaming the wrong people. The end of the old Union was brought about solely by those who organized a coup to "protect" it: the party nomenklatura, which rallied around the State Committee for the State of Emergency. With the end of the USSR's existence began a new stage of affirmation of Russian foreign policy as the policy of a sovereign great power, the legal successor to the USSR. As of January 1992 Russia had been recognized by 131 states. The country's leaders assigned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the task of drafting and implementing a new course in the international arena. In a speech to a session of the MFA Board on 27 October 1992 B. N. Yeltsin defined the principal objectives of Russian diplomacy thus: to ensure favorable external conditions for the political and economic reforms that had been begun, elimination of the legacy of the Cold War, and complete dismantling of confrontational structures left over from the past. The top priority in Russia's foreign policy was the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a new form of voluntary and equal cooperation between the republics of the former USSR. On 8 December 1991 an agreement establishing the CIS was signed in Minsk. The original members were the RSFSR, Ukraine and Belarus, which were later joined by Kazakhstan and a number of other republics. Russia's position of active support for the Commonwealth immediately gave the CIS a firm foundation. Of fundamental importance was the signing on 21 December 1991 of an agreement between the RSFSR, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan concerning measures to deal with the nuclear weapons deployed in their territory. In accordance with that document the right to use nuclear weapons was turned over to the president of Russia. That step helped maintain strategic stability in the world and strengthened the confidence of the international partners of Russia and the other CIS states in the course set by Commonwealth members in international affairs. Despite the difficult and contradictory nature of its origin, the CIS has become a political and economic reality of the modern world. A solid foundation of treaty law has been created for the CIS. At a meeting of heads of CIS states in Minsk in January 1993 the Commonwealth Charter was approved. The significance of that document lies primarily in the fact that it opens up the possibility of deeper cooperation for those CIS countries that genuinely strive for that. But neither does it exclude from the Commonwealth those who are still wavering, permitting them to participate in cooperation in forms and degrees which they find acceptable. Thus the idea of a "variable-speed," multi-option Commonwealth put forward by B. N. Yeltsin found not only support but also legal expression in Minsk. The standing executive body of the CIS -- the Coordinating and Consultative Committee -- began functioning. More than 30 interstate, intergovernmental and interagency bodies were established to coordinate the activities of Commonwealth members in a broad range of fields ranging from foreign policy to environmental protection. Meetings between CIS heads of state and heads of government are becoming increasingly businesslike. Russia's partners are ridding themselves, though not without difficulty, of the euphoria that accompanied their first months of independence and are demonstrating a growing understanding of the importance of maintaining and developing integrating ties within the CIS. Stronger reintegration trends allowed a number of Commonwealth members to establish the Economic Union in 1993 and begin creating a new type of ruble zone. Of course, these processes are not without difficulty. However, Russia's leaders are working patiently to coordinate economic and financial interests within the framework of the CIS. Adherence to the principles of equal rights and mutual benefit will allow members of the Commonwealth to create a solid foundation for integration. The emergence of independent states in place of the former USSR has raised the issue of their admission to the Council on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Russian diplomats have actively supported that option. There have also been some skeptics among the participants in the European process, and we have had to change the minds of these. Admission of the Central Asian and Transcaucasus republics to the CSCE was a step of strategic significance both to those countries and in terms of the development of the European process. The new CSCE members have accepted moral and political obligations to pursue a policy in keeping with high international standards in the area of protection for human rights. This is a powerful additional incentive that will help the values of democracy take root in the post-Soviet space. One important aspect of Russia's policy in the "near abroad" is protection for the rights of the Russian-speaking population living there. Our long-term goal is creation within the CIS of a unified legal space that will encourage compliance with internationally recognized rights and liberties for individuals and ethnic, religious and other minorities. At the initiative of Russian diplomats the decision was made to establish a Human Rights Commission within the Commonwealth. Russia favors adoption of a "Declaration of Human Rights in the CIS States." In bilateral relations with its CIS partners the primary goal of Russian diplomacy has been to conclude treaties regarding mutual protection for the interests of citizens in the signatories' territory, the right to freely choose citizenship, the rights of ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious minorities, and the terms of citizens' emigration to other states. One focus of particular alarm and concern among the leaders of Russia and the Russian Federation MFA has been the status of our fellow citizens and countrymen in the Baltic countries, particularly Estonia and Latvia. Russia's democrats, who during the period of CPSU rule staunchly defended the right of the Baltic peoples to reestablish historical justice, now on the very same grounds favor a civilized, just approach to the rights of those countries' Russian-speaking population. The issue of protection for human rights is on the agenda of our talks with representatives of the Baltic countries at all levels, including the highest level. Russian diplomacy is also mobilizing international organizations and institutions -- the U.N., the CSCE and the Council of Europe -- in support of human rights in the Baltic countries. A certain positive effect on the situation, particularly in Estonia, has resulted from the efforts of the CSCE Supreme Commissar for Ethnic Minority Affairs. Liberating the peoples of the former USSR from the totalitarian past has been a difficult and at times painful process, one accompanied in many regions by outbreaks of aggressive nationalism. The result has been the emergence of a number of conflict situations which directly threaten Russia's national security interests. As of the end of 1993 approximately two million refugees had entered our country, in particular from regions where interethnic clashes are occurring. Aiding these people would be a difficult economic burden for any state and in particular for Russia, which is currently going through a transition period. It is not only those directly involved that are the victims of ethnic conflicts, but also ethnic minorities, including the Russian-speaking minority, which has become an object of persecution and sometimes of outright ethnic purges. Local conflicts have become the suppliers of organized crime in Russia. No civilized state can tolerate an increase in such threats literally on its own doorstep. The nationalist patriots, particularly those among the members of the Supreme Soviet, have persistently demanded that Russia's leaders solve the problem of conflicts along Russia's perimeter using old imperial methods, i.e. military force and dictates to sovereign states. That course, which threatens to bring on the collapse of the Commonwealth and the emergence of a ring of hostile states around Russia, has been firmly rejected by our country's leaders. Instead, emphasis has been placed on a policy of active peacemaking that includes preventive diplomacy to avoid conflicts, arbitration and the conducting of peacekeeping operations. Our country's president has been an active participant in the pursuit of Russia's peacekeeping course in the post-Soviet space. In particular, widespread acclaim and approval by the international community greeted B. N. Yeltsin's initiatives to settle the Karabakh conflict. The Russian leadership is urging the parties to the conflict to cease military clashes immediately, withdraw all military units to the positions held by them prior to violation of the ceasefire, and come to Moscow to sign an agreement on complete and comprehensive cessation of military operations. Russian diplomats are actively involved in peacekeeping efforts. The minister of foreign affairs has already made several trips to "hot spots" from Abkhazia to Tajikistan. Special Russian presidential representatives are working to bring about a solution to conflicts in the Transcaucasus region. It was mainly at our initiative that the CIS began to reorient itself toward more active peacekeeping efforts. Specifically, the decision was made to create collective CIS peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan. However, thus far the main burden of peacekeeping efforts in the former USSR has been borne by Russia. There are 20,000 Russian military personnel taking part in peacekeeping operations in three republics: Moldova, Georgia and Tajikistan. Not everything has gone smoothly by any means, but the only alternative to Russian peacekeeping would be the loss of Russian ties and influence in the "near abroad" that have come into being over centuries. That means there is only one solution: qualitative improvement of our forces protecting the peace in "hot spots." The peacekeeping operations currently being conducted by Russia are in keeping with the objectives and principles of peacekeeping as set forth in the U.N. Charter. Russian peacekeeping forces are present in all areas at the request of legitimate governments and with the consent of all parties to the conflict. Yes, we do have to resort to peacekeeping methods that are not traditional for the U.N. That includes participation in peacekeeping operations by forces from neighboring states (mainly Russia itself) and even by the parties to the conflict. But this practice has proven its effectiveness in the Dniester region and in South Ossetia, where no blood has been shed in over a year. It would be simply unreasonable to reject this as "incorrect." Therefore at the 48th session of the U.N. General Assembly Russian diplomats urged the international community to provide active support for our peacekeeping efforts. Specifically, we expressed support for the creation of a voluntary fund to aid peacekeeping efforts in the former USSR. The Russian leadership has subordinated its approach to democratic states in West and East to the goal of establishing partnership relations with them, and over the long term alliance relationships. That guideline has from the very first days after the USSR ceased to exist helped prompt the democratic world to undertake active efforts in support of the reform process in Russia and the other CIS countries. In late January 1992 Washington was the scene of a coordinating conference on assistance to the newly independent states that had emerged out of the former Soviet Union. There were 47 states and seven leading international economic organizations participating. In his message to those attending the conference, B. N. Yeltsin expressed Russia's desire to achieve genuine economic and social revitalization through stimulation of broad business cooperation with all interested partners. The course toward the building of new relations with the outside world was also reflected in Russian diplomats' first steps at the highest level. In this context the most major events were participation by Russia's president in a U.N. Security Council session in January 1992 and his visits to England, the United States and Canada. From the U.N. podium Russia's leader declared that Russia was joining the world community as a firm and consistent supporter of freedom, democracy and humanism. B. N. Yeltsin expressed support for a decisive reduction in strategic offensive weapons and tactical nuclear weapons, a complete ban on nuclear testing, substantial reductions in conventional weapons, a ban on chemical and bacteriological weapons and creations of a Europe-wide collective security system. In London, at Camp David and in Ottawa declarations were signed on the prospects for partnership between Russia and England, the United States and Canada. Those documents set forth for the first time the fundamentally new foundations, free of ideological confrontation, of our relations with states that were counted by the Soviet leadership among "potential opponents." The key stages in the further complete dismantling of the Cold War legacy were the signing of the Russian-American Charter of Partnership and Friendship (June 1992), which stated that "increases in the wealth, prosperity and security of a democratic Russian Federation and the United States of America are vitally interconnected," and conclusion of the SALT II Treaty (December 1992). The Russian-American summit meeting in Vancouver (April 1993) focused, for the first time in the history of relations between Moscow and Washington, not on ways of overcoming confrontation, but instead on ways of laying the groundwork for economic interaction. A similar breakthrough was also achieved in Russia's relations with the other leading developed states of the world -- France, England, Germany and Italy. Patient work began on genuine normalization of relations with Japan based on the principles of law and justice. On the basis of political partnership it became possible to shift Russia's relations with those states to a frank and intensive dialogue on financial and economic issues. The previous topic of how to eliminate the threat of global war was replaced as central issue by problems pertaining to Russia's access to markets, including markets in high-tech products, nuclear materials and space services. Russian diplomats were among the initiators of a decisive reinforcement of the CSCE, a unique tool for strengthening peace and preventing conflicts in the North Atlantic region. The foundations of this approach to the European process were laid out by B. N. Yeltsin during a meeting of heads of state and heads of government from the CSCE member countries in Helsinki on 9-10 July 1992. Concretizing that approach, Russian diplomats put forward at the Rome session of the CSCE Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs (November 1993) extensive proposals aimed at increasing the effectiveness of CSCE organs, stepping up the Conference's peacekeeping functions and more closely coordinating efforts in the field of protection for human rights and the rights of ethnic minorities, with preventive CSCE diplomacy in Europe's conflicts zones. One important aspect of Russia's European policy has been active participation in new regional associations such as the Council on Barents-Eurarctic Cooperation, the Council of Baltic Sea States and Black Sea Economic Cooperation. In this area as well our goal is to utilize the opportunities offered by those organizations to create a zone of good-neighborliness around Russia. It has proven possible to achieve a genuine breakthrough in Russia's relations with the countries of Eastern Europe. Visits by Russia's president to Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have made it possible not only to clear away old -- sometimes prewar -- debris from our bilateral relations, but also, and most importantly, to lay down a fundamentally new foundation for our relations with the new democracies. Yet there also remains much to be done in that area, particularly in terms of developing trade and economic ties with the region. Generally speaking, in contrast to many other powers, particularly the West, in its present circumstances Russia does not rely so much on economic ties and leverage in its foreign policy as it uses policy to compensate for its foreign economic weakness. Russian diplomacy, guided by the ideas of peacemaking, has been actively involved in international efforts to resolve the conflict in former Yugoslavia. Our actions, undertaken in close coordination with other parties to a resolution of the Yugoslavian situation, are aimed at establishing peace as quickly as possible in Bosnia-Herzegovina and normalizing relations between the republics of the former SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. The dynamic creation of new relations with the states of the West has by no means caused a "pro-Western slant" in Russian diplomacy, a charge often levelled by national-patriotic politicians. Entry into partnership relations with the United States and the countries of Western Europe is occurring in parallel with greater Russian attention to the East. One landmark on that path was a visit by Russia's president to China. In a joint declaration adopted by the two countries, Russia and China recognized each other as friendly states. A mutual interest was expressed in the equal and ongoing nature of bilateral relations, without any geopolitical alliance but also without relapses into confrontation. The visit laid down a solid foundation for development of relations in trade, science, technology, personnel training and military affairs. Talks have been stepped up regarding reduction of armed forces along the border and clearer definition of the border's location. This has helped further strengthen the spirit of mutual trust and businesslike partnership in Russian-Chinese relations. Russia's relations with another great Asian country, India, have gotten off to a new start. The treaty of friendship and cooperation signed during highest-level Russian-Indian talks in New Delhi in January 1993, while retaining all the positive things that existed in relations between the USSR and India, also puts those relations on a basis of mutual benefit and frees them of the logic of geopolitical alliances pitting some countries against others, as had previously been imposed by Moscow. Russian diplomats have also succeeded in "opening up" the ASEAN countries, the Persian Gulf and the Republic of South Africa for business cooperation and new partnerships. The emergence of the foreign policy of Russia as an independent state has required major organizational and personnel reinforcement of the Russian diplomatic service. An important step in this regard was the creation of an updated Russian diplomatic service in October 1990, as well as the introduction of the institution of Russian representation in the USSR's foreign institutions and delegations in the spring of 1991. The staff of the former USSR MFA, like all of Soviet society, was excessively ideologically oriented. For many decades Soviet diplomacy was in effect a part of the CPSU Central Committee's International Department. Consistent efforts to get rid of the burden of old stereotypes and stagnant mindsets began after the merger of the RSFSR MFA apparatus with the USSR MFA in late 1991. That process was made easier by the fact that the Russian MFA had already removed all party structures in August 1991. Simultaneously with this reorganization of the diplomatic service a course was set toward increasing its professionalism. The ministry's apparatus was reoriented toward protecting Russia's national and state interests as Russia underwent a time of revolutionary changes. An exceptionally important role was played by the fact that as of February 1992 the Russian Federation MFA and a number of other key ministries have been administered directly by our country's president in order to ensure more timely solutions to foreign policy issues. This practice has won Russia's foreign policy broad recognition and respect abroad. By the spring of 1992 the reorganization of the diplomatic apparatus on the basis of the Russian MFA was complete. This made it possible to create an integrated foreign policy mechanism and bring new, democratic blood into the diplomatic service. The Russian MFA has always striven for cooperation with the Supreme Soviet, providing it with all possible support in the development of interparliamentary relations. Within the ministry's structure a special administration has been established to handle relations with the Supreme Soviet and with political and public organizations. However, over time the Supreme Soviet came to be dominated by openly anti-reform forces. They focused their efforts on confrontation with the executive branch and resistance to the reform policy. The situation was further exacerbated by the efforts of certain individuals in the Supreme Soviet leadership to conduct "personal" foreign policy. This threatened to have severe effects on our relations with Ukraine and a number of other CIS states, threatened Russia's ability to function as a partner in disarmament negotiations such as SALT II, and disturbed Russia's relations with the countries of Eastern Europe. The explosive nature of the situation in Russia was clearly evident to those attending a session of the CSCE's Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs in Stockholm in December 1992. The dramatic reaction abroad to my presentation of a number of points from the platforms of what were by no means the most extreme right-wing movements and forces in Russia gave food for thought about the profound isolation -- probably like in 1917 -- in which our country would find itself should they come to power. Stockholm also demonstrated the effective absence of any non-imperialist, neo-Atlantic alternative as has been speculatively put forward by politicians of a "moderate" orientation. Additional organizational measures undertaken at the president's initiative have strengthened the ministry's position in its area of jurisdiction within the system of federal executive bodies. Specifically, in November 1992 a presidential directive assigned to the MFA coordination of a unified foreign policy course, though that goal is still far from realization -- differences among the approaches of various ministries and agencies, and in some cases "ministerial politicians," particularly in "hot spots," are seriously undermining Russia's strategic positions. Everything that has been achieved in the field of foreign policy (plus some losses and some tactical failures) are the result of the Russian leadership's pursuit of Russia's national and state interests. The events of October 1993 graphically demonstrated the efforts of those who oppose reforms to slow their steady progress. The decisive position taken at that time by Russia's president received broad international support. The adoption of the Constitution and creation of the Federal Assembly should provide a new impetus for the implementation of full-scale reforms and take the country to new heights in international politics.
