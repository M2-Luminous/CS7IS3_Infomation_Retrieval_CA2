Contact methods (CTD-photography, track measurements) and remote methods (IR radiometry, acoustic Doppler measurement of current speed, satellite sound backscattering studies) were used. The characteristics of fronts and associated phenomena (meanders and eddies) are studied. A significant correlation between hydrophysical and acoustic characteristics is detected. Surveying was done with 63 hydrological stations in a quasi-rectangular gird of nine meridional segments, each with seven stations 10 miles apart. The depth of the studied region was 200-350 m. Temperature and salinity gradients at the surface across the front reached 0.5ï¿½C/km and 0.15 0/00. Data on individual mesoscale meanders are presented. Eddy regions displayed the most significant curving of isolines. Maximum sound scattering values, 10-20 dB, were found at 90-200 m. At 50-90 m the contrast was 10-12 dB; below 200 m the contrast was no more than 4-6 dB. Analysis of echolocation measurements indicate the existence of mesoscale structures in the sound scattering field. Characteristic horizontal scales of regions with quasi-homogeneous scattering properties were 20-40 km, which matches the dimensions of dynamic formations. The transition regions between these zones have high gradients and the spatial configuration had the structural and dynamic features of a thermohaline field. Consequently, one can monitor mesoscale dynamic formations with echolocation equipment on a moving ship or on ocean bottom platforms. Figures 5; references 13: 8 Russian, 5 Western.
