Wichit Suphinit said the Bank of Thailand would in July evaluate all economic indicators for the first half of the year to determine the need for policy changes. The bank will also evaluate whether domestic production capacity will have an effect on long-term inflation. "We have to see if there is sufficient domestic capacity to meet local demand." Inflation has become the bank's priority concern since the May consumer price index rose to 5.1 per cent compared with the same period last year. Increases in crude oil prices, food prices and non-food items led by education and recreation costs have contributed to higher prices. The inflation rate measured on the moving 12-month average was up 0.2 percentage points in May from April to 3.9 per cent. Wichit has identified excessive credit extension by commercial banks as the main cause of higher inflation. Credit extension by all banks in the first four months of the year grew 24 per cent compared with the target of 21 per cent for the entire year. Roengchai Marakanon, deputy central bank governor, has identified higher spending on personal consumption and recreation as accounting for about 40 per cent of the higher inflation rate. Another 40 per cent was attributable to higher agricultural prices given the world recovery in commodities. The higher cost of labour and oil is believed to account for a further 14 per cent of the increased inflation rate. Savings during the same period grew less than the target. The actual growth figure in the first four months was 14 per cent compared with the target of 19 per cent. Wichit said the Bank of Thailand has already signalled commercial banks to raise interest rates which he added would take two to six months to work through the economy. He said the central bank will have to wait and see if higher interest rates would cut consumer spending and boost savings. But he did not see higher interest rates dampening investment given that companies can borrow externally at more favourable rates. -- The government is working on a draft "White Paper" which will serve as the basis for the upcoming 8th National Plan, Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchapak said yesterday. But first it has to analyse the results of the National Economic and Social Development Board's 7th plan, he said. Suphachai said the White Paper is scheduled for release in August and will be used to gauge opinion in the private sector. The White Paper will cover four major areas: -- How to increase exports from the present 0.9 per cent share to 1.8 per cent of world trade. -- The government's plan to promote research and development by providing tax and other incentives for foreign investors wishing to set up R&D divisions in Thailand. -- Promote industry, and add more industries as appropriate to the National Plan. -- Stipulate what the government should do to promote the economy generally. Suphachai said the present 15 per cent inflation rate is not particularly worrisome since the increase was due to the sudden rise in the cost of food and farm products. The rise is only temporary, he said.
