Thus, any ownership system is fine provided it can develop productivity: "there is only one matter of choice in the ownership system" and we "should make it beneficial to productivity." The discussant seemingly is entirely unconventional, truly reaching "non-ideologization," unfettered by any socialist or capitalist clans. It goes without saying, provided the economy can develop, any system of ownership, public or private, is fine! I would like to raise for discussion some queries regarding these enlightening remarks. But for a discussion to procede normally, first there must be the premise that everyone respects the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and all intend to undertake socialism. If there is no common agreement on this point, disapproval of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics with no intention of undertaking socialism, then there can be no discussion. Or else the discussion could only procede in a different sense. Now that Volume 3 of the Selected Writings of Deng Xiaoping has been published, we can analyze this issue according to it. Everyone knows that Comrade Deng Xiaoping highlly regards developing productivity. He repeatedly has stressed "The fundamental principle of Marxism is to develop productivity," "the premier task of socialism is to develop productivity," and "to not develop productivity, to not improve the living standards of the people cannot be said to correspond to the needs of socialism" (Footnote 1)(Selected Writings of Deng Xiaoping, Volume 3, page 116). He promotes reform and an open door policy because the originally highly concentrated planned economic system had fettered the development of productivity, "reform is the necessary path for China to develop productivity." He emphasizes wholeheartedly undertaking the four modernizations centered around the economy, noting that we must button up this fundamental link without slack. If we do not master this point, "it is divorced from Marxism, it is only empty Marxism." Comrade Deng Xiaoping is entirely correct in the strategic ideology of concentrating energy in moving the economy forward. It has the wholehearted support of the people nationwide and is being implemented by all. Nevertheless, productivity always develops within certain social production relationships. No economic activity can be divorced from society's basic system. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's aforementioned developing productivity refers to doing so within socialist production relationships rather than being separate from production relationships and talking abstractly about developing productivity. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, "We must realize the modernization of industry, agriculture, national defense, and science and technology. Yet the word `socialism' precedes the four modernizations; they are called the `four socialist modernizations.' When we talk now about enlivening the domestic economy and having an open door policy, they procede by firmly upholding the `principles of socialism,'" (Footnote 2)(Ibid., page 138). Clearly, from Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concepts of developing productivity, one cannot draw the conclusion that productivity can be developed using any ownership system. Although productivity may develop a certain amount by taking a capitalist road, however, first, the speed of productivity development could not be rapid because of the constraints of fundamental conflicts of capitalism. Second, taking this path definitely leads to polarization, it "can allow several percent of the Chinese people to become wealthy but it absolutely cannot resolve the problem of the welfare of ninety-some percent of the Chinese people" (Footnote 3)(Ibid., page 64). Thus Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphasizes that only socialism can save China. Likewise, only socialism can develop China, "it will not do for China to engage in capitalism." He clearly noted: "if our policies bring on polarization, we have lost. If they engender some new bourgeois class, then we really have taken to evil ways" (Footnote 4)(Ibid., page 111). So then, what is socialism? Comrade Deng Xiaoping's response to this question is: "socialism has two extremely important aspects, one is the primacy of the public ownership system, and the other is non-polarization (Footnote 5)(Ibid., page 138)." In another place, he also clearly noted: "a public ownership system is the mainstay, a common wealth. This is a basic principle of socialism we must firmly uphold. We must resolutely implement and realize these socialist principles" (Footnote 6)(Ibid., page 111). Some worry that reform is taking a capitalist road and China has become capitalist. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said that it cannot be said that this worry has no reasoning. We cannot dispel their fears using empty talk while firmly upholding these two facts in reply to those who hope we become capitalist. Obviously, the public ownership system is not a method to develop the economy. The public ownership system as the mainstay of our economic development process from start to finish must be firmly upheld as a basic socialist principle. Although in the early stage of socialism non-socialist economic elements may play a positive role in developing the national economy, ultimately they are not mainstays but only complement the public ownership system. The primary position of public ownership cannot waver. If it does, the entire socialist endeavor will be shaken. Saying "the public ownership system is a method," obviously is contrary to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's judgement because methods can be used or not. The people can choose one method or another, but fundamental principles are not allowed to be cast aside or altered. Why must we firmly uphold the primacy of public ownership? This question can only be answered with Marxism regarding the basic tenets of the mutual relationship between production relationships and productivity. Marxism contends that in social production, productivity is the material content of production. Production relationships (their base is the form of ownership) are the social form of production. The organic unity and synthesis of productivity and production relationships constitute a society's form of production. Within forms of production, the relationship between production relationships and productivity is not one of method and goal but rather a dialectical relationship: productivity determines production relationships and production relationships counteract productivity. When production relationships are suited to the nature of productivity, then they can promote the development of productivity. Conversely, they can fetter the development of productivity. In line with the development of capitalism, productivity increasingly has a social nature. Private capitalism vis-a-vis productivity constitutes an essential insurmountable problem within the capitalist system itself. It is precisely the nature of productivity and its development needs which objectively provided the necessity for public ownership to replace private ownership and socialism to replace capitalism. Our firm support of public ownership as the mainstay is not a subjective choice of this or that but rather it is because public ownership is suited to the nature of productivity and can promote its development. Here is the dialectical relationship between production relationships and productivity: the social nature of productivity determines the emergence of a socialist public ownership system, and conversely the public ownership system which is suited to the nature of productivity promotes the development of productivity. This dialectical relationship could not be explained within the scope of methods and goals. Here the reason why we take great pains to discuss some most rudimentary Marxist common knowledge is only because those who say "public ownership is a method" do not even want basic Marxist tenets. Those who suggest "public ownership is a method, developing productivity is the goal" also have forgotten a basic fact, namely, that no society can have the goal of developing productivity; developing production merely as a method to attain a certain goal. The goals of production are not decided by the subjective wishes of the people but precisely by the form of ownership of the means of production. Whoever owns the means of production, social production must serve his basic interests. Whatever the form of ownership of the means of production, the owners will have special interests of that nature. Correspondingly, that will be the goal of social production. In capitalist societies, the capitalist class' private ownership system occupies an authoritative position and social production follows the basic interests of the capitalist class which determines that the goal of capitalist production is to seek the greatest surplus value or profits. Under the socialist public ownership system, the laboring peoples jointly hold the means of production, becoming the masters of social production , which determines that the goal of social production is to satisfy the material and cultural needs of all laboring peoples and to promote their overall self-development. Socialist countries develop production to satisfy the needs of the people and this point is determined by the socialist system of public ownership. These inherent ties between things are common knowledge to anyone with a smattering of Marxist understanding, yet "authoritiative" economists do not even want this most basic thing. Considered in political terms, it is incorrect to make developing productivity a goal. As stated above, Comrade Deng Xiaoping fully highly regards developing productivity but has never made it a fundamental aim or objective goal of socialist society. He has never advocated production for production's sake. He repeatedly has stressed "our ideals and beliefs are to engage in communism." Communism takes the greatest abundance of products as a material base. Our development of productivity is to manifest the superiority of the socialist system, win a victory over capitalism and ultimately realize communism. Economic work is the central task of all of our work. Developing the economy is to consolidate and develop the socialist system which is centered around public ownership, thereby serving the transition to communism. To abstractly and generally discuss developing productivity while forgetting why we want to do so will put one in evil ways. A saying by Richard Nixon, such a monopolistic capitalist class representative, is worth our deep consideration. In 1983 he concluded after visiting several eastern European countries that for eastern Europe, "the time is ripe for a peaceful transition" because the "eastern European communist party people have fully lost faith," "the new generation of eastern Europeans are not ideologues but men of action and utilitarianism may open a space for a peaceful transition" (Footnote 7)(Richard Nixon, 1999: Victory Without Battle, p 169). This passage proves the reality of eastern Europe's transition. This is a strike against those who discuss the economy all day without mentioning socialism or communism. They are busy all day developing the economy but forget that we are building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Guess what is the intention of those promoting the enlightening remarks that "public ownership is a method?" Regretfully, "authoritative" economists dare not directly explain. Perhaps this is a way of speaking: say half a phrase, hint at another. Be complicated and confusing, only suggesting, not stating explicitly. What the conclusion is is not clearly stated to allow one to guess or conjecture. According to the ideological logic of "authoritative" economists, public ownership is one method of developing productivity which can be chosen. Private ownership is another. Any method is fine as long as it can develop productivity, thus, one ought not to propose the matter of which ownership system is the mainstay. This is called "rediscovery of public ownership as the mainstay." Undoubtedly, "public ownership is a method" is a natural extension of numerous various forms of ownership systems which do not distinguish between primary and secondary "mixed up economic" thinking in the previous period. Therefore in any society there always is the form of ownership of the means of production as a mainstay. It determines the entire nature of the form of society and economy. There has never been a "mixed economy" as a mainstay. If the mainstay is not public ownership, then private ownership is. Which ownership system ultimately is the mainstay for those discussing "methods"? Unfortunately, they do not clearly say. However, their intentions are clear when related to the temporary clamor of "the results of public ownership are not as good as in enterprises under the three forms of foreign ownership or the private economy," "public ownership has entered a blind alley," "public ownership is not like market economics," "the private economy is the vanguard of market economics," etc. Although public ownership is only a method chosen to develop productivity, and public ownership is not as good as private ownership, then naturally we should get rid of public ownership and privatize. Obviously, promoting "public ownership is a method" is simply the theoretical basis for privatization. However under current historical conditions, privatization has to lead to capitalism. The reality of Russia and eastern Europe have proven this. Whatever the "methodists" want, why don't they say it right out?! Clearly, "public ownership is a method" relates to whether to uphold public ownership as the mainstay and thus relates to whether to take the socialist road or a capitalist road. How can the people be unmoved or silent regarding such cardinal questions of right and wrong? Analyzing the nature of the issue a bit, disputing its right and wrong, undoubtedly is beneficial.
