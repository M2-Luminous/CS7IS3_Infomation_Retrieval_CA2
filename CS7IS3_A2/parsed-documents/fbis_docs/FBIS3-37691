Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky stated this today to the ITAR-TASS correspondent on the occasion of the upcoming official visit to Budapest by Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. Naturally, many spoke of equality in the Hungarian-Soviet friendship during the "Communist period" though in reality Hungary was in a clearly subordinate position, the minister said. The USSR constantly interfered in the internal affairs of our country. Nevertheless, the Hungarian people never identified the Soviet policies that in many cases violated the national interests of Hungary, with the stance of the Russian people. Many in our country understood and continue to understand that it was the peoples of Russia who were, in the first place, the victims of Stalinism and the communist model, G. Jeszenszky pointed out. In this connection, he said, suffice it to recall the events of 1956 in Hungary, when most of the Soviet soldiers and officers in the country understood the true nature of the popular uprising. This is why, at the decisive phase of suppressing the revolution, they were replaced by a "fresh" contingent of troops from another part of the USSR. Some soldiers and officers took the side of the uprising against the Communist dictatorship of the Hungarian people. One can only speculate how many were subsequently executed for failure to obey orders. G. Jeszenszky expressed hope that the new Russian Federal Assembly, unlike its predecessor, would ratify the treaty between the two countries with the paragraph condemning the Soviet intervention in the 1956 events in Hungary. The minister thought it necessary to recall that beginning with August 1991 in the Soviet Union, the Republic of Hungary has consistently been one of the first to voice support for the democratic forces in Russia and their leader, Boris Yeltsin. In recent years, he stressed, our states have established good and constructive political relations that are free of any ideological element. President Yeltsin's official visit to Hungary was a timely high point to these relations, and the documents signed in Budapest provided a boost to development of bilateral economic ties. The question of the ex-USSR's debt of $2 billion to Hungary was also resolved. Under an agreement reached, Russia inherited the debt and has already delivered various military hardware to half that sum. Intensive negotiations are now underway regarding the remainder. The upcoming talks with A. Kozyrev will focus on Hungary's relations with NATO and East European countries' involvement in the Partnership for Peace program, G. Jeszenszky said. He said he was firmly convinced that a close relationship between East and Central European countries and NATO, and their subsequent joining of that military-political bloc, would in no way run counter to Russia's national interests. Hungary realizes, he said, that a certain part of the Russian public has preconceptions about NATO. The old stereotype has been too hard to kill off and many people in the Russian Federation still see the alliance above all as an enemy. But it is obvious to all who are familiar with the history of the North Atlantic alliance that it has always had a purely defensive nature and has never threatened anybody, Russia included. The minister thought that Russia should be interested in calm and stability in the region that abuts its western borders. In turn, NATO's very existence has a beneficial influence on political stability in central Europe, and this is precisely why Moscow should not be anxious about NATO expanding in the region at Russia's expense. The "South Slav crisis" will occupy an important place in the upcoming Russian-Hungarian talks. In this connection, the minister pointed out that at all international bodies Hungary has always advocated an active role for Russia in resolving the Balkans conflict. The events of the past few days provide solid grounds for hope that the Russian leadership's constructive initiative to solve the Bosnian crisis will be successful, and that NATO air strikes will not be required. This became possible primarily because of Russia's even-handed policy, which took into account the problems and concerns of the Bosnian Serbs, and also of the Croats and Moslems living there. G. Jeszenszky said in conclusion that in any event Hungary will not play any role in NATO military action in Bosnia if it goes ahead. The main reason for this, the minister said, is that a significant Hungarian minority lives in Vojvodina (Serbia). Concern for the interests of ethnic Hungarians and the fact that the Hungarian and Serbian peoples are neighbors means that we must stand aside from "any use of force in Bosnia," the foreign affairs minister said.
