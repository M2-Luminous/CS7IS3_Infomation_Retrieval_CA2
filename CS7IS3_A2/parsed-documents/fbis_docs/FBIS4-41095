Apparently the presidential "reshuffle" edicts should not be scrutinized for signs of just another apparatus overhaul. Some of them were prepared long ago: For instance, Vladimir Zaytsev's appointment as Russia's chief controller or Vladimir Varov's nomination as the country's chief labor inspector. It is not yet clear exactly what the Russian Federal Labor Inspectorate will do: Whether Varov will be tasked with verifying the correct maintenance of work record books or whether he will conduct on-site checks at enterprises. But it would be unreasonable to expect any serious changes in Russian politics as a result of this appointment. That Nikolay Medvedev's days as chief of the Administration for Work With Territories were numbered has been known for a long time. Having failed to establish proper contacts with the regions, Medvedev, after the March reorganization of the staff, was not confirmed as administration chief and has remained acting head throughout this time. His departure was inevitable and did not evoke any protest either from the administration's staff or from deputies of parliament's upper chamber: heads of the regions. Commenting at KOMMERSANT-DAILY's request on Medvedev's fate, a member of the Federation Council leadership observed "It is high time," while another crossed himself. Therefore the only surprise was the appointment to this post of Aleksandr Kazakov rather than any of the regional aspirants. Before the edict Kazakov worked in the government as Anatoliy Chubays' deputy. True, according to comments from his colleagues, the new administration chief dealt with privatization mainly "in the regional sphere" and therefore is well acquainted with regional problems. Nonetheless, he will clearly take a long time to restore the administration's reputation in the eyes of the regional rulers. Perhaps the most mysterious of these edicts was the decision to create in the staff an Operations Department which, according to the official version, will be responsible for processing incoming and outgoing presidential documents. The name of the candidate for the post of the president's chief operations officer is not being disclosed yet. Until recently all paperwork has been handled by the President's Chancellery, headed by Valeriy Semenchenko. No one in the Presidential Staff could explain yesterday what exactly will happen now: Whether Semenchenko will have his hands freed to deal with other presidential affairs or whether, quite the contrary, he has been sidelined. From the Statute on the Administration for Work With Territories The administration's tasks include ensuring interaction between the president and the bodies of state power and administration in the republics, krays, oblasts, autonomous oblasts, autonomous districts, and the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg Commentary by Federation Council Deputy Chairman Ramazan Abdulatipov "I do not understand what the administration does. It is not clear whether it is supposed to brief the president about what is going on in the regions, or coordinate the activity of various departments, or convey federal government decisions to the regions. The administration's status and powers have not been defined."
