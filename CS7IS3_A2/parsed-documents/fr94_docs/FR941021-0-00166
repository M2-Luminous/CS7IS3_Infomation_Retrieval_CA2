The Committee's task was made somewhat easier by the fact that radio astronomy observations are usually conducted in remote areas and are not always continuous. The Committee's proposal, developed cooperatively with the Committee on Radio Frequencies (CORF), 118 would establish fixed-radius protection zones around the sixteen radio astronomy sites in the United States and technical requirements for MSS downlink transmissions. Based on this recommendation, we proposed to establish protection zones around radio astronomy sites in the United States as a means of preventing MSS transmissions from interfering with RAS observations in the 1610.6&hyph;1613.8 MHz band. 119 To that end, we also proposed that ``all 1.6/2.4 GHz MSS systems shall be capable of determining the position of MSS user transceivers accessing the space segment through either internal radiodetermination calculations or external sources such as LORAN&hyph;C or GPS.'' 120 118 CORF operates under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences and is responsible for advancing the interest of radio astronomy in the United States. 119 See proposed §25.213(a)(1)(i)&hyph;(iii). 120 See proposed §25.213(a)(1). 102. Big LEO parties generally agree with the fixed-radius protection zone approach. However, both TRW and Constellation question whether it is necessary to require all MSS systems to be capable of determining the position of their user terminals. 121 They contend that a position location requirement need not be imposed on those MSS systems that elect to use beacon-actuated protection systems as a means for avoiding harmful interference to RAS observations. 121 TRW Comments at 120, Constellation Reply at 43. 103. As we stated in the Notice, the Committee decided that a beacon actuated protection system might provide an alternative to fixed radius protection zones. Under such a system, a beacon would transmit a signal when RAS observations were in progress. Upon receipt of this signal, an MSS control center would automatically assign the MSS terminal to a communications channel outside of the shared MSS&hyph;RAS frequency band. The Committee concluded, however, that several theoretical and practical concerns must be addressed before a beacon system can be implemented. 122 CORF continues to support that position. 123 122 Notice , note 2, supra , at n.90. 123 CORF Reply Comments at 4. 104. Because beacon actuated protection systems are not yet fully developed, we will adopt our original proposal that requires MSS operators to protect RAS observations in the 1610.6&hyph;1613.8 MHz band using the fixed-radius protection zone method. Nevertheless, because we expect that more efficient solutions will be developed, we will permit MSS licensees to use smaller geographic protection zones in lieu of the specified areas upon a showing that MSS operations will not cause harmful interference to an RAS observatory during periods of observation. 124 We will, however, as proposed, allow beacon-actuated protection zones to be used in lieu of fixed protection zones if a coordination agreement is reached between a mobile-satellite system licensee and the Electromagnetic Spectrum Management Unit (ESMU) on the specifics of beacon operations.'' 125 Should any of the Big LEO licensees show at a later time, and coordinate with the ESMU, that certain other methods can be used in lieu of the fixed-radius protection zone, we will allow MSS system operators to employ these methods. In the interim, however, position determination of MSS user transceivers is necessary to accomplish fixed-radius zone protection. Therefore, we adopt as part of §25.213(a)(1), the MSS user transceiver position determination requirement as proposed in the Notice. 124 See §25.213(a)(1)(v). 125 See §25.213(a)(1)(vii). The ESMU falls under the auspices of the National Science Foundation and is responsible for coordinating RAS frequencies. 105. In the Notice, we also proposed that MSS user transceivers be capable of terminating operations as soon as practicable upon entering an RAS protection zone. 126 LQP argues that our proposal would require that calls initiated outside of an RAS protection zone be terminated as soon as the MSS user transceiver moves within the protection zone, which, according to LQP, would be inordinately complex and costly. 127 LQP suggests that our rules should permit the call to be switched successfully to frequencies outside of the RAS bands (during RAS observations) before operations are terminated to that unit. 128 126 See proposed §25.213(a)(1)(v). Notice , note 2, supra , at para. 50. 127 LQP Reply at 58. 128 LQP Comments at 64. 106. We believe that LQP's suggestion is reasonable. Allowing calls initiated prior to entering an RAS protection zone to continue until a non-RAS frequency is found will ensure continuity of service to the MSS user. Further, we believe that other requirements that we are adopting, such as the notification requirement that is described below, will ensure that RAS operations are not affected adversely. Therefore, we modify proposed §25.213(a)(1)(v) as suggested by LQP.
