This bill should regulate the status of BIS members, the utilization of intelligence-gathering devices, and the BIS status and its control. After the debate, we asked interim BID Director Stanislav Devaty: [Stastny] The majority of the amendments provide you with more powers than the draft bill you have presented. Why were you so restricted when drafting your bill? [Devaty] When we worked on our draft, we based our considerations strictly on the Principles for the Law on Intelligence Services. Our draft has undergone a very rigorous vetting procedure. BIS welcomes the changes, of course, because they allow us to work better. [Stastny] Are you satisfied with the fact that BIS is under the control of parliament? [Devaty] I welcome any kind of control. This protects me as well. For instance, when I am attacked in the press, I can address this control body and demand that this problem be sorted out. In my opinion, the parliamentary committee should control all BIS activities because it is responsible for them. A separate law will define what will be in parliament's jurisdiction. [Stastny] How do you view volunteers for cooperation with BIS, and what is their role in the fight against organized crime? [Devaty] The basic requirement is the will to cooperate. There is no other alternative. Cooperation with those people is one of the methods being used by all of the secret services all over the world. In some instances, if we want to penetrate into the structures of organized crime, this cooperation becomes indispensable. [Stastny] The Interior Ministry has initiated tougher procedures against various extremist groups. Is BIS also preparing a similar step? [Devaty] Of course, our service also deals with such problems and closely cooperates with the police. Unlike the police, however, we do not have executive powers; therefore, we pass all of our information on these groups to them. I believe we have done enough in this sphere; therefore, we are not planning further steps. [Stastny] In what spheres do you cooperate with the police, specifically? [Devaty] We cooperate with them when working on specific cases. Important information--about organized crime, for instance--is passed on to police departments that deal with them. Then, we can take steps like we did in the Buontempo case. Our service can ask the police for cooperation, and vice versa.
