Some 756 registered contenders are vying for seats in the parliament, six to a seat. Three hundred and sixty-one of them were self-nominated, public associations named 331, and 64 were nominated by the president. The most widely represented among the candiates are the "Popular Unity of Kazakhstan" coalition, the Socialist and Republican Parties, as well as the Trade Union Federation, the "Popular Congress of Kazakhstan", and the Peasants Union. Voting is going on in more than 10,000 polling stations, 6.5 thousand of which are located in rural areas and in shepherds' winter camps. According to the public opinion poll conducted by the Giller Institute ahead of the elections, 62.9 per cent of the voters and 50.3 per cent of candidates said they favoured private landownership. 74.8 per cent of the voters and 41.7 per cent of the candidates said Russian should be given the state language status in the Republic. President Nursultan Nazarbayev said at the polling station, to which he came together with Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko to cast their ballots in the elections, that there was nothing more important for the Republic at present than "to adopt laws which could help democratise our young sovereign state, and encourage economic reforms and the restructuring of the legal system". "I hope that the new parliament will be more active than the previous," the Kazakh presdient said. There is no uniformity of opinion among the voters. According to the Giller poll only 25 per cent of them were planning to vote for the candidates who prioritise the development of private property and free enterprise, while 66 per cent favoured a tougher state regulation of the economy.
