Order In the matter of implementation of sections of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992_Rate Regulation. Adopted: February 8, 1994. Released: February 8, 1994. By the Commission: Commissioner Barrett issuing a separate statement. I. Introduction 1. In this Order, on our own motion, we reconsider the expiration date of the freeze of regulated cable service revenues, and extend the expiration date of the freeze from February 15, 1994 until May 15, 1994. Later this month, the Commission will consider pending petitions to reconsider various aspects of its rate regulations. In considering the petitions for reconsideration and other issues outstanding in the rate regulation proceedings, the Commission will address, among other issues, the benchmark/price cap methodology, relief for small systems and so-called ``going forward issues.'' The Commission also plans to adopt cost of service rules. This short extension of the freeze is the minimum amount of time required to enable affected parties to familiarize themselves with any modifications to the cable rate regulations before the freeze is lifted. II. Background 2. In the Rate Order issued in May 1993, we established a comprehensive regulatory framework providing for rate regulation of the basic service tier by local franchising authorities and of cable programming services tiers by the Commission as required under the Cable Act of 1992. We established June 21, 1993 as the effective date of our new rate regulations. At the same time, we were concerned that during the period between adoption of our rules and the earliest practical opportunity for local franchising authorities to establish regulation of the basic service tier, and for consumers to file complaints with the Commission concerning rates for cable programming services tiers, cable operators could raise rates, effectively undermining the statutory mandate that rates for cable services remain reasonable. In particular, we were concerned that cable operators could raise rates to potentially unreasonable levels, as determined under the rate regulations ultimately adopted. We determined that a freeze of regulated cable service revenues until August 3, 1993 would provide a reasonable opportunity for local franchise authorities to become certified to regulate the basic service tier and for consumers to invoke by complaint the Commission's regulatory oversight over cable programming services tiers. Accordingly, we established a freeze until that date of revenues for cable services subject to regulation under the Cable Act of 1992. Under the freeze, the average monthly subscriber bill for cable services and associated equipment subject to rate regulation under the Cable Act of 1992 may not increase above the level determined under rates in effect on April 5, 1993. The Commission provided for waivers of the rate freeze in particular cases where a cable operator can demonstrate that the freeze would impose severe economic hardship or threaten the viability of continued cable service.
