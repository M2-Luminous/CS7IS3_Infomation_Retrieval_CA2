Rasulzade and Russian Food Industry Correspondence Institute, Moscow; UDC 547.962:541.63] [Abstract] An earlier study of the structural-functional organization of the molecule of such opioid neuropeptides as Met- and Leu-enkephalin, _a_-, _g_-, ï¿½-, and _b_-endorphins, etc., is continued, and an attempt is made to solve the primal and inverse structural problems of another compound in this series--adrenorphin--an octapeptide whose N-terminal segment has the Met-enkephalin sequence. The adrenorphin molecule's optimum conformational states are determined on the basis of the conformational theory of native peptides and the corresponding analysis method. The amino acid sequence of adrenorphin was treated as [Met[.sup]5[/]]-enkephalin with a tripeptide fragment attached to its C-terminal. The relative conformation energy of the tripeptide fragment, the relative energy and energy contributions of nonvalent, electrostatic, and torsional interactions of adrenorphin's optimum conformations, the geometrical parameters of the preferable conformations of various shapes of the peptide skeleton, and the relative energy of optimum adrenorphin conformations and its synthetic analogues are summarized. These synthetic analogues are examined; each of them may assume a rather limited number of conformations (sometimes only one) from the set of low-energy conformations and, consequently, physiologically active spatial forms of the native peptide. The proposed analogues differ from the native peptide only by their conformational abilities and as a group, are consistent with the structural-functional organization of the native molecule.
