Fierce fighting is under way, the sides are suffering major losses. [passage omitted] The real threat of the conflict's internationalization is another noteworthy aspect. It is, alas, an open secret that envoys from Azerbaijan and the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] are spending big money to hire "soldiers of fortune" in Russia, in Ukraine, in Belarus, in the Baltic countries.... "International aid" to the warring sides is already arriving from beyond the former USSR's borders. Afghan mojahedin are fighting on Azerbaijan's side. Furthermore, the notorious Hekmatyar and General Dustum have examined the possibility of rendering more effective assistance to Baku. Mercenaries from Lebanon, Syria, and other Near East countries are fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh's defense detachments. Teheran and Istanbul are finding it increasingly hard to conceal their annoyance with the development of events in the NKR. And even though these two capitals issue assurances of readiness to perform a peacemaking mission in the region, it is no secret that certain quite influential forces in both Iran and Turkey are also considering strongarm options of "international aid."
