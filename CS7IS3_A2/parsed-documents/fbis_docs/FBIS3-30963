"We have agreed to reorganize our country," he said in an interview late Saturday [12 February] in Geneva. He was answering questions about the Moslems "bottom line" -- their minimal demands as the West finally takes decisive steps to end the 22-month-old Bosnian war. Washington has presented itself as the savior of the Moslems. The latest round of E.C.-UN-mediated peace talks ended here Saturday without any progress as direct US and Russian diplomacy took over with the clock ticking on NATO's deadline for Serbs to end their siege of Sarajevo. If heavy weapons are not withdrawn by midnight next Sunday, NATO warplanes will destroy the guns. The Bosnians insist on the idea of a united Bosnia but this would be under the already accepted formula of three ethnic mini-states, one each for the warring Moslems, Serbs and Croats. Bosnia became independent in April 1992 as a state without ethnic divisions. The main remaining problem in the formula, which allocates one-third of Bosnia to the Moslems, is the 15 areas claimed by the Moslems but held now by either Croats or Serbs. Silajdzic said he wanted these areas "to be demilitarized and put under UN administration until we stop the war." This would apparently be a way of bypassing the bitterly intractable disputes over places like Zvornik in eastern Bosnia. Zvornik, on the border with Serbia, has been described by one analyst here as the "Serbs' Golan Heights," a strategic town they would never give up. Silajdzic is equally stubborn about Zornik, one of the prime sites of ethnic cleansing, where the 70 percent non-Serbian population was driven out. "Those still alive," Silajdzic said bitterly, must one day return. "We must not accept gains by force," he said. He said, however, that the Bosnian Government understood that the Americans, the driving force behind the NATO initiative, have not given them a carte blanche for re-taking territory. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic on Saturday here expressed concern about the advantage Moslem infantry will soon have. "Moslems have three times more numerous infantry than the Serbs. Serbian weaponry was the element of strategic balance. If we put our heavy weaponry under (UN) control, then the Moslem infantry should be under control too," he said. But infantry and light arms are not mentioned in the NATO ultimatum issued February 9. Asked if his troops would take advantage of the situation, Silajdzic said emphatically: "They will not." He said the Bosnians would not risk their credibility. Silajdzic said the outlines for peace have become clear. NATO's military pressure has been matched by a geopolitical forcing that leaves the Serbs little choice but to stop the war. For instance, the neighboring patron of the Bosnian Serbs, Serbia President Slobodan Milosevic is a man "condemned to peace," Silajdzic said. International economic sanctions have put Serbia in a position where Milosevic can not be defiant. "I think he's dragging that country into an abyss," Silajdzic said. Russia, anxious to share in the peacemaking role with the United States, is also expected to pressure Bosnian Serbs to compromise, analysts here said. Silajdzic said NATO's active involvement had restored "a balance of power." "There is a recognition that superpowers must lead and that not being involved eventually leads to dangerous situations where loss of life and resources is inevitable," he said. But he still described himself as a disillusioned man. "We have sanctions (arms embargo on former Yugoslavia), we have shells coming in and we have grey-haired children (in Sarajevo from the long siege). What more could there be, an atomic bomb?" he asked.
