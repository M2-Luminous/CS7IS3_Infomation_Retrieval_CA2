Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii made light of the issue in his meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Mickey Kantor, quipping that "the political weather is bad." But the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] -- the largest party in the ruling coalition -- continued to demand revision of the tax plan, which was announced in the early hours of the same day by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa without SDP approval. An SDP official said the party will quit the coalition unless there are changes in the timing and scope of a new welfare tax intended to pay for a cut in income tax. Hosokawa was quoted by one of his ministers as saying that he may change his decision in line with a compromise reached at a meeting later of coalition party leaders. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura also told a regular morning press meeting that the government is ready to revise the plan. A revision, if made, would be a reversal for the Finance Ministry, which had won its call for the offsetting tax in the face of strong opposition from the SDP. The plan calls for tax cuts of 6 trillion yen, including 5.3 trillion yen in national income tax and local resident's tax, to be paid for by a 7 percent national welfare tax on goods and services from April 1997 in place of the current 3 percent consumption tax. In a last-ditch effort to end the continuing row, which appeared likely to delay the announcement of an economic stimulus package due out in the evening, some SDP leaders visited Finance Minister Fujii, but both sides declined to comment on the meeting. Meanwhile, the ministry issued a detailed report explaining the financial justification for the 7 percent rate of the welfare tax. The report appeared intended to clarify Fujii's press remarks shortly after the government decision early Thursday in which he denied there would be any net tax increases. The new tax is expected to generate revenues of some 9.5 trillion yen a year, while the tax cuts total only 6 trillion yen, the ministry said. As for the net 3.5 trillion in net revenues, it cited some 800 billion yen in additional welfare spending, about 1.3 trillion yen in tax burdens from the new tax on government purchases of goods and services, and repayment of principal of some 1.4 trillion yen for short-term government bonds. The government needs to issue about 18 billion yen worth of "bridge" bonds to cover the three-year period before implementation of the new tax, and principal repayments will take over 10 years. The repayment period would be longer when including interest, the report said. In his press remarks, Fujii vowed his utmost efforts to win public support and stressed that revenues would be for social welfare. Unlike the consumption tax, the new tax would be introduced by a law defining it as "a politically objective tax," Fujii said.
