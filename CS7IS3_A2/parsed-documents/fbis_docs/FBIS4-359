In a written statement read by his spokeswoman Therese Gastaut, he also condemned "the odious attacks" in which 10 United Nations peacekeepers died. Butrus-Ghali said he was asking his envoy in Rwanda, Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, "to take all measures to guarantee safety throughout the country and particularly in Kigali," the capital. There were no details on what measures Booh-Booh would be asked to enact. Some 2,500 UN peacekeepers are in the country to help ensure a peaceful transition to elections scheduled to take place next year. Pandemonium and ethnic violence have broken out in the country since the deaths of the two presidents in a plane crash Wednesday evening. The UN chief also said he had "learned with great indignation of the new incidents in Rwanda and especially the tragic death of Rwandan Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana." He was working on a report for the Security Council recommending ways of protecting UN staff, the statement said. In Brussels earlier, sources said Rwandan employees of foreign aid workers in Kigali have been murdered by Rwandan troops, while at least 22 Rwandan missionary priests and nuns have been killed amid the ethnic violence. Troops have been blamed for the murder Thursday of Uwilingiyimana, killed in the aftermath of the plane crash deaths.
