The move ends a year of anxiety and negotiations. The initial bilateral negotiation was followed by others within the GATT, where a panel was set up after the EU imposed countervailing duties in April 1993. Ernesto Tironi, the Chilean Ambassador to Geneva who receives the kudos for this agreement, labeled this process as "laborious" and told EL MERCURIO that it entailed a race against time. "The agreement was ready on 8 March and it was practically closed on 17 March," he added. He explained that the agreement entails both a change in the way the EU calculates the countervailing duties and a reduction in EU tariffs on Chilean apples and other fruits. In exchange for this, Chile suspended its protest before the GATT which had established a panel presided by Swedish Ambassador to GATT Christer Manhusen and included representatives of Mexico and Pakistan. This agreement will be instrumental in boosting Chile's export earnings. Tironi stated: "A surplus in the European production of apples last year, coupled with a 10 percent increase in tariffs -- up from 6 to 16 percent -- caused exports of Chilean apples to drop by 40 percent." [passage omitted] A Foreign Ministry communique states that the countervailing duties which affected Chile last year will be replaced by another, less restrictive, more transparent, and more predictable system. This was negotiated within the framework of the Uruguay Round of GATT trade talks. This new tariff system will apply to all Chilean fruits, not just to apples. The communique adds that within the framework of the Uruguay Round, Chile managed to increase the selling price of its apples from 8 to 12 percent [as published] without being penalized by extremely high additional customs duties. This measure will become effective in July 1995. The agreement also includes clauses to make the EU system that limits the entry of fruit less severe when there are exceptional market conditions. For example, countervailing duties will not be levied when sales volumes are very small. The communique adds that the agreement includes a commitment for closer cooperation between Chile and the EU on the exchange of information about fruit market conditions. The agreement states: "The information provided by the Exporters' Association is of utmost importance for the fulfillment of the cooperation commitment." [passage omitted]
