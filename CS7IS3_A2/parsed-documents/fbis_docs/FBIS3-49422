Ivanov: "Hasten Cleverly, but Not Slowly"] [Text] The Ministry of Industry has made a request to dismantle and sell 200 enterprises that have accumulated 10.89 percent of the total uncollectable debts in the industrial sector. The tripartite commission is insisting on closing down firms that have leased out more than half their property in the present financial impasse. For years on end, our politicians and rulers have watched with mixed feelings while the state economy sinks into a sea of problems. They hastened slowly, and did absolutely nothing. Finally, unemployment has gone through the ceiling, reaching 21.4 percent, not including those on unpaid leave. In the state industry alone, bad debts have reached monstrous dimensions -- almost 13 percent of the GDP of 501 billion leva that the government is budgeting for this year. Only now have they got busy, because a market economy cannot be made without a market, and the simplest definition of a "market" is a place where someone sells something and someone else buys it. In Bulgaria this second "someone" is looking around a great deal, but buying little. His cash funds are mainly dependent on the state sector. However, because no one is buying anything, everyone is making losses without exception. The general flurry of activity is giving rise to chaos. At the end of 1993, parliament failed to realize how many laws were needed before the bad debt problem can be settled. Now at last, they are proposing extremely painful and now unavoidable "surgical" measures that will be very difficult to implement. The country lacks coordination, a legislative base, and budget funds. Cannot the authorities and the politicians hasten intelligently?
