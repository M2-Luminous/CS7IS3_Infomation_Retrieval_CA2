This is the first large-scale meeting since the sixth provincial party committee was elected. The main subjects discussed at the conference were to study and implement the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee and the central rural work conference, to sum up and exchange the experiences in rural reform and development, to discuss and work out the policy measures for speeding up the development of agriculture and the rural economy under the socialist market economic conditions, and to arrange the agricultural and rural work in 1994 and in the foreseeable future. Present at the conference were leading comrades of the provincial party committee, the provincial people's congress, the provincial government, and the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, including Jiang Chunyun, Zhao Zhihao, Li Chunting, Li Wenquan, Lu Maozeng, Ma Zhongcai, Dong Fengji, Chen Jianguo, Sun Shuyi, Guo Changcai, Wang Jiangong, and Wang Yuxi; secretaries of the city and prefectural party committees; vice mayors (vice commissioners) in charge of agriculture and the rural economic work; chairmen of the city and prefectural agricultural commissions; directors of the town and township enterprise administrative bureaus; secretaries of the county (city and district) party committees; and responsible comrades of the provincial-level departments. Xiao Wanjun, vice chairman of the central policy research office, attended the conference. Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor of the provincial government, chaired the conference. Wang Jiangong, vice governor of the provincial government, relayed the guidelines of the central rural work conference. Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, made an important speech at the conference. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: According to the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee and the central rural work conference and in line with the actual conditions, the province should persist in the following basic ideologies of speeding up the development of agriculture and the rural economy in the foreseeable future: Unswervingly implement the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy and persistently put agriculture in the primary position of the economic work. The development of high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture should be regarded as the fundamental way for agricultural development. The cultivation of the mainstay of the market, the improvement of the market system, the enhancement of the macroeconomic regulation and control, and the protection of agriculture should be regarded as the main contents of the rural reform. The acceleration of the rural economic development, the ceaseless increase of the peasants' income, and the realization of the target of becoming fairly well-off should be regarded as the fundamental starting and ending point of the rural work. We should strive to make a new leap in the rural economic development. In line with these basic ideologies and ideas and according to the provincial party committee standing committee's study opinions, Jiang Chunyun talked about seven issues as follows: Jiang Chunyun first urged that under the conditions of the socialist market economy, we should further understand and upgrade agriculture's role as the foundation of the national economy. He said: The issues relating to agriculture, rural areas, and the peasants are always the fundamental issues relating to the overall situation of the party and the state. Reviewing the work done in the past years, we know that the party and government leaders at various levels have gradually upgraded their understanding about agriculture's role as the foundation of the national economy and upgraded their awareness of agriculture. The overall agricultural and rural economic situation is good. However, through the examinations according to the guidelines of the central instructions, we know that some leaders still lag behind in terms of their understanding about the role of agriculture and fail to firmly foster the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy. Under the new situation, they consciously or unconsciously neglect agriculture. This is a problem that the party and government leaders at various levels across the province should pay high attention to. The provincial party committee maintained that under the new situation of developing the socialist market economy, the leading cadres at various levels, particularly those at or above the county level, should further study and understand Comrades Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin's important expositions, work closely in line with reality, further understand and upgrade agriculture's role as the foundation of the national economy, and strive to make a new leap in understanding. Jiang Chunyun stressed the necessity to clearly understand the following few points: First, although the proportion of agriculture in the national economy is relatively reduced, agriculture's role as the foundation of the national economy has not been changed yet. The developed industry should be based on the developed agriculture. Only when the foundation of agriculture is solid will we be able to greatly develop the secondary and tertiary industries. Second, agriculture's role as the foundation of the national economy and agriculture's strategic functions cannot be replaced in the course of developing the socialist market economy and carrying out the open policy. Third, enabling peasants to by and large have sufficient food and clothes does not mean that agriculture has passed the test. We should affirm the breakthrough in Shandong's agriculture and rural economy and the historical changes in the rural outlook achieved in the past decade and more since reform and opening up started. However, tasks to develop agriculture and rural economy remain very arduous. We should never overestimate our agricultural production level and peasants' prosperity level, be unrealistically optimistic and complacent, or neglect and slacken efforts in the issues of agriculture, rural areas, and peasants. Fourth, judging from a long-term viewpoint, the fundamental position of agriculture should be further strengthened instead of weakened if we are to attain the "three- step" strategic objective of economic development. Merely a small number of counties among the 135 counties, cities, and districts of the province have achieved a fairly comfortable standard of living, merely 21 percent of the rural population have achieved a per capita income of 1,000 yuan or more, and some peasants in mountainous areas and areas adjacent to reservoirs and beaches have yet to have sufficient food and clothes. Evidently, without a great development in agriculture and rural economy, the grand goal of modernization cannot be attained smoothly. Fifth, we should also note that agriculture is not only an economic issue but also a political and social issue concerning the future and destiny of the party and the state. Jiang Chunyun emphasized: As a large agricultural province, Shandong must attach great importance to agriculture at all times and under all circumstances. It should never hold that agriculture is no longer the foundation of the national economy just because agriculture accounts for a small proportion; never hold that agriculture is no longer important just because we are developing the market economy and opening to the outside world; never hold that we may slacken efforts in agriculture just because there is a bumper harvest every year and peasants have sufficient food and clothes; and never hold that we may relax and all is well just because the rural situation is relatively stable. Following the requirements of the party Central Committee and the State Council, we must have more initiative in developing agriculture and rural economy in the historical process of developing the socialist market economy. We should see to it that the better the situation is, the more we should attach importance to and strengthen agriculture and rural work; that the more reform is deepened and the wider we open to the outside world, the more we should pay attention to agriculture and make it successful; and that the more the market economy is developed, the more we should protect and support agriculture. The second issue Jiang Chunyun discussed was revising and improving the plans for the development of agriculture and rural economy in line with the need for developing the socialist market economy. He said: In the condition of the market economy, we need a scientific plan for accelerating the development of agriculture and rural economy. Based on the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee and Shandong's "three-step" strategy for economic development, we should include the development of agriculture and rural economy in the overall plan for the socialist market economy and, in line with the principle of "adjusting the structure, improving efficiency, accelerating development, and increasing income," map out overall plans and rational arrangements and implement them step by step in line with specific local conditions. The general plan of the province is to greatly facilitate the industrialization, commercialization, and modernization of agriculture in line with the requirement for developing the socialist market economy and, by the end of this century, to develop Shandong's agriculture into commercial and market-oriented agriculture with the characteristics of coastal developed areas--rational layout, balanced structure, advanced technology, scientific management, high rate of resources utilization, large share of the market, high degree of opening up, and high overall efficiency--and to raise the overall quality of Shandong's agriculture and rural economy to a new level and turn Shandong from a large agricultural province into a strong agricultural province. After achieving this, we should make efforts for another decade to by and large attain agricultural modernization and establish a new pattern of industrialized, commercialized, and modernized agriculture. Jiang Chunyun emphasized: To attain the above-mentioned targets, we should accelerate development of rural economy in all sectors and achieve new breakthroughs in some key spheres and key links: 1) a new breakthrough in structural adjustment, 2) a new breakthrough in improving the comprehensive production capacity of agriculture, 3) a new breakthrough in increasing scientific and technological content in farm products, 4) a new breakthrough in the processing of farm and sideline products, 5) a new breakthrough in the transfer of rural labor forces and the construction of small cities and towns, and 6) a new breakthrough in developing export- oriented agriculture. Based on the guidelines of the central rural work conference and this conference and their specific local conditions, all localities in the province should conscientiously revise and improve their own plans, put forward realistic and feasible targets and key points of development and supporting measures, and implement them in a down-to-earth manner. The third issue Jiang Chunyun discussed was to accelerate rural reform, with the aim of establishing the socialist market economy system. He said: Cultivating the mainstay of the market and improving the rural operating system are important tasks of the current rural reform. By deepening the reform, we should truly turn peasant households and rural operating organizations into producers and dealers of commodities who are independent in management, responsible for their own profits and losses, and capable of self- development and self-restraint and into the mainstay of the market which is full of vigor and vitality. We should fully respect peasant households' decision-making power in management and, in line with the stipulations of the central authorities, extend the term of land contracts another 30 years. We should gradually establish and improve the system of paid transfer of land use right according to law in line with the principle of peasants' voluntary participation and mutual benefit and gradually guide peasants to develop the optimal-scale management and intensive management of land in the localities where the secondary and tertiary industries are developed and most labor forces are engaged in the trade other than agriculture and have stable income. We should strengthen and improve unified management and expand the economic strength of the collectives step by step to enhance their service function. We should popularize the shareholding cooperation system in rural areas in an active and yet prudent manner. All localities should learn from and disseminate the experiences of Zhoucun and Laiyang and lead and encourage peasants to develop multiform shareholding cooperation in township enterprises, farming, livestock breeding, agricultural development, farmland capital construction, and tertiary industry. Meanwhile, we should conscientiously summarize experiences and formulate corresponding rules and laws to gradually standardize rural shareholding cooperation. He said: How to lead peasants to the market and link the independent operation of thousands upon thousands of households to the unified large market is another important issue we should resolve with great efforts when deepening the rural reform. The first thing is to establish and improve the rural market system. Shandong's markets for farm products have been developed better. However, the development of labor, money, technology, and information markets has been relatively sluggish, and development of the markets for property rights has yet to begin. The next step is to build more rapidly the markets for the wholesale of farm products and for the essential elements of production and, with the establishment of the modern enterprise system, actively explore ways to cultivate and build the markets for property rights to promote the rational distribution of the essential elements of production and the maintenance and increase of the value of collective assets. Rural cooperative foundations and shareholding cooperative foundations are the organizations for mutual aid with the collective funds of the communities. We should actively give them guidance, strengthen their management, standardize their activities, and give full play to their positive role in developing the rural market economy. Third, we should organize agricultural production in such a way that it is industrialized and actively apply the management form under which trade, industry, and agriculture are integrated, and production, processing, and marketing are a coordinated process. All localities in the province should industrialize agriculture and regard this as an important measure for facilitating rural reform and economic development. In line with the local resources and basic conditions and according to the domestic and foreign market demands, we should define our own key industries and products; carry out regional distribution, specialized production, coordinate management, socialized service, and enterprise management; and set up a production and management system of making cropping, breeding, and processing a coordinate process; production, supply, and marketing a coordinate process; agriculture, industry, and commerce a coordinate process; and agriculture, science, and education a coordinate process. We should pay attention to industrializing agriculture on a trial basis. We should foster the idea of circulation on a large scale; break the bounds of different trades, different regions, and different ownerships; develop large- scale circulation and large markets; positively guide and organize tens of millions of the peasants to enter the circulation spheres; and fundamentally solve the purchasing and marketing difficulties. He pointed out: Strengthening and improving the macroeconomic regulation and control over agriculture and effectively protecting and supporting agriculture is also a problem that should urgently be solved in the course of deepening reform. According to the state requirements for the macro regulation and control over agriculture, we should perfect the means for regulation and control, set up a special grain storage system and grain risk-taking funds, and establish branches of agricultural policy banks and commercial banks. We should set up a system to support and protect agriculture, fix grain protective prices and the ceiling prices for means of production, and perfect the various-layered grain storage systems. The reduced portions of the grain subsidies of the financial departments at various levels should be used as grain risk-taking funds but must not be diverted for other purposes. We should also study ways to set up systems to protect and store up such major farm products as cotton and oil-bearing crops. We should conscientiously sum up experiences gained from practice and positively explore the best ways for developing agriculture and the rural economy. This is the fourth issue that Jiang Chunyun defined in his speech: He pointed out: Over the past years, all localities in the province have positively made explorations in this aspect, created many successful experiences, and pioneered the ways of development with special features. The ways of development can be summarized as follows: First, ways for high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture. Second, ways for comprehensively developing a diversified economy. Third, ways for making trade, industry, and agriculture a coordinate process and production, supply, and marketing a coordinate process. Fourth, ways for developing the export-oriented agriculture. Fifth, ways for overall development. Sixth, ways for cultivating markets to promote development. Seventh, ways for linking agriculture with science and education and coordinating science with prices and policies. Besides, there are ways with which each township should have its own specialized trade and each village should have its own special product, ways for developing transcropping and transplanting agriculture and ecological agriculture, and ways for developing garden-based economy. The aforementioned ways are created by the masses in the course of reform and development. All localities should proceed from their actual conditions to study these ways and use them for reference, select accurate ways suitable to their local conditions, continue to make improvement in the course of practice, and strive to make a new leap in agriculture and the rural economy. When talking about the fifth issue, Jiang Chunyun stressed that we should firmly foster the ideology that science and technology are the primary productive forces and positively carry out the strategy of relying on science and education to rejuvenate Shandong. He pointed out: The key to developing high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture, elevating the rural economy to a new height, and modernizing agriculture is to actually popularize and apply agricultural science and technology. The party and government leaders at various levels across the province should strategically change their guiding ideologies and realistically shift the focus of agricultural development onto the orbit of relying on scientific and technological progress and upgrading the quality of laborers. We should ensure that top leaders should personally grasp the primary productive forces and grasp the following several key work links. First, we should accelerate the popularization of existing applied agrotechnologies and turn scientific and technological findings into productive forces. Second, we should strengthen the basic and applied research on agricultural science and technology. Third, we should popularize and apply new high technology and cultivate and develop new agricultural growing points. We should continue to run nine provincial-level new high-tech development experimental zones and some city and prefectural experimental centers, bring into full play these experimental zones' exemplary roles, and promote the development and application of agricultural new high-tech. Fourth, we should restore and improve the agricultural science and technology dissemination network as soon as possible. Agrotechnology dissemination organizations at all levels are the bridges for developing agriculture through the application of science and technology. We should restore and improve such organizations as soon as possible according to the agriculture law and the law on science and technology dissemination. We should develop more rapidly and improve the county-level agrotechnology dissemination organizations and step up efforts to determine the nature, establishment, and personnel quotas of town and township agrotechnology dissemination organizations. We should actively support peasants' specialized technology associations and research societies and nongovernmental science and technology organizations and give full play to their role in disseminating agricultural science and technology and leading peasants to prosperity through application of science and technology. Fifth, we should exert great efforts to train scientific and technical personnel. Speaking on the sixth issue, Jiang Chunyun urged further efforts to intensify construction of infrastructural facilities to raise the level of agricultural modernization. He said: To push agriculture up to a new level, infrastructural facilities for agriculture should reach a new level first. The focus of the infrastructural facilities for agriculture is farmland water conservancy projects. For many years in a row, Shandong has organized millions of laborers to build farmland capital construction on a large scale, with the focus on harnessing rivers, thus greatly improving the conditions for agricultural production. Generally speaking, however, the province has yet to fundamentally change the situation of "feeding the people at the mercy of heaven." Following the requirements of the central authorities, we should regard water conservancy projects and other infrastructural facilities for agriculture as important as energy, communication, and other basic industries and attach sufficient importance to them. We should adhere to the principle of emphasizing both the antidrought work and flood prevention, both the work to increase income and the work to reduce expenses, and both construction and management and persistently draw up unified plans for comprehensive improvement of mountains, rivers, farmland, forests, and roads. A success in farmland water conservancy projects depends mainly on the labor accumulation of peasants. Meanwhile, we should increase investment from various sources. He said: The development of the market-oriented agriculture urgently requires good infrastructural facilities for circulation. All localities in the province should regard construction of such facilities as the basic work for developing the rural market economy and, like Zhucheng, Shouguang, and Cangshan, build supporting facilities for the processing, storage, and transportation of farm and sideline products to provide a basic guarantee for peasants to enter the market. In the process to promote agricultural modernization, they should regard it as an important task to achieve mechanization and should strive to gradually mechanize the major links of production, such as plowing, harvesting, transportation, threshing, and drying, and the work after production, such as the processing and storage of farm products, so that their equipment for agricultural modernization will be raised to a new level. We should adopt effective measures to speed up development of chemical fertilizer, pesticide, plastic sheet for farm use, and other agriculture-oriented industries. In conclusion, Jiang Chunyun spoke on strengthening and improving party leadership over rural work to comply with the new situation in developing the socialist market economy. He pointed out: Developing the rural market economy and building socialist new countryside with Chinese characteristics constitute a brand-new undertaking, and comprehensive strengthening and improvement of party leadership over rural work is needed. City, prefectural, and county party committees should focus their work and energy on rural work. Major responsible comrades of the party committees and governments at all levels should personally attend to agriculture and rural work. Comrades in charge of agriculture and rural work of party committees and governments should truly hold their responsibilities. Other members of city, prefectural, and county leading bodies should also show concern for and study the issues on rural areas and make their work serve agricultural development still better. As they are on the forefront of rural work, town and township party committees should always regard agriculture as the work of prime importance and successfully organize forces to develop it. Leading cadres at all levels should conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to improve their ideological, theoretical, leadership, and policy-making levels. We should particularly study well Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, master and apply Comrade Deng Xiaoping's basic stand, viewpoints, and methods to conscientiously analyze and study the new conditions, new issues, and new experiences in the current rural reform and development, respect practice, laws, dialectics, and the masses' creation, strive to turn perceptual knowledge into rational knowledge, and implement correct and effective policies and leadership over agriculture, rural economy, and social development. Meanwhile, we should also conscientiously study the knowledge on the market economy, science and technology, and management to continuously upgrade our ability to lead and control the rural market economy. He emphasized: We should persistently attend to two tasks simultaneously and be competent in both. The current main stream in the rural ideological and political field is good, but problems in ideology, social conduct, and public security remain rather conspicuous, which our party and government departments at all levels should pay great attention to. The more we accelerate reform, opening up, and economic construction, the more we should strengthen the socialist spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal system so that we can truly attend to both and be competent in both. We should educate rural cadres to develop democratic work styles, enhance sense of respect for the legal system, and successfully carry out ideological and political work to resolve contradictions. We should strictly crack down on various economic and criminal offenses according to law to eliminate the various ugly phenomena, safeguard rural public security, and make sure that peasants have a sense of security toward production and their life. He pointed out: In improving leading bodies, we should pay attention to two aspects. One is the leading bodies of county and township party committees, and the other is the rural grass-roots party branches. In particular, we should do a good job in selecting secretaries of party branches. We should make conscientious efforts to improve leadership styles and leadership methods. Leading cadres at all levels should meet the demands put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin for devoting more time to study and attending fewer parties, conducting more investigations and study and engage less in subjectivism, and doing more solid work and giving less empty talk. They should often visit rural areas, rural households, and the forefront of agricultural production to conduct investigations and study, give heed to the voice of the masses, ensure implementation of policies, and earnestly carry out solid work for peasants. We should advocate earnest efforts to tell truth, seek real results, and do practical work and oppose formalism, exaggeration, and cheating. We should all the more prohibit coercion, commandism, and violation of laws and discipline, and those who violate laws and discipline should be strictly investigated and dealt with. In giving work guidance, we should not only pay attention to the development of economically developed localities but also attach importance to the development of and support to the economically less developed localities. We should continue to reduce the burdens on peasants and formulate laws to manage this work. Leaders at all levels should use policies and fruitful work to fully boost peasants' enthusiasm for reform and development and guide, protect, and develop well their enthusiasm. All trades and professions should support and protect agriculture. They should firmly embrace the idea that "they can achieve development only when agriculture is development and they share the same fate with peasants," be eager to meet the needs of peasants, and provide them with what they need.
