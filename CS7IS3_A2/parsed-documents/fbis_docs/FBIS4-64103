"The May 10 arrest of trade minister, while he took a 2,500-dollar bribe, was carried out smartly", told Siradegyan. As already reported, two days after his detention the trade minister was released, because no prosecutor sanction was submitted during his arrest. He took up his office again. From a TV screen, Vano Siradegyan announced: "All officials with whom I have talked accepted that trade minister is a thief and bribe-taker, however they required proof, being doubtful about the sum as low as 2,500 dollars. But it's a teacher's salary for 50 years", exclaimed Siradegyan. He promised to arrest next time the state minister red handed--instead of a minister--and present the proper videotape.
