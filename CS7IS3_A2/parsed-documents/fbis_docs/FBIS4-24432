Meanwhile, it is necessary for us to take practical measures to conscientiously work for increasing grain output in a steady way, and for continuously enhancing peasants' incomes to maintain a sustained, comprehensive and coordinated rural economic development. On 15-19 May, Zhao Fulin successively conducted investigations and studies in Guanyang, Pingle, Yongfu, and Lingchuan Counties of Guilin Prefecture. He went to the fields, visited peasant households, forest farms and orchards, and went deep into large specialized households in farming and breeding and township and town enterprises to find out about the situation of agricultural production and township and town enterprises. Guilin Prefecture has been increasing its grain output for years running. Last year, on the basis of greatly adjusting its farm production structure, per capita consumption of grain by peasants in the prefecture was 446 kg. Its diversified economy and township and town enterprises have been developing considerably. Zhao Fulin affirmed the achievements of Guilin Prefecture. Wherever he went, he discussed with county, township, town, and village cadres and the masses the way to correctly handle relations between increasing grain output in a stable way, developing diversified economy, and expanding township and town enterprises, as well as measures for speeding up development. Zhao Fulin pointed out: Handling well the above-mentioned relations is an inherent need of the development of agriculture, and the correct path for promoting a benign agricultural cycle and sustained, comprehensive and coordinated development of our rural economy. It is also needed by our efforts to guide peasants to become rich and advance toward small-scale prosperity, and to preserve social stability. With regard to the way to increase grain output and make more money to ensure a good crop and people's prosperity, Zhao Fulin stressed that the following work must be done effectively: We must first enhance and unify our ideological understanding. Zhao Fulin stressed: Only by developing grain production can we stabilize the livelihood of our urban and rural residents. Only thus can rural areas develop forestry and fruit undertakings, animal husbandry, aquatic production, and other undertakings which rely on meat and grain. In the meantime, only by developing diversified economy and township and town enterprises can we increase peasants' incomes and gradually improve their living standard and quality. Only thus can we arouse peasants' enthusiasm in farming and producing grain. Zhao Fulin continued: Judging from our region's conditions for agricultural production, it is a unified matter to increase grain output and develop diversified economy, because they help each other. Therefore, grasping a stable increase in grain output will not affect the development of diversified economy. It is not necessary to base the development of diversified economy on a reduction in the acreage under grain or in grain output. Increasing grain output does not conflict with making money. Leading cadres at all levels must unify them well in both understanding and practice. While grasping the stable growth of grain output, they must also vigorously develop diversified economy to achieve comprehensive agricultural development, and ensure that we reap a good crop and that our people are wealthy. It is necessary for us to take practical and effective measures to ensure a stable increase in our grain output. Zhao Fulin added: Agriculture is the foundation of our national economy, while grain is the core of this foundation. We must never waver in this basic idea at any time or under any circumstances. To ensure a stable growth in our grain output, an important thing for us to do is that we must conscientiously implement the policies of the central authorities, and the preferential policies for grain production in particular. We must establish and perfect our grain storage system, and pursue a grain purchase protective price. Even in a bumper harvest year, we must not delay in purchasing grain, and never issue IOU's. We must ensure that peasants are not adversely affected by great increases in grain output so as to arouse and protect their enthusiasm in producing grain. In the meantime, we must rely on science and technology to increase yield per unit area, and multiple cropping to raise the total output of grain. It is necessary to vigorously develop diversified economy and township and town enterprises to further boost peasants' incomes. Zhao Fulin emphasized: Under the prerequisite of steadily increasing grain output, we must persist in sticking to the principle which is beneficial to giving play to our strong points, conforming to market demand, and attaching importance to efficiency to greatly develop diversified economy. Various localities must suit measures to local conditions to greatly adjust rural production setups, develop their strong points and avoid their weaknesses, and make use of their own favorable conditions. Marketability and efficiency determine what they plant, breed, exploit, process, and develop. Zhao Fulin pointed out: In light of the practical conditions in our region, we can mainly develop our diversified economy in the following ways: 1. Making use of hills and waters. This means we can develop forestry, orchards, and breeding undertakings on hills and mountains, and the aquatic products industry in waters. To become rich, we must plant more trees. In the future, our region must not only increase the acreage under fruit trees, but also attach importance to transforming low-yield orchards. In particular, we must pay attention to developing famous, special, excellent and rare fruits to enhance our economic efficiency. There are vast grasslands in our region, and we have huge markets because of being close to Guangdong, Hainan, Hong Kong and Macao. We have good conditions for developing animal husbandry. We can raise large quantities of pigs, cows, chickens, ducks, milch cows and so on. We must stabilize the acreage under sugar cane. Some localities must make use of dry land to expand the acreage under sugar cane to meet the pressing capacity of the existing sugar refineries. There are pools, reservoirs and fish ponds in our region, and the area for fresh-water fishery has reached nearly 2 million mu. A considerable part of this fresh-water fishery area has not yet been utilized. It is necessary for us to develop fresh-water fishery. In the meantime, we must fully utilize the sea in our region to speed up the pace of developing our sea fishery. We must work hard for several years to ensure that total output value of aquatic products in the coastal counties and cities will exceed or be equal to the output value of their planting and breeding undertaking on land. It is necessary for us to create several additional cities and counties relying on sea resources. 2. Making use of winter agriculture: Our region has a temperate winter climate. It is beneficial to making use of winter idle farmland to develop the winter farming and breeding undertaking. In the future, the areas of winter agriculture must be increased year by year. We must strive to eliminate winter idle farmland in two or three years. 3. Making use of city suburbs. Rural areas in city suburbs must be developed around the needs of cities, and grasp well vegetable basket projects by developing vegetables, pig-raising, fishery, chickens, ducks, eggs, milk, and so on. This will not only ensure sufficient market supplies in cities, but also increase the income of peasants in city suburbs. 4. Making use of science and technology. We must devote our main efforts to producing high-quality vegetables, fine-breed pigs, precious fish, and rare birds and animals to significantly increase the economic efficiency of our farming and breeding undertaking. Zhao Fulin stressed: It is necessary for us to vigorously develop township and town enterprises. Due to the fact that our region was late in starting its township and town enterprises, we must now attach importance to developing undertakings related to resources. We must stick to the principle of the simultaneous movement of wheels, and multitrack advance. While attaching importance to developing rural collective economy, we must also pay attention to the development of individual and private economy. We must deepen rural reform to promote simultaneous development of grain and diversified economy with emphasis on promoting the shareholding system and the shareholding cooperative system. We must exercise land use rights in a flexible manner. Through the rural shareholding system, we must speed up and optimize the composition of the elements of production, including land, work force, funds and technology. We must speed up rural water conservancy works projects, and improve conditions for agricultural production. This will provide a guarantee for the stable growth of grain and the development of diversified economy. On the basis of improving the contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output, we must exercise land use rights in a flexible manner. We must mainly allow peasants to use land as their share in joining rural shareholding cooperative economic organizations. In some localities, land transfer with compensation such as leasing should be allowed. With regard to barren hills, hillside fields, waters, and sand, other forms of transfer should also be allowed. Zhao Fulin continued: Through promoting the shareholding system and the shareholding cooperative system, we must establish and improve our service system and speed up our comprehensive agricultural development. In the meantime, we must gradually realize specialization in our agricultural production, unification in operation, the combination of industry and agriculture, large- scale operation, and mutual supplementation of the strong points of grain and diversified economy aimed at common development.
