He did not advocate a direct transition to electing the head of state by popular vote, Scharping told journalists in Mainz on Wednesday. The implications that such a regulation would have for the constitution must be carefully examined, he said. He said he considers the decision made in Berlin to be legitimate; but he wanted to point out that the decision was based on 1990 election results. Over 800 delegates to the Federal Assembly came from parliaments that were elected four years ago. The SPD chairman wants to see his fierce criticism of the Free Democratic Party [FDP] put in perspective. The comment that the FDP is superfluous as a political force of its own only referred to the presidential election. At the same time Scharping exempted the Rhineland-Palatinate FDP, and thus the SPD's coalition partner, from this criticism, saying that they have proved to be an independent liberal force in the government alliance.
