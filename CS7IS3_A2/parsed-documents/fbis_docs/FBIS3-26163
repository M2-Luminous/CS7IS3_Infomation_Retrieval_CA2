In what way can we maintain better management over this special commodity of grain under the present market economic conditions? This staff reporter interviewed Lin Yifu, research fellow of the State Council Development Research Center, on this issue. [Reporter] People usually foresee a drop in grain prices after grain harvests, so the recent rise was quite unexpected. Can you explain this phenomenon for us? [Lin Yifu] Yes, in today's rural areas, control over the prices of grain and cooking oil have been lifted, the state monopoly for purchase and marketing abolished, and market regulations put into effect. In order to gain the initiative in management of the grain market, relevant government departments should learn to act according to the law of the market economy when they deal with relations between demand and supply in the market and with changes in such relations. For instance, increasing the income of peasants in grain-producing areas has long been a knotty problem, and also one of the major causes for the recent fluctuation in grain prices. It seems the best solution at the present stage would be for coastal provinces with a relatively low comparative advantage in grain production to reduce their grain-growing areas appropriately and give away a part of their grain market so they will have a greater demand for grain produced by grain-producing areas and can help increase the income of peasants in grain-producing areas through higher market prices. This may be an effective solution. The situation in the grain market last year exactly proved that the abolition of the policy of unified purchase and marketing of grain has helped us attain the goal of rationalizing the market setup in accordance with comparative superiority and the goal of enhancing the interests of grain-growers on the basis of market strength. This means that using the marketing concept to observe and analyze the rise in grain prices in grain-producing areas is a normal phenomenon that accompanies the structural readjustment of grain-producing areas. Of course, we should not overlook the fact that the recent drastic fluctuation in grain prices is also attributable to a number of abnormal factors. As it is known to all, ever since the reform of the purchase and marketing system began in 1992, the basic state policy has been to "relax price controls and ensure grain quantity"; in other words, the purchasing price is to be set by the market while the state will guarantee the fulfillment of a fixed grain purchasing quota of 100 billion jin. This policy meets with no difficulties when prices in the grain market are relatively low. However, when grain prices go up, local governments always find it hard to raise the selling price in urban areas on the basis of the purchase price. This is because, on the one hand, the grain- producing areas are plagued by a relatively backward economic development and urban dwellers in those areas have relatively lower personal incomes; on the other hand, local financial departments find themselves in difficulties and are unable to give urban residents any further allowance on grain prices. Under such circumstances, with a view to fulfilling their purchase quotas at a relatively low price, grain-producing areas adopted the method of forbidding any outflow of grain from the local market before they can fulfill their purchase quotas during a time when grain prices are going up as a result of coastal provinces' increased demand for grain. It is true that this measure can help check the rise of grain prices in grain-producing areas, yet it also has added to the already tight situation in the grain market of coastal provinces, thus pushing grain prices up to such an irrationally high level that they are unsuited to the readjusted production setup. The market price will remain stable if people can change their way of thinking, act in accordance with the rule of the market, and eliminate those man-made factors that can cause fluctuations in grain prices. [Reporter] Grain is a special commodity. How can we ensure stable growth in the country's grain production, prevent excessive fluctuations in market prices, and realize the goal of increasing grain production and the yield of grain-producing areas under socialist market economy conditions? [Lin] In my opinion, the most fundamental way to do this is to establish a country-wide unified general market. With this country-wide unified market, areas with a low comparative advantage in grain production naturally will get out of grain production and will have a greater demand for grain produced by grain-producing areas having a high comparative advantage. The increase in the market demand will push up grain prices; as a result, the peasants in grain-producing areas can benefit from increased production and yield, and consequently will display greater enthusiasm in grain production, thus achieving the goal of increasing and stabilizing the grain output. This point has been proved correct by the grain production in 1993, and also by the practice of relaxing price controls on vegetables, fruits, and fresh aquatic products over previous years. Theories and both domestic and overseas practices all have proved that the larger the market coverage, the greater is the possibility for different localities to supplement each other and fewer are the fluctuations in the market price. The establishment of a country-wide unified general market does not mean on any account that the government will keep no control over the country's grain production and marketing. It is necessary for the government to retain the policy of "relaxing price controls and ensuring grain quantity," while abolishing the system of unified purchase and marketing. Relaxing price control is a natural demand of the market economy, and the key issue is how we are going to "ensure grain quantity" in order to suit the principle of the market economy while simultaneously maintaining the stability of the grain market. At present, China's annual demand for grain totals around 900 billion jin, of which 600 billion jin is for peasants own use, while 300 billion jin is commodity grain. "Ensuring grain quantity" should mean ensuring a total supply quantity of 900 billion jin. In case the total grain output is lower than 900 billion jin, the state should draw on stocks or increase imports to make up the deficiency. Conversely, if the total output is higher than 900 billion jin, the state should reserve more grain or reduce imports so that there will not be excessive surplus grain. By so doing, the supply and demand will be in a well-balanced state, peasants' expectations on prices will not fluctuate following the increase or reduction of grain output, and the 300 billion jin of commodity grain will be guaranteed. Under the prerequisite of the socialist market economy, "ensuring grain quantity" should mean ensuring the total quantity supplied instead of the total quantity purchased. The task of ensuring grain quantity should be shouldered by grain departments at the central level, not by individual local governments. As a matter of fact, it is much easier to ensure a total supply of 900 billion jin than to fulfill a purchase quota of 100 billion jin. This is because over the past 40 years or more -- except for the years 1959 and 1960 -- the country's total grain output has never dropped for two consecutive years, while the annual reduction rate never exceeded 5 percent except in a few years. Therefore, an annual turnover volume in state grain reserves of no more than 50 billion jin can help maintain a stable grain price and a stable supply of commodity grain in the national grain market. [Reporter] Can we say that the recent fluctuation in grain prices has showed once again that strengthening and improving macroeconomic control and regulation is an indispensable link in building up a market economy structure? [Lin] Yes, and this is especially true with the management of grain as a special commodity, for macroeconomic control and regulation are essential with this commodity. Grain has a great bearing on the state planning and the livelihood of our people. Any abnormal fluctuations in the market price of grain which fail to be brought under effective control may possibly endanger social stability and tarnish the overall situation of reform. This time, because the government acted instantly and took resolute measures, the market price of grain returned to normal in less than 10 days. The measures taken by the government were highly prompt, necessary, and correct, which gives full expression to the great importance of the state's macroeconomic control and regulation, the position of state-owned grain enterprises as a major channel, and the role of state grain reserves in stabilizing supply and demand in the market. To us, the recent fluctuation in grain prices served as a concrete lesson in market economics, and the measures aimed at stabilizing grain prices were a valuable experience for us to use in our future grain work.
