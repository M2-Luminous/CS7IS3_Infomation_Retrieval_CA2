FR940721-0-00078 FR940721-0-00014 NHTSA addressed several issues concerning the supplier definitions in the NPRM. In commenting on the request for comments, Ford had asked that NHTSA consider a supplier owned jointly by more than one parent company as an allied supplier of both parents, especially in situations such as those in Canada, in which the Canadian government has laws requiring partial Canadian ownership of share. NHTSA stated that it believes that such a situation is akin to the joint venture agreement mentioned in section 210(f)(15) of the Cost Savings Act. The agency tentatively decided to treat the supplier in such a case as being wholly owned by one of the manufacturers in the joint venture agreement, and therefore an allied supplier for purposes of any carline jointly manufactured. After further consideration, however, NHTSA has decided that it cannot fully accommodate this suggestion by Ford. The agency notes that Ford made the following statement in its comment on the request for comments: We believe that suppliers and plants owned, operated, or controlled by the parent company (i.e., a consolidated subsidiary of the parent company or ``joint venture'' of partners in which the parent holds a majority interest) should be treated as allied suppliers. Thus, Ford appears to have been asking that the agency replace the specification in the statute that suppliers be ``wholly owned'' with a specification that they merely have to be ``controlled.'' NHTSA does not believe there is any justification for such a departure from the statute. Moreover, the agency believes that the statement in the NPRM that the situation is ``akin'' to the joint venture agreement mentioned in section 210(f)(15) was incorrect, i.e., there is no analogy between the two situations. As discussed below, the agency is clarifying the definition of allied supplier to encompass varying corporate structures where ownership is complete. However, a mere control relationship is not sufficient to make a supplier ``allied.'' In the NPRM, the agency specifically addressed the issue of a supplier owned by the parent company of the manufacturer. NHTSA stated that it recognizes that a supplier owned by the parent company of a manufacturer is not strictly wholly owned by the manufacturer. The agency noted, however, that if the parent is a holding company that wholly owns both the manufacturer and the supplier, there is no meaningful difference in this situation from that in which the strict definition of wholly owned occurs. In other words, there are no outside interests represented (as occurs if there are outside shareholders). Therefore, the agency tentatively decided to treat a supplier wholly owned by the parent holding company of a manufacturer as an allied supplier, provided that the parent holding company also wholly owns the manufacturer. Finally, NHTSA indicated that it read section 210(f)(17) as requiring wholly owned suppliers to allied suppliers to be treated as outside suppliers. The agency received a number of comments on the supplier definitions. Ford stated that to clarify the difference between suppliers and distributors, a definition of supplier should be incorporated into the definition section. It recommended the following definition, which it indicated is consistent with NAFTA_The term supplier means a person or an enterprise that manufactures or assembles passenger motor vehicle equipment. The agency does not agree that distributors should be eliminated from the definition of supplier. NHTSA observes that a distributor may supply passenger motor vehicle equipment to a manufacturer. Moreover, a manufacturer might have a relationship with a distributor to obtain certain equipment but not with the company which manufacturers or assembles the equipment. Ford also stated that the outside supplier definition requires clarification. It argued that the definition in the statute was not intended to include, in any way, allied suppliers. It stated that the regulation should clearly eliminate allied suppliers from the definition. Ford noted that an interpretation that an allied supplier becomes an outside supplier to the extent that it supplies equipment to another allied supplier could result in an allied supplied part having two sets of content values: the actual U.S./Canadian content when the component is supplied to the final assembly plant, and a rolled-up or down U.S./Canadian content when the component is sent to another allied manufacturing facility.
