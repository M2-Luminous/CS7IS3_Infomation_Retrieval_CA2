On 23 June ethnic minority soldiers used a SAM-7 rocket to shoot down a Chinese-made government F-7 attack bomber near Mongton. The two pilots were killed. According to a report, Burmese Government soldiers were sent to search for the bodies of the pilots. They engaged in an intense clash with ethnic minority soldiers who also tried to reach the downed aircraft. Regarding the fighting in Monghtaw, government troops lost several camps and ethnic minority soldiers were able to control most of the town. At 1500 on 25 June, ethnic minority soldiers ambushed government troops who were patrolling the east bank of the Salween River north of Mongchut, killing seven. Fighting reportedly subsided in many areas, particularly from the area opposite Muang District, Thailand's Mae Hong Son Province, to opposite Thailand's Chiang Dao District, and in the area opposite Mae Sai District and Mae Fa Luang Subdistrict. However, fighting around Mongchut and Monghtaw continues sporadically. Recent heavy rains have caused many soldiers from both sides to contract Malaria which resulted in a lull in the fighting.
