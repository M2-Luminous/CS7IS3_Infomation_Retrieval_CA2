According to the section of the agreement dealing with public finances, the most important elements of the reform will be the itemized investigation of state expenditure, the establishment of a central budget that is not based on figures of previous years, and cuts in state expenditure. A long-term financing strategy of state debts must be set up and the large number of separate state financial funds and foundations must be reduced, with some of them to be integrated into the central budget. The document plans a law on non-profit activity and on public procurement as well as the reorganization of the pension and health insurance system. The aim of the incoming coalition is to reduce central tax payments and to rise local tax payments in the long run. This however is feasible only when the economy grows. Steps must be taken towards the establishment of the single-tier value added tax [VAT] system with the compensation for those in need. VAT refunds on house building must also be re-introduced, the agreement says. Consumer taxes must be adjusted to inflation, the supervison of levy payment must be strengthened and tax evasion must be punished. Investment preferences must be standardized, personal income and company taxation must also be included in the standardization. According to the agreement, preferences must be given to portfolio investments with share purchase. Minimum taxation must be abolished. Withholding tax on deposit interests must be cut back to zero, and tax after securities must be reduced to a minimum in order to decrease interest margin, the document says. On the basis of the agreement, a lump-sum tax will be imposed on small businesses, which can than be controlled more easily. The issue of company taxation must be revised, and its amount may be reduced in the future in case of economic growth. Regarding personal income taxation, the agreement urges a more fair allocation of tax burdens among families, and income-related taxation must be introduced in the field of pension and other social benefits. It will enable taxpayers to use a part of their personal income tax on various public, non-political purposes. With the adjustment of duty tariffs to European standards, market defensive measures approved by GATT and the European Union must be implemented. Another aim of the agreement is to reduce local government dependence on the central budget and with this, to decrease central re-allocation. As a first step, local authorities will be allocated at least 35 percent of the personal income tax revenue, instead of the current 30 percent.
