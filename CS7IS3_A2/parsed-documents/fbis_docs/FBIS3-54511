The final session is under way. More details from our correspondents at the Palais des Nations: [Correspondent] Dear listeners everywhere, God's peace and mercy be upon you. As you heard, we are now following the final session of the national conference of consensus. The main event of this session is the report being presented by the rapporteur of the committee in charge of drafting the platform of national dialogue. One of the most important points of this report thus far is that the committee has reached a number of decisions. First of all, with regard to the article pertaining to the appointment of the presidential body [Article Six], the committee kept the version of the original text which stipulates that it is the Higher Security Council which appoints the head of the presidential body. The latter can appoint one or two deputies. The two deputies will assist the head of state in the tasks which he entrusts them with. So as I have said, the head of state will be appointed by the Higher Security Council. As regards Article 27 pertaining to the Transitional National Assembly [al-majlis al-watani al-intiqali], the committee in charge of drafting the platform proposes to increase the number of seats from 180 to 200. These seats will be divided according to the following percentages: 15 percent of the seats will be reserved for representatives of state bodies, and the remaining 75 percent will be equally divided among the political parties, associations, economic organizations, and other organizations. The installation of the Transitional National Assembly will take place three months after the latter has been formed. It has also been decided to abolish the board of censorship since nothing justifies its existence, the document says. Another article in the document stipulates that the head of state can rule by decrees in the period between his appointment and the appointment of the transitional national assembly. In other words, the period between the two appointments has not been fixed. The political resolution says that actions and measures have to be taken in order of priority with a view to ending the political crisis. This resolution adds that the end of the political crisis will inevitably have to go through the electoral process, but there are other actions which must be undertaken and other conditions which must be met in the economic, social, and security fields. The resolution further says that the constitution remains in all circumstances the legal framework of the transitional period. But, the resolution adds, the constitution cannot be implemented in full since, for example, it will be impossible to hold elections soon. However, emphasis was put on the need to return to the electoral process as soon as possible and also on the need to amend some laws during the transitional period, such as the electoral code, the law on political parties, and the information code. This point was in fact included in the original text of the draft platform. [Announcer] Rachid Benhmimid, we give you back the line to follow the rest of the statement read out by the rapporteur of the committee in charge of drafting the document and also the proposals made by the committee to the national conference which is meeting at this very moment. These proposals will be put to the vote very shortly.
