The General Administration of Customs promulgated the Customs Anticorruption Regulations in 1990, and the Regulations on Certain Concrete Issues Concerning Personal Relations Between Customs Personnel and People With Whom They Have Work Connections, in 1991. The General Administration of Customs also recently made certain amendments to these two sets of regulations. The revised regulations maintain most of their original provisions. The new anticorruption requirements laid down last year also were officially written into the regulations. The customs are not allowed to run business enterprises, except for those providing logistics and technological support; nor to seek patronage from the institutions with which they have work relations; nor to participate in costly recreational activities specially arranged for customs personnel by the institutions with which they have work relations; nor to intervene in the law enforcement process by interceding for people involved in customs investigation cases.
