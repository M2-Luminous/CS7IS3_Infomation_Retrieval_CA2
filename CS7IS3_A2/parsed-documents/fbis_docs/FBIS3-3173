He said that if the present political line continues to develop, China will become a capitalist society led by a communist party guided by non- Marxist theories in less than 15 years, or even in seven to eight years. We cannot use the manifesto of a ruling party as the standard for judging what road a country takes and what structure it establishes, but must look at the political line of the ruling party and the specific principles and policies its pursues. The so-called leftist political parties, the socialist parties and labor parties of the European countries, also practice capitalism. Today, I can say with certainty that there cannot even be half of the total number of party members who think that the present political line is following the socialist road. Deng Liqun also said: I will not waver at all in my own beliefs. Deng Liqun's remarks were excerpted from bulletins issued by the General Office of the CPC Central Committee.
