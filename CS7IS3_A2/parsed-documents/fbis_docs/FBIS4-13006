FBIS4-13006 "drnes073_c_94002" FBIS-NES-94-073 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 Egypt Asyut Governor Interviewed on Terrorism Asyut Governor Interviewed on Terrorism NC1404123794 Cairo AL-AHALI in Arabic 6 Apr 94 p 6 NC1404123794 Cairo AL-AHALI Arabic BFN [Interview with Asyut Governor Major General Samih al-Sa'id by Sami Fahmi in Asyut; date not given] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Fahmi] What is the reason for the rising wave of terrorism in Asyut? [Al-Sa'id] The tightening security fist in Asyut and the tightening noose around the terrorists have led the latter to resort to desperate terrorist operations. What is happening in Asyut is similar to swatting a "wasp's nest," when the wasps get irritated they will try anything. Everyone should know that Asyut is now different than it used to be. The Islamic groups do not hold activities in al-Rahmah Mosque, not even weekly seminars. Extremist activities have been brought under control. There are no longer marches like the ones that were staged during the Night of Revelation or during the nights that mark the first day of each Hegira month. [Fahmi] Does this mean that the security forces start "the action?" [Al-Sa'id] The security organ is in control of the situation. I do not know what you mean by the word "action." [Fahmi] I mean the security organ takes the initiative by raiding the extremists and the terrorist moves are merely a "reaction." [Al-Sa'id] What the terrorists are now doing is the result of their bankruptcy. [Fahmi] How do you explain the calm in the governorates neighboring Asyut (al-Minya, Suhaj) and the inflamed situation in Asyut? [Al-Sa'id] There are historic factors to consider. We cannot ignore the fact that the Islamic groups were first formed in Asyut University in the late 1970's and this helped them spread. There are also differences between the Islamic groups. Some of the terrorist elements that are carrying out terrorist acts in Asyut come from Suhaj, al-Wadi al-Jadid, and al-Minya. [Fahmi] What helped the Islamic groups spread in the 1970's, as you mentioned? Was there official support? [Al-Sa'id] I cannot answer because I was abroad at the time. [Fahmi] Are the security organs, with their present resources and power, capable of dealing with terrorism? [Al-Sa'id] The security forces are in control of the situation all over the governorate. The security fist is not concentrating on one area at the expense of another. Security measures are being tightened everywhere. The security organs are capable of handling this, but the support of the people is necessary. The government is meeting the Interior Ministry's demands within the limits of available resources. [passage omitted] [Fahmi] Does the situation in Asyut require the armed forces' help to safeguard the vital installations? [Al-Sa'id] The vital installations are secured according to specific guidelines. There is the popular defense, which plays a role in defending the installations. The military counselor in the governorate leads the popular defense operations in accordance with established plans and targets. [Fahmi] Some people are saying that armed forces' intervention might be necessary to control the explosive situation. [Al-Sa'id] It is my personal view that we will not reach this point. I have great hopes for the popular action that is confronting terrorism and the support being given to the security forces in Asyut so that the situation will be decided in favor of society's security and stability.
