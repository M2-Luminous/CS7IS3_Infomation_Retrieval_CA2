In his answer to the interpellation by independent deputy Kamal Khalid this evening, the interior minister said that Egypt enjoys the brightest era of democracy and its prudent leadership is now sponsoring a national dialogue to shape a safer, more stable, and prosperous future. He noted that calls for the protection of human rights are out of place in Egypt, adding that those who make such calls are encouraged by foreign quarters. The interior minister pointed out that what the government has done to provide security and safety cannot be ignored, adding that preserving security and stability is our duty. He noted that the government, using legal and decisive measures, has confronted a conspiracy concocted by a group of wrongdoers who have deviated from the correct path and thought that they could undermine the people's accomplishments. The government has succeeded in curbing the threat of terrorism, he added, noting that the security agencies' measures against it has reflected the will of the people and that the verdicts passed by the Egyptian judiciary categorically condemned terrorism and all those who advocate it. The interior minister pointed out that in 1993 and the past months of 1994 the Interior Ministry's agencies have thwarted a serious threat against society, legitimacy, and the security of the homeland and the people. During this period, he added, 257 terrorist cases involving 1,802 terrorists have been uncovered, thanks to the sound scientific planning, high-level performance, and extraordinary efforts of policemen. He noted that the interpellator's claims of violations of human rights are a clear omission of the facts and of the evils of extremism. He added: Let me remind the interpellator of the guarantees provided in the Constitution regarding human rights, the protection of the people's security and stability, and the procedures followed in prisons, which are under the full supervision and control of the judicial authorities. Minister al-Alfi referred to the statement issued by the majority of members of the Lawyers Association in which they denounced the attempt by a few members who belong to the Muslim Brotherhood to control the association, adding that these members support terrorism. He noted that the interpellation refers to incidents involving some arrested lawyers. He added that these incidents are being investigated by prosecutors, who have decided to remand the defendants, 12 of whom are not lawyers, in custody. He asked: Did the deputy submit his interpellation because the government is doing its job in implementing the law and respecting the judiciary? He added: As for the question of the arrested lawyers, it falls within the jurisdiction of the judiciary. Al-Alfi noted that the memorandum attached to the interpellation elaborated about the question of mediation between the government and terrorists. The minister asked: What mediation does it refer to and why at this particular time? He added: The question of mediation between the government and terrorists has long since been settled; there is no room for mediation between legitimacy and illegitimacy. In the face of extremism and those supporting it, there will be nothing but extremely firm legal confrontation without hesitation, he added. The interior minister spoke about the circumstances surrounding the recent death of 'Abd-al-Harith Madani. He said that investigations into and information about the explosions in some banks proved that the dead lawyer played a major role in the illicit activities and that he received organizational instructions directly from the terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam. The prosecution issued a warrant for his arrest. The defendant was arrested in his house in al-Haram and informed of the prosecution's warrant. Upon searching his home in al-Haram, a number of important papers were found. He said that when the late lawyer was taken to his other house for it to be searched, he suffered from difficulty in breathing and was taken to al-Manyal Hospital for first aid treatment; he died there. The diagnosis showed that the cause of death was a severe asthmatic attack. He noted that some defendants admitted the organizational role the dead lawyer had played; he was the direct link with Tal'at Yasin Hammam for transmitting orders among the leaders of the organization from inside and outside prison. He exploited the nature of his work as a lawyer. He also received funding from the organization amounting to 45,000 Egyptian pounds, with $3,000 to spend for organizational purposes. The interior minister said that the brother of the dead lawyer, Salah Madani, also belongs to the terrorist organization and is a defendant in one of the terrorist cases. On the action by the Lawyers' Association after the lawyer's death, the interior minister said that we monitored some suspicious moves by the association that increased day by day, even after the official announcement about the circumstances surrounding the death. In fact, some lawyers tried to contact other associations for incitement purposes, but these did not respond. Hasan al-Alfi added that we are sure that there was a premeditated attempt to create sedition and riot. In particular, a number of people who gathered on the streets threw bricks and stones from behind the fences. After that, a number of the people walked out on the street. In addition, the police received information that some lawyers were armed. The interior minister repeated that the security organs were quite tolerant of all the practices that were considered wrong, especially since most of the legitimate means were open to the lawyers and association members to make their demands known and pose their questions. But a small group of members violated legitimacy by attacking the regime. He pointed out that 48 individuals were arrested, 12 of whom were not lawyers. The prosecution charged them with many things, such as participating in a criminal act with the objective to commit crimes of mobbing, demonstrating, attacking the authorities, hampering them in performing their duties by using force and intimidation, organizing a demonstration against the law, as well as spreading false statements to disturb public peace and possessing publications that incite demonstration. The interior minister affirmed that no extraordinary measures were taken to confront the situation. The entire situation has been presented to the investigating bodies. He added that no one is above the law, despite the fact that the defendants are lawyers. He clarified that there is no alternative to legitimacy and that every violation will be firmly confronted with force. However, false allegations will not terrorize us and we will not back down on our responsibilities before God and the people, he added. We shall not hesitate because our unwavering option is Egypt itself. The interior minister noted that 120 defendants have been arrested in connection with the terrorist organization connected to the terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam. The People's Assembly then proceeded to discuss its agenda upon a request signed by 35 members. The Interior Ministry was thanked for its efforts.
