FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ruby Cozad, at telephone number: (202) 208&hyph;4871. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 30, 1987, the Bureau published proposed Adult Education Program rules in the Federal Register . These regulations are being re-proposed because of the considerable passage of time since that publication. In January, 1991, the Bureau conducted consultation meetings with tribes, parents, school boards, and other interested parties concerning the Adult Education Program regulations. Oral testimony and written statements were received in the Office of Indian Education Programs until February 26, 1991. The Bureau considered the comments, objections, and suggested changes received in response to the 1987 Federal Register publication and the 1991 consultation meetings in re-proposing these regulations. This proposed rule is published in exercise of authority delegated by the Secretary of the Interior to the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs by 209 DM 8. The information and record keeping requirements contained in this rule will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval as required by 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The collection of this information will not be required until approved by the Office of Management and Budget. The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practical, to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments regarding the proposed rule to the location identified in the ADDRESSES section of this document. The Department of the Interior has determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and no detailed statement is required pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Department of the Interior has determined that this regulation is a major rule under Executive Order 12866 and therefore will be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. This rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). These regulations will affect only the delivery of adult education services to eligible individual Indian adults. They will not have an impact on small entities as defined in the Act. The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these proposed regulations meet the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. In accordance with Executive Order 12630, the Department has determined that this rule does not have significant takings implications. The Department has determined that this rule does not have significant federalism effects. The primary author of this document is Mr. Harvey Jacobs, Education Specialist, Branch of Post Secondary Education, Office of Indian Education Programs. The eligibility of Indian adults participating in this program is contained within 25 U.S.C. Section 2008(f)(1). The Bureau feels the definition ``eligible Indian student'' stated in the aforementioned statute should be extended to Indian adults participating in this program. Comments are especially desired on this section of eligibility.
