The State Council made a timely decision on carrying out a nationwide general price inspection and this won the heartfelt support of the masses. The people hoped that the general price inspection would check the momentum of the price increases and urgently demanded that the relevant government departments take serious action against the practice of irregularly raising prices and charges in order to effectively advance reform, promote development, and maintain stability. At present, the six price inspection teams which were sent to various parts of the country for nearly one month have returned to Beijing. This article will inform our readers about the major results of the general price inspection, the problems discovered by the inspection teams, and their opinions on the measures for the next step. The main results: Along with the implementation of various control measures and the general price inspection, the rapid price raises throughout the whole country have begun to abate. At present, the general price inspection has been going on in all parts of the country. Two-thirds of the 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities have achieved good or comparatively good results, which mainly find expression in the following: --Enhancing the understanding of the necessity to exercise management and control over prices under the conditions of the market economy. Since the beginning of this year, the leading comrades of the party central body and the State Council have repeatedly stressed the need to strengthen macrocontrol, curb inflation, and maintain social stability. They have also criticized the one-sided and laissez-faire approach toward price management. This time, with the adoption of various measures for regularizing and controlling prices, a propaganda campaign was also organized by the propaganda department according to the instructions by the State Council leading comrades. Through giving publicity to the price control measures and organizationally implementing the measures on a large scale, the party and the government showed their sincerity and determination to the masses in effectively bringing the prices under control; this also caused the responsible people of the local governments to understand that price control was an important function of the government in economic management and made producers and dealers aware that one cannot do whatever one likes in the market economy. Thus, the general atmosphere for exercising price control in the market economy has basically taken shape and the laissez-faire condition prevalent since prices were decontrolled has been changed. --Promoting the implementation of various measures formulated by the state for price control and management. It is learned that some provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) have set up their own grain risk funds: Shanghai's amounted to 400 million yuan; 350 million yuan in Jiangsu; 250 million yuan in Guangdong; 303 million in Shaanxi; 100 million yuan in Heilongjiang; and 70 million yuan in Ningxia. At present, almost all state-owned and collective retail shops and institutions which charge service fees have clearly marked the prices of the goods and services they sell. Practices such as selling goods and services with clearly marked prices has also been adopted by increasing numbers of private enterprises and fixed stalls. In some areas with good results, the practice of selling goods and services with clearly marked prices accounted for 75 percent of all retailers. All provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) have worked out their own measures for implementing the regulations laid down by the State Council for supervising the prices of daily necessities and basic services. Nine provinces and municipalities have announced such measures and put them into effect. Some provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) included a number of additional categories in the scope of price supervision, such as vegetables, medicine, household electric appliances, commodity housing, haircutting and hairdressing, and public bathroom operations. Heilongjiang Province laid down rules for managing the prices of grain, cooking oil, and vegetables. Tianjin Municipality required that applications first be filed for increasing the prices of some medicines, vinegar, noodles, toilet paper, and matches. Guangdong Province's Price Control Authority formulated 11 sets of regulations for market prices, fees charged by administrative institutions, education fees, medical care fees, medicine prices, service fees charged by hotels and restaurants, the pricing practice in various trades, the antimonopoly and antifraud operations, and for the price adjustment fund. At present, the regulations are being deliberated on or have been submitted to the upper authorities for approval. While decontrolling the vegetable and pork wholesale business, Shenzhen City exercises control over the differences between the buying and selling prices of the retailers; this not only guarantees the reasonable profits of those involved in the transactions but also protects the interests of both producers and consumers. The Shanghai Municipal Price Control Authority formulated and implemented the "Interim Regulations on Prohibiting Price Fraud and Profiteering" and the "Rules for Awarding Penalties to Profiteers in the Entertainment, Catering, Clothing, and Mechanical and Electric Appliances Trades." They explicitly stipulate that those who raise the prices of the goods and services by 50 percent to 150 percent over the normal price level fixed by the price control authority will be regarded as profiteers and will be punished for their profiteering activities. In the month after the rules and regulations came into force on a trial basis, definite results were achieved in checking profiteering behavior and protecting the interests of consumers. In order to stabilize prices, Jilin Province, Tianjin Municipality, and Wuhan City decided that no price adjustment would be made this year; Dalian City postponed the planned adjustment of gas fees, water fees, and school fees. Many cities paid attention to the supply of food and intensified market construction and management. Practice showed that general price inspections create favorable conditions for the implementation of the price control measures and the implementation of the price control measures provide policy foundations for the price inspections and promote the in-depth development of the inspections. --Handling a number of lawbreaking cases in the aspect of prices. In the general inspection, the various localities mainly examined the illegal practice of directly violating the regulations on prices, the rates of price difference, and the fee standards of goods and services fixed by the state; the behavior of some retailers who do not mark the prices clearly; and the irregular practice of adding the 17- or 13-percent value-added taxes to the commodity prices or raising prices on a wide scope and by a big margin. According to statistics in 19 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities), between 10 March and 15 April, they discovered and handled 61,384 cases of violating the price regulations and the total money involved in these cases amounted to 53.89 million yuan; 47,397 of these cases were handled and the fines imposed on the people and institutions involved in these cases amounted to 27.9959 million yuan. Of the cases discovered in the general price inspection, 20,345 were related to the prices of people's daily necessities; 471 cases were related to the prices of production materials being dealt with in a monopolistic way; 672 cases were related to the prices of agricultural production materials; 1,139 cases were related to the prices of public utilities; and 1,257 cases were related to fees charged by administrative institutions. Various localities made great efforts to inspect the prices of grain, cooking oil, and other consumer goods and basic services closely related to the people's livelihood. In Heilongjiang Province, the inspection was personally directed by the vice governor of the province who took charge plus the participation of three deputy secretaries general of the provincial government and the leading cadres of the price control authority. They inspected the prices of grain in the links of processing, wholesale, and retail and discovered, and solved in a timely fashion, the problem of insufficient supply in the main channel. They also laid down a price ceiling policy and rapidly stabilized the prices of grain and cooking oil in just a number of days. Liaoning Province dispatched 756 people to examine the grain prices and check a new round of price raises. In particular, Shenyang City imposed fines on more than 10 grain shops which sold grain at prices higher than those fixed by the government and seriously criticized some grain shops which tried to hoard goods to making higher profits. These actions checked the panic buying phenomena in some areas and stabilized the mass psychology. Actions were taken to check the irregular practice of raising the prices of salt in Dandong, Liaoning, of medicine in Shiyan, Hubei, and of gas in Guangzhou. The price inspections effectively checked the tendency toward irregular increases of prices and service charges. Various localities in particular made public a number of typical and serious cases which had produced widespread evil impact and the handling of such cases was reported by the mass media. So far, 1,224 cases of violating the price control laws and regulations have been handled publicly throughout the whole country. This played a role in warning and deterring those involved in the illegal activities, supporting the grass-roots price inspectors, and promoting the development of the general price inspection. --Prompting producers and business dealers to pay attention to their internal price management. According to the arrangements by the local authorities, many enterprises carried out self-examination and self-correction and took the initiative in correcting their own behavior in fixing prices. On 12 March, Dianmen Food Market in Beijing and 99 other institutions named as being the best units in abiding by the state's price and measurement regulations and policies, jointly published their proposal on maintaining the market stability in RENMIN RIBAO. They called on all the state-owned commercial institutions to play a leading role in restraining price increases in the market, boycotting inferior and counterfeit commodities, and effectively guaranteeing the interests of consumers. Shandong Province required all commercial enterprises to name their own price inspectors and adopt five management systems (the bookkeeping system, the decisionmaking system, the system for marking clearly prices for goods and services, the system of regular price examinations, and the system of market investigations), thus perfecting the self-discipline mechanism with regard to commodity prices. Wuhan City's Zhongnan Commercial Building carried out across-the-board examination of clearly marking prices for all the commodities it sold and imposed fines on those who bore direct responsibility for not marking prices or marking wrong prices. The fines ranged from 20 to over 1,000 yuan. The People's Market in Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, began to sell goods popular with customers at lower profit rates in April and played a leading role in restraining the market prices from increasing. Because of the gradual implementation of the price control measures and the general price inspection, the excessive price increases throughout the whole country have been restrained. In March, the national retail price index rose by a margin of 0.7 of a percentage point lower than in February; the monthly increase rate was 0.7 percent, or 2.4 percentage points lower than that in February. The prominent problems: The price situation remains serious and prices in some fields remain out of control. Some people still do not fully understand the necessity to strengthen price management. There remain substantial difficulties and obstructions in the handling of cases of violating price management regulations. The price control institutions and personnel are not sufficiently stable. The state the nationwide general price inspection and the situation in the macroeconomic operations showed that the present price situation is not a favorable one and the actual implementation of various price control measures, and the conduct of the general price inspection, still require unremitting efforts. At present, the prominent problems in price control and inspection are as follows: 1. The price situation remains serious. This is manifested by the fact that prices are still increasing at a high rate; retail prices are still increasing; and, in particular, the prices of basic consumer goods and services in people's daily lives and the prices of basic production materials are increasing at a rate higher than the average. In the first quarter of this year, the price indexes of the 15 categories of commodities (including grain, meat, poultry, eggs, aquatic products, and vegetables) all showed increases to differing degrees. A noteworthy fact is that, since March, the prices of grain and cooking oil in some provinces and autonomous regions have risen again. The price indexes in both the urban and rural areas rose at the same time. In some rural areas, prices rose by a bigger margin than in the urban areas. The differences between the rates of increase in the urban and rural areas were only 0.1, 1.4, and 0.4 percentage points. [sentence and percentages as published] In short, it is still rather difficult to bring the rate of price increases within the target scope of the control. The main reasons are: First, demand remains too strong and continues to pull up the prices and some departments and localities are seeking an unrealistically high rate of growth and are blindly expanding the size of investment and increasing the consumption fund. This caused the excessive issuance of currency for the past several consecutive years, caused the potential inflation pressure, and brought about a strong demand-led pulling force applied to the commodity prices on the market. Second, the accumulated costs were released in a larger quantity and this also pushed up the prices. In the last few years, the prices of many basic products and basic facilities were decontrolled and this increased the costs of the downstream products. The higher degree of the economy's market orientation also raised the prices of land, capital, and labor by larger margins and this also directly increased the costs of the enterprises' investment, production, and trade. Such accumulated costs are being turned into a force to push up the commodity prices in the currently brisk market. Third, the momentum of spontaneous price increases became stronger. After the prices of most commodities were decontrolled there was no effective means for controlling and regulating the market prices. Since the beginning of this year, some enterprises took advantage of the reform of the tax system and the foreign exchange system to raise the prices of their products and the prices of the goods they sold. This increased the impact of the spontaneous price increases. 2. Some local government leaders do not fully understand the necessity and urgency of controlling price increases, do not adopt effective price control measures, and do not act according to the requirements of the central authorities. This found expression in the following. First, they are not fully aware of the seriousness of the current situation in which prices are continuing to increase at a high rate. Second, they are setting the task of controlling the price increases against the task of economic development. Third, they think that they might suffer losses if they control the prices and might gain benefits if they allow prices to go freely. Fourth, they shift the responsibility for price control to the central authorities. And fifth, they lack confidence in achieving the goal of keeping the rate of price increase within 10 percent this year. Because there were differences between their thinking and the requirements of the central authorities, the localities made slow progress in establishing the grain risk funds, the food price regulation funds, and the reserves system for important materials; failed to adopt effective measures to control prices; and they even continued to adopt new plans and measures for raising the charges of various public utilities. 3. The circulation order was disrupted and prices in some fields went out of control. In the course of transforming their management and operation mechanisms, some state-owned commercial and trade enterprises neglected the social effects of their behavior, failing to play the role as the main channel in the field of circulation. In particular, after the prices of most commodities were decontrolled, and because the economic means and the legal means were imperfect to a serious degree, prices in some fields went out of control and the phenomena of price regulations violations became very serious. Some typical actions were as follows: Some grain shops sold grain and cooking oil at prices higher than the prices fixed by the state. Some enterprises produced chemical fertilizer, steel products, and other production materials and sold their products at high prices. Some enterprises took advantage of the reform of the tax system to include the value-added taxes in the prices of the commodities they sold, thus raising the commodity prices. Some medical, educational, postal and telecommunications, and rural electric power institutions charged irregular fees. The price differences in the intermediary links of the circulation of some farm products and some daily-use industrial goods were too large and, as a result, both producers and consumers suffered losses, while dealers in the intermediary links earned handsome profits. Some private garment shop owners and food stall owners cheated their customers by selling their goods at high prices in order to profiteer. All these things not only harmed the interests of the consumers but also aggravated the unfairness in the field of wealth distribution and disrupted the economic order. 4. The general price inspection developed unevenly and the actions against the cases of violating the price management regulations encountered great difficulties and obstructions. Some local government leaders did not attach importance to the work in this regard. They only relayed the instructions of the upper authorities but did not take concrete action to implement such instructions and did not include the general price inspection in the work schedule of the governments. Some local governments did not lay down explicit targets and requirements for the price inspection and did not make concrete arrangements by the end of March. Some localities did not take effective price control measures while carrying out the price inspection and did not work out concrete and feasible steps for implementing the price control measures laid down by the State Council. Some localities did not create a public opinion environment to support the general inspection and to check the behavior of raising prices and imposing charges irregularly. Because of the backwardness of the legislative process and the indistinct policies, plus the weakness of the inspection means and the lack of mandatory measures, the handling of the cases of violating the price management regulations encountered great difficulties and obstructions. In just over one month after the beginning of the general price inspection, there were six cases of attacking and beating up price inspectors who were performing their official duties. In addition, some local price management institutions were unstable and there was high personnel turnover in those institutions. This also weakened the price management and affected the effectiveness of the price supervision and inspection. The task for the next step is to further implement the price control measures on the basis of unifying the thinking, lay stress on the key points of inspection, quicken the pace of legislation concerning price management, and strive to achieve marked results in the field of price management. In March this year, when listening to the report about the price situation, General Secretary Jiang Zemin said: Keeping prices stable is the key to the proper handling of the relationship between reform, development, and stability. In the final analysis, it is now necessary to resolutely and effectively curb inflation. Premier Li Peng, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, and Vice Premier Zou Jiahua also stressed many times that curbing inflation and strengthening price control is the key task in the economic work at the present stage. Responsible people of all localities and departments should enhance their consciousness and unify their thinking in line with this requirement, overcome various one-sided viewpoints, and maintain the same position as the party central leading body. The local and departmental interests should give way to the overall national interests. In the economic work, importance must be attached to curbing inflation and stabilizing market prices. It is necessary to suppress the upward tendency of inflation by every possible means and strive to keep the increase rate of the general retail price index within 10 percent. This was a decision made by the party central leading body and the State Council and was approved by the National People's Congress. All localities must resolutely carry it out and adopt effective measures to achieve good results in the field of price management. Carrying out the nationwide general price inspection was a major measure adopted by the State Council for stabilizing the overall situation. The leading comrades of the State Council set forth five criteria for judging the effectiveness of the general price inspection. We should meet the five criteria in the whole process of the general price inspection. In the next step of the price inspection, the concrete objectives are as follows: 1. To see whether or not the state's price control measures have really been implemented, the concrete measures, such as those for supervising prices and ensuring that the prices are marked clearly, have been properly carried out, and whether or not the grain risk funds and the food price regulation funds have been set up. 2. To see whether or not the malpractice of irregular price increases and irregular charges in the localities has been effectively checked, the action of taking advantage of reforms to raise prices has been corrected, and whether or not the cases of violating the price management regulations have been properly handled. 3. To see whether or not both positive and negative cases have been made public and whether or not public opinion has further played a role in supervising prices. 4. To see whether or not producers and dealers have a stronger sense of abiding by the laws and regulations with regard to prices and have adopted more effective self-discipline measures. 5. To see whether or not the momentum of excessive price increases has abated and the rate of price increase has declined somewhat. All localities should adopt effective measures in the light of such requirements and strive to achieve solid results. It is necessary to organize special inspections on the key categories of goods which raised the general price level most seriously and on the key items about which the masses complained most strongly. In the whole country, it is first necessary to guarantee the stability of the prices of grain, cooking oil, and other daily necessities. All localities should regularly examine the prices of grain and cooking oil and see whether they are above the price level fixed by the State Council and the local governments at all levels. It is necessary see whether or not such management and supervisory measures as submitting the plans for adjusting the prices of other basic daily-use goods to the authorities concerned for approval and record and controlling the price differences (profit margins) in the dealings of such goods, are properly carried out, whether or not the action of taking advantage of the reform of the tax system and the foreign exchange system to raise commodity prices has been corrected, and whether or not the grain risk funds and the food price adjustment funds have been set up. At the same time, in view of the fact that the price of cotton is rising sharply, it is necessary to inspect various links in the purchase and supply of cotton. Second, it is necessary to inspect the prices of chemical fertilizer, diesel oil for farming purposes, electricity for farming purposes, steel products, coal, and petroleum products and to see whether or not the prices of such materials have been raised in violation of the relevant regulations. Third, it is necessary to see whether or not the basic service charges, including the prices of coal, gas, LP gas, rents, water, electricity, local bus services, and local public telephone services have been raised in violation of the relevant regulations. Various provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) can increase the items of inspection in the light of their specific conditions. In the course of inspecting the key items, a number of cases of violating the price management regulations should be handled publicly. It is necessary to quicken the process of legislation with regard to price management, draft the "Price Law" as soon as possible, formulate the antimonopoly, antiprofiteering, antifraud laws and regulations, regularize various pricing behaviors, and begin to draft the "Price Supervision and Inspection Regulations." Before the national laws and regulations for price management are officially promulgated, various localities should be encouraged to formulate their local regulations in the light of their specific conditions and their successful experience should be summed up and introduced to other parts of the country. It is necessary to maintain the stability of the price control institutions and their personnel and to make necessary manpower and material replenishment to such institutions. The means of inspection should be strengthened. Propaganda and public opinion should also be further strengthened and public opinion should play a more effective role in supervising prices. In order to further advance the general price inspection, it is necessary to stress the need to exercise more effective leadership, to carry out closer cooperation between different departments, and to remove disturbances and obstructions. The governments at all levels should attach great importance to the general price inspection, include it their work schedules, assign principal leaders to personally take up this matter, and assign special officials to take charge of the inspection by making across-the-board arrangements and ensuring the implementation of the concrete steps. Problems arising in the work should be resolved in a timely fashion. Various departments should conscientiously implement the spirit of the relevant documents issued by the State Council and the spirit of the telephone conference on the nationwide general price inspection. The financial departments should guarantee the working funds for dealing with the cases in the price inspection; the financial and tax departments should improve the scheme for reforming the tax system and join hands with the price control department in properly resolving the price problems caused by the additional tax burdens for a small number of enterprises. The banks should help the price inspection organs to execute their decisions by debiting the accounts of the institutions and individuals who refuse to pay the fines for their violations of the price management regulations. The industrial and commercial administrative organs should prompt private enterprises, individually-run businesses, and stall owners in the fairs to clearly mark the prices of the goods they sell and should support the execution of the decisions of the price control organs on suspending the business licenses of those shops which are found violating the price regulations. The technical supervision organs should intensify the inspection of the measuring tools and the quality of the goods and resolutely punish those who sell inferior goods at high prices, give short measure, and raise prices irregularly in various forms. The public security organs should take measures to protect the personal safety of the price inspectors when they are performing their official duties. The supervision department should take administrative disciplinary action against officials who shield the misconduct of violating the price regulations. The grain supply organs should properly handle the purchase, transportation, and storage of grain in order to guarantee grain supplies in all localities. The commercial department should guarantee the supply of the people's daily necessities on the markets.
