[Brazauskas] This decision is part of an ongoing process. Since the declaration of independence in 1990, we have proceeded along this path. This step is in line with the atmosphere in our society. The precondition was the withdrawal of the Russian Army. Then I exchanged letters with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner. The resolution adopted by the Sejm on this issue on 23 December was also of major significance in this respect. [BERLINER ZEITUNG] Does your country feel threatened by Russia? [Brazauskas] No. [BERLINER ZEITUNG] When you applied for NATO membership, did you take into consideration possible reactions by Moscow? Were there any consultations? [Brazauskas] We expected a reaction from Moscow. It was quite strong and reflects the complicated situation in Russia itself. Yet we do not believe that this reaction is a danger to the good relations between Russia and Lithuania. We hope that every European country will find its place in the new European security structures. [BERLINER ZEITUNG] The collapse of the USSR began in the Baltic states. It seems as though the integration of former communist republics into Western structures begins there, too. Do you have the feeling that you are playing a special role and fulfilling a historic mission? [Brazauskas] I do not believe that a single country, large or small, should be claiming that it is fulfilling a historic mission. [BERLINER ZEITUNG] Do you think that Lithuania's acceptance by the European Union might be sufficient as far as military security is concerned, or will NATO membership remain the vital and imperative objective? [Brazauskas] We do not expect the issue of our NATO membership to be settled positively in the near future. Yet we hope that the process leading to membership will soon be initiated. Lithuania believes that it will join NATO via the European Union. To use a metaphor, the European Union will open the door for us. If we are able to make use of the new opportunities, we will be much closer to NATO. [BERLINER ZEITUNG] Mr. President, do you believe that in the current new historical period NATO should be giving way to new and broader security structures, including both the NATO states and the members of the former Warsaw Pact? [Brazauskas] Forecasts are not very useful. What is important is for all countries from Vancouver to Vladivostok to feel secure in the future. [BERLINER ZEITUNG] If Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic should become NATO members, Moscow will be left "outside." Do you think that this might have the effect of making Russia feeling psychologically isolated and less secure than today? [Brazauskas] The system of antagonistic military blocs in Europe and the world should not be revived. We are obliged to ensure that the transformation and expansion of NATO does not provoke any hostile reactions from Russia. Lithuania does not want to isolate its eastern neighbors. I would like to make it clear that Lithuania's position toward NATO is not directed against neighboring states or other European countries, which must all find their place in the new security structures of the continent.
