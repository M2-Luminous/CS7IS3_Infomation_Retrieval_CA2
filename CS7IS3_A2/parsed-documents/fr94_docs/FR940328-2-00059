FR940328-2-00059 FR940328-2-00038 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Supplemental Awards to Current Community Partnership Demonstration Program Grantees AGENCY: Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), HHS. ACTION: Availability of Supplemental Funds for Currently Funded Grantees in the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention's (CSAP) Community Partnership Demonstration Grant Program. SUMMARY: This notice informs the public that CSAP is making available approximately $600,000 in Fiscal Year 1994 for approximately 12 supplemental awards to existing grantees in its Community Partnership Program (CPP). The supplemental funding is intended to permit currently-funded CPP grantees to build an ongoing communication-centered activity on their existing infrastructure to further the accomplishment of their project's alcohol, tobacco, and other drug prevention goals. Only currently funded CPP grantees are eligible to apply for supplemental funding. Eligibility is restricted because the limited funds available can be used most effectively to demonstrate communications-centered approaches by creating optimal conditions for success in the existing partnerships, where the necessary infrastructure and organizational capacity to develop such approaches are already in place. The existing Community Partnerships have exhibited interest in and the need for communications components to supplement their existing array of strategies, and many have participated in relevant training offered by CSAP and other organizations. This restriction thus will allow more thorough demonstrations of the effects of communication-centered approaches by linking them to existing partnerships, their needs assessments and evaluation measures, rather than starting such projects from the beginning. To apply for a supplemental award, a CPP grantee must have a minimum of one full project year remaining in the current grant as of September 30, 1994. Awards will be limited to one year and can not exceed a total of $50,000 in direct and indirect costs. The receipt date for applications is April 29, 1994. The application receipt and review and the award process will be handled in an expedited manner. Applications will be reviewed for merit by a panel of expert Federal and non-Federal reviewers, and supplements will be awarded on the basis of merit and availability of funds no later than September 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. David Robbins at (301) 443&hyph;9438 (Community Prevention and Demonstration Branch, Division of Community Prevention and Training) or Ms. Joan White Quinlan at (301) 443&hyph;9936 (Public Education Branch, Division of Public Education and Dissemination), CSAP, Rockwall II, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.
