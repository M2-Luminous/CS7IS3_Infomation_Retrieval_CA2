This commitment was made to the provincial Communist Party of Cuba leadership during an assessment of the results of the last 10 days of the harvest. The province has already surpassed the production level attained in the last harvest and is gearing up to complete the remaining sugar production. This goal implies establishing a link between the cane waiting to be processed and the mills with higher production capacities. This vital final period is getting the support of the manual and combine workers from mills that have completed operations. Only the Rafael Reyes, Salvador Rosales, and America Libre Mills have met their sugar production goals to date. Recognizing their success, Politburo members Jose Ramon Machado Ventura and Esteban Lazo instructed the management of those mills to present labor feat banners to their respective workers. Machado Ventura stated that together with the efforts that the current harvest demands, it is necessary to guarantee, by every means, the sugarcane spring planting campaign. This makes it necessary for Santiago de Cuba to increase the daily pace to keep up with the program. Esteban Lazo stated this is why we need to take advantage of the days remaining in June to get ahead without neglecting crop tending tasks.
