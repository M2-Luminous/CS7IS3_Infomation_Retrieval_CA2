Caucasus Debate PM2903144194 Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI in Russian 29 Mar 94 p 2 PM2903144194 Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Language: Russian Article Type:BFN [Report by Sergey Karkhanin: "Federation Council Urges Peace on Ossetians and Ingushetians"] [Text] The Federation Council will continue to examine the situation obtaining in the state of emergency zone in North Ossetia and Ingushetia. This was reported by Vladimir Shumeyko, the chamber's chairman. According to him, "the question of the conflict between the Republics of North Ossetia and Ingushetia is very acute in nature and violates that supreme human right -- the right to life." Deputies instructed the Federation Council chairman to set up a special commission under the leadership of Ramazan Abdulatipov for further study and consideration of this issue. After this has been done, the commission is to submit its own proposals to the president. Deputies intend to hold an enlarged session of the Security Council with the special commission's participation in order to make a final decision at the chamber's next session. Vladimir Shumeyko stressed that many decisions had been made before but none of them had been carried out. Therefore, he stressed, it is "essential that all three branches of power -- the Federation Council, the president, and the government -- discuss this question and make a common decision." The deputies present at the closed session adopted an appeal to the peoples of Ingushetia and North Ossetia. The document stresses the need for them to "lay down their arms and solve the problems built up over many years by peaceful means." Thus, three days of debate in the upper chamber of parliament on how to settle the conflict have essentially failed to yield a constructive result. It has become clear to the participants in the session of the upper chamber of parliament that to think that the explosive situation in the North Caucasus will stabilize of its own accord would be like trying to fall asleep on a powder keg.
