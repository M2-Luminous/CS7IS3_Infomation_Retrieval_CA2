By doing so, he expressed his disagreement with the procedure for appointing Nikolay Yegorov, the new minister for affairs of nationalities. We would like to recall that there were no consultations with Shakhray, although he as the vice premier was in charge of national issues. However, Moscow's political circles have a different explanation on the reasons for the resignation. Of late Shakhray's department was overseeing Russia's northern regions, for whose support credits amounting to several trillion rubles were allocated. Observers believe that the true reasons for the resignation are disagreements in the Russian leadership on who will be sharing out these credits, and how this will be done.
