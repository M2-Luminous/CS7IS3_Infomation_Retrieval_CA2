FR940304-1-00035 FR940304-1-00008 (d) Consistent use required. The operator must use the selected method and the price of product consistently (see §146.92(g)) of this subpart). §146.94 Records concerning establishment of manufacturing period. (a) Feedstock charged into a refinery operating unit. The operator must record the date and amount of each feedstock charged into a refinery operating unit during each manufacturing period. (b) Final product consumed in or removed from subzone. The operator must record the date and amount of each final product consumed in, or removed from the subzone. (c) Consumption or removal. The consumption or removal of a final product during a week may be considered to have occurred on the last day of that week for purposes of attribution and relative value calculation instead of the actual day on which the removal or consumption occurred, unless the refiner elects to attribute using the FIFO method (see Example II to Appendix to this subpart). (d) Gain or loss. A gain or loss that occurs during a manufacturing period must be taken into account in determining the attribution of a final product to a feedstock and the relative value calculation of privileged foreign feedstocks. Any gain in a final product attributed to a nonprivileged foreign status feedstock is dutiable if entered for consumption unless otherwise exempt from duty. (e) Determining gain or loss; acceptable methods. (1) Converting volume to weight. Volume measurements may be converted to weight measurements using American Petroleum Institute conversion factors to account for gain or loss. (2) Calculating feedstock factor to account for volume gain. A feedstock factor may be calculated by dividing the value per barrel of production per product category by the quotient of the total value of production divided by all feedstock consumed. This factor would be applied to a finished product that has been attributed to a feedstock to account for volume gain. (3) Calculating volume difference. Volume difference may be determined by comparing the amount of feedstocks introduced for a given period with the amount of final products produced during the period, and then assigning the volume change to each final product proportionately. §146.95 Producibility. (a) Industry standards of potential production. The industry standards of potential production on a practical operating basis necessary for the producibility attribution method are contained in tables published in T.D. 66&hyph;16. With these tables, a subzone operator may attribute final products consumed in, or removed from, the subzone to feedstocks during the current or a prior manufacturing period. (b) Attribution to product or feedstock not listed in T.D. 66&hyph;16. For purposes of attribution, where a final product or a feedstock is not listed in T.D. 66&hyph;16, the operator must submit a proposed attribution schedule, supported by a technical memorandum, to the appropriate district director. If an operator elects to show attribution on a producibility basis, but fails to keep records on that basis, Customs shall use the operator's actual operating records to determine attribution and any necessary relative value calculation. §146.96 Methods of attribution. (a) Producibility. (1) General. A subzone operator must attribute the source of each final product. The operator is limited in this regard to feedstocks introduced into a refinery operating unit during the current or a prior period. Attribution of the final products is allowable to the extent that the quantity of such products could have been produced from such feedstocks, using the industry standards of potential production on a practical operating basis, as published in T.D. 66&hyph;16. Once attribution is made for a particular product, that attribution is binding. Subsequent attributions of feedstock to product must take prior attributions into account. Each refiner shall keep records showing each attribution. (2) Attribution to privileged foreign feedstock; relative value. If a final product is attributed to the separation of a privileged foreign feedstock, their relative values must be assigned. Example. An operator who elects to attribute on a monthly basis files the following estimated removal of final products for the first week in September: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ Jet Fuel (deemed exported on international flights) 20,000 Gasoline: Domestic Consumption 15,000 Duty-free certified as emergency war material 10,000 Petroleum coke exportations 10,000 Distillate for consumption 5,000 Petrochemicals exported 10,000 n,s Total removals 70,000 Because it does not elect to make attributions for feedstocks that were charged to operating units during the same week, the operator attributes the estimated removals to final products made during August from the following feedstocks: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ Class II PF (privileged foreign) crude 20,000 Class III PF crude 35,000 Class III D (domestic) crude 20,000 Class III NPF (nonprivileged foreign) crude 20,000 n,s ␣ 95,000 During August the operator produced from those feedstocks: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ Jet 35,000 Gasoline 40,000 Petroleum Coke 10,000 Distillate 5,000 Petrochemicals 15,000 n,s ␣ 105,000 There is a gain: 105,000^95,000=10,000 Using the tables in T.D. 66&hyph;16, the following choices are available for attribution: ␣ 1␣ 1Charged 1Jet 1Gasoline 1Petroleum 2Coke 2Distillate 1Petro-chemical Class II PF Crude 20,000 13,000 17,200 4,400 17,200 5,000 Class III PF Crude 35,000 24,500 31,850 14,000 31,150 10,150 Class III D Crude 20,000 14,000 18,200 8,000 17,800 5,800 Class III NPF Crude 20,000 14,000 18,200 8,000 17,800 5,800 Relative value factors are calculated: ␣ 1␣ 1Barrels 1Value/barrels 1Value 1Feedstock factors Gasoline 40,000 $25 $1,000,000 .9117 Jet Fuel 35,000 23 805,000 .8388 Distillate 5,000 20 100,000 .7294 Petroleum Coke 10,000 10 100,000 .3647 Petrochemicals 15,000 40 600,000 1.4587 n,s,n,s,n ␣ 105,000 2,605,000 Gain ^10,000 2,605,000 n,s,s,n Total 95,000 195,000 1Equals $27.42 average value p/bbl.
