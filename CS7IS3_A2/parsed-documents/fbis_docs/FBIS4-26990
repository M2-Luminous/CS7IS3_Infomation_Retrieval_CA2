In the maelstrom, one of China's best-known modern poets, who was working secretly for the publication, has been forced to flee to a remote part of the country. Street Magazine, a monthly which began in Shenzhen in March, has been under pressure from city officials to reduce coverage of controversial issues such as discontent over urban renewal and the weakening ideological role of street committees in China. The Civil Affairs Ministry has praised the magazine's "serious style and high tone" and the Communist Party's mouthpiece, People's Daily, voiced its approval of the publication in mid-May. But complaints from provincial officials have flooded in. The chief editor, Xu Hao had encouraged the magazine's more than 100 contributors to "find out things first hand" and often despatched staff reporters and photographers to cities throughout the country. At a Shenzhen propaganda work meeting at the end of May, a deputy party secretary, Lin Zuji, called for a shake-up at the magazine, even though Beijing had not called for such a move. Xu Hao was sacked two weeks ago. Also purged was one of China's best-known underground poets, Meng Lang, who had worked for the magazine since the outset. Meng, 32, fled from his native Shanghai in February after local police harassed him over his involvement in a U.S.-funded literary journal. In early May, Shenzhen authorities sent to investigate the magazine discovered Meng's presence and reported it to Shanghai police. "He was warned that he was not welcome in Shenzhen, so he fled to Sichuan Province," a source said. Meng's sudden disappearance raised alarm in China's dissident circles, where many feared he had been arrested. The former factory engineer was jailed for six weeks in Shanghai in 1992 for his involvement in the banned quarterly Modern Chinese Poetry. Recent moves suggest the Street Magazine mess could be sorted out soon. Senior party cadres in Beijing have now come to the aid of Xu, a respected propagandist who formerly ran the Shaanxi provincial party committee's theoretical journal. Guangdong's civil affairs department, apparently on orders from Beijing, last week reprimanded Chen Yushan, head of the propaganda department of Shenzhen's Nanshan District where the magazine offices are situated, since he carried out the sacking. His plan to replace Xu with a deputy editor from Nanshan district's daily newspaper is now on hold. Shenzhen's chief of propaganda, Shao Hanqing, was also asked to explain her behaviour. "The matter is now being discussed between Shenzhen and the central and provincial civil affairs authorities," one local source said. "The civil affairs ministry sees no problems with the magazine, so the hardline ideologues in provincial and local governments have no grounds for tightening control over it."
