FBIS4-17932 "drsov083_u_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-083 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 Latvia U.S. Group on Russian Officer Housing Program U.S. Group on Russian Officer Housing Program WS2804184494 Tallinn BNS in English 1627 GMT 28 Apr 94 WS2804184494 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Riga, Apr 28, BNS -- The United States has allotted 160 million dollars to build homes for Russian officers repatriating from the Baltic states and Eastern Europe, said representatives of the U.S. State Department and the U.S. International Development Agency [USAID]. The group toured Riga this week to acquaint Latvians with the implementation of two housing programs for Russian military. The first experimental apartments will be ready next week in the Novgorod and Pskov regions of Russia, said George Deikun, a spokesman for the USAID. All 350 flats in this program will be completed in the near months, he noted. To accommodate 450 officers, 100 vouchers will be issued to enable the officers to acquire apartments in Russia in 90 days. From the 450 apartments, 80 percent are designed for those withdrawing from the Baltic region. The second project foresees to build 4,000 apartments and distribute 1,000 vouchers. The general contractor for the implementation of this project will be found until July. Under a U.S.-Russian agreement, the construction is carried out by American or Russian privately-run firms, or U.S.-Russian joint ventures, said Deikun. Unfortunately, Deikun said, the homes are and will be built in compliance with Russian and not with American standards. The apartments, however, will become private property of the officers. The U.S. delegation also met Wednesday [27 April] with representatives of Russian Northwestern Army Group command to discuss the implementation of the projects. The officers basically want to return to their native districts or places where it is easy to find jobs. USAID drafts the list of officers who need accommodation together with the Russian Interministerial Housing Committee, Russian local governments and army command. U.S. Ambassador to Latvia Ints Silins reconfirmed the intention of the United States to donate 2 million dollars to help Latvia dismantle the new block of the Skrunda radar facility. BNS asked Silins whether the United States will participate in the financing of the Russian military retirees' repatriation foundation, which will also deal with the rehabilitation of the Skrunda environment. Silins answered he lacked information about the goals of the foundation and, consequently, abstained from comments.
