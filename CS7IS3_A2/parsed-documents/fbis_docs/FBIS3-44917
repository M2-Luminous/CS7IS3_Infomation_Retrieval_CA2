The local branch of the bank, starting the service on December 28, 1993, anchored a total transaction of 500,000 U.S. dollars through new year's eve. Resuming on January 4, the trading is running smoothly. For each transaction, 300 U.S. dollars or an equal amount of other foreign currencies is required. The trading hall is well- equipped with a computerized quotation, trading and clearing system, flashing the latest exchange rates. Through free trading, clients can make money not only from interest differentials, but also from exchange fluctuations. Now Shanghainese have found a way to apply foreign exchange in hand, besides depositing the money in the bank. Foreign exchange deposits made by Shanghai citizens are on the rise. Figures show that the city had more than one million depositors by last February, with foreign exchange totalling 1.3 billion U.S. dollars. Major sources of the money are Shanghai citizens residing overseas and businessmen and students based abroad.
