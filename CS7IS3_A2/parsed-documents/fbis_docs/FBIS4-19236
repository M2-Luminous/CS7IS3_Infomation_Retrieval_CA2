This has been agreed upon by the leading politicians of the two parties in a talk, which lasted more than five hours and was held in the chancellor's office on Tuesday evening [12 April]. CDU Secretary General Hintze said that the CDU/CSU is on the verge of "rising to its greatest election campaign strength and bringing about a change in the mood." The party leadership, which met under the chairmanship of their heads Kohl and Waigel, established a working group. It is to work out a government and working program for 1994-98 and present it before the summer recess. In addition, an election campaign committee was formed to coordinate that European and Bundestag election of the CDU and CSU. Hintze said that in the election campaign of the CDU and CSU, the conflict about safeguarding jobs by strengthening the upswing is the top priority. In addition, the CDU/CSU works for Germany's internal unification and the further development of the equalization of burdens on families toward an equalization of benefits for families with children. Hintze and [CSU Secretary General] Huber were not able to say what this should be like. In addition, the CDU/CSU wants to work for a more efficient combating of crime and a further increase in housing construction. The record of 500,000 new apartments should be exceeded in the next few years. In addition, the CDU/CSU wants to stress the value of a stable currency and promise a tax reduction in the long run. The main opponent of the CDU/CSU is the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. Scharping will be presented as a "political shirker" who tries to cover up the real intentions of the SPD. CSU Secretary General Huber stressed the will of the Bavarian sister party to get as close as possible to the CDU. This time there will not be an election campaign against Bonn, he added. The tenor of the election campaign will be the statement: "There is no alternative to Kohl, the experienced chancellor." Despite the well-known results of opinion polls, his party considers the outcome of the elections to be "open." It will try to win the elections by winning over the largest possible part of the so far undecided people eligible to vote, which oscillates between 25 and 40 percent. In addition to the person of the chancellor, one intends to stress the reliability of the financial policy characterized by Theo Waigel and contribute to the polarization by campaign Waigel and Lafontaine, who is envisaged by the SPD as finance minister. The CDU and CSU also want to gain profile as "parties of property" and point to the disastrous consequences of the SPD's proposal to tax real estate property on the basis of the market value instead of the basic value. One intends to act tough against the Republikaner and the German People's Union and tell the people that "decent Germans" cannot vote for these parties. The Greens are a security risk because of their intention to dissolve the Bundeswehr and to leave NATO -- and this is how they will be presented.
