The river water must become clean again by the end of this century so that the river can again benefit local people living along its banks, he said today at a meeting to check on the environmental protection of the Huaihe River Valley. Local enterprises that run at low economic efficiency and cause serious pollution but lack efficient measures to curb pollution must be closed or switch to other products with less pollution, he said. Those enterprises that bring heavy pollution but are able to harness pollution must do it within a limited period. In addition, urban sewage treatment facilities must be built in a group of cities, the state councillor said. The Huaihe River Water Resources Protection Organization, formed by departments of the four provinces concerned and departments of the State Council, should be further improved and a supervising network on the pollution of the Huaihe River be established. The third largest river in China, the Huaihe River runs across four provinces -- Henan, Anhui, Shandong and Jiangsu -- its drainage area covering 269,000 sq km, with population topping 150 million. Since the beginning of the 1980s, the main tributaries of the river and the river proper became increasingly contaminated owing to a fast-growing local economy and urbanization. Song, also minister in charge of the State Science and Technology Commission, inspected many parts along the river to investigate the state of pollution. He also visited local farmers' families that have suffered from the pollution. He urged local officials to cooperate with each other in taking comprehensive measures to ease the pollution so that a better environmental condition can be created for the valley in the 21st century.
