A Thai official said to local media Monday [7 March] that the foreign ministers' conference would be held on July 23-24, which would be followed by the first session of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) on July 25. The annual post-ministerial conference with seven dialog partners -- The United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan and the European Union -- is set on July 26-27. The six-ASEAN member states are also inviting five other countries -- China, Russia, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea -- to attend the ARF. Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pracha Gunakasame was quoted by the local media as saying that Monday's meeting endorsed a related idea -- the proposed establishment of a regional peace-keeping center. But it remains to be decided whether the center should function as a nucleus for training regional peacekeepers or one for exchanging information. Monday's gathering also discussed outstanding problems in the South China Sea, on the Korean peninsula, and prospects of setting up a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality (ZOPFAN). The meeting which began on Monday will end Wednesday.
