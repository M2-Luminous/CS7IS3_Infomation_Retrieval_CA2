It Clarifies Why the USSR Economy Collapsed"] [Text] It is expected that today the State Duma will conduct parliamentary hearings devoted to programs of economic reform and anticrisis measures. The impact caused by the parliamentary elections on the moods of the political leaders of Russia was extremely significant. In this connection one can expect that the results of the hearings will be taken into account by the government when it determines the plan for further measures. SEGODNYA offers its readers an interview with the leader of the Russia's Choice faction in the State Duma, Yegor Gaydar, who previously defended the government program from attack by the Supreme Soviet and is now criticizing developments for changing this program proposed to the government by a group of Russian academicians. [Bekker] Anatoliy Chubays called the proposals from academicians Shatalin, Abalkin, and Petrakov for changing the course of the reforms "economically absurd." Do you too consider them to be unworthy of professional attention? [Gaydar] No, it is a very interesting document. It makes it possible to guess the riddle of the 20th century--why did the generally inert economy of the Soviet Union collapse so quickly? Of course, by 1985 it was severely ill. But in order to completely destroy the consumer market and financial system in six years and by the end of 1991 to leave the country without currency reserves or grain supplies--one had to try very hard to accomplish this. [Bekker] And you mean to say that this striking result was achieved by a set of measures similar to the ones proposed in the report by the scholars? [Gaydar] Yes. Take such a proposal as state regulation of prices of the most important raw material commodities. They do not reveal precisely which ones, but apparently they are the products of the fuel and energy complex and, possibly, nonferrous and ferrous metals and products of chemistry. The regulation would be introduced against a background of large-scale financial infusions, working capital of enterprises and the savings of the population would be indexed, and capital investments, expenditures on conversion and the social sphere, and critical imports would increase. The consequences are obvious: the sharpest disproportions would arise between regulated and free prices. As a result, after a short period of time even with the present rates of inflation, oil, gas, and practically all goods on which prices are frozen would begin to be produced at a loss. There would be a need for a large financial influx to cover the needs of these branches. Otherwise there will simply be nothing with which to pay wages and nothing with which to buy electric energy and spare parts. [Bekker] But the report suggests establishing a certain rational relationship among parts for branch goods. [Gaydar] In the first place, who knows what this ratio is? In the second place, it is not simple to do that. In two months inflation could bring products, say, from machine building to a new price level, and in order not to shut down the fuel and energy complex the government would have to scrape together funds from the budget. But the disparity in prices would get ever deeper and ever more subsidies would be required, the budget deficit would start to grow and unfixed prices would rise ever more rapidly. Further--there would be two other consequences. If the demand for metal were greater than the supply of metal at suppressed prices, a waiting line would form for it and the seller would determine whether to provide it or not based on who satisfies certain of his additional needs, say, through barter. And the second thing: there would arise a need to control this distribution. And then there would appear the boss who decides who gets what limits and funds and assignments. A sector of deficit distribution would develop in the economy. [Bekker] And inevitably it would be necessary to restore the Gossnab [State Committee for Material and Technical Supply] in order to divide up the deficit and the Gosplan [State Planning Committee] in order to determine the national economic proportions and calculate interbranch balances. [Gaydar] Well, naturally. The report masks this with a euphemism--"the state will undertake to play the game." But what will the "player" do when he finds out that first metal has ceased to be very profitable and then it is produced at a loss, and then there is nowhere to get the money to pay the wages of the metallurgists, and then strikes begin at the combines. Of course, under pressure the government will give in and raise prices. But not by 15 percent, as is now happening in the market, but three- to four-fold, since by that time the other prices will be rising sharply. As a result, throughout the entire economy a powerful pro-inflation impulse will be set in motion. That is, instead of making it possible for the enterprises, hard as it may be for them, to adapt each day to the changes in the proportions, you will reorganize them once every four months and beat them over the head with a club. And then see how they react to that. [Bekker] After all, just in July the government finally released prices for petroleum and stopped regulating grain prices. [Gaydar] Indeed, the minute they have achieved something they are immediately ready to drive up the high cost waves, reproducing price distortions and an immense load on the budget. The esteemed academicians say that this is being done in order to bring the prices in the branches up to normative ratios. In principle it is possible to achieve this by two methods. First--slightly influence supply and demand; introduce export and import tariffs and stimulate the importing or exporting of goods. The second is to assign prices. To say that they will be this or that. [Bekker] Is that what the State Committee on Prices has been doing? [Gaydar] Yes. This system would have to be made all-encompassing. Because if you regulate prices for knitted goods, you automatically have to control the price of cotton. And then there arises the problem of equal advantage in producing products which was well known in Soviet times. This problem practically does not exist now: products are sold at the prices at which they are sold. In the academicians' version we are given a deficit and an escape from producing disadvantageous products. If you know that it is impossible to buy many batching items and spare parts at any price, you will have to construct, without any of these absurdities, an integrated price regulation system. [Bekker] Plus the system for regulating incomes and wages through the State Committee on Labor and Social Problems. [Gaydar] Sure. And for orders on prices and wages to be carried out they must be backed up by strict sanctions and legislative rights for state organs. For instance, if someone refuses to produce the necessary kind of fitting the authorities must have the possibility of firing the leader or giving a reprimand. But here is the problem: all of this somehow cannot exist in a private economy. In order for there to be no cracks in the system, it is necessary, as was said in the report, to abandon the populist voucher privatization and begin the reverse process--nationalization. Then events will develop in the standard way on the consumer market. As soon as the monetary assets of the population grow as a result of indexation and prices, according to the advice of the academicians, are fixed, the government itself will be very bewildered when it discovers that again nothing can be bought for the money. And that again it is necessary to go from Tula to Moscow, stand in lines, introduce ration cards, divide up the supplies of meat products, go to the capital to try to scare some up, have good relations with the salesmen, and have a foot in the back door. In brief, all the charms about which we have forgotten somewhat will come creeping back, although in terms of time they are not far behind us. In our history there existed a great organ--the Commission on Distribution of Material Resources. It died quietly and unnoticed in 1922 with the liberalization of the economy and the introduction of a relatively stable currency. And very quickly it turned up restored in expanded form as soon as a set of measures painfully similar to the ones proposed in January 1994 were implemented. [Bekker] You have not yet touched on an important element of the academicians' concept: they assert that administrative regulation will halt the decline of production and make it possible to saturate the commodity market. [Gaydar] The scale of financial disproportions that will follow such a measure will be incomparable to the current fluctuations and production volumes. As a result of such a decision the demand will automatically increase not by 2 percent or even by 10 percent but several-fold. Because this is a monetary phenomenon. According to this scenario, stabilization or at least retardation of the rates of decline of production would be possible only under the condition that the authorities fully and effectively restore the previous system of management. But I am convinced that now it would take years of deep crisis in order to arrange a normally functioning Gosplan, Gossnab, and 50 branches of ministries, to restore the old ties, to cast off privatization, and to again adapt to the discipline of fear. We are now living under the conditions of a very painful intersystem transformation whereby the old system has been broken down and a new one is just being built. And here, without hanging on, without being patient, in general, a year...experience shows that in a postcommunist economy financial stabilization comes in the third year of reform, and production begins to increase in the fourth. Instead of continuing things, they are now beginning to turn this machine back, that is, worsen the condition of systemless chaos. How and from what will production all of a sudden begin to grow in this situation--this is absolutely incomprehensible. [Bekker] But yet in certain periods of 1992 and 1993, when the government and the Central Bank had increased monetary emissions and unleased the nonpayment crisis, production was clearly invigorated. [Gaydar] That was a very short-term and transitory result which was swept away with the next wave of disproportions. No, of course, if in three years you restore strict total control of the state, if you bring back fully the administrative-command system of management and force the population to tighten their belts, in time production volume could stabilize and the preconditions for a certain growth could even appear. But there is no reason to think that anybody will be happy because of this. Because the volume of economic activity never signifies its effectiveness. This is simply the quantity of shovelled resources: the volume of ditches you dig, the number of tanks you rivet. After this you will completely deprive the economy of the set of microregulators that were vitally necessary and because of which, actually, the old system of administration collapsed. Innovations? Why are they innovations? Economic utilization of resources--from what item? Having poured capital, labor, and resources out of ineffective branches--nothing of the kind. The maximum you can do with a great deal of labor is preserve the archaic economic structure, which will drag the country into the web of backwardness. [Bekker] Boris Yeltsin, having the academicians' work in mind, said that "such advice had already been given." But Messrs. Petrakov and Abalkin were not working on a public basis but on instructions from First Deputy Prime Minister Soskovets. To what extent, in your view, is Viktor Chernomyrdin prepared to listen to the president's assessment today? [Gaydar] I do not think that Viktor Stepanovich will decide to implement the complex of recommendations contained in this report. Moreover, all the proposals are in the intermediate phase. If the academicians were to write down what we have just discussed, that is, the set of consequences and the set of institutions that would have to be formed immediately in this connection--beginning with deprivatization of the economy and ending with the restoration of direct specific administration of all flows of resources--that would be some kind of integrated and comprehensible program. Well, say, the program of counterreforms. But in the present form it is simply a program for restoring the chaos of 1990-1991. It is doubtful that the prime minister would even dream of this. [Bekker] You probably know his program plans. [Gaydar] No, but I do know that Viktor Stepanovich has not lost his mind. The academicians' concept contains certain shortcomings that are obvious and, in my opinion, apparent even to the non-specialist. Let me put it this way: I would be surprised if the government would have the courage to consistently implement what is presented there. It is presented, incidentally, in an extremely contradictory way. In one place the government is reproached for its extremely strict financial policy, for the fact that it has used purely monetary means of holding down inflation through limiting demand. But two paragraphs above it says: "The government has widely used emission as a kind of narcotic for emboldening production." The strictest financial policy which proceeds against a background of wide use of emission--that is brilliant. Or: "In two years they still have not managed to normalize the budget system in spite of enlisting immense amounts of credit from the Central Bank to cover the budget deficit." Apparently the esteemed authors sincerely think that attracting this credit is a means of stabilizing the budget systems. [Bekker] The academicians' attack against voucher privatization as populist and pro-inflation does not seem altogether clear either. According to the State Program, voucher privatization will end by 1 July and investment trade for money and control of publicly financed enterprises will begin. [Gaydar] Quite right. I especially want to discuss the supposedly pro-inflation essence of voucher privatization. Even if one proceeds from the assumption that the checks are an ersatz means of payment, check privatization is now playing a marked stabilizing role since the number of vouchers, which was maximal as of 1 January 1993, is decreasing rapidly. This means that the total amount of the monetary residuals is increasing considerably more slowly. One could argue about whether the emission of vouchers had a pro-inflation effect at the end of 1992. That, as it were, is an interesting question. But the fact that now if voucher privatization has any influence on inflation at all it is only in the direction of restraint is obvious to anyone who understands anything about the analysis of monetary reserves. So the academicians were at least a year and a half late with their criticism. [Bekker] And if the chambers of the Federal Assembly approve this program as a basis for compromise between the government and parliament? [Gaydar] Well, the punishment for experiments of this kind will be forced and apparent to society. [Bekker] But the academicians are calling your reforms violence against the economy, shock therapy. Moreover, your previous friend, when working with Stanislav Shatalin in the Central Economics and Mathematics Institute and then a like-thinker in the first post-communist government, Aleksandr Shokhin, said a couple of days ago that you had resigned in order to avoid responsibility for what you had done. [Gaydar] Yes, I heard that. You know, last year we had a paradoxical, almost unprecedented situation in which there was a strong, energetic prime minister who did not seem to bear responsibility for what was happening, which is borne by Gaydar who is in retirement. And his colleagues, who have also remained in the government, do not seem to have anything to do with this. I am not running away from responsibility. I think that was clear during 1991-1992. In the autumn of 1993 I came to the government at a time that was not the easiest for it. In my view, responsibility is inseparable from the possibility of implementing the policy that you consider right. As long as I was able to implement this policy, I considered it possible and necessary to bear responsibility for it and I did not shift it to anyone else. But, in my view, to take responsibility absolutely does not mean to be chained to the chair regardless of fluctuations in the course pursued by the government. It does not mean to be omnivorous and it does not mean to be prepared to swallow our pride and accommodate any twists in this policy as long as you can remain in the loop.
