For instance, a few days ago Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov issued a directive according to which "all rights with respect to managing Moscow property in enterprises' conversion to joint-stock holding and privatization" will be controlled by the capital city government. In keeping with the same document, the capital city government may take into trust management for a period of three years the shares of even those plants and factories that are federal property but until sold at auction are under the jurisdiction of the city property fund. An interesting detail: The Moscow Government is willing to sell these shares before due time only in the event it finds it "economically expedient." The latter category, as anybody will agree, can be interpreted so broadly that the issue of selling will not arise at all--especially considering that Luzhkov, for purely political considerations, is afraid of the consequence of mass bankruptcy of major capital city enterprises, and in order to avert such a painful process will attempt, in the opinion of some, to stall the selling of shares through actions. According to some reports, the head of the State Committee for Administration of State Property [GKI] reacted to the decision of the mayor--his old adversary--with extreme irritation. But an even greater headache for Anatoliy Chubays may be presented by the draft Law on Regulating Property in the Russian Federation, officially submitted for State Duma consideration by the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] faction. According to this draft, the overwhelming majority of already completed privatization acts in Russia may be invalidated as illegal. Moreover, in the event of a low economic efficiency of denationalized enterprises, and "in instances of persistent noncompliance by the new owner with the terms of the privatization agreement... the object is to be deprivatized." Keeping in mind that the production indicators of very many plants have declined after denationalization, their return to the state bosom (in the event this draft is approved) appears quite likely. Radical economists have already nicknamed the LDPR document the "Law on Deprivatization." It would be naive, of course, to assume that the Duma, torn by controversy, will unanimously pass this law. However, the idea per se--to put privatization in reverse in instances where its economic effectiveness turned out, as they say, to have a minus sign, is currently becoming increasingly popular. Meanwhile, in its blueprint of post-voucher privatization, Chubays' agency is planning the compulsory sale of the property of insolvent debtor enterprises at the demand of creditors. Only the labor collectives of privatized enterprises, which are vested with sufficient powers in keeping with the current legislation, can interfere in this process. Even here, however, there is a surprise ready to be sprung on us: Chubays insists on substantially cutting preferences to labor collectives and, from his standpoint, considers even this tough approach a compromise--in the first draft of the concept of post-voucher privatization the wording was "no longer grant any preferences." It is hard to judge at this point whose position will win this time. One thing is clear: The current battles between supporters and opponents of "privatization according to Chubays" may turn out to be insignificant compared to what may be coming in the future.
