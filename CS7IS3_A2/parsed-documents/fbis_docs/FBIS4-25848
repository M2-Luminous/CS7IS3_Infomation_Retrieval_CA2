Aimed to reduce conflicts between management and labor over wage hikes, the formula pegs the minimum wage to the CPI recorded in the previous year plus half the labor productivity growth rate. In 1993, the CPI went up 2.94 percent on a year-earlier level while labor productivity gained by 3.44 percent, according to tallies of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. The minimum wage therefore will be raised by 4.66 percent, the council said, which would make the minimum monthly wage NT$13,917 [new Taiwan dollars] (about U.S.$516). A council official stressed that the figure would need to be slightly adjusted to take into account employees who are paid on an hourly or daily basis. The wage hike will take effect on July 1. "The formula is simple and makes the accounting of wage hikes easy," Tung Tai-chi, the director of the council's labor conditions department, said, speaking of the new formula's merits. Generally speaking, Tung added, the minimum wage will only increase or stay steady in the future. "Even if the CPI and labor productivity decline, the minimum wage at most will be frozen," he said. Also on Tuesday, Premier Lien Chan approved in principle a proposed 3-percent wage hike for government employees, teachers and servicemen, also beginning on July 1. The proposal will cost the government an estimated NT$11.2 billion.
