The actual signing confirmed yet again that there was never any confrontation in Russia between reformers and antireformers, as was often suggested to the uninitiated. The struggle for power does not always mean the same thing as the struggle for reform. If we think about it, economic reform in the USSR and Russia in recent years came about more in spite of rather than thanks to the ruling groups. Specific economic interests have to be sought for everything, and real reforms always lead to a loss of administrative power for nomenklaturas of any stripe. The economic reforms in Russia today have run ahead of society's political maturity, which at a certain phase inevitably leads to equilibrium being restored through a serious crisis. It is no accident that the "Chinese experience" is so popular in certain circles -- everyone thinks of its economic side, when what they really mean is the political side. Meanwhile Russian statehood is under deadly threat from the crisis of central power, the destructive activity of a number of regional elites, and the criminalization of society. And the interests of our statehood are being sacrificed for the sake of the struggle for an increasingly ephemeral power. All this inevitably leads to the appearance of phenomena such as V. Zhirinovskiy. Another factor in instability is the damage being done to the democratic movement in Russia in the broad sense of the word. Every second person is a presidential contender, and the rest are geniuses. The evolution of political and economic views on the part of a number of leading democratic politicians is striking, and there is no limit to their personal ambition. Is there any real possibility of some kind of peace? In my view, we must agree with G. Yavlinskiy: If illegal or simply violent methods are used, then this is a matter for the law-enforcement organs. If these are legitimate measures in the political struggle, then no accords will help. Political opponents are hardly likely to give up the struggle for power. What are the prospects for economic reform in this context? To my mind, signing or failure to sign will not affect the reforms, since the treaty's provisions are vague in the extreme and are not aimed at accelerating reform. Equally, it is time we recognized that reforms are never carried out anywhere with the consent of all and sundry. That is a fairytale. Somebody has to take responsibility. This responsibility lies primarily with the executive and the president. Parliament, with its current factionalism and the executive's attitude toward it, is incapable of making the breakthrough. The loyalty shown by flexible ministers is rewarded by awarding them extraordinary vice premier titles; for signing the treaty some (like Travkin) have received ministerial portfolios, while others have obtained trillions under a "clarified" budget. Where is the reform in that? Nonetheless, I remain convinced that this time too it is worth voting for the budget along with the happy Agrarians and Communists, but without the Gaydar Democrats. But for a different and simpler reason. Yes, the budget is bad and absolutely unrealistic. Yes, the actual deficit will be nearer 50 percent of budget expenditure than 36 percent. But this budget is at least not the disaster which sectoral lobbyists were ready to organize at any minute. It would be hard to expect anything better from the current government. We will probably have a new wave of inflation in three months' time, but, I trust, it will not be an explosion. But the most important thing is that the government's hands are bound by legislative fetters and it will be very easy to verify its fulfillment of its obligations. Any expenditure decision over and above the budget will be illegal. The government itself, if it wants to retain its freedom of action, will find it advantageous to reject the budget. It will now be impossible for agrarian and other lobbyists to demand any further increase in appropriations. God willing, what has been submitted will be fulfilled. In a few months' time everything will be clear, and it will be possible to pass a verdict of confidence or no-confidence in the government.
