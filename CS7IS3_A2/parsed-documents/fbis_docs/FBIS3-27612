Party committees at all levels in the province should attach importance to and strengthen the party's united front work and, following the changes in the situation and tasks, continuously study the new conditions, put forward new demands, create new experiences, further consolidate and develop the broadest patriotic united front, and ensure the inexhaustible source of strength and the broad and solid mass foundation for reform, opening up, and economic construction. In his speech, Jiang Chunyun first emphasized the need to further enhance the understanding of the importance of the united front work in the new situation. He pointed out: The united front that our party established under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong was an important weapon for China to win victory in revolution and construction. In the new historical period, Comrade Deng Xiaoping led our party to again make new and significant contributions to consolidating and developing the united front and clearly defined it as an important component of the theory and practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Jiang Zemin put forward clear requirements on the united front work in the new situation and gave important instructions. We must profoundly understand the importance of the united front work in the new situation and continuously raise our awareness and have more initiative in making united front work successful. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Under the leadership of party committees at all levels, the united front work departments in the province have united the forces of all quarters and mobilized all positive factors to accomplish large amounts of fruitful work and achieve notable results in promoting Shandong's two civilizations over the past few years. The provincial party committee is satisfied with this. Jiang Chunyun emphasized: As China's reform, opening up, and economic construction are in a crucial period, the position of united front becomes more important, and its role greater. It is a great historical task for the entire party and the people of various nationalities throughout the country to establish an initial system of the socialist market economy by the end of this century. Based on the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee and the reality of Shandong, the recent sixth provincial party congress defined the three-step strategic objective of Shandong's economic and social development. To attain this grand objective, we should unite all the forces that can be united, mobilize all positive factors, and strive to liberate and develop productive forces; we should address in a timely manner and correctly handle the various social contradictions to ensure social and political stability; and we should fully develop democracy, extensively give heed to the voice of the masses, strengthen supervision, and make sure that party and government organs at all levels are clean and honest and reduce and avoid major mistakes in policy-making. All these are basic functions and tasks of the patriotic united front in the new period. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: To make a success of the united front work in the new period, we should persistently take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the guide, conscientiously study to master the guidelines of the important instructions on united front work given by General Secretary Jiang Zemin and other central leading comrades, resolutely implement the party's principles and policies on the united front work, and, proceeding from Shandong's specific conditions and the overall situation in reform, development, and stability, develop the advantages, give prominence to work priorities, perform work in a creative manner, and strive to open up a new situation in the united front work and win new achievements continuously. First, we should continue to improve and develop the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the CPC, which is China's basic political system and also the major characteristic and advantage of the political system. Continuous improvement and development of this system is a need in strengthening and improving party leadership, a need in developing democratic politics with Chinese characteristics, and also a need in realizing long periods of order and stability of the state. Active participation of democratic parties and personages outside the party from various circles involved in consultation, discussion, and democratic supervision of the various policy-making groups for reform, opening up, and the modernization drive can help make policy-making more democratic and scientific. We should conduct full consultation with democratic parties and personages outside the party from various circles on major issues and ensure consultation before making policy. This should become a system and be conscientiously implemented. Recommending personages outside the party to assume leading posts in governments and judicial organs is the important work for adhering to and improving the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under party leadership and the important content of China's endeavor to develop democratic politics. Party committees at all levels should further enhance understanding, have a stronger sense of urgency toward this work, and adopt effective measures to make sure that new and significant progress is achieved in the job arrangements for cadres outside the party in the near future. We should cooperate with the cadres outside the party who have assumed government leading posts and make sure that they are entrusted with duties, powers, and responsibilities so that they can truly play their due role. Second, united front work should be firmly focused on economic construction, the central task, and its advantages should be developed in order to improve service. The party's central task for the new period lies in economic construction, of which united front work should be geared. With the "three advantages" put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the criterion, we should emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, actively conduct exploration, adopt various measures, open up various channels, mobilize all positive factors, concentrate the will and forces of all nationalities, democratic parties, mass organizations, and personages from various circles on the grand cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as much as possible, and strive to transform the advantages of united front, such as a galaxy of talent, extensive contacts, and large social influence, into actual productive forces. United front work departments should fully perform their functions, embody their characteristics and advantages, and place their work emphasis on creating a united, stable, and harmonious social environment conducive to reform, opening up, and economic construction and on participating in and discussing the administration of government and state affairs focusing on economic construction, offering ideas, serving as advisers, and providing good service. Third, we should attach importance to the work for the representative personages outside the party. Party committees and united front work departments at all levels should consider it an important task. In particular, we should attach importance to and strengthen the work for nonparty intellectuals, representative personages of the nonpublic sectors of the economy, overseas targets of united front work, and representative figures from nationalities and religious circles. We should put the work of nonparty intellectuals in an important position. In connection with the work assigned them respectively, party and government leading comrades at all levels should make friends with the personages outside the party, define the scope and the targets, and strengthen contacts with them. Respect is the prerequisite for establishing friendship, treating others with sincerity is the channel for friendship, and mutual understanding is the bridge of friendship. We should respect, trust, and show concern for the friends outside the party. Fourth, we should attach greater importance to and strengthen nationality and religious work. Party and government departments at all levels should fully understand the importance of achieving success in nationalities work, regard it as a major task, and conscientiously carry it out. The education on Marxism and the party's nationalities policies should be intensified within and outside the party, and communist party members, Communist Youth League members, cadres, and ordinary people of various nationalities should be educated to conscientiously implement the party's nationalities policies. We should adopt measures, such as support of certain projects, support by counterpart departments, and preferential policies to actively and effectively accelerate the economic and cultural development of minority nationalities to promote the common prosperity of all our nationalities. We should attach importance to training cadres of minority nationalities to continuously improve their political quality, professional proficiency, and their ability to participate in and lead economic construction. Party and government organs should comprehensively and correctly implement the party's policy on freedom of religious belief, strengthen management of religious affairs according to law, actively guide religions to comply with socialist modernization, and lead religious believers to make contributions to social stability and economic development. In conclusion, Jiang Chunyun pointed out: The new conditions and new tasks have set new and still higher demands on united front work. To raise Shandong's united front work to a new level and open up a new situation, we should further strengthen and improve party leadership over united front work. Party committees at all levels should include united front work high in their agenda, discuss it several times a year, listen to reports, and study ways to resolve some major issues. Their chief leading comrades should take the lead in united front work, attend to it personally, and implement the party's united front work policies in an exemplary manner. Comrades in charge of united front work should conscientiously meet their responsibility and make earnest efforts to carry it out. United front work departments should fully perform their functions, serve as good advisers and assistants to party committees, and accomplish their specific work in an outstanding manner. We should conduct extensive and intensive propaganda and education on the theories and policies on united front work, increase the dynamics of the propaganda, and broaden the channels for it. Newspapers, radio, television, and other mass media should report and publicize the knowledge, work, and activities of united front, as well as the advanced deeds of the representative personages outside the party. Through propaganda and education, we should enhance people's understanding of united front work and strive to create a situation in which the entire party and society show concern for and attach importance to united front work. We should intensify investigation and study to learn about new conditions and resolve new problems. Firmly focusing on economic construction, the central task, we should make great efforts to study ways to guide specific work with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on united front and to make united front work meet the needs for establishing the socialist market economy system. We should conscientiously summarize the guiding experiences to counter the new conditions and new characteristics of united front work and offer valuable suggestions to guide and lead united front work to make new headway. United front work departments should attach importance to improving themselves and do a good job in division of work and cooperation. We should intensify the training and education of the cadres in charge of united front work, arm their minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and strive to upgrade their theoretical, political, and professional quality.
