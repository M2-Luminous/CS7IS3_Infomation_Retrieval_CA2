FR940816-1-00018 FR940816-1-00007 The EPA plans to make perfunctory modifications to section 2.4 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix K. In addition, guidance on the interpretation of air quality data believed to be influenced by special events and conditions will be addressed in a separate publication that will replace the 1986 Exceptional Events Guideline. III. International Border Areas A. Statutory Requirement Section 818 of the 1990 Amendments added a new section, 179B, to subpart 1, part D of title I. Section 179B applies to areas that could attain the relevant NAAQS by the statutory attainment date but for emissions emanating from outside the United States (U.S.). For PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas, section 179B(a) provides that EPA must approve the moderate area SIP if (1) the SIP meets all the applicable requirements under the Act other than a requirement that such plan or revision demonstrate attainment and maintenance of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable attainment date, and (2) the State demonstrates to EPA's satisfaction that the SIP would be adequate to attain and maintain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the attainment date but for emissions emanating from outside the U.S. In addition, section 179B(d) provides that if a State demonstrates that an area would have timely attained the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS but for emissions emanating from outside the U.S., the area must not be subject to the reclassification provisions of section 188(b)(2). Section 188(b)(2) provides that any moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area that EPA determines is not in attainment after the applicable attainment date shall be reclassified to serious by operation of law. Therefore, the statute provides that areas that could attain but for emissions emanating from outside the U.S. must not be reclassified as serious after failing to attain by the applicable date. 7 7 As noted, section 179B(d) states that areas demonstrating attainment of the standards, but for emissions emanating from outside the U.S., shall not be subject to section 188(b)(2) (reclassification for failure to attain). By analogy to this provision and applying canons of statutory construction, EPA will not reclassify before the applicable attainment date areas which can demonstrate attainment of the standards, but for emissions emanating from outside the U.S. (see section 188(b)(1)). First, section 179B evinces a general congressional intent not to penalize areas where emissions emanating from outside the country are the but-for cause of the PM&hyph;10 nonattainment problems. Further, if EPA were to reclassify such areas before the applicable attainment date, EPA, in effect, would be reading section 179B(d) out of the statute. Specifically, if EPA proceeded to reclassify, before the applicable attainment date, those areas qualifying for treatment under section 179B, an area would never be subject to the provision in section 179B(d) which prohibits EPA from reclassifying such areas after the applicable attainment date. Canons of statutory construction counsel against interpreting the law such that language is rendered mere surplusage. Finally, note that section 179B(d) contains a clearly erroneous reference to carbon monoxide instead of PM&hyph;10, and that this section contains other clear errors (see, e.g., section 179B(c) reference to section 186(b)(9), which does not exist). B. Policy Assuming that a plan or revision meets all applicable requirements, the State must show that an area is eligible to have its SIP approved and not be reclassified as serious under section 179B by evaluating the impact of emissions emanating from outside the U.S. and demonstrating that the SIP would bring about attainment but for those emissions. Several types of information may be used to evaluate the impact of emissions emanating from outside the U.S. The EPA will consider the information presented by the State for individual nonattainment areas on a case-by-case basis in determining whether an area may qualify for treatment under section 179B. Five examples of such information are listed below in increasing order of sophistication (the State may use one or more of these types of information or other techniques, depending on their feasibility and applicability, to evaluate the impact of emissions emanating from outside the U.S. on the nonattainment area; the first three examples do not require the State to obtain information from a foreign country): 1. Place several ambient PM&hyph;10 monitors and a meteorological station, measuring wind speed and direction, in the U.S. nonattainment area near the international border. 8 Evaluate and quantify any changes in monitored PM&hyph;10 concentrations with a change in the predominant wind direction. 8 See 40 CFR part 58 for guidance on locating PM&hyph;10 monitors and ``On-site Meteorological Program Guidance for Regulatory Modeling Applications,'' EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;87&hyph;013, June 1987 for guidance on locating meteorological stations.
