When the British Foreign Office summoned the charge d'affaires of the Islamic Republic of Iran in London last week and informed him of its decision, it did not divulge the name of the expelled diplomat and the reason for this action. Yesterday, it announced the name of the Iranian first secretary Bilurchi and claimed that he had circulated false documents regarding the anti-Muslim policy followed by the British forces deployed in that region. The following points may be noted in this regard: 1. The British policy with regard to the Bosnian Muslims requires no affirmation by means of forged documents as the anti- Muslim policy of the British authorities regarding the oppressed Bosnian Muslims is known to all. The actions and allegations of the British political and military officials are so numerous that their publication would require reams and reams of paper. RESALAT has repeatedly written that if justice were to prevail in the world, British and military representatives such as David Owen should be impeached on charges of complicity in the massacre of the Bosnian Muslims. The British Government has played the primary role in preventing the Muslims from gaining access to arms for their defense to save themselves from the Serbs' aggression and by the induction of Russia in the political talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina, it paved the way for further pressure on the Muslims. 2. The actual point that the British Government wishes to conceal by these miscellaneous charges against Iran is the same issue of its espionage. The British security officials planted a plethora of listening devices in the building of the Iranian Embassy in London so that the building cannot be used for normal purposes and has to be entirely reconstructed. Such an act has completely destroyed the already tarnished position of London. 3. Britain's weak point lies not in a diplomatic war but in economic pressure. Why should we have such firm economic relations with a government that is completely unreliable from the political point of view? What is the reason for the centers for extensive purchases for Iran's industrial ministries in London, especially the office for its oil sales? In addition to minimizing economic relations, some thought should be given to the transfer of these purchase centers to other countries.
