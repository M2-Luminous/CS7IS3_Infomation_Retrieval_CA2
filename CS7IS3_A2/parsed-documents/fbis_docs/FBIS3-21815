A few hours ago you said that the way this process has been handled could lead to impunity. Do you feel the same way after today's surrender? Arrieta: I think a couple of things need to be cleared up. There have been differences, which the people heard about. I have questioned some decisions because I think these matters must be handled within a process, respecting the rights and duties of each entity. I do not believe the government, the Prosecutor General's Office, or the Attorney General's Office have grown apart. We have had our differences. I think that what happened today is the best proof that if we cooperate with one another, as we did in [Julio Fabio] Urdinola's case, this process can work. The truth is that Urdinola's surrender was an announced surrender. For quite some time now there has been talk of a surrender. I do not think there are any differences between the government, the prosecutor general, and the attorney general on this. de Bedout: But the problem of impunity continues. Do you think the way things are being handled could result in impunity? Arrieta: I have said repeatedly that because our Penal Code is a confusing, profuse, and diffuse code, it could lead to impunity. I have also said that the best way to prevent this is for all the institutions that must work with the law to agree on how we should make it work. In other words, the prosecutor general would do his job, the government its job, and the attorney general would orchestrate the whole procedure and see that no one goes unpunished. If we can achieve this, even though the Penal Code is confusing, profuse, and diffuse, I think we can give the country a balanced and appropriate answer. de Bedout: Attorney General Arrieta, one subject that led to differences between the government and the prosecutor general was the transfer of certain Medellin Cartel members to a jail in Medellin. Do you think that transfer should be made? Arrieta: I cannot express my opinion on that matter. Depending on what happens, the Attorney General's Office may have to become involved in this matter, and if I expressed my opinion now, I would have to declare myself ineligible to rule on this matter. I would like to say that the law is clear. The law clearly establishes the duties of the prosecutor general and the government, and we are responsible for ensuring that none of the two institutions oversteps its authority in order to ensure that the law is respected, not just in this particular case but in all cases that are controlled and supervised by the Attorney General's Office. de Bedout: Thank you, Attorney General Arrieta.
