FBIS4-34777 "drlat122_b_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-122 Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 Dominican Republic Haiti DeRonceray Denounces UN, OAS as `Inquisition Courts' DeRonceray Denounces UN, OAS as `Inquisition Courts' FL2306222194 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole in French 1600 GMT 23 Jun 94 FL2306222194 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole French BFN [Text] The Mobilization for National Development, MDN, the party of professor Hubert de Ronceray, accuses the UN and the OAS of converting themselves into inquisition courts to crucify the poorest nation of the American continent. Within the next hours or coming days, the giants will add new cruelties to the Haitian age-old tragedy, states MDN leader Hubert De Ronceray. [Begin De Ronceray recording] In spite of our 191 years of struggle against all the weariness of chronic underdevelopment, today, we are more isolated than ever in a hostile, merciless world. Our loneliness is aggravated by our noxious sense of identity, our indiscipline, our intolerance, and the pathological ambitions of our irreconcilable camps. In the coming hours or days, the giants will add new cruelties to our age-old tragedy to again remind us that human rights, stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the Constitution of the United States, and in all the world's charters, do not apply to the negroes of Haiti. In the name of democracy, Haitians have no right to work, to travel, to feed themselves, to use the fruits of their labor, to receive medical care, etc. All it takes now is to brandish the word democracy in order to assassinate Haiti and its people without impunity, and to justify the daily murder of thousands of children and young people, victims of an absurd, criminal embargo. The misfortunes that are hitting us today could have been avoided if there had been, outside and inside, a minimum of respect for a spark of truth. Our fundamental charter forces us to resist all partial or total occupation of the national territory, to avoid satisfying individual madness linked to some brotherhood or hierarchy, but to assert our rights as a sovereign people and our determination to choose a democracy authentically Haitian, respectful of our laws, of our institutions, and of our cultural identity. More hardships are ahead of us. But tomorrow will consist of a Haitian political solution that will bring about national and international reconciliation. [end recording]
