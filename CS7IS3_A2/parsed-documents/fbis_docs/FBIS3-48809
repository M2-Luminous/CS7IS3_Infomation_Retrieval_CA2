MPT's Broadcasting Bureau Chief Masaaki Egawa said: "Tokyo is the only major city in the world which has no radio station providing foreign language programs." In light of this, the MPT will create conditions for approving the establishment of new broadcasting stations to live up to the name of the international city "Tokyo." If technical issues such as allocation of electric waves are solved, it is likely the establishment of foreign language FM stations will be authorized within the year. In concrete terms, FM stations will be newly established to provide programs only in English. Although it is planned that such stations will be newly established in three major cities -- Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya -- it is expected an FM station will be established only in Tokyo at first. The MPT will first study technical issues as to whether there will be electric waves which could be allocated for a new station. Then it will begin to work out a basic broadcasting program to improve system conditions. What is behind the issue of setting up broadcasting stations for foreign language programs is that with the progress of internationalization, the number of foreigners who visit or live in Japan are increasing every year. Statistics show 980,000 foreigners stayed in Japan for more than 90 days in 1989. In 1993 the number increased to 1,370,000. The number of foreigners who visited Japan sharply increased to 3.53 million people (in 1991) from 2.15 million (in 1987). In light of this, those associated with the broadcasting business have expressed hope that broadcasting stations intended for foreigners will be established. Moreover, some felt that broadcasting in foreign languages is necessary in view of emergency cases such as disasters.
