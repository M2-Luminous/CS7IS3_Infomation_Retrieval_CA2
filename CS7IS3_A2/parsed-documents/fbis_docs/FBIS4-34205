[end recording] He said he could not forget his fellow countrymen, the Paez Indians in Cauca and Huila Departments, who are currently suffering so much. Also, that he could not forget the solidarity of so many friendly countries as it allowed his brothers, who have been left without their dear ones and their belongings due to providence, to initiate their first steps toward a new life. This was what Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo said when he closed the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem, who was the first president to refer to Cuba at the summit, again centered his closing speech on that island's political situation. Without mentioning the Cuban president, Mr. Menem emphasized the need that Latin America have freedom as its point of departure. [Begin Menem recording] It can be a democracy based on the presidential, monarchic, or parliamentary systems, but it must be a democracy. [end recording] Mr. Menem said there is no conflict between the market and the state and also underscored the importance of democracy as the fundamental factor to obtain the peace required for justice and freedom to rule. He added that if he were to be asked which of the four summits he thought had been best, he would answer that this one had, the one held in Cartagena, because of the topics that had been broached, the debates, the freedom, and the organization of the summit. It was an important and impressive summit, he said. In his final words, President Menem said freedom and democracy can only be strengthened with more democracy.
