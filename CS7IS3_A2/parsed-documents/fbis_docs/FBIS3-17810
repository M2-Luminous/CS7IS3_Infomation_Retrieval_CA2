It is hard to establish to what extent they are true and to what extent they are false: The heads of the Korean mission and the Korean security services (the latter are very active in the Siberian wastes on an entirely official basis) establish their own procedures there. For example, two women journalists from THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and a South Korean television crew looking into the problem were snubbed as "emissaries of imperialism." Others were taken around "showcase facilities" which had been seen many times and had to listen to prepared texts about the happy citizens of their brilliant land being the freest people on earth. Nonetheless, your IZVESTIYA correspondent managed to peep behind the scenes of the customary theater presentation. How It All Began The first intergovernmental agreement between the USSR and the DPRK on joint timber logging on the territory of the Russian Far East was signed exactly 27 years ago, in March 1967. There was a great deal of politics in that agreement, but very little economics. And although it was pure ideology, we turned a blind eye to the fact that the Korean comrades often behaved in a manner that was far from fraternal. Timber industry supervisors suddenly discovered that Korean workers were secretly chopping down trees, obtaining the resin, and sending it home. There were no agreements sanctioning this kind of activity. Local people and hunting inspectors were increasingly encountering blatant poaching by Korean loggers. They were using barbaric methods to kill musk deer, Manchurian elk, and sable and they were laying waste the celebrated mountain cranberries of Verkhnebureinskiy Rayon... For the entire 27-year period the forest protection service has been keeping records of gross breaches of the forest management rules by Korean loggers. They fail to clear felling areas of leftover wood, they destroy new growth, and on only one occasion in all these years have they planted a small area with young trees.... One wonders why in heaven's name we concluded the treaty in the first place. North Koreans As Saviors of the Industry [subhead] Strange as it may seem, the most zealous advocates of the extension of the intergovernmental agreement on joint DPRK and Russian timber logging in the Far East are the leaders of Verkhnebureinskiy Rayon, where this predatory logging goes on. Their main argument is that, if the Koreans leave, the rayon's timber industry will soon die out because there is no one to take the place of the foreign state's citizens in this difficult taiga work. So I was told by rayon administration chief Petr Titkov, who was himself a timber worker in the recent past and worked for some years alongside Koreans in the "Urgalles" association, which represents the Russian side in joint activity under the intergovernmental agreement. What economic foundation would Verkhnebureinskiy Rayon lose with the departure of the Koreans from the taiga forest lots? Last year the "Urgalles" association, through which all economic arrangements are made with the "Gastarbeiter" from North Korea, paid 1.5 billion rubles [R] in taxes into the federal, kray, and rayon budgets. Some R446 million remained in the rayon, which is one-tenth of all budget appropriations. A trifling amount of money these days. But clearly we cannot expect even that amount this year. This sad conclusion can be drawn from the results of the work of native loggers since the beginning of the year. Their daily round wood production schedule is 4,548 cubic meters. But they are producing only 1,400-1,500 cubic meters per day. That is the amount being produced, for example, by the De-Kastrinskiy timber logging operation. It employs around 600 Russian loggers, whereas the North Korean timber logging association employs over 6,000. This answers the question why the rayon bosses are in favor of a treaty which places the country in bondage: A mass of problems far removed from the practice of joint timber logging is being resolved in Chegdomyn, Urgal, and Novyy Urgal by the almost free workforce from the DPRK. For example, Korean workers are constructing the Urgal railroach branch administration building, and local people hire them to dig truck gardens, repair apartments, erect garages, dachas, and barns... "Our workers will fleece you real bad," a rather drunk "native" of Chegdomyn told us candidly, "whereas this bunch -- give them a bowl of soup each or a bottle of moonshine and, boy, will they work!" Denial of Rights and the Rights of the Korean Individual [subhead] ...It is a common sight in these parts: Emaciated people in short jackets and Kim Il-song caps, with "great leader" badges on their chests, roaming the streets of the settlements, tormented by the continual fear of starvation. Their silent suffering does not concern the local Russian officials one bit. The latter have no concept of the fact that it is a grave sin to exploit people who are dependent on you, taking cynical advantage of their dependence. If they have to explain themselves to their own or foreign journalists they have a pat formula: What we are doing is building relations with the North Koreans on a purely economic basis. As for delicate matters such as human rights, they are the Foreign Ministry's concern. With the connivance of the kray and rayon authorities, North Korea has long since constructed its own strongholds, like states within a state, living in accordance with their own totalitarian laws. Remember 18 months ago, when photographs of prison cells erected behind the high fences of North Korean encampments were all over the Russian and foreign press? Runaway timber loggers told journalists about the sophisticated torture that went on there, about the severe punishments meted out for the slightest offense. The North Korean security service is not only operating in Chegdomyn and Verkhnebureinskiy Rayon, but is rampaging all over Russia with impunity. For example, its officers carried out a search of a Russian woman's apartment in Khabarovsk, suspecting her of hiding a Korean who had run away from timber logging. These patently illegal actions take place with the consent of our law-enforcement organs. Their DPRK colleagues evidently have some kind of agreement, the text of which is secret. All we do know is that our militia is helping the North Korean security service to catch runaways, who are increasing in numbers with each passing year. When caught they are immediately handed over to Korean "comrades," and what happens then is shrouded in mystery. There are currently more than 50 people on the run. There is one very worrying element: There has been a sharp fall in the amount of timber cut, while the Korean side is ordering more and more galvanized iron from "Urgalles" to make coffins for people killed in "accidents." Formerly any incident of this kind would have been carefully investigated by our technical experts and the findings of a forensic medical expert on the cause of death would have been required. Now the procedure has been "simplified": No examinations are carried out, the bodies are kept in a refrigerator, and they are then taken home in a special freightcar. We made a considerable effort to arrange a visit to the North Korean hospital where loggers are treated, but our way was barred as if it were a top-secret strategic facility. V. Cherepanov, a surgeon from Chegdomyn hospital, who has access to the hospital, said that conditions in the "hospital" were squalid, to put it mildly: Water has to be brought in, the toilets are outside, the premises are primitive, are there are hardly any medicines.... It should be borne in mind what kind of diet the citizens of the "brilliant land" have. A senior party official from the DPRK timber logging mission recited a long list of all the things their workers allegedly receive: Every month around five kg of meat, nearly 30 kg of rice and fresh vegetables each, fish.... Knowing that in Khabarovsk a kilogram of fresh cucumbers currently costs more than R5,000 and tomatoes around R10,000 and that in Chegdomyn the price is nearly twice as high as that, we wanted to know where the Korean comrades got the vegetables from. "We have our own wonderful hothouses, which provide abundant crops," came the reply. In Chegdomyn we learned that nothing had been grown in hothouses for two years and the Korean workers were not even getting their national dish -- "kimchi," highly seasoned cabbage -- and their diet consisted of rice alone.... ...The intergovernmental agreement on joint timber logging in the Russian Far East between our country and the DPRK expired on 31 December. So far a new one has not been signed. But if it is considered economically expedient to continue thos cooperation, our country, which loudly proclaims itself democratic, is simply obliged to stop foreigners doing whatever they like on our fatherland's territory.
