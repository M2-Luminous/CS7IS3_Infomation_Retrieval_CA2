You understand that the question or the whole problem of nuclear weapons that are located in Ukraine remains, for the moment, the most important problem. I would like to begin by saying that after the Supreme Council's ratification of START I, neither Russia nor the United States recognized the act of ratification as though it had taken place. Obviously, this is why we were forced to deal with an extraordinary situation and forced to resolve, in a short period of time, exceptionally complex issues. I would like to say that the situation developed in a very complicated way. Since the first days of Ukraine's independence we had never felt such intense international pressure, the main aim of which was to isolate us as quickly and as broadly as possible internationally. The main thing that is almost completely unacceptable and was unacceptable and which provoked the toughest reaction was the refusal by Ukraine to accede to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. On this issue I would like to assure you that there is an absolute consensus by CSCE member countries. The treaty should be universal and undoubtedly extended for an unspecified period. We have been given to understand that by refusing to accede to the NPT, Ukraine is joining a group of states that do not have a very high rating in the world and many of the world's democratic countries are talking about this. The second thing is that doubt was cast on the very fact that Ukraine would ratify the START treaty and a rumor was spread that Ukraine was reviewing its policy of attaining nonnuclear status as set out in its basic foreign policy documents. Obviously great harm was inflicted on Ukraine's international image. I will be frank. To achieve glory as an unreliable international partner that fails to abide by its promises -- moreover a country that is only two years old -- is a very disadvantageous and I would even say almost hopeless situation. To remain without support in the world community, even if one thinks one is right, is a losing game. You do not have to go far for examples. I would like to note separately that President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk's position on this, which he announced in a speech soon after the ratification of the START treaty, is exceptionally important. It was really an important political and diplomatic step. Thanks to it we managed to avoid, without any exaggeration, serious complications. Such a position left the doors open for us for contacts and for future work. How did our foreign policy department act under these conditions? I would like to tell you, esteemed people's deputies, that practically in the first hours following the ratification of the START treaty, the ministry began work on explaining the content of the Supreme Council's resolutions and the motives that caused it to raise the reservations at the time of ratification. [Passage omitted: Explains the mechanism by which Ukrainian embassies informed foreign ministries of other states and how Ukraine's foreign minister personally wrote to all the world's leading states, including the UN and NATO general secretaries, explaining the Ukrainian position on the ratification of START; Kravchuk's 30-minute telephone conversation with President Clinton and his telegrams to Russian President Boris Yeltsin; explanatory work carried out at the CSCE conference in Rome; Ukraine's negative image reflected in various publications] You recall the phrase spoken by our president, Leonid Makarovych: It is the first time that I am experiencing such a difficult situation that Ukraine was fated to endure at the beginning of December 1993. We did not broadcast this widely. We could not do this because we understood that the nation might not be able to withstand all this. We dealt with this and worked on it calmly and took it to its conclusion. Esteemed deputies, international isolation -- and I would like to place particular emphasize on this -- creates such an attitude in the world toward an isolated country that any kind of forced methods against it are received as a naturally forced reaction to its behavior. As an example, I would like to remind you of the course of events on the eve of the war in the Persian Gulf. Then the United States and its allies made use of the full isolation of Iraq almost six months before the military operation, to find support for its actions throughout the entire world community. It was a great mistake not to take into account Russia's reactions on the possible transformation of Ukraine into a nuclear state. You are aware that such an option is not only unacceptable to the political and military leadership of that country but also plays the role of a popular slogan for those like one of the winners in the recent elections who support the transformation of Ukraine into a new Russian province [huberniya]. In this connection I would like to return to the key issues for our security and future as an independent state, the value of nuclear weapons as a restraining factor. Foreign experts and the overwhelming majority of those who understand these things tell us that the only weapon capable of halting aggression is the one that can be put to real use by inflicting unacceptable harm on the aggressor. Not only us, but all nuclear state know that Ukraine does not have operational control over the nuclear weapons located on our territory. [Passage omitted: Repeats Kravchuk's statements about not being able to service the weapons and that they are a threat to Ukraine's own security] I would also like to dwell on safeguarding Ukraine's interests and above all the national security of our state. It seems that the state of our economy clearly underlines an obvious and undeniable truth or thesis that is only too obvious today: that the main component of any state's security is a healthy economy and socio- political stability in society. If this does not exist, no kind of nuclear weapon, even if it is controlled and reliable, will help. The example of the former USSR serves as an example, and Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] spoke about this. We must consider whether we can preserve independence achieved at this price if, having found ourselves in isolation and without friends in the world, we encounter a situation where supplies of energy sources and in particular of nuclear fuel, are completely cut off and every kind of economic cooperation is frozen. Could we survive for long? [Passage omitted: speaks about the problems of Ukraine's nuclear power industry, the trilateral talks in Moscow, the foreign ministry's utmost attempts to defend Ukraine's position at the talks; the need for compromise; the agreement fulfils the conditions set out by the Supreme Council on 18 November 1993; sums up the arguments in favor of Ukraine getting rid of nuclear weapons including the end of Ukraine's isolation] We will be frank, esteemed deputies. It is a serious and difficult political decision but I am certain that it is the only one possible under the present conditions. It is about preserving not only Ukraine's positive image in international relations but about the very survival of our state. Thank you for your attention.
