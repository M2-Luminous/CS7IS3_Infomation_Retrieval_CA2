FR940511-1-00056 FR940511-1-00012 The mandatory inclusion of in-home care in current CCDBG and IV&hyph;A regulations is intended to ensure a full range of options to meet families' needs and to accurately reflect the child care market. However, because in-home care is not required by statute and because States and other grantees have requested greater flexibility and consistency across policies, we considered proposing that in-home care be made optional in both programs. However, we were concerned that, because in-home care presents a number of administrative challenges, some States would unduly restrict the availability of care for families who particularly need this type of setting or who lack other options. We therefore decided not to make in-home care optional but to give States and other grantees greater flexibility. We are mindful that in-home care plays a valid and important role in the child care market place and that many participants in subsidized care programs rely on care in their own homes to meet their family needs. Access to care which meets the needs of individual families is critically important to parents and children, to schools and the workplace, and to other community institutions which interface with the family. While in-home care represents only a small proportion of all available care in most communities, it may be the best or only option for some families and may prove valuable, necessary and cost-effective when compared to other options. Despite the challenges cited above, in-home care is being successfully offered and has proven to be an important resource. For these reasons, we expect States and Tribes to consider family and community circumstances carefully in establishing any conditions which will limit the availability of in-home care. We are thus proposing that grantees include in their CCDBG plans a discussion of their policies for in-home care and a rationale for their policy decisions. There are a number of conditions under which in-home care may be the most practical solution to a family's child care needs. For example, the child's own home may be the only practical setting in rural areas or in areas where transportation is particularly difficult. Employees who work nights, swing shifts, rotating shifts, weekends or other non-standard hours may experience considerable difficulty in locating and maintaining satisfactory center-based or family day care arrangements. Part-time employees often find it more difficult to make child care arrangements than do those who work full-time. Similarly, families with more than one child or children of very different ages might be faced with multiple child care arrangements if in-home care were unavailable. Many families also believe that very young children are often best served in their own homes. Given the general paucity of school-age child care in many communities, in-home supervision may enable some families to avoid latchkey situations before school, after school, and when school is not in session. For many families, in-home care by relatives also represents an important cultural value and may promote stability, cohesion and self-sufficiency in nuclear and extended families. We also urge child care administrators to consider the capacity of local child care markets to meet existing demand and the role that in-home care may play in the ability of parents to manage work and family life. Although in-home care does not represent a large share of the national supply, it plays an important role in the structure and functioning of local child care markets by extending the ability of parents to care for children within their own families, closing gaps in the supply of community facilities, and creating a bridge between adult care and self- or sibling-care as children near adolescence. Some States may choose to limit in-home care because of cost factors governed by minimum wage provisions of the FLSA and other Federal and State requirements. For example, a State might determine that minimum wage requirements result in payments for in-home care serving only one or two children that are much higher than the local market rate for other categories. Therefore, the State could elect to limit in-home care to families in which three or more children require care. The payment to the in-home provider would then be similar to the payment for care of the three children in other settings. This ability to limit in-home care allows States to recognize the same cost restraints that families whose care is unsubsidized must face. ACF recognizes that giving the States greater latitude to impose conditions and restrictions on in-home care may affect parents' ability to make satisfactory arrangements and thus their ability to participate in work, education or training. We also recognize the challenges of implementing health and safety requirements in the child's own home, of monitoring in-home providers, and of complying with federal wage and tax laws governing domestic workers. Therefore, we are seeking focused comments on our regulatory proposals for in-home care and would especially appreciate suggestions on how to balance parental choice, cost effectiveness, and adherence to other Federal and State provisions, such as the FLSA, that are unique to in-home settings. In-Home Care and the CCDBG We propose to revise ยง98.16(a)(7)(ii) to require that grantees include in their CCDBG plans a specification of their policies for in-home care and the rationale for those policies.
