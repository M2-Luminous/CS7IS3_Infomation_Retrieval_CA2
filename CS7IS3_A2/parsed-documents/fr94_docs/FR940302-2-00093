FR940302-2-00093 FR940302-2-00066 First, the rule sets forth certain minimum requirements before summary reports can be used, including that financial information contained in the summary annual report be reconciled to U.S. generally-accepted accounting principles, and that all shareholders have the ability upon request to receive a full annual report. Second, the NYSE will evaluate each country's program for providing shareholders with summary annual reports to verify that U.S. Holders are receiving adequate information under the laws of the foreign country. Finally, the NYSE will also review the procedure the country has provided for disclosing to shareholders the option to receive a full annual report. If the Exchange determines that either the substance or the procedure provided by a foreign country's law is unsatisfactory, the Exchange may prescribe additional requirements before the summary annual report can be distributed to U.S. Holders under the NYSE rule. In this regard, the NYSE has stated it will ensure, under its new rule, that shareholders receive adequate information and are provided with full and meaningful disclosure of their choices to receive the full annual report as opposed to the summary report. 12 Based on the above, the Commission believes the Exchange's review and oversight, combined with the minimum requirements set forth in the rule, should ensure the continued protection of investors and the public interest consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act. 12 See NYSE Letter, supra note 4. The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the rule change prior to the thirtieth day after publication of notice of filing thereof. Amendment No. 1 added language to subsection (a) of the proposed rule to clarify the Exchange's intention that summary annual reports include summary financial information. 13 The NYSE's proposed rule change was published in the Federal Register for the full statutory period and no comments were received. 14 13 Id. 14 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33400 (December 29, 1993), 59 FR 642 (January 5, 1994). IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;47 and should be submitted by March 23, 1994. V. Conclusion It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 15 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;47) is approved. 15 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988).
