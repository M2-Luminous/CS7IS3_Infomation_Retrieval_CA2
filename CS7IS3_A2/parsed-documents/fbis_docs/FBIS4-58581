In an interview with Algerian news agency `APS' and daily 'AL-SHA'B', the Algerian prime minister said the council is an essential body with which the government will be in constant touch and to which it is planning to submit its projected program to get out of the current crisis in the country. The National Transition Council which will be acting as a parliament during the three-year transition period will be made up of 280 members representing the state, political parties, and nonpolitical organizations. The institution of the council is to take place at the latest three months after the adoption of a transition platform. Several parties, mainly the former single party the National Liberation Front `FLN' and the Socialist Forces Front `FFS' have declined to be represented in the Council. Another group of some 30 political organizations said they are ready to sit in the Council. In the same interview, the head of the Algerian Government said if conditions are met, elections which he described as `unavoidable' will be held before the expiry of the transition period. For the prime minister, the people have to choose those who will decide their future and conditions for the consultation have to be gathered. `We are ready from a technical and administrative viewpoint to hold elections', he pointed out. Meanwhile, Algerian daily `L'INDEPENDANT, which reappeared on the newstand after a two week-ban, reported Tuesday that the curfew enforced in seven wilayas and extended later to three other central regions will be lifted next June. The paper, which quoted `reliable sources,' also cited measures to be taken by the government to support the civil peace process in the country. According to the daily, some leaders of the banned Islamic Salvation Front, including Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj will be `shortly released'.
