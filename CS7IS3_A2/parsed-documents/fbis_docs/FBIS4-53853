You might say that the markets have rebeled against the German Federal Bank, which is strongly independent and is referred to as the "central bank among central banks." Loses "Characteristics of Federal Bank" Growth in the money supply is also running high at about a two-digit rate. The Federal Bank has been managing policy in a manner that showed excessive sensitivity to the seeds of inflation, losing its "characteristics as a Federal Bank," and inviting the distrust of financial markets. The rise in U.S. interest rates, induced by monetary tightening in the United States in February, led to a hike in interest rates in the European markets. Although the United States is taking tightening measures and Germany is following an opposite relaxation posture, market rates have assumed a "coupling" phenomenon where they are rising in both regions. Turbulence in U.S. financial markets can said to have spread to European markets like those of Germany. Ever since both yen and European currencies such as the Deutsche mark began to rise against the dollar, the U.S. Treasury has displayed a noticeable degree of alarm. One market source interpreted U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's public statements on two separate occasions as being "tantamount to declaring a dollar crisis." Officials at a leading city bank commented, "Cautionary measures were taken out of fear that rising U.S. interest rates because of a weak dollar would spread to Europe," as the reason why European nations such as Germany joined in the Japan-U.S. coordinated market intervention to buy dollars on 4 May. For the time being, the modestly paced "coordinated actions" by the United States and Germany are benefiting Japan. The reason is that actions to support the value of the dollar against European currencies has temporarily halted the rising trend of the yen. Nevertheless, officials at the Bank of Japan [BOJ] remain concerned. Imbalances in international payments are not an issue between the United States and Germany, but the Japan-U.S. balance of payments shows an annual $130 billion surplus for Japan. As Germany lowers its official discount rate and the United States hikes its official discount rate, the United States and Germany are able to attain their common objective of stabilizing foreign currency exchange rates. BOJ officials fear that "Japan will now be asked to discharge its obligations." The root cause of the weak dollar is the shortage in the flow of funds to the United States to compensate for deficits in the U.S. balance of payments. In March, instead of investment funds flowing out of Japan which is the nation recording the highest surpluses against the United States, $11 billion in Japanese institutional investor funds flowed back into Japan. Surpluses That Fail To Drop A senior BOJ official remarks, "We are speaking of an exercise in futility," in referring to the yen selling-dollar buying intervention amidst a growing surplus of dollars within the flow of funds. A BOJ policy committee member goes so far as to joke, "Perhaps a more effective measure would be to select a currency other than the dollar to use as a foreign exchange reserve." The reason is that the several hundred millions of dollars purchased since last year have dropped in value because of the progressive strong yen-weak dollar relationship. Even if the value of the yen rises, Japanese firms have no choice but to seek their means of survival by exporting to maintain optimum plant operating levels, which contributes to the failure of surpluses to decline. Such "weaknesses" of the Japanese economy lead to pressure for a strong yen and vitiate intervention efforts. Even Japan has resumed a policy to implement lower short-term interest rates to reinforce the coordinated intervention actions. One BOJ director states, "There's nothing that says it would be bad for short-term market rates to fall below the official discount rate." Normally, the official discount rate, currently at 1.75 percent, at which the BOJ lends to private-sector banks serves as the lower limit for the interest rate structure. This new approach varies decisively from previous BOJ statements that "common sense dictates that the official discount rate does not go above market rates," and indicates that the goal is to drop market rates considerably lower. On 13 May the BOJ boosted the money supply and boosted efforts to establish lower short-term interest rates, and short-term interest rates are expected to fall further at the beginning of next week. Market participants predict that, "Interest on next-day unsecured call money might drop below 2 percent." Decline in Political Leadership Although the outlook for the economy "Shows signs of improvement," according to BOJ President Yasushi Mieno, the BOJ was forced to reinforce moves towards lower short-term interest rates for the sake of "coordination." As a minority coalition, the Hata government could have difficulty even passing a budget and it suffers from a decline in political leadership. The United States seems to have toned down its demands on Japan, but there is no guarantee that it will remain content only with the interest-lowering actions of the BOJ. The recent coordinated actions among Japan, the United States, and Europe resulted in realizing the coordinated goals of the group, but lurking in the background is the situation that demands that preference be given to domestic political affairs. Difficulties are being faced in implementing effective policies such as hikes in U.S. official discount rates and reductions in Japanese recurring surpluses, which means that it would not be surprising to see a sudden disruption in the "coordinated actions." If that should occur, market upheavals may not be restricted to the rising of long-term interest rates.
