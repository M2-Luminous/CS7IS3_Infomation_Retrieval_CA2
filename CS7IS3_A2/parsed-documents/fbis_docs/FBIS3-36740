[Words indistinct] With the Helsinki Final Act, Russia took upon herself an unambiguous obligation to withdraw her troops from Estonia quickly, in an orderly manner and completely. The UN General Assembly and CSCE foreign ministers have been demanding the same of Russia. Keeping in mind such a consensus on the part of the world public, each Russian hint which casts doubt on the withdrawal of the Russian troops must be seen as violating crudely the international behavior standards, said Juri Luik. The Russian foreign minister's hint that the Western countries' request for Russia to observe elementary standards of international communication and honor unconditionally the sovereignty of her neighboring countries would (?play a trump card) into [Vladimir] Zhirinovskiy's hands remains completely unclear to the [Estonian] foreign minister. Against this background, Juri Luik recalls with worry that despite previous promises Russia failed to hand over to Estonia a timetable for the troop withdrawal during the recently ended 16th round of talks and not one Russian serviceman left Estonia in January.
