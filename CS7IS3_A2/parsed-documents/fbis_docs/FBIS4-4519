FBIS4-4519 "dreas063_c_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-063 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 North Korea Joint U.S.-ROK `Air War' Exercises Denounced Joint U.S.-ROK `Air War' Exercises Denounced Radio Reports 30 Mar Exercise SK0104093194 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1200 GMT 31 Mar 94 SK0104093194 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1200 GMT 31 Mar 94 Korean BFN [Text] According to a military source, the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets on 30 March again staged a joint air war exercise for Northward aggression. This war exercise, which included ground force support, air strikes, long-distance airlifts, and surprise attacks was carried out in the skies above Pyongchang, Yangpyong, Oeyon islet, and Muju as the operational stage. F-16 nuclear-loaded fighter bombers, pursuit-assault planes, electronic jamming planes, which were mobilized from overseas bases, and more than 380 various military airplanes from the U.S. Air Force in South Korea and from the puppet Air Force, were mobilized. This war exercise, staged frantically under the support of a EA-6 electronic jamming airplane, was a dangerous playing with fire designed to promote actual combat capabilities for cooperative surprise attack [hyopdong kisuptagyok siljon nungryok] for a Northward aggression, together with airplane wings deployed in U.S. bases in Japan and the Pacific, and airplanes from the 7th U.S. Air Force based in South Korea and from the puppet Air Force. KC-135 refueling airplanes, which flew in South Korea from overseas bases timed to coincide with this war exercise, refueled scores of airplanes that ran amok with air war exercises by making shuttle flights between Taehuksan Island and Kyongyolbi Yolto. C-141 and C-130 transport planes airlifted large aggressor Armed Forces from U.S. bases in the Pacific to the U.S. air base in South Korea. The airlifted troops and lethal weapons were deployed in operational zones. In the meantime, the South Korean puppets frantically ran amok with exercises of a Northward war of aggression on the ground, in the sea, and in the air, under the U.S. imperialists' instigation. On 30 March, the South Korean puppets deployed hundreds of armed hooligans and scores of armored vehicles in the area adjacent to the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ] near Konan-ri, Piari, Yanggu county, South Korean Kangwon Province in the eastern sector of the front. In addition, they mobilized and deployed large-caliber artillery units in Hoengsan-ri, Yonchon County, Kyonggi Province in the western sector of the front. That day, the puppet 105-mm artillery unit, occupying fire positions in Mayong-ri, Chorwon County in South Korean Kangwon Province and in Hapsu-ri, Yonchon County, Kyonggi Province, fired about 70 artillery shells at an area near the DMZ by the Military Demarcation Line. The armed hooligans of the puppet Army, occupying combat positions in Chungsa-ri, Yonchon County, indiscriminately fired some 800 bullets from large-caliber machine guns, thus displaying war hysterics. About 10 transport planes of the puppet Army, which flew in the air above Uijongbu, Kyonggi Province that day, created a bloodthirsty war atmosphere by dropping commando troops one after another, and the wings of armored helicopters and transport helicopters, which were mobilized in the air above Paju, Pochon, and Yonchon in Kyonggi Province, ran amok with airlifting war supplies to commando operations. Fighter-bombers, pursuit-assault planes, and observation planes of the puppet Army, which were mobilized in the air above the sea off Kunsan, also ran wild with marine attacks and landing support. The military airplanes, which participated in various air war exercises staged in the air above South Korea against the Northern half of the republic on 30 March, alone numbered as many as some 600 planes. The war maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets, which are becoming more grave with each passing day, clearly demonstrate how recklessly the rascals are running amok to crush our Republic with armed forces.
