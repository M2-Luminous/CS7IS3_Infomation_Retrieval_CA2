Paris -- Two thirtyish Algerians, presumed FIS sympathizers, who were arrested in Lille last Monday were formally charged on Friday evening with complicity in a terrorist plot and bound over by Parisian magistrate Jean Louis Bruguiere. The Algerians were in possession of an assault rifle and ammunition (not for the assault rifle), as well as tracts and false documents, it was learned from judicial branch sources. We have also learned there is a lot more to the story than suggested by that terse 25 March dispatch: in fact, the discovery of the first GIA [Armed Islamic Group] in France. Disturbing and incredible as it may seem, no one--not the DST [Directorate of Territorial Security], the antiterrorist section of the Paris PJ [Judicial Police], the 6th Central Directorate of the Judicial Police [DCPJ] responsible for counterterrorism nationwide; not even the DGSE [General Directorate for External Security] or the Algerian intelligence services--knew of the existence of such a terrorist ring. Some time ago, on 9 November 1993, 75 Islamists were arrested in various parts of France, among them prominent FIS leaders residing in France such as Moussa Kraouche and Djaafar El-Houari, leaders of the Algerian Fraternity in France (FAF), as well as Ahmed Simozrag, currently under house arrest, an attorney for FIS leaders incarcerated in Algiers. The latter was the subject of an expulsion order signed by the Ministry of Interior on 9 November 1993. The decision to place him under house arrest was made after he refused to pick a destination country, Algeria for example. That police operation set off panic in Islamist circles in France, as well as a political and media outcry. French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said the day of the arrests that "the round-up of FIS leaders and sympathizers in France... should serve as a warning to all and sundry...that in France, everyone must obey the laws." For his part, French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua issued a strong warning to Islamists that "the government will not tolerate the growth of subversive activity in France, under whatever pretext, and we will put an end to it." Thus the French Government, which thought it had put the Islamist menace behind it, discovers now to its consternation that Islamist activists seem to have paid little heed to those warnings. But Islamists were already known to be implicated in various trafficking activities, including narcotics, that serve to finance activities of the terrorist groups in Algeria and in Europe. This particular story goes back to December, when the investigative division of the police security branch [RG] in Paris and the Lille PJ began their separate sleuthing. The Paris RG was on the trail of a GIA support network, while the Lille PJ was investigating a heroin trafficking ring that was smuggling 4 kg per month of the drug from the Netherlands into northern France. On 21 March at about 1700, the PJ squad in Lille arrested 18 members of the network, which had been using for its base of operations the "El Djazair" cafe, which was located at 15 Rue de la Cle in Lille's old town and owned by a 67-year-old Algerian, Mohamed Bougrioua. Forty-eight hours later, Mrs. Catherine Fontaine, examining magistrate with the Lille public prosecutor's office, signed committal orders for nine of those apprehended, including the cafe owner and Messrs. Adji, Djouab, and Amireche (aged 22, 24, and 30, respectively), on drug charges. Hundreds of grams of heroin were seized in police searches that also brought to light links between the GIA network and a big criminal ring specializing in fabrication of forged Algerian identity documents. Nine members of that ring had been arrested in a raid about twenty days earlier but were released for "lack of evidence." The work of the investigative divisions of the RG in Paris and Nord led to the discovery of 511 blank Algerian national identity cards and 606 national service cards (bearing the stamp of the High Commissioner's National Service Office [HCSN]) at the Lille residence of a 39-year-old Algerian "student," El-Hadj Chaib Eddour. These ANP [People's National Army] documents had already been placed in envelopes bearing names and addresses of the intended recipients in Algeria. According to our sources, the list of these names was passed to Algerian authorities. Also arrested was Ahmed Seba, a 28-year-old Frenchman of Algerian origin. He quickly confessed and said he had been induced, by threats of reprisals against loved ones in France and Algeria, to deliver the documents to Chaib Eddour's domicile at the behest of one Chemellal Boudjellal, a GIA Islamist now a fugitive from justice. Boudjellal, born in Mascara in November 1966, is also said to have given Ahmed Seba an assault rifle of Israeli manufacture (Galil) found during the search of the latter's domicile in Persant-Beaumont, on the northern outskirts of Paris; inspectors from the 6th DCPJ found munitions, plus--once again!--hundreds of blank Algerian identity cards and certificates issued by the army's HCSN. Police also found GIA documents sent from London and addressed to one Aymar Elachir, various postal transfer documents, some cash, and rubber stamps bearing the name of an ANP officer. According to our sources, the false papers were intended for GIA members returning from Afghanistan and for elements of the same terrorist group in Algeria. The search also turned up a connection between Ahmed Seba and Larbi Beddiaf, who was charged on 12 November with conspiring in a terrorist plot: A copy of the judicial order was found in Seba's residence in Persant-Beaumont. This sweep was the largest ever mounted by French police against a "dormant network" of Islamist operatives in France. Ahmed Seba and Chaib Eddour--both unknown, we emphasize, to either French or Algerian security services--have been bound over by examining magistrate Jean Louis Bruguiere, who frequently handles terrorist cases. The two suspects were charged on 25 March with "conspiracy to engage in terrorist action, violation of the weapons laws, falsification of official documents, and utilization of falsified documents." An international look-out bulletin has been issued for Chemellal Boudjellal, who French police say is the "brains" behind the GIA in northern Europe. Unlike the November police sweep against Islamists residing in France, this affair has been handled very quietly by French authorities. The new approach suggests that the implantation of Islamists in France and Europe may be more extensive than previously thought.
