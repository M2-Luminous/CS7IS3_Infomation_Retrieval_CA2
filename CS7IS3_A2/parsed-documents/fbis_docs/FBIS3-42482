Admittedly, now that the cold war is far behind us and relations of trust and mutual understanding are being established between states, such an episode may seem to the uninitiated to be an anachronism. Is it still necessary to carry out reconnaissance such as this today, you might ask. Well, judge for yourself. Despite the strengthening of confidence and mutual understanding between the countries of West and East Europe, every day reconnaissance planes take off from foreign airfields and head toward the borders of Russia and the CIS countries. According to recent data in my possession, in 1993 alone NATO countries and other states carried out over 2,600 reconnaissance flights near the borders of the Russian Federation and our immediate neighbors. At the present moment the NATO countries support a whole armada -- 470 reconnaissance planes and base patrol aircraft -- in the allied and national air forces. The main types of tactical reconnaissance planes are the RF-4C, the RF-16, the AMX, the Jaguar GR1, the Mirage F-1CR, and the Tornado FR and GR1 [as published]. The tactical and technical characteristics of these planes are given in the table below. In addition, the U.S. Air Force has over 60 strategic reconnaissance planes. In addition to this number around another 150 reconnaissance planes and base patrol planes belonging to the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea and stationed in Asia and the Pacific also constantly monitor Russia's borders. To be fair, it should be noted that since the end of the cold war the intensity of these flights has diminished year by year. To be precise, the 1993 figure was 12 percent down on 1992. But you will agree that 2,600 reconnaissance flights a year are still rather a lot. In short, Russia's neighbors near and far are keeping us under constant observation. Incidentally, they are doing this not just from the air but also from the ground and from space. What is there for us to do? Despite the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Russia is still a vast state. In terms of length of border and size (the area of the Russian Federation is 17.1 million square km), it is still the largest country in the world. Russia's geostrategic position is unique because it is situated in both Europe and Asia and, consequently, it is bound to have interests in those parts of the world. In view of that fact the Russian Federation is obliged to follow the development of military-political processes both in the Asia and Pacific region and in Europe and, indeed, in the Near and Middle East, which are just 1-2 hours' flying time from our territory. In short, Russia needs constant, objective information on the states surrounding us. This information comes not just from the words and assurances of the politicians. Airborne reconnaissance is one objective source of that information, too. [passage omitted] The Army and its most important component -- the Air Force -- like the whole country, are not having the best of times at the moment. Owing to the crisis in the economy and the disastrous lack of funds, the command of the Air Force is having to tackle tasks that contain many unknown quantities when it comes to the allocation of budget money: What is it to be spent on -- wages, housing, spare parts, or procurement of new hardware? "Owing to the shortage of fuel, spare parts, and other expendable materials," Lieutenant General of Aviation Nikolay Rastorguyev, directorate head and deputy chief of the Air Force Main Staff, said, "we have cut flights to a minimum beyond which we can go no further. Pilots are simply losing their skills." I cannot fail to mention the fact that, as a result of the breakup of the Soviet Union and the division of the Army, the Air Force reconnaissance service has suffered palpable losses. Some air regiments have been disbanded, some "privatized" by the former Union republics. For instance, there is one regiment of front-line reconnaissance aircraft left in Belarus and three regiments apiece in Ukraine and Central Asia. Despite these losses, a Russian front-line reconnaissance aviation grouping has in the main been formed today. Units redeployed from distant and nearby foreign countries are settling down in their new bases and have embarked on combat training. And the claims by some mass media that the Air Force has curtailed combat training do not, to put it mildly, accord with reality. The example I cited at the beginning of these notes and a host of other facts attest that the Air Force reconnaissance service is always ready to perform and is performing its designated tasks. Of course, they are having a hard time now. Everything is in short supply. Things are further aggravated by the fact that over the last few years (owing to lack of proper funding) the Air Force has drastically cut procurement of new aviation hardware. That has also taken its toll on reconnaissance aviation. The stock of Su-17M4R, Mig-25RB, and Su-24MR planes is becoming outdated and worn-out, their service life is coming to an end, but there are no reinforcements or replacements. The program for commissioning the Sukhoy firm's new reconnaissance plane has been disrupted owing to lack of funding again, and will the Air Force even have the money to buy it? In short, if the current situation lasts another few years, in around 10 years the Air Force may be left without a reconnaissance service. But what are we worrying about? The world situation is changing. And it seems to be changing for the better. Perhaps in 10 years or so Russia will not have any enemies or adversaries? God grant that that be true! But can we close our eyes to the fact that neither the United States nor the other NATO countries are giving up any of their reconnaissance programs. In particular, reports have appeared in the Western press that the United States is developing the "Aurora" top-secret supersonic reconnaissance plane. With a range of 15,000-17,000 km and a speed of Mach 5-6 at altitudes of around 36,000 meters this aircraft with its two-man crew is capable of getting virtually anywhere in the world fast. AVIATION WEEK AND SPACE TECHNOLOGY also reports that the U.S. Air Force has allegedly taken delivery of the new "Black Manta" TR-3A operational-tactical reconnaissance aircraft. In short, despite the fact that international tension is obviously easing and relapses into "cold war" are a thing of the past, the leadership of the world's leading countries has not slackened its efforts to develop airborne reconnaissance systems, but is, on the contrary, trying to perfect them. Come what may, Russia is historically destined to be a leading world power. And it cannot do without reconnaissance (airborne reconnaissance included).
