FR940822-2-00052 FR940822-2-00038 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION [CC Docket No. 94&hyph;89, FCC 94&hyph;192] Elehue Kawika Freemon and Lucille K. Freemon v. American Telephone and Telegraph Company; Designation for Hearing AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Notice of Designation for Hearing. SUMMARY: This Hearing Designation Order designates for hearing a formal complaint proceeding to resolve material questions of fact surrounding the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's (AT&T's) handling of an operator-assisted telephone call involving the complainants in this case, Elehue Kawika Freemon and Lucille K. Freemon (together the Freemons or complainants). The issue to be decided in the proceeding is whether AT&T's actions violated Section 705 of the Communications Act and, if so, whether the Freemons suffered any measurable harm as a consequence of such violations and are entitled to an award of damages from AT&T.

Synopsis of Hearing Designation Order 1. The Freemons filed a formal complaint with the Commission pursuant to Section 208 of the Act alleging that AT&T had violated Section 705 of the Act by monitoring the complainants' telephone conversation and disclosing its contents or meaning. AT&T disputes the legal and factual bases of the Freemons' claims. 2. After submission of numerous pleadings and motions to the Commission and discovery by the parties directed at clarifying the basis of their respective claims, both the facts and circumstances surrounding AT&T's handling of the Freemons' call are sharply disputed. Although neither AT&T nor the Freemons has formally requested that the complaint be designated for hearing, both have informally advised Commission staff that they view a hearing as the most appropriate and expeditious way to resolve the issues raised by the complaint. 3. Based on review of the record adduced in this matter, the Commission concluded that further proceedings are necessary to resolve material questions of fact bearing on whether AT&T violated Section 705 of the Communications Act in connection with its handling of the complainants' operator-assisted call as described in the complaint. 4. Accordingly, it is ordered, pursuant to Sections 4(i), 4(j), 201, 206, 207, 208, and 209 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§154(i), 154(j), 201, 206, 207, 208 and 209, that the above-captioned complaint proceeding is designated for hearing in a proceeding to be held before an Administrative Law Judge at a time and place to be specified in a subsequent order upon the following issues: 1. To determine the facts and circumstances surrounding AT&T's handling of Elehue Freemon's operator-assisted telephone call to his mother, Lucille Freemon, on May 30, 1988. 2. To determine whether a telephone conversation ensued between Elehue Freemon and Lucille Freemon on May 30, 1988, at the time an AT&T operator handled the operator-assisted call at issue. 3. To determine whether AT&T, through its operator or otherwise, intercepted and disclosed the contents or meaning of any telephone conversation that may have taken place between Elehue Freemon and Lucille Freemon on May 30, 1988, within the meaning of Section 705 of the Communications Act. 4. To determine, in light of the evidence adduced under issues 1 through 3 above, whether AT&T's actions in handling Elehue Freemon's May 30, 1988 operator-assisted call violated Section 705 of the Communications Act. 5. To determine, in view of the evidence adduced on the foregoing issues, whether and if so, in what amounts, AT&T should be required to pay monetary damages to complainants. 6. To determine, in view of the evidence adduced on the foregoing issues, whether complainants are entitled to an award of prejudgment interest on any damages recovered in this proceeding. 5. It is further ordered, That the burden of proof and the burden of proceeding with the introduction of evidence shall be upon complainants. 6. It is further ordered, That the designated parties may avail themselves of an opportunity to be herd by filing with the Commission a Notice of Appearance in accordance with Section 1.221 of the Rules, 47 CFR 1.221, within twenty (20) days of the mailing of this Order.
