Several retail stores ran out of beer last week and some restaurants, specializing in the sale of medium-strength beer, have already had to close their doors. In other respects, there have been sufficient quantities of food in the shops so far. This morning, all the basic necessities were still available almost as normal, but the situation may become somewhat more difficult in the next few days. The employers' organization in the food industry thinks that processed meat and fresh meat will disappear from the stores at the end of the week if the strike continues.
