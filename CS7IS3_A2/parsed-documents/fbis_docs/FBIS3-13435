[passage omitted] In line with America's former policies toward China, during his four-day visit to that country, Warren Christopher tried very hard to make use of the human rights issue in China as a means for extracting a number of economic and political concessions from Beijing. However, despite America's political deceptions on this issue, Christopher failed in his mission to China; because Chinese leaders know full well that the claims of White Office officials about defending human rights, freedom of expression and assembly, and the release of political prisoners, are nothing but political ploys. America's silence regarding manifest human rights violations by her own allies proves this point. [passage omitted] The most important disagreements between Beijing and Washington, which started after the collapse of the former Soviet Union, have been due to the two countries' different perceptions of international developments and the new world order favored by America. The two countries' different interpretations regarding the new polarization of power in the world, as well as the rapid growth in China's commercial exports and the expansion of cooperation between Tokyo and Beijing as two superior powers in East Asia constitute the roots of contradictions of interest between China and America, which have assumed more complex dimensions during the past few months. During the past few years, the Asian countries of the Pacific Ocean rim have enjoyed the fastest economic growth in the world. In Washington's eyes those countries constitute a suitable market for helping the recovery of America's ailing economy. America, which is making every effort in order to gain access to that market, is worried about the loss of her market in that part of the world and China's excessive influence there. The repetition of the allegations of human rights violations in China, even raising the issue of the danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons in that region, are in fact parts of Washington's attempts to achieve its goals. By claiming to defend human rights and by exaggerating the danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and even by increasing her pressures on her allies in the region, such as Japan and South Korea, America is trying to justify the necessity of her presence in those countries, which have always rejected American requests to open their markets to American goods. The failure of Christopher's recent visit to Australia and Japan has been due to the rejection of American demands by those countries. During his visits Christopher did not succeed in extracting economic concessions from those two countries, which are regarded as being America's allies. In any case, Christopher's failures during his visits to Australia, Japan, and subsequently China, demonstrates the fact that in the new international scene America is incapable of forcing her views upon powerful economic countries, whether those countries that are her allies or those that are opposed to her.
