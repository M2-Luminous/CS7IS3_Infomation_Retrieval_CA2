Narrative Statement for the Department of Transportation Office of the Secretary The Office of the Secretary of Transportation proposes to add the record system, DOT/ALL&hyph;10, Debt Collection File. The purpose of the system is the administrative management and collection of delinquent debts. The debts include past due loan payments, overpayments, fines, penalties, fees, damages, interest, leases, sales of real or personal property, etc., due to the Department of Transportation and debts due to other Federal departments and agencies that may be referred to the Department of Transportation for collection to the extent the Department of Transportation controls funds due the debtor. The authority for the maintenance of this system is the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, Pub. L. 89&hyph;508; Debt Collection Act of 1982, Pub. L. 97&hyph;365; and Executive Orders 9397 and 11222. Individuals receiving benefits in the form of salary and/or other forms of compensation already have disclosed the subject information to a federal agency; therefore this system presents no undue threat to privacy rights of individuals. A description of the steps taken to safeguard these records is given under the appropriate heading of the Federal Register system of records notice. No changes to existing procedural or exemption rules are required for this proposed new system. The purpose of this report is to comply with the Office of Management and Budget Circular, A&hyph;130, Appendix I, dated June 25, 1993.
