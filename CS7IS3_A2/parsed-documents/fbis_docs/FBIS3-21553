Marcel Duval, former chairman of our the National Defense Studies Committee and director of DEFENSE NATIONALE: "What Future for the Nuclear Weapons Nonproliferation Treaty?"] [Exerpts] The Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which covers a 25-year period, will expire in 1995. Negotiations will then be needed to set the terms for its renewal. Adm. Marcel Duvan was kind enough to carry out an analysis of nonproliferation, of the treaty, of the concerns of different nuclear and nonnuclear states, and finally of the prospects for the future, particularly for our country. We are most grateful to him for this very complete study. [passage omitted] Future Prospects Having taken stock of nonproliferation, the term hitherto used to describe the totality of measures to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, let us now examine its future prospects on the eve of its expiry in 1995. As for the NPT itself, its indefinite renewal, which naturally is desired by the nuclear powers, would require an affirmative vote by 83 countries, since it is estimated that 165 countries will then be party to it. As the general assumption is that 45 positive votes are guaranteed, those of at least 38 developing countries will also have to be secured. The Conference of Nonaligned States, which met in 1992, set the following conditions for extending the treaty: the cessation of nuclear tests; an end to the production of nuclear weapons; implementation of the START treaties; and the total elimination of these weapons by a given deadline. Furthermore, during the conference to prepare the revision of the NPT, which took place in May 1993, it appeared that many nonnuclear states, not all of which were nonaligned states, will oppose indefinite extension and may even propose a two-year trial period, at the end of which their demands would have to be implemented through international treaties. We have seen that the United States has now decided to meet most of these demands by proposing the conclusion of a treaty totally banning nuclear tests, and of another prohibiting the production of fissile materials for explosive use. For its part, the United States has already declared a moratorium on its tests until 1995, and stopped its production of fissile materials, while also accepting international monitoring of its stocks. In addition, it has ceased modernization of its nuclear arsenal, since, for the first time for 50 years, it is no longer running a nuclear program now that it has ceased further work on its mobile strategic missile, and it canceled both its light strategic missile program and its programs for new nuclear warheads for its Trident submarine missiles and for new nuclear missiles for its B2 bombers. It has also undertaken the dismantling required by the START treaties, even though these have not yet been ratified by the other parties. In the face of this voluntary disarmament, some have wondered, analyzing statements by Americans in senior positions, whether this did not amount to a delegitimization by the United States of nuclear weapons so as to derive maximum advantage from its undisputed conventional superiority over any possible adversaries anywhere in the world. Nevertheless, problems may still arise with other protagonists involved in the renewal of the NPT and the adoption of any other planned nonproliferation agreements linked to it. First, take the chaotic situation in the former Soviet Union, which particularly raises, as has been seen, the problem of Ukraine's adherence to the NPT. There will then remain the task of dismantling those nuclear weapons affected by the START treaty, which will take over 10 years and will require considerable financial assistance, not to mention the difficulties arising from the international monitoring of its implementation. To these concerns we should add, mindful of the Chernobyl catastrophe, those over the safety of nuclear plants for peaceful purposes and over the possibility of subjecting these plants to the controls which will inevitably be required by a treaty banning the production of fissile materials for weapons use. Finally, it is obvious that the degree to which all these proposals are welcomed in 1995 will be primarily influenced by the actions taken before this expiry by China, the most "proliferating" state whose actions frequently differ from its statements and which has the right of veto. It will also depend on the behavior of the undeclared nuclear powers. In other words, it will depend on Iraq's respect for its commitment to accepting long-term monitoring of its disarmament; on the outcome of the present confrontation over monitoring North Korea's installations; regarding Israel and Iran, on the peace process presently under way in the Middle East; while it may be hoped that the mutual deterrence between India and Pakistan will prevent their dispute over Kashmir from degenerating into open war. History teaches us that disarmament of all kinds is far more often a consequence of peace than the necessary prerequisite for it. This means that the struggle to prevent proliferation is undoubtedly far more of a political process, particularly at a regional level, than a matter of preventive technocratic measures. This does not imply that the latter have no effect, even if it is only to do everything possible to avoid the use of nuclear weapons in haste or in error, since, once the "nuclear taboo" has been breached, they have failed in their peace- keeping purpose. Consequences for France We now have to consider the consequences of all the above for France, which for the past 35 years has based its defense policy on the peace-keeping effect of nuclear weapons, and has largely based its foreign policy on the independence of its deterrent. Thus, the "French exception" in this area will be particularly challenged by the nonproliferation measures to be submitted in 1995 to the international community. Of these, the major concern is obviously the total cessation of nuclear tests, since this not only poses both for ourselves and for others a threat to the safety of existing weapons, but would also prevent us from developing new programs, even though we presently have at least one major one under way, the M5, which, by considerably increasing both range and performance, is intended to give our "new generation" of nuclear-missile launching submarines (SNLE) "all-out" capabilities. To this technological constraint is added the psychological, and hence political one, which is bound to challenge the two super powers' previously-announced renunciation of mobile strategic missiles and multiple warheads, and of terrestrial and naval tactical nuclear weapons. In contrast, the cessation of production of fissile materials for explosive use would not appear to have any major consequences for our defense, at least over the medium term. The increase in "denuclearized zones" would also seriously limit the freedom of action of our nuclear submarines, as they presently carry almost 90 percent of our nuclear deterrent capability. If this process were to extend to Europe, following the apparently conceivable withdrawal of U.S. airborne nuclear capacity still deployed there, then this would put an end to the possibility of eventually establishing a European deterrent. For this reason, and also to finally frame a common policy in this matter, it would be desirable to discuss all these nonproliferation measures within the European Union, or, failing this, on a Franco-British basis, as allowed by the recent establishment of a "Joint Commission on Nuclear Policy and Doctrine." At the national level, it would also appear desirable to reactivate the "Council on Exterior Nuclear Relations," set up in 1976 to respond to the concerns then beginning to be aroused here by proliferation. The survival of our national deterrent, together with the need to consider establishing such a deterrent at the European level, must be justified in terms of the effectiveness to be expected of them in the face of threats which can be foreseen over a fairly long term. In this respect, the threat emanating from the still considerable nuclear arsenals located in the territory of the former Soviet Union has in no way disappeared, however unlikely any aggression by them appears at present. The greatest danger is probably that of the possibility of these nuclear weapons falling into the hands of groups of varying degrees of responsibility, for whom the exercise of our deterrent, backed up by the threat of massive reprisals, would run the risk both of being unacceptable to international public opinion, and of being ineffective. The same would apply, we believe, to any "troublemaker" located outside Europe who, armed with a few primitive weapons and suitable ballistic vehicles, would hide in some kind of "aggressive sanctuary," or even perpetrated nuclear blackmail. In the face of such possible threats, two schools of thought are taking shape here. The first holds to the above doctrine, restricting it to the instance of major aggression, actually directed against our national territory, for which it feels the present arsenal is adequate. The second considers there is a need for a limited "nuclear counterthreat," capable of deployment overseas and intended to "inhibit" the destructive capacity of a terrorist state, and if need be to "decapitate" it. This would require, in the view of this school, very accurate mobile weapons with reduced collateral effects, with adjustable power, and the capability to penetrate the ground, and would thus mean new programs, and hence the need to carry out tests. In contrast, a rapprochement seems to be emerging between the two schools over the possible benefits, in the face of these new threats, in possessing a system based on ballistic theater antimissiles, or in other words a mobile system, even though during the Cold War France was opposed to any global system. Some consider that the disadvantage of establishing such a system is that it could give the "South" the impression that it is about to replace the "East" as the Western world's enemy. The expiry in 1995 will therefore force us to formulate a view on all these matters. As for doctrines, we do not feel it is desirable to specify too closely the future conditions in which our nuclear deterrent could be used, or particularly to say what will not be done, so as to keep all our options open. It appears obvious that this deterrent will not be able to remain the absolute priority it was during the Cold War; but, as is amply proved by the present debates over nonproliferation and also those over the future course of the Security Council, it will certainly retain its political dimension. As it is no longer possible to "disinvent" the nuclear weapon, France must protect itself from its human know-how and its technical capabilities in this area, as these are largely what will ensure its future status as a "major medium power," and, if necessary, its survival if it were to be the object of any major aggression.
