As you know, the Zhalah camp recently replaced the al-Biqa' Valley. The terrorists were being trained and sheltered in this camp, and they were providing logistics support to the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization in Turkey. Approximately 1,600 terrorists were nestled there. We also received intelligence information to the effect that the leaders of the PKK were among these terrorists. We also know that of the 1,600 persons, approximately 300 were armed, female militants. Our Air Force launched an operation at 0810 this morning. Our planes took off and the Zhalah camp was bombed at 0900. This operation will continue. To my satisfaction, I was informed a while ago that the operation was completely on target. This was a political decision, and it had to be made. As I stated earlier, 1994 must be an important turning point in the struggle against terrorism. In order to turn 1994 into a year in which terrorism is placed under control, we, on one hand, waged our struggle abroad on a diplomatic level by explaining our just cause and, on the other, displayed our political determination today by hitting the Zhalah camp, which had become the most important region providing logistics support for the PKK.
