Work on 18 Tornados and the entire fleet of more than 50 Harriers is seen by the RAF as examples of what can go wrong when work is contracted to civilian companies . "It looks likely that we will have to cut out the fuselage centre sections of the older Tornado F2's and fit them into the F3's," said an RAF official. "But it may take several years, and these aeroplanes may never fly again. No RAF engineer would do what they did." It was alleged that hundreds of rivet-like fasteners were found to have been ripped out by inappropriate tools, damaging the pre-stressed metal skins of the aircraft. They were returned without comment to RAF fighter squadrons, where the condition was noticed by junior RAF engineers. The RAF says there is a vital need for the Service to have an independent engineering capability. Next month, however, the Ministry of Defence [MoD] is expected to announce the loss of about 4,000 RAF engineering jobs, the largest single area to be affected by the new Defence Costs Study. The study aims to reduce the defence budget by contracting more support work to cheaper civilians. RAF officials are worried that the cuts will drastically erode the Service's engineering ability, cut repair standards, lose its military reinforcement capability -- and could even cost aircrew lives. The most serious evidence of what can go wrong are 16 of the 18 Tornado F3's which, a year after they were allegedly damaged while being modified by Airwork Limited of Bournemouth, still await repair at RAF St Athan, Glamorgan, as the Ministry of Defence and the company argue about an estimated 30 million pound repair bill. A court case is expected. Airwork had won a 7 million pound contract to modify the airframes, undercutting British Aerospace [BAe], which had won an earlier F3 contract, by a substantial amount. The company has since been taken over by Short Bros of Belfast, with the exception of the Tornado contract, which stays with Bricom, now known as Securiam which was Airwork's parent company, according to a Shorts spokesman. Although 38 of Airwork's 40 MoD contracts have been done satisfactorily, according to Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Defence Procurement Minister, the company has been placed on an MoD contractors "special attention" list. This "reduces the chance of Airwork being awarded future MoD contracts," Mr Aitken wrote to Mr Rhodri Morgan, Labour MP for Cardiff West, last month. The Tornados are needed to be flyable in reserve, particularly as 24 Tornado F3's are to be leased to the Italian Air Force next year. Perhaps more importantly for the engineers at RAF St Athan, however, is the many thousands of hours' work they have had to do on all the new Harrier GR5's and GR7's. After one aircraft caught fire and crashed in Denmark in 1991, and another landed on fire at RAF Wittering, RAF engineers found a basic design problem with the Harrier's wiring. American-made Kapton wiring is used in almost all civilian airliners, but carbon arc tracking in wiring bundles in new U.S.-designed Harriers prompted the U.S. Marine Corps to replace the wiring with something else. That was not done, however, for the British-made Harrier GR5's and GR7's. Following the fires, RAF officials faulted poor wiring standards by British Aerospace, while BAe said it merely followed RAF specifications. The result, however, is that in a rolling programme every Harrier -- some with only 10 hours flying on them -- has had to be returned to BAe and to RAF St Athan to have the wiring replaced. Each aircraft has required about 4,000 hours of work. Within months, however the Harriers were brought back to St Athan, some after operations over northern Iraq, to have their tail sections strengthened because of stress caused by engine nozzles. This fault could not have been anticipated. The work, still going on, has involved about another 4,000 hours. For the RAF, the problems of such highly sophisticated aircraft require the highest standards of engineering care and that is why there are 17,885 engineering tradesmen in the newly-formed RAF Logistics Command. "There is a view that Third Line maintenance (major repair) is a luxury," said Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Alcock, head of Logistics Command, who concedes that housing costs and school fees help make RAF engineers 20 per cent more expensive than equally-qualified civilians. "But we have an ability to understand and repair all our own technology. We are an intelligent customer that manufacturers and civilian engineering companies can't easily fool."
