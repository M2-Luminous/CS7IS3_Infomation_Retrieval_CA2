['Urayqat] Thank you. [Al-Aswad] Dr. 'Urayqat, let us begin with the situation in the occupied territories. The occupied territories are simmering with tension as a result of the Israeli repression of the Palestinians. You live in the occupied territories; how do you assess the situation there? ['Urayqat] The situation is this: Since the terrorist attack in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque, massacres have occurred daily. The Israeli Army is using live ammunition against the Palestinians, leading to the deaths of dozens and the wounding of hundreds. It is a picture of daily carnage. A residential neighborhood in Hebron has been hit by 168 antitank rockets. The unjustified measures taken by the Israeli army are exacerbating the situation. A curfew is in force and all the occupied territories live under siege, all of which seriously undermine the economic, educational and health conditions. [Al-Aswad] Dr. 'Urayqat, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators speak of progress concerning the deployment of foreign observers and Palestinian police in Hebron and the occupied West Bank. Palestinian and Israeli negotiators, having held 14 hours of talks in Cairo, agreed to meet again on Tuesday [29 March] in an effort to reach a final agreement. How do you see this development? ['Urayqat] First of all, I would like to make this clear: The talks recently held in Tunisia and Cairo aimed to find a mechanism for implementing Resolution 904, particularly with regard to international protection for the Palestinian people. These talks do not involve negotiations with regard to the Gaza-Jericho or Oslo agreements. Second, with a view to the practical steps on the basic level, there are measures that still need to be taken. To focus on the Palestinian police and international presence but overlook the need to remove the settlers from the heart of Hebron will, in my opinion, complicate matters further. Efforts should now be focused on evacuating the settlers from the heart of Hebron because they create a flash point of tension and trouble. Looking back, it was the settlers who attacked Hebron University, killing four people; who set fire to shops; who rampaged through the city; and who harassed the population. I am afraid that deployment of Palestinian or even international forces while the status quo remains unchanged in Hebron will fail to resolve any problem. Israel should therefore take a major step by evacuating the Jewish settlers from the heart of Hebron. [Al-Asad] Dr. 'Urayqat, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin announced that it is possible to cut short the transitional period, which was supposed to last for five years. He said that the Israelis and Palestinians should start talking about a permanent settlement a few months after the Gaza-Jericho agreement is implemented. What do you think of this statement? ['Urayqat] Our position has always been that we should enter into the final phase of negotiations immediately. This has been the Palestinian position right from the beginning. As you know, conditions were imposed on us in Madrid and we were forced to enter into a transitional and then a final phase. As for Beilin's statement, let me be frank. Israel is speaking with too many tongues all at once: Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says one thing, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says another thing, Beilin comes up with a third view; and Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur expresses a fourth opinion, and so on and so forth. What the Israeli Government must do is turn the statement by the deputy foreign minister into official policy. It happened in the past that officials, other than the deputy foreign minister, made proposals that could have boosted the peace process, but the Israeli cabinet silenced them. I fear that Beilin's proposal will meet the same fate once it is brought before the Israeli cabinet. [Al-Aswad] Dr. 'Urayqat, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser Dr. Nabil Sha'th and [chief Israeli negotiator at the Cairo talks] Amnon Shahaq have announced that they agreed on a draft joint document which will be submitted to the Palestinian and Israeli leaders. Do you know anything about this agreement? ['Urayqat] I have no information about this document. What I wish to make clear is that the current talks in Cairo seek to find a mechanism to implement UN Security Council Resolution 904. They are not talks about the Gaza-Jericho plan or the Oslo agreement. I believe it is too early to speak of an agreement, even an initial one, because the Israeli Government remains intransigent on the basic issue of evacuating the settlers from Hebron. I personally believe that it is too early to make optimistic statements. [Al-Aswad] Do you think current Arab backing for the Palestinian negotiators is sufficient or adequate? What further backing are the Arabs required to offer to the Palestinian position? ['Urayqat] First of all, inter-Arab coordination is flawed, although this is not the time to speak of it. Two days ago, U.S. President Clinton made a statement about the status of Jerusalem. For this reason, on behalf of all Arabs and Palestinians, I urge all Arab leaders, notably Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, to send an urgent message to President Clinton asking him to clarify his position on the remarks attributed to him about Jerusalem. If it is true that Clinton said Jerusalem is Israel's eternal capital, then I believe that the Arab nation and Arab leaders should rally together and reassert their united position that there can be no peace without Jerusalem. We should keep in mind brother Abu-'Ammar's [Yasir 'Arafat] pronouncement that four red lines surround Jerusalem: an Arab line, a Muslim line, a Palestinian line, and a Christian line. The current peace process and the current events concern every Arab. At least, we hope that is so. This is not a purely Palestinian-Israeli affair. We are looking for total Arab coordination that will lay down strategic Arab guidelines for the bilateral and multilateral negotiations. We hope this will happen because what we do now will determine the region's fate for many years to come. This should concern every Arab from the Atlantic to the Gulf. [Al-Aswad] Dr. 'Urayqat, you referred to the U.S. President's position on Jerusalem. This position and the reports circulating about it have really provoked widespread Arab reaction. However, when correspondents representing the international media asked the U.S President about the substance of his remarks on the status of Jerusalem to the leaders of the U.S. Jewish lobby, he replied in these exact words: I told them what I also say publicly; namely, that the PLO-Israeli Declaration of Principles states that the fate of Jerusalem will be determined by the final status talks. What is your comment? ['Urayqat] Even this is a retraction of former U.S. positions. When we say that Jerusalem's final status will be determined by the negotiations, we mean both East and West Jerusalem and an ultimate decision on sovereignty over the city. Since 1967 the U.S. position has been that East Jerusalem is an integral part of the occupied territories. This situation continues. We would like the Arab leaders to send a message to President Clinton urging him to reiterate this U.S. position. Failing to reiterate this position constitutes a retraction in itself, a very serious matter. [Al-Aswad] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, thank you every much. ['Urayqat] You are welcome.
