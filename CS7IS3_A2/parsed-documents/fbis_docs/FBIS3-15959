Rybkin says he and his delegation of Russian parliament members had meetings with House Speaker Foley; Senators Mitchell, Dole, Pell, and Nunn; Defense Secretary Perry; Strobe Talbott; and "others." The final meeting was with President Clinton and Vice President Gore. Rybkin says that "breaks in contacts between the legislators of such large countries as the United States and Russia" are "inadmissible" and that the Washington visit "has shown that Russian and U.S. members of parliament alike shared this conviction." Replying to ITAR-TASS, Ivan Rybkin says he told the U.S. President and vice president and U.S. congressmen that a "qualitatively new situation was taking shape in Russia: Millions of property owners had appeared, some owning fortunes running into thousands of millions, others medium-size business people, and yet others owning small plots of land. That is why any rolling back of reforms and turning back is completely out of the question." He says that currently he sees the Duma "as the most reform-minded branch of power in Russia." "Its members are made up by three quarters of the former government; many came to it from the presidential structures and occupy key posts in the parliament. If you look at the factions, many of them changed their names, but among their members are bankers and commerce people, legal experts and farmers, and that is why, when we come to adopt the most important laws that will clear the obstacles on the path of reforms, things will be much easier for us than for the former Supreme Soviet. However, there must be an awareness that without civic consensus, without cooperation between authorities, we cannot move an inch further. Those who failed to understand it are now beginning to understand. Even here, reading TASS reports, I see how the positions of those who, for example, were opposed to the adoption of the memorandum on accord, are beginning to change." Rybkin speaks at the news conference about the importance of cooperation between executive, legislative, and judicial authorities in Russia and America, and says the intergovernmental commission chaired by Gore and Chernomyrdin would hold an exceptionally important meeting soon. During the news conference Rybkin is asked how he views speeches by certain members of the Duma who paint a catastrophic picture of life in Russia while on foreign trips. He says everybody is, of course, entitled to their point of view. However, he says, I have always called for restraint and said that the personal views of deputies should bear some relation to what the people who elected them are thinking. Maybe they should visit their constituencies more often and go on fewer foreign trips. Then everything would fall into its rightful place, he says. Rybkin is asked to comment on reports that the elections in Kazakhstan were marred by contraventions of the electoral rules and that this could give rise to serious problems. He says problems are cropping up along the entire length of our frontier, in areas where tens of millions of our fellow countrymen are living. However, he says, such problems should be resolved in a civilized way. If anyone tries to infringe people's rights, he will soon discover how much this will cost. Just look at those countries which tried to expel our fellow countrymen, he says. All their hi-tech industries have ground to a halt, and now they are turning to us once more for help. The rights of people living in various territories must be respected, irrespective of nationality, and these people must be represented on bodies of power in proportion to their numbers, he says. During the news conference, members of the delegation representing different factions expressed totally opposite views on the recent political amnesty for those involved in events of 1991 and 1993. In response to an ITAR-TASS correspondent question on whether the Russian delegation was united in its position at the talks with their U.S. counterparts or demonstrated similar differences of opinion, Rybkin says that whatever differences there are, if any, they are only over minor nuances. "On the principal issues in our life we were unanimous," he says. He concludes: "Our talks were precisely about the principal issues, the principles of Russia's relations with the United States. These principles have not changed. Their permanent feature is partnership and cooperation for the sake of peace and accord in the world, for the sake of the difficult reforms in Russia. We have agreed on many issues, worked out programs for cooperation and decided that mutual exchange of information should be full and frank so that there will be no rough patches in our relations, which usually appear when information is not complete."
