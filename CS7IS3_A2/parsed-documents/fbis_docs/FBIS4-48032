FBIS4-48032 "drafr090_d_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-090 Daily Report 9 May 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Mozambique Udemo Threatens War If Agreements Not Fulfilled Udemo Threatens War If Agreements Not Fulfilled MB0905185094 Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in Portuguese 1730 GMT 9 May 94 MB0905185094 Maputo Radio Mozambique Network Portuguese BFN [Report by correspondent Antonio Barros in Zambezia Province] [Text] If the agreements reached between the government and Gimo Phiri's Mozambique Democratic Union, Udemo, are not complied with, a new war could erupt in Mozambique at any time before elections are held in October of this year. That threat was made by Jose Frederico Goncalves, Udemo's national chief for organization and mobilization. The Udemo was formed in the wake of differences between Carlos Reis, president of the Mozambican National Union, Unamo, and Gimo Phiri at the congress which resulted in Unamo's creation. Gimo Phiri used to lead a force of some 2,000 men, who were subsequently confined to an assembly area in Milange. Some of those men have already been demobilized. Sources whom we have contacted have told us that all those men have been disarmed. Goncalves has told Radio Mozambique in Milange, Zambezia Province, that the promises made by the Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo, are a left-wing coalition [as heard] because they are not being observed. He also said that the leader of those former armed forces will only leave the jungle once he obtains all the conditions that have been granted the Mozambique National Resistance, Renamo, leader. Despite our reporter's insistence, the Udemo national chief for organization and mobilization did not give any details concerning the nature of the agreements reached with the government. He simply said that his organization had been promised transportation and premises. Political observers in Quelimane speculate that the government must have promised to confine and demobilize Gimo Phiri's forces, as well as to pay the salaries and subsidies to which all demobilized forces should be entitled. Gimo Phiri's forces are confined and are being demobilized in the same assembly area as the government forces in Milange. Goncalves said that Udemo is to become official and, depending on the government's response to the problem, it intends to participate in the elections scheduled for October. Meanwhile, contacts are continuing. That Udemo official also said that the Mozambican ambassador to Malawi has been liaising between the government and his movement which, according to him, has its headquarters in the Namuli mountains, in Zambezia Province's Gurue District.
