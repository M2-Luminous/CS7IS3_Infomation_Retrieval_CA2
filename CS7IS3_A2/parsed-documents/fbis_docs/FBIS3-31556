[Begin Izetbegovic recording] I believe this is a great victory for us. Perhaps it is not a completely clear victory, it is not faultless, some things have spoiled our joy a bit. But it still remains our victory for we are not being killed any more. You can let your children skate freely, they can go to school, you can go to the market without fear that someone will not return home. This is a great achievement after 22 or 23 months of misery. This is not their victory, as they want to present it. They have even convinced themselves, 500 or 600 years ago when they lost their state [in 1389, the Serbs were defeated by the Turks in the Kosovo battle] that that was their victory, and not a defeat. This is their clear defeat. For eight days they had been hesitating to withdraw their weapons, they were making up some kinds of reasons, from categorical refusing to different pretexts -- snow, adverse weather conditions, and so on. In two days only they were forced to take to a headlong flight, leaving behind weaponry in their retreat. Do not let yourselves be convinced that this is a victory for them as they are now trying to convince themselves in those hills up there. They left behind -- handed in -- 262 pieces of heavy weaponry, including 36 tanks and armored vehicles. I think that this is our victory and a first step, first in a series of good things that are going to happen to this city. Electricity and water supply will be better, food supplies will be better, convoys carrying food and medicines will enter more safely, a kind of spring is coming. Therefore, please celebrate this victory and do not be afraid any longer. Of course, we are not going to allow the city to be divided. We must not be afraid of that either. This is a political solution. They are no longer there with their tanks and their guns above our heads.
