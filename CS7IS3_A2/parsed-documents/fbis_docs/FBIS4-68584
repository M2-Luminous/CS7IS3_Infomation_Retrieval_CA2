Yevgenyev; date and place not given: "If Inflation Can Be Kept in Check, Major Capital Will Move Toward Us. So Russian Federation Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin Believes"] [Text] ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's guest "this Wednesday" is acting Russian Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin. For three months he has headed a department which has found itself by the will of fate at the epicenter of Russian economic reform. He is 43. He is a doctor of economic sciences. While paying tribute to his competence experts noted on his appointment that, unlike the uncompromising Fedorov, he is a softer person. We would add, however, that Dubinin does not yet seem to have provided any reason to remember that parallel. Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Aleksashenko also took part in our talk. [Yevgenyev] Sergey Konstantinovich, what is happening with the 1994 draft budget? It had great difficult and incredible adventures in passing its first reading in the state Duma. [Dubinin] We had not expected everything to be sweetness and light. We had assumed that the debate would be fierce. It is not a question of some personal failings or shortcomings. It is all more complicated than that. Any budget reflects a certain economic policy. It cannot exist outside one. But it was not hard to predict that the current economic policy would meet with plenty of opponents in different parties and factions in the lower house and that they would use the debate on the budget to overthrow the proposed strategy. In principle this is normal. [Yevgenyev] How have the regions and ministries assessed the draft? [Dubinin] We have done a lot of work with both of them. We tried out different options and came back again to our initial positions. In general the budget was drawn up under a new classification that is as close as possible to international standards. IMF recommendations have been taken into account. We included a great many things that were not previously in the budget -- for instance, the cost of shipping goods to the Far North. In our view, the budget is realistic. This is why sectors have mainly been dissatisfied about what they received -- they had all asked for more. But it is quite difficult to fundamentally change the budget structure within existing resources. And going beyond those limits would mean going in for fantasies. [Yevgenyev] The Finance Ministry is being rebuked for overstating the revenue side of the budget. [Dubinin] Until we have actually collected the cash, the arguments about the revenue side are merely estimates. Nonetheless, I do not think that we have gone overboard. We calculated it as follows: Last year on average we collected 10 percent of Russia's GDP in tax for the budget. This year, if we keep to the previous structure and collect what we plan to additionally mobilize for the federal budget, we plan to bring in 10.6 percent. As you can see, that is a small difference. Future growth -- up to almost 16 percent -- will be powered by the proceeds of the 3-percent increase in value-added tax, better collection of excise duties, and so forth. I think that by the year's end we will be able to achieve the indicator set out in the budget. Problems have come from the least-expected quarter. And, strangely enough, they are connected with the victory in the fight against inflation. You know, inflation fell to 10 percent in February and to 8.5 percent in March. It will be in that ballpark in April as well. This means that nominal growth in gross product, income, and all the rest will be slower than envisaged by the budget. Consequently the tax base will also grow more slowly than planned. But just try to convince the recipients of budget funds that they will now have to make do with less than was stated in the budget. [Yevgenyev] Gaydar and Fedorov stated that the spending in January-February would lead to a new surge of inflation in April. But you are claiming that April will be as quiet as March. How do you explain that? [Dubinin] By the fact that there was no dramatic expenditure in January-February. We did not allow it. [Yevgenyev] What about March? [Dubinin] Not in March either. [Yevgenyev] So, what about the debts? [Dubinin] What debts? The budget debts? We have already paid off those debts which the government has recognized by concluding contracts at different times -- and they come to more than 4.5 trillion rubles [R]. We are planning to repay another R1 trillion with treasury bills. But there have been a lot of wrongheaded interpretations, mutual misunderstandings, and confusion in this area. For instance, people are saying that we are not giving the Army its extra pay. When the decision was made in December to index the pay of workers in the budget-funded sphere, the Finance Ministry warned that the money for these payments was not there. We were not listened to. Consequently, when the time came to pay up, we told the Army leaders that we would not be increasing their salaries. Naturally people disagreed with this, and they believe that they are regularly failing to receive their extra pay -- that in February they received their pay for January, that in March they received their pay for February, and so forth. In other words, we have created problems for ourselves, with our own hands. If we are unable to pay, we should not take on commitments. That is why we insisted that the minimum wage and bands in the unified pay scale not be indexed in the second quarter. There are no funds for this in the budget. [Yevgenyev] But the countryside has gotten enough for its soup and porridge. [Dubinin] This is the way things have gone with the countryside. We had just one commitment to them -- for grain. It was not immediately released onto the free market, as would have been logical, given the good harvest; instead it was decided to sell it at high fixed prices, indexing those prices into the bargain. And only to deregulate prices as of 1 October. The Finance Ministry again lodged a protest, since elementary calculations showed that we would simply be unable to finance such expensive grain. As a result, we had to spend an extra R1.5 trillion. It can be said that the entire loan received from the IMF last year was spent on grain purchases. Then what happened? "Roskhlebprodukt" received this money as a budget subsidy. They mobilized the grain, delivered it, and are storing it in silos, having partially paid for it, partially pledged to take care of it, and partially accepted, as it were, state funds without repaying them. By their reckoning, the R1.5 trillion already allocated is no longer sufficient. Then we told them -- "release the grain, release it. It will be used for flour, the flour will be used for bread, and the profits will make their way back to you. And you can pay off your creditors." For some reason they are unable to resolve this issue. The money that the population has paid for the grain is not being repaid by the grain-owners. And if the grain is released, it will be at the price at which it was procured. And they will again demand budget funds for new purchases in the spring -- that is, funds from taxpayers like you and me. What does this mean in the context of inflation? It means that they are eating up the circulating capital that was issued to them -- in other words, they are not acting in a market-driven fashion at all. And the Finance Ministry should provide compensation for all this. The following things happened next. "Roskhleboprodukt" recast the terms of the contract for grain accepted for responsible storage, declaring it to have been bought. And we are being presented with the bill: There is still some grain that has not been paid for. That is how we are living -- eating up circulating capital and forgetting what a free market is. Mired in endless debts that we cannot hope to repay. And nobody is particularly worried about it. They say that the Finance Ministry will fund it. You even find some strange things happening. The Commission for Urgent Questions is examining the sowing situation. Who do you think the report writer will be? The Finance Ministry. The Ministry of Agriculture and Food has probably solved all its problems; only the Finance Ministry is failing to pull its weight. [Yevgenyev] So do you still owe "Roskhleboprodukt" anything? [Dubinin] Yes, we have agreed to allocate it another R200 billion from the budget. This is over and above the aforesaid R1.5 trillion. But "Roskhleboprodukt" will receive the funds in the form of bonds which it can sell as securities. The bonds will come into circulation this spring, and they can be sold on the market to raise R200 billion. And that, clearly, will settle the issue of the 1993 underpayment. That weight will be lifted from our backs. But the problem will remain. Because it is not clear how we can continue to work under such a system. [Yevgenyev] No matter what we do, we seem to come off badly. There is not enough money for anything. At the same time, $15-20 billion is finding its way into Western banks each year. Doesn't that worry you? Or have you gotten used to it? [Dubinin] It does worry me. But what are you proposing? There is a system of licensing the export of foreign exchange resources and their placement abroad. We have the Federal Service for Currency and Export Controls, which is designed to monitor these processes and hunt down criminals. Virtually everything possible in the way of administrative bans has been done. But until it becomes more profitable to import than to export capital, we will not be able to reverse these currency flows. [Yevgenyev] But surely it is beneficial to keep foreign currency in Russian deposit accounts? Nobody anywhere in the world will give you 36 percent annual interest the way we will. [Dubinin] Well, suppose for a minute that you are a businessman. You have earned $1 million. What are you going to do with it here? Putting it in the bank at 36 percent is boring and not without risk either. It is impossible to acquire any real property. Our well-known "Lukoil" company is buying a network of retail stores in Turkey. Why not in Russia? We have no network. We just have one store, and then another, and another.... And it is tiresome to have to buy up trade outlets one by one. When every Russian has the opportunity to open a store in Russia, when they can acquire everything they need, that is when capital will work here as well, rather than just in Germany and Switzerland. Apart from its well-known advantages, voucher privatization also has some disadvantages. Virtually the biggest of these is that you cannot acquire anything for your money. Practically every bank in Moscow is housed in rented premises. They cannot even buy their own offices. Where else can you find a situation like that? [Dubinin ends] S. Aleksashenko entered the conversation: [Aleksashenko] I agree, we are experiencing major outflows of capital. But, strangely enough, since the middle of last year there has also been an inflow of capital -- but in a concealed, cash form which is hard to register. When money passes through bank accounts everything is clear, but when dollars in cash are brought into Russia by the suitcase, it is hard to keep track of them. Nonetheless, according to Central Bank estimates, such capital imports amounted to $5-7 billion last year. [Yevgenyev] Is this a reaction to that 36 percent? [From this point on the identity of the respondent is unclear] [Interviewee] The way I see it is this -- the hottest, riskiest capital has already come here. It is important that it does not expand the realm of the criminal, black economy, but that it should work in an entirely civilized and open manner. Post-voucher privatization will provide the conditions for this to be possible. And if inflation is kept in check, major investment will soon be heading Russia's way. [Yevgenyev] But what is happening? There has been a squeeze on inflation, and production is literally on its last legs. Can't you see the connection? [Interviewee] There is a connection, of course. Any country bearing down on high inflation is forced to pay the price in the form of a recession. We are into our second attempt in the space of less than two and a half years of reform to really get inflation down. We tried first in mid-1992. And we are trying again now. Each time falling inflation is accompanied by recession. Even if we start providing incentives for production, this will not mean that production will invariably take off again. We could see the same scenario as in the fall of 1992, when production stabilized for three or four months at its previous low level. Or things could be even worse -- production could continue falling quietly and, by supporting industry, we would find ourselves stoking inflation yet again. And that would be no joke. Calculations have been done -- they show that in order to halt the production slump we would need to pump money into the system to such an extent that inflation would rise to 50 percent a month. At any point our weary population might say that it had had enough of prices rising every day and demand that we lower them. We would again start bearing down on inflation. And we would again pay for it with recession. If we go up and down this switchback for another couple of years, will there be anything left of production at all? The classic recipe for economic stabilization is to squeeze inflation out of the system once and quickly. And to suffer just one recession. [Yevgenyev] Is something of the sort possible in this country? [Interviewee] Theoretically, yes. We could conquer inflation in the space of a single quarter. For instance, we could get it down to 3 percent a month. There are some quite well-known instances of that around. To begin with, we should not borrow money from the Central Bank. But many enterprises would then be unable to adapt to a reality that would be new to them. A large slice of the economy would simply be destroyed. That is why we are forced to move gradually to 10-, 8-, and then 7-percent inflation. In order to give industry time to reorient itself and do something. But I would note that many directors are hoping for something else. They are traipsing around the Finance Ministry, the Council of Ministers, and the Kremlin asking for handouts. I can say quite categorically that their enterprises are doomed. They will not last long. One such famous director recently told me that he had twice been reprimanded by the Politburo for not boosting production of combine harvesters. They had wanted to remove him for his slow pace of construction. Today he has everything he needs -- workers, components, and materials. But he cannot sell the harvesters. He wanted R200 billion to somehow survive until such time as they can be sold once again. [Yevgenyev] Well, that was "Rosselmash." [Interviewee] This is the kind of logic they have. "You do your experiments there and carry out your reforms. And let me quietly sit out all this commotion." Of course, we could mothball a plant in that way and hold out until the historic time when the economy comes good. But if our entire industry has to wait for everything to change of its own accord, without changing anything itself, then we will all find ourselves in the kind of dead-end that the AZLK [Moscow Leninist Komsomol Automobile Plant] and ZIL [Likhachev Automobile Plant] plants are currently in. [Yevgenyev] Flotation has done them no good. They were floated, but now they are saying: "Pay us." [Interviewee] And if you total up what the ZIL Plant is asking for it comes to R1 trillion. Quite often of late I have received administration heads from quite wealthy oblasts asking for help of any kind. Their oil refineries have ground to a halt -- the products are so expensive that nobody is buying them. We advise them to lower their prices -- for both gasoline and other petroleum products. My visitors' eyes would come out on stalks -- "How can that be done when everything is getting more expensive?" But we are in the marketplace. The thinking is as follows -- since there is a market, let prices go through the roof. What is happening with grain, for instance? Our peasants' wages are 1 percent of world wages, our fuel is 30 percent of the world price, our equipment is 20-50 percent of the world price, but we produce grain at the world price. And sausages and milk too. Food prices in any store are at world levels. And if you make allowances for our very mediocre quality, then we are actually paying more. Nonetheless, demand constraints are starting to kick in. Two oil extraction companies -- "Lukoil" and "Yukos" -- recently announced that they had frozen their prices for the whole quarter. [Yevgenyev] Do you not think that these enterprises need to be encouraged in some way? [Interviewee] Such as? Presenting them with a red banner or scroll of honor? They have provided their own incentive -- their output is being bought and paid for. Incidentally, prior to this our oilmen had given us no peace for six months in their demands for subsidies. Throughout this period a package of 18 documents, each worth between R300 billion and R1 trillion, was circulating among government members. People tried to wheedle official stamps out of them. Thank God, they stood firm. That is why the Finance Ministry did not give out the money, and why the demand constraints have started working. Now we will see what happens next. I think that our oil industry will live normally if it learns the rules of the market. [Yevgenyev] But there are natural monopolies -- railroads, electricity, gas. What about them? [Interviewee] In those areas we cannot do without a system of state regulation. From my standpoint, nobody exploits their monopoly position as shamelessly as the power generation people at the "YEES Rossii" [Russian Integrated Power Grid] Russian Joint-Stock Company. When they charge one rate in one oblast and another rate bigger by an order of magnitude in another oblast, what do you call that? That sort of thing does not happen in any country anywhere. And they will not accept the cheapest power from nuclear stations onto their grid for fear of spoiling their indicators. [Yevgenyev] Nuclear power workers recently picketed the White House. Was that related to the behavior of the Integrated Power Grid? [Interviewee] Undoubtedly. This situation was largely brought about artificially. In this connection I would like to say the following. Yes, our miners have been in a difficult position, and that is now true of the military. But trillions of rubles pass through their hands. They have the funds to give themselves room for maneuver. Why is it that people will seemingly forget about one place somewhere? Wages will not have been paid there for five months, people will have been pushed to the limit, to the point of starvation. I suspect that these sources of extreme tension are created with a purpose. Then everyone suddenly seems to remember about them. The press and television suddenly descend and show us the starving. The "background to the disease" begins to be teased out. And this is used to get money for the entire sector. You will note that these situations are reproduced systematically. It seems to me that we are dealing with a kind of blackmail, to which both the government and society are subjected. And all of us have to pay. For instance, to fend off the miners' discontent, we gave them R2 trillion that had been earmarked for increasing wage bands in the second quarter. This means that we are robbing Peter to pay Paul. [Yevgenyev] We need to close mines that have no future. [Interviewee] Yes, we do. Although that costs money too. Nonetheless, last year the coal industry was planning to find R40 billion and close just one mine -- at Khalmer-Yu. It did not find the money and did not close the pit. It has been given R2 trillion this year, yet there is still no money to spare for the closure. The pit is located inside the Arctic Circle, where mining anything is senseless, and the coal quality is as bad as it gets. I fear that the rumor that 10 pits will close in the first half of the year will remain a rumor. Miners already know from experience that they can overspend, present the government with an ultimatum, and get what they want. Even at somebody else's expense. [Yevgenyev] But few people know about this. Why are facts of this sort not made public? Why is information not regularly published on pay, the number of working days in the year, and on the leave for workers in different sectors? [Interviewee] We need to do that in depth. And, clearly, not only on an intersectoral basis. For instance, take a major enterprise maintained by injections of state funds and look at its spending structure -- how much the director earns, how much the engineers and workers earn, whether the soccer team is funded, whether dividends are paid on the shares, and what kind of social costs there are. This detailed analysis should be carried out at a micro-level so as to provide a clear and accurate picture. You are probably right. This would be instructive to many people. I promise to think about it.
