The results of the February 1990 elections showed that the social and grass-roots movement had entered a phase marked by the retreat of the mass movement. They also showed that the traditionally impoverished sectors and the middle class that had grown poor during the last half of the 1980's voted for change. Four years after the elections, however, poverty has worsened and the retreat of the social movement has intensified. One of the major accomplishments of the Chamorro government is that despite the worsening of almost all social indicators, a new period marked by the rise of the grass-roots movement has not begun. The political and economic initiative remains in the hands of those who are pushing the counterreform. Leadership and Strategy 2. Since the day after its defeat the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] has been immersed in a necessary internal debate on the tactics and strategy to be followed during the current stage of stagnation and retreat for the grass-roots movement. All factions are worried about the future of the FSLN: how to regain the political ground that it has lost and how to develop the best tactics to regain power in the 1996 elections. The crux of the disagreement is how to reassemble the political forces that became scattered after the 1990 electoral defeat into a government alternative in 1996. 3. The social and grass-roots resistance to the policies of the "neoliberal" government has been spontaneous, isolated, circumstantial, without long-term political organization and guidance. The FSLN's political leadership has been unable to begin an internal debate that would help formulate a strategy that can coordinate and combine the various pockets of social resistance and, at the same time, place them properly in the current correlation of political forces. A tactic must be urgently implemented to preserve the political, social, and economic clout of the progressive forces so that they can retake the political and social initiative and overcome current limitations. This means changing styles of leadership, which can be achieved only by making substantial changes in the current political leadership. Impoverishment and the FSLN 4. The lack of a clear FSLN strategy and the frustration of most people over the Chamorro government's failure to keep any of its campaign promises have been and may remain the breeding ground for the risky, spontaneous actions of the masses. They could also turn major segments of the population into the social base of the far right, which speaks the language of populism. We must remember the example of the PLC [Constitutionalist Liberal Party] in the Atlantic Coast elections in February 1994 and the Italian elections in March 1994. Moreover, the increased poverty among the population does not necessarily benefit the FSLN; rather, it could lead to "political apathy among major segments of the people" or become a "spearhead" for Nicaragua's far right. In order to prevent the right from capitalizing on the population's current discontent, there must be a shakeup in the FSLN leadership. The victory of the left-wing forces favoring "democratic socialism" in Poland in the October 1993 elections was based on cutting ties to the past, maintaining discipline in the party, backing reforms to establish a flourishing economy, and reassuring voters that the party is a stable and revamped political force. 5. The strategic defeat of "real socialism," which was heavily influenced by the Stalinist political model, has ceased to be the political reference point for many FSLN activists; this has made possible the natural emergence of various factions within it. [23 Apr p 7] [Text] 6. We find three schools of thought in the FSLN, although they are embodied in just two organized factions: a) Those who think that all is lost and who are feverishly seeking any way to join with the people who won the 1990 elections. They have forsaken the struggle for "democratic socialism" and, influenced by the retreat of the grassroots movement, feel that the FSLN will not regain power through elections. Owing to these factors and to opportunism, they have decided that now is the time to switch sides so that they can enjoy cushy jobs under the current government or a future one. b) Those who think that in spite of the defeat of "real socialism" nothing has changed. They adhere to "orthodox" and "rigid" positions regarding their methods of struggle and feel that the status quo in the FSLN political leadership must be maintained at all costs. The leaders of this faction confuse short-run successes with strategic victories and replace an analysis of the real world with political rhetoric from the era of the struggle against the Somoza dictatorship or with the language that was used during the revolution, which a majority of the population rejected in the 1990 elections. c) Those of us who acknowledge defeat are engaged in intensive self-criticism and are working to develop specific tactics that will enable us to set immediate new political goals that must be redefined in a wide-ranging, open discussion inside the FSLN. This does not mean abandoning the struggle for a more just society or setting aside the grievances about which broad segments of the population feel most strongly. We simply feel that the FSLN must tailor its tactics to the political circumstances in which we find ourselves, and this means a shakeup if we want to return to power in 1996. 7. Because of the lack of an incisive, serious discussion and owing to the preservation of the status quo in the FSLN leadership at the 1991 Congress, we have lost the political initiative and failed to delve more deeply into the meaning of the strategic defeat in 1990. It is precisely because no political changes have been made in the FSLN leadership that an in-depth analysis of the current situation and of the role that the FSLN ought to be playing is not being conducted. 8. Some mid- and upper-level leaders have not openly accepted the failure of the Sandinist agenda in its version for the 1990's. They want to preserve anachronistic language and leaders; they refuse to accept that they do not represent the best chance for the FSLN to recapture the vote of the people. Criteria for Renewal 9. There are two major requirements that the FSLN must fulfill in order to present a new face to the majority of the people, and both can be met at the next Special Congress: a) Most of the members of the FSLN's next political leadership must come from the rank and file. In other words, only half of the political leadership ought to be members of the current National Directorate and National Assembly. We cannot talk about a political renewal if we merely propose a rotation of the personnel who were responsible directly or indirectly for the defeat in 1990. We are not in favor of a purge either. Some degree of historic continuity must be preserved in the FSLN, combining experience with input from new leaders who can spur new solutions and alternatives. b) The Special Congress has a responsibility to elect not just a new and different political leadership but also a leadership that is not linked to the "pinata." We cannot promote a political renewal unless it is accompanied by an ethical and moral renewal. In other words, the new leadership cadres of the FSLN must emerge from the rank and file and not be linked to the "pinata." Unless these two minimum conditions are met, we will be jeopardizing any possibility of winning the 1996 election. 10. We must keep a cool head and not meddle in problems or involve ourselves in unnecessary political commotion. What we are proposing is a rejection of economic, political, and social improvisation. We must become standard-bearers of the policy that the privatizations must be transparent and we must call for the monitoring of CORNAP [National Corporation of the Public Sector] sales. We must aspire to once again become the moral conscience of the people. 11. Sandinism needs to rejuvenate itself, to become viable and credible. The poor need a new hope free from the stumbling blocks of the past and with a new, consistent, rectifying leadership that does not renounce its principles but is instead able to harness the mistakes of the right wing and the government in order to build a new social consensus with the people.
