He spoke at an official dinner given in his honor by the Spanish King Juan Carlos I, in the Palacio de Oriente. According to the Russian leader, the present visit "will become a turning point in the history of relations between the two countries." Prospects for the stable development of Russian-Spanish cooperation, which is a long-term one and is not affected by political considerations, are becoming clearer. Boris Yeltsin noted that a treaty on friendship and cooperation between Russia and Spain, which will be signed in Madrid on 12 April, will become the legal basis for this new stage in bilateral cooperation. This fundamental document "will open wide horizons for interaction between our countries in various spheres." For a long time the peoples of Russia and Spain were forced to live under systems of dictatorial state power that were hostile to each other. Numerous obstacles and bans were put on the path toward mutual rapprochement. "The Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation is the result of the triumph of democracy both in Russia and Spain," the president said. In his opinion, the unique experience that allowed Spain to be transformed into a stable, law-based, democratic state with a developed economy is very valuable for Russia. Now Spain is integrated into the European system. It plays a noticeable role in the European processes and occupies a worthy place in the world community. He welcomed the involvement and active role of Madrid in international affairs and expressed readiness to join efforts in order to "jointly take part in tackling difficult international problems." Boris Yeltsin stressed that the new Russia is becoming a full-fledged member of the community of democratic states. "We want," he continued, "this process to meet our national interests and the goals of building a new order based on mature strategic partnership to a greater degree." Having noted the difficulty of Russia's integration into world economic relations, the president stressed that this process will require "mutual adaptation -- a political, economic, and psychological one. We count on the fact that leaders in the West have the political courage to do what is necessary to resolve this." A mutually beneficial dialogue between the leadership of Russia and Spain on most topical issues of modern times has become traditional, the head of the Russian state said. He expressed confidence that the establishment of a direct line of communications between the Kremlin and the Moncloa Palace -- an agreement on which was signed today by the foreign ministers of the two countries -- will allow it to be given a greater sense of urgency and regularity. "We will be able to cooperate more closely and constructively in the sphere of international relations, both in building a peaceful, unified, democratic Europe and in establishing a new world order." Boris Yeltsin reported that a grand monument to Columbus, "which will be soon erected in Seville according to a design by our sculptor Tsereteliy," will be a sign that Russia recognizes Spain's eternal contribution toward the formation of a modern civilization.
