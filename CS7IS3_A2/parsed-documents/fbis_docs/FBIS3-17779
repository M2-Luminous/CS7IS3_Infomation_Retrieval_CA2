Meeting journalists after the ceremony of signing Russian-Kazakh bilateral agreements in the Kremlin on Monday, Yeltsin described the visit as "the first and very important official visit by the head of the Republic of Kazakhstan to Russia." Yeltsin said Russia and Kazakhstan signed a record number of bilateral agreements. The prime ministers of the two countries and Russian and Kazakh governmental delegations signed a total of 23 bilateral agreements, including on political, economic and military cooperation. "Russia and Kazakhstan already have the basis of bilateral relations, namely the bilateral treaty of friendship and cooperation," he continued. "But this document needs to be developed and expanded." The Russian leader said that all the documents had been prepared thoroughly and long. The agreement on the Baykonur cosmodrome had been ironed out for nearly a year. Nazarbayev stressed that his visit "sweeps away all talks and rumours about Russia's imperial activity." Both sides had "overcome all difficulties," he added. Commenting on the agreement on Baykonur, Nazarbayev replied that the Kazakh side "understands how important Baykonur is for Russia now," added that "Kazakhstan did not want to keep it in its pocket." Yeltsin noted that the "difficulties which emerged in this issue were connected not with the political aspect, but mostly with the technical and economic one." The president explained that the latter concerned primarily technical and economic support for the people living in the city of Leninsk and servicing the cosmodrome. Under the agreement, Kazakhstan will lease the cosmodrome to Russia for 20 years with further prolongation of the term for another ten years. Russia will pay 115 million U.S. dollars to Kazakhstan annually in lease payments. The agreement also considers Baykonur Russian territory for the duration of the lease period where all Russian laws will have equal force as in the rest of Russia. The two presidents also signed an agreement on the development of economic cooperation and integration, a memorandum of the basic principles of resolving issues concerning the civil and legal status of citizens of Kazakhstan living in Russia and Russian citizens residing in Kazakhstan, an agreement on military cooperation and an agreement on strategic nuclear forces temporarily stationed in Kazakhstan.
