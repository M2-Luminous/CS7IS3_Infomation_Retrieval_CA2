This is the reaction by a high-ranking officer at the NATO air force base in Geilenkirchen at the German-Dutch border to the question about experiences regarding flights by the NATO reconnaissance planes over Austria. However, he also stresses that cooperation with the Austrian authorities basically works well on this matter. NATO's request to Austria for simpler permits has, however, practically no chance of being approved until the elections, in the view of Vienna government circles, because giving up the duty to request permits for every single overflight would presuppose an amendment to the law. The respective regulations are contained in the Aviation Law and the Decree on Flights Across the Borders. An amendment to the law, however, would give rise to a discussion about neutrality, which is not desired by the Austrian Government. Since 12 April 1993 NATO has been monitoring the no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina on the order of the United Nations and, for this purpose, it had flown more than 10,600 missions by 24 January. One main element of this airspace monitoring is NATO's early warning fleet, which consists of 18 planes of the E-3A type. The main base of the AWACS planes (AWACS stands for Airborne Warning and Control System) for the Bosnian missions is the NATO base in Geilenkirchen as well as the external landing sites of Preveza in Greece and Trapani in Italy. If the AWACS planes take off from Geilenkirchen for one of their Bosnian monitoring missions, which take place at great height over the Adriatic and Hungary, the flight across Austria is the shortest route. Even though Vienna has given permission for the NATO overflights, which take place at the order of the United Nations, every single flight must be approved by the Austrian authorities. According to NATO officers in Geilenkirchen, this applies to two routine flights per day plus special daily flights. The individual permit for each of these overflights to be given by Vienna is applied for by Luxembourg, where the AWACS planes are registered. This becomes particularly complicated in the case of special flights for emergencies. In order to circumvent this bureaucratic procedure, NATO therefore wants a general overflight permit from Austria. In contrast to Vienna, the Swiss Government (Federal Council) has given such a general permit for half a year for the time being. Bern justifies this with the principle of solidarity with the peace-loving international community, which does not contradict neutrality. The UN mission in the former Yugoslavia is not a martial act but a police action by the international community, Bern argues. The NATO air force offices in Geilenkirchen hope that Austria, too, will adopt this view and make their missions for monitoring the Bosnian airspace easier by means of a "global permit." Concerning the second Austrian demand, that the AWACS planes must switch off their military radar equipment during the overflight, they say succinctly: "This is no problem for us."
