Valeriy Zorkin made the statement Friday in an interview with Interfax. After other leaders of the Movement discuss the proposals they may be part of the Movement's program. Zorkin sees as the main task the restoration of the power's efficiency. With this aim in view he proposed to create a state council out of representatives of influential political forces. Is it worth to put cardinal transformations to the will on one person even if he is elected by the people because he has no team of professionals enjoying the people's confidence? asks the judge. A state council could coordinate important decisions taken by the executive power. This body could bear responsibility before the people for the measures taken, believes Zorkin. The draft document outlines the main principles for the country's pulling out of the economic crisis which are based on the proposals by Sergei Glazyev and other economists. Zorkin is sure that it is necessary to regulate prices for the time being on key price-forming goods, to effect state control over prices for electricity, oil, communal services, bread, milk, butter and sugar. There is need to reform the taxation system to lower the tax burden for current incomes. Also important is to stop the crime tide, said Zorkin. He proposed to create an anti-mafia structure, a standing body of cooperation between the executive and legislative branches of power to combat power abuse and organized crime, including in the sphere of state government. It would be worthwhile to adopt for three-five years amendments to the Criminal Code toughening punishment for crimes against individuals, said the judge. He believes that army units should operate in areas with the unfavorable criminal situation. Zorkin proposed to introduce amendments into the Law on the State of Emergency which would permit impose a special rule in such areas.
