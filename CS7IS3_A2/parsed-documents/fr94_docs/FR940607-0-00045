FR940607-0-00045 FR940607-0-00016 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Research and Special Programs Administration 49 CFR Part 195 [Docket No. PS&hyph;121; Amdt. 195&hyph;51] RIN 2137&hyph;AB 46 Pressure Testing Older Hazardous Liquid and Carbon Dioxide Pipelines AGENCY: Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule provides that operators may not transport a hazardous liquid in a steel interstate pipeline constructed before January 8, 1971, a steel interstate offshore gathering line constructed before August 1, 1977, or a steel intrastate pipeline constructed before October 21, 1985, unless the pipeline has been pressure tested hydrostatically according to current standards or operates at 80 percent or less of a qualified prior test or operating pressure. In addition, this final rule creates a comparable requirement for carbon dioxide pipelines constructed before July 12, 1991, except for production field distribution lines in rural areas. The purpose of this final rule is to ensure that the affected pipelines have an adequate safety margin between their maximum operating pressure and test pressure. This safety margin is essential to prevention of particular kinds of pipeline accidents. EFFECTIVE DATES: The changes to part 195, except ยง195.306(b), take effect July 7, 1994. The final rule under ยง195.306(b) takes effect August 8, 1994, unless RSPA receives, by July 7, 1994, comments that illustrate that disallowing the use of petroleum as a test medium for pressure testing required by this rulemaking is not in the public interest. Upon receipt of such comments, RSPA will publish a document in the Federal Register withdrawing the final rule under ยง195.306(b). ADDRESSES: Written comments must be submitted in duplicate and mailed or hand-delivered to the Dockets Unit, room 8421, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590&hyph;0001. Identify the docket and amendment number stated in the heading of this notice. Comments will become part of this docket and will be available for inspection or copying in room 8421 between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. each business day. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: L. M. Furrow, (202) 366&hyph;2392, regarding the subject matter of this final rule document, or Dockets Unit (202) 366&hyph;4453, for copies of this final rule document or other material in the docket. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Any steel pipeline may contain hidden physical defects that result from the manufacture or transportation of pipe and from pipeline construction. Over the operational life of the pipeline, new physical defects can be created by external forces acting on the pipeline. When a physical defect is large enough, it can cause the pipeline to fail during operation. Also, during pipeline operation, internal or environmental stresses can cause smaller defects to grow and become large enough to cause the pipeline to fail. Adequate pressure testing can disclose hidden physical defects in a pipeline. Pressure testing involves raising a pipeline's internal pressure above its maximum operating pressure (MOP) for a time sufficient for leaks to develop from defects. A test that is adequate in pressure level and duration will disclose physical defects that are large enough to cause pipeline failure during operation. In addition, an adequate pressure test will provide a proven margin of safety against failure during operation from the growth of defects.
