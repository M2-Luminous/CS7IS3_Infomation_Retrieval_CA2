FBIS4-3243 "drchi075_v_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 TAIWAN U.S. Electronics Group Wins Satellite Contract U.S. Electronics Group Wins Satellite Contract OW1904083194 Taipei CNA in English 0731 GMT 19 Apr 94 OW1904083194 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Debbie Kuo] [Text] Taipei, April 19 (CNA) -- The U.S.-based TRW Space and Electronics Group Monday [18 April] was awarded a contract to build the ROCSAT-1, Taiwan's first satellite for scientific research and communications scheduled to be launched at the end of 1997. The contract was signed by Hu Ching-Piao, vice chairman of the National Science Council (NSC) and Bruce Gerding, vice president of the civil and international systems division of TRW Space and Electronics Group. The ROCSAT-1, carrying a price tag of NT$ [New Taiwan dollars] 1.6 billion (U.S.$59.26 million), is the first of a series of planned procurements for the development of Taiwan's space system capabilities, Hu said. The NSC and TRW also agreed that the contract will become void if TRW fails to acquire an export license from the U.S. Government within 60 days, Hu said. As technology acquisition is a predominant factor in international procurements, Hu said, a technology assistance agreement (TAA) is integral to the ROCSAT-1 contract. TAA's are necessary for the export of high technologies from the U.S. Officials of the Redondo Beach, California-based TRW said they are confident they will receive the TAA in three to five weeks. Once the TAA is secured, the NSC's national space program office will send 24 engineers to TRW to participate in the design, development, manufacture and testing of the satellite, a space program official said. The NSC began the ROCSAT-1 procurement project in December 1993. Four foreign companies, including France's Matra Marconi -- a group comprising French and Israeli aircraft industries -- Germany's Dornier, France's Alcatel, and TRW submitted bid proposals. Under a NT$13.6 billion (U.S.$509 million) space program, Taiwan plans to have three satellites in orbit by 2006. TRW, a leading space/defense contractor to the U.S. Government, has developed and launched 175 spacecraft and more than 500 scientific payload instruments in the past 35 years, according to TRW officials.
