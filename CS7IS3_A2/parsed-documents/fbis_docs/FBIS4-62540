Urniezius"] [Text] [Grineviciute] For the second week running, RESPUBLIKA has failed to receive a reply as to how much money the VAT [value-added tax] will contribute to the state budget. Finance Minister E. Vilkelis has said: "No one can say how much budget revenues will increase." Maybe you know the answer? [Slezevicius] While debating the budget law, the Seimas [parliament] estimated budget revenues from the VAT at 967 million litai, or 25 percent. The VAT is a long-term rather than a temporary economic policy measure. This tax does not uphold the government's popularity, because its introduction increases prices. On the other hand, however, the VAT makes the collection of taxes more effective and, thus, disciplines the community. [Grineviciute] Prior to the VAT, you used to say that the total of collected taxes accounted for about 30 percent. What is the VAT ratio in this respect? [Slezevicius] This should be assessed by experts. I myself have not drafted such predictions. One can say, however, that the collection of taxes in our state is ineffective, and that there are many ways to evade them. The tax system that is being projected now should improve the situation. Another aspect of the same problem is responsibility for the nonpayment of taxes. We are planning to rally a group of lawyers who will draft specific laws on combating this phenomenon. These documents will be of the same type as the law on preventive detention. [Grineviciute] Are you drawing a parallel between the nonpayment of taxes and organized crime? [Slezevicius] The latter are alike, according to the importance, severity, and effectiveness of these measures. [Grineviciute] However, if in cases of businessmen who do not pay taxes, we resort to measures similar to those that are applied to organized criminals, we could jail all businessmen after doing our best. [Slezevicius] I suppose that there are quite a few companies and firms (I have worked in business and I know this) that do not engage in illegal trade. Every respectable businessman is moving away from the shadow economy. Finally, we will apply economic rather than physical (imprisonment -- R.G.) measures. [Grineviciute] In your opinion, can these laws be retroactive? Should they create conditions for law enforcement institutions to inquire into the manner in which the capital stock of firms was accumulated? [Slezevicius] Certainly, we should choose the zero option and leave history intact. [Grineviciute] How would you comment on the fact that over the first days after the VAT introduction, contrary to the predictions of government experts, gas and bread prices went up by about 30 percent, while lines appeared on the border, because customs services began to collect the VAT? [Slezevicius] We have always said that this temporary price hike is linked with the desire of separate commercial structures to earn surplus profits over the short term. There are no objective reasons for the price rise to exceed 18 percent (the VAT). Traders will have to reduce their prices, otherwise, their turnover will decline. The rush at the border should not be explained by the unpreparedness for the VAT introduction, but it should be interpreted as the businessmen's great desire to bring goods into our country before 1 May. [Grineviciute] How do you plan to collect the VAT? Thus far, this has depended on a person collecting the VAT, on his "price." [Slezevicius] This tax is perfect because it does not allow an official alone to decide whether or not to pay it. This tax is paid in the entire "chain." One can receive compensation from the budget only after paying everything. This system forces one to pay. [Grineviciute] Recently, S. Urniezius, "Duke Vilgaudas of the Gediminaiciai" [leader of young people's patriotic organization bearing the name of Lithuania's 13th-century Grand Duke Gediminas], announced his plans to sell cheap alcohol. In the opinion of experts, only contraband liquor could be so cheap. How will you force Mr. Urniezius to pay taxes? [Slezevicius] Measures that we are introducing now are directed against such citizens as S. Urniezius -- he seems to represent a noble family, but his actions can hardly be called noble. He is trying to sell and promote contraband goods. This demoralizes the community. We are preparing to toughen the rules for applying excise bands. This will be done not at customs warehouses, where one has the chance of leaving transit goods illegally in our country, but at the producer's place. When goods are imported to Lithuania, it must be clear where they will be sold. We will apply the same requirements to local producers. For example, "Philip Morris" exports production and does not pay us any taxes, but its products "settle down" here. We must look for an antidote! True, those who do not pay taxes are looking for an "antidote" against them. [Grineviciute] What is a VAT antidote? [Slezevicius] Such recommendations are not my function. Let us not discuss issues that are not the matter of our discussion. Laws are binding on everyone. [Grineviciute] Will the increased rate of inflation due to the VAT require an adjustment in the litas-dollar exchange rate? [Slezevicius] The increased rate of inflation is estimated at 10 percent. We hope to compensate it by raising people's wages and pensions. [Grineviciute] In this case, however, the fixed exchange rate will be unreal. [Slezevicius] There is a lot of mismanagement in production. The consumption of energy and resources is overly large, and technologies are imperfect (therefore, production costs are so high). The difference in the level of inflation should be offset by increased effectiveness of production. These reserves will last us for a long time, and we will not have to talk about the devaluation of the litas. [Grineviciute] Recently, the government cancelled the payment of debts and taxes for a number of state-run enterprises. How long will our state budget be used for the artificial sustenance of bankrupt enterprises and reduction of unemployment? [Slezevicius] Those enterprises were not exempt from taxes. We wanted to separate the moribund ones from those which have some chances of survival. Taxes were cancelled for the Alytus refrigerator plant, some electronic enterprises, the cotton mill, and others. These are enterprises which will survive, and they should not be placed in an awkward situation. [Grineviciute] How should business, which cannot get loans or their guarantees, to say nothing of the cancellation of taxes, survive under the conditions when government support is extended only to state-run firms? [Slezevicius] The shortage and costliness of credit resources is one of our key economic problems. The Currencies Council and the Law on Commercial Banks should increase possibilities to receive loans and reduce their prices. The government does not distribute credits any longer. This is accomplished through commercial banks. It is the latter that will decide to whom credits should be extended.
