What consequences would that have? [Jagoda] No one would be able to determine what the level of unemployment, which is soaring, was. Millions of people would not receive any unemployment benefit. Advice on careers, qualifications, occupational rehabilitation -- all those things would be gone. Apart from that, in 1993, which was a difficult year for the economy, we found jobs for 700,000 people in the new laender. In the old laender, we found employment for over 2 million people. Is that not something? [Reif] Private employment agencies could also do that. [Jagoda] Not, they would not be able to. I am not being pigheaded when I say that a partial privatization of the labor market will not yield any results. Incidentally, we can scarcely talk of the Federal Employment Office having a "monopoly" if the state service accounts for 30 percent of the jobs that are found while newspaper advertisements and information by word of mouth account for 70 percent. That is perfectly all right. We are pleased whenever anyone finds a job. My great skepticism with regard to private employment agencies stems from the justified assumption that we will not have more jobs as a result. If we end up with private employment agencies and they function, then they will absorb a lot of the people who are looking for jobs through us. We will lose a clear picture of the overall situation on the labor market. We offer people looking for work the opportunity to inform themselves extensively about the jobs that are on offer via computer. Once someone has that information, he can initiate the application process himself. [Reif] Have we not arrived at a point where there is too much state control? [Jagoda] Privatization must make sense and result in success. The privatization of the labor market will not contribute to a reduction in unemployment. [Reif] Why not? [Jagoda] Because it will result in agencies taking the pick of the bunch and in a kind of revolving-door effect. Private agencies will increase the amount of rotation on the labor market. So, what we will find on the labor market is not that 7 million changes have been registered, but 7.2 million or 7.3 million changes. The unemployed, however, will remain on the sidelines of this process. In other words, for those providing such services, it will be more convenient to assist people in changing jobs. On the other hand, those people who are in difficulty because of their age or qualifications will find it harder to obtain employment. [Reif] Let us be honest for once. The Federal Employment Office is nothing other than a costly, bloated, bureaucratic institution that uses up enormous amounts of taxpayers' money. [Jagoda] A certain degree of bureaucracy is necessary to achieve things in a highly industrialized state. However, the state administration constantly suffers from the shortcoming that it is dependent on lawmakers. For example, when we read what new decisions lawmakers have produced in the BUNDEGESETZBLATT between Christmas and New Year, and then have already changed a million of our decisions accordingly at the beginning of January, I cannot say anything negative about the Federal Employment Office in connection with bureaucracy. [Reif] It is rather too easy to pass the buck to Bonn. [Jagoda] Well look, almost daily, we receive new instructions that have to be translated into practice. It is not child's play. If I am not mistaken, the Law on Promoting Employment has been amended 11 times by important pieces of legislation and over 50 times as a result of other legislation since 1969. At the same time, we seek to simplify things wherever possible. There are many directives, instructions as well as laws and decrees that we try to translate into practice in a simplified form. In addition, we are continually making organizational decisions with a view to slimming down and decentralizing. Thus, as of 1 January 1994, we have made budgetary provisions for job-creation measures, further training, retraining, and rehabilitation at each individual employment agency. So, the administration of every employment agency not only knows what its budget for 1994 is, but, at the same time, has received allotments for 1995 and 1996. [Reif] Despite the dramatic increase in unemployment, you now have less money at your disposal than before. [Jagoda] It is true that we have much less cloth for cutting our coat. However, I would not like to give rise to the impression that we do not have any money with which to provide help. Whoever is unemployed, even in November or December 1994, can count on us. We are always able to meet our financial obligations. Our budget now amounts to 107.2 billion German marks [DM], of which over DM50 million is for the payment of unemployment benefit. [Reif] How do you assess your job in international terms? [Jagoda] Compared to other industrialized countries, I believe that we not only provide precise statistics, but also set a certain standard through our active labor market policy and our punctuality regarding payments. [Reif] There are grave doubts precisely about how exact your statistics are. In reality, there are said to be almost 9 million people unemployed, rather than 4 million.... [Jagoda] I am surprised that the figure is so modest. Seriously, however, everything depends on how unemployment is defined and one's basis for making calculations. If I say that everyone between the ages of 15 and 65, or between the ages of 14 and 65, 68, or 70 wants to work, then the number of unemployed will, of course, be much higher. Then, I can also include all students and all those attending further training or retraining courses by saying that they constitute "concealed unemployment." That is something that I simply consider impermissible. By pursuing further training or retraining, these "unemployed" people are preparing themselves to enter the normal work process tomorrow. You can be sure that the number of people registered as unemployed that we give is correct. I am firmly opposed to this juggling with horrific figures, which is intended to cause panic among the public. The lesson of our century teaches us that people have a pain threshold, and if one sets a certain pain threshold that is not one in reality, then I believe that to be irresponsible in terms of social policy. [Reif] So, where is the pain threshold then? [Jagoda] In the Weimar Republic, we crossed it in 1932 to 1933 at the very latest. The result was 1945. However, neither today nor at the time of the Weimar Republic could anyone say with certainty where the pain threshold lay and whether it has been reached. We can only establish that with hindsight. Whether we have 4, 5, 6, or ultimately 8 million unemployed is of no consequence in this respect. The situation is explosive every time. The point is that we have to be more resolute and active in creating new jobs. Continually bemoaning the situation leads nowhere. [Reif] The number of people registered as unemployed has just risen to over 4 million.... [Jagoda] Let me finish saying what I have to say. The pain of unemployment is a pain felt at the individual level. It will not be alleviated if more people become unemployed. For someone who wants to work, for himself and his family, unemployment is something exceptionally terrible. In that respect, the actual level of unemployment is irrelevant. It is and remains a personal tragedy. To reply to your question: This year, the number of people registered as unemployed in the old laender will rise by between 300,000 and 400,000. For 1993, the average annual level of unemployment was 2.3 million for the western part of the country, and with the increase that we are now expecting, it will rise to between 2.6 and 2.7 million. Since the middle of 1993, we have noted a trend toward stabilization in the new laender, and there are some indications that employment will increase. In January, however, the magical figure of 4 million was exceeded. It will fall back in the spring, but will remain high. At the end of the decade, over 3 million people will still be unemployed in the Federal Republic. [Reif] Does this mean that Volkswagen's four-day week is more than a desperate, but hopeless, struggle for work? [Jagoda] Volkswagen's four-day week is not a model for the German economy as a whole, but is a temporary solution. It is, if you want to put it this way, an emergency solution for Volkswagen. [Reif] Company programs aimed at boosting efficiency indicate that a further 500,000 jobs will be lost by the year 2000.... [Jagoda] I do not want to set figures. However, we will lose jobs in manufacturing. On the other hand, employment will grow in the construction and services sectors. Nevertheless, we should not throw in the towel, but ask ourselves: How can we create 500,000 new jobs by the year 2000? How are we going to compete internationally? What new processes and products should we develop? How can we promote and support patents? What incentives do we need to acquire a greater role in global economic and trade structures? It is simply nonsense to believe that we can become internationally more competitive through wages alone. [Reif] Herbert Spaeth, president of the Handicrafts and Trades Association, has reminded his colleagues to display more responsibility with respect to jobs and training programs. [Jagoda] My compliments to Mr. Spaeth. I have noticed that the training program situation in larger companies has deteriorated to reduce costs in the short term. I have observed with concern that the number of places on training programs has declined in the old laender above all.
