The Foch aircraft carrier is expected to leave for the Adriatic sea tomorrow morning at the latest, with an escort consisting of the Suffren missile-launcher frigate and the Meuse refueling ship. The three ships will join with the Ouragan landing-barge transporter -- which has been carrying out the "Balbuzard" national mission -- as well as the Cassard antiaircraft frigate and the Commandant de Pimodan destroyer -- which have been participating in Sharp Guard, the embargo control operation of the WEU [Western European Union]. The Foch's air strike capabilities will include some 20 Super Etendard jets as well as a number of Alize aircraft and helicopters. These will complement the French Air Force already present in Italy: 10 Mirage 2000 RDI air superiority fighters based in Cervia (Italy); five Mirage F1 CR reconnaissance aircraft and eight laser-guided assault Jaguar aircraft based in Istrana (Italy); one C-35 refueler aircraft and one AWACS radar aircraft. In addition to shipboard aircraft such as those on the U.S. Saratoga carrier, over 120 U.S., British, French, Spanish, Turkish, and Netherlands aircraft are based ashore around the former Yugoslavia. In total, it is estimated that NATO has over 160 aircraft under its command in the region. The departure of the Foch for the Adriatic sea will therefore assume a primarily political meaning. This meaning is meant to be all the stronger since the government had to suspend the second testing campaign of the marine version of the Rafale fighter aircraft on the Foch, which was to take place mostly this week.
