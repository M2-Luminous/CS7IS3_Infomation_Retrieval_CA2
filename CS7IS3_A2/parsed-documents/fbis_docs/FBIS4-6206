Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said this to reporters after he accompanied his Iraqi counterpart Sa'id al-Sahhaf who paid a courtesy call on the president at Jakarta's Bina Graha presidential office this morning. The Iraqi minister, who held hour-long talks with the president, conveyed Iraqi President Saddam Husayn's oral message on efforts to lift economic sanctions as stipulated in Clause C of the UN Resolution No. 687, which Iraq believes it has fully conformed to. Iraq hopes the four-year-old sanctions will be lifted soon because it has caused severe hardship to its people. The Iraqi minister said his country's infant mortality rate has increased (?sevenfold) against that before the war, while the mortality rate for children over five years old is four times higher. As a result of severe economic sanctions, about 150,000 children have died due to malnutrition and even hunger. During talks between President Suharto and the Iraqi foreign minister, various steps have been agreed on in approaching the United Nations through the Nonaligned Movement's Coordinating Bureau at the UN headquarters and urging the UN Security Council to review the sanctions and conduct an objective study aimed at lifting the four-year-old sanctions. In this connection, Iraq also called for solidarity and support of all Nonaligned Movement members.
