Sometimes this is dictated by the nature of the situation which has developed on the territory of the former USSR and Russia's commitments as its successor, and also, as far as can be surmised, by a definite division of functions directly within the military structures. Moreover, the experience of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry's previous contacts both with the leaders of Transcaucasian states and the heads of military delegations demonstrates that in a number of cases dialogue around the negotiating table is undoubtedly successful for the "diplomats in uniform." Despite naming the objectives of his visit upon landing at Yerevan Airport, when Pavel Grachev noted that he had come "in connection with the start of the summer military training period which is designed to test the combat effectiveness and condition of the Russian troops stationed in Armenia," it is clear that the tasks he will address during his visit are far broader. This is evidenced by his plans to meet with the region's heads of state. The dialogue that has already taken place between the Russian Federation defense minister and Armenian President Levon Ter-Petroysan has been acknowledged to be fruitful by both sides. During the talks they discussed issues connected with the siting of Russian military units on the republic's territory, and also the possibility of young Armenian performing service in these units. It is well-known that under the treaty signed by the heads of both states, a Russian motorized infantry division is stationed at Gyumri in Armenia and another regiment is stationed near Yerevan. Army Gen. Grachev spoke highly of cooperation with Armenia's military department. During their talks they also discussed the terms for sending peacemaking forces into the region. This problem will also be discussed by Army Gen. Grachev at his upcoming meeting in Baku 11 June with Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev. On 10 June the Russian defense minister flies to Tbilisi, where he intends to meet with Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze. According to information from the Abkhazian Ministry of Information and the Press, Pavel Grachev also plans to meet with Vladislav Ardzinba, commander in chief of the republic's armed forces, and the Abkhazian Government; during this meeting he will discuss deploying peacemaking forces along the Inguri River.
