Li Peng made the remark when he joined deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) in a group discussion on the government work report he delivered March 10. Talking with NPC deputies respectively from Henan and Heilongjiang Provinces, both leading grain producers in China, the premier said that rural reform in the past 15 years have brought about great changes in the countryside, especially the development of township enterprises. As a result, many farmer-turned entrepreneurs have emerged, of whom majority are good and trust-worthy. But a small number of them have become degenerate and some even have committed crimes, Li added. Without being supervised by the party and the masses, some people may easily make major mistakes when they have power and money. This is the case not only among farmer-turned entrepreneurs, but also among party officials, Li Peng said. Li Peng urged party committees at all levels to protect and help and the masses to supervise the entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurs, at the same time, should enhance their awareness of law. The premier also discussed with deputies on how to change the way state-owned enterprises operate. When conditions are mature, enterprises groups should be set up to build up the production scale. Efficiency of an enterprise lies in finding markets for its products, the premier added. In response to deputies' proposals on smooth implementation of new reform measures, Li Peng said that all these measures have undergone careful consideration before they are introduced and they are aimed to create a climate in which all compete on an equal footing. Of course, the premier said, people should not expect that the measures will effect all their benefits this year as some problems may occur in the process of implementation. The only correct attitude is to be prudent and promptly solve problems when they are discovered. As for saving energy, Li Peng said continuous efforts should be made to improve energy utility efficiency since energy supply is still a bottleneck for the country.
