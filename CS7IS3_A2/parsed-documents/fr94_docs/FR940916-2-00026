Status of Environmental Analysis: This application has been accepted for filing and is ready for environmental analysis at this time_see standard paragraph D9 below. l. Description of Project: The existing Watertown Project's principal features consist of two dams (the Diversion Dam and the Delano Island Dam), a headgate, a power canal and forebay, a powerhouse, an impoundment, and appurtenant facilities. In addition, there is a designated wetland area of 17 acres within the project's boundary, located just upstream of the Diversion Dam along the left shoreline of the forebay. The City of Watertown is proposing to increase the total installed capacity by replacing all existing electrical and mechanical equipment with new generating units. The existing project has a total nameplate capacity of 5.4 megawatts (MW) and an average annual generation of about 28,000 megawatt- hours (MWh). The proposed project would have a total nameplate capacity of 10.8 MW and an average annual generation of about 47,900 MWh. In detail, the existing and proposed project is described as follows: 1. the concrete gravity Diversion Dam, totaling about 650 feet long, consisting of (a) an ogee section, 590 feet long by 13.5 feet high, with a crest elevation of 500.1 feet mean sea level (msl), and (b) a small minimum flow ogee section, 60 feet long by 11 feet high, with a crest elevation of 496.15 feet msl; 2. the concrete gravity Delano Island Dam, totaling 200 feet long, with a maximum height of 12 feet and a crest elevation of 500.1 feet msl; 3. an impoundment, 3.5 miles long, having (a) a surface area of about 190 acres (AC); (b) a gross storage capacity of 2,000 acre-feet (AF); (c) a negligible useable storage capacity; (d) a normal headwater elevation of 500.1 feet msl; (e) a normal tailwater elevation of 473.0 feet msl; and (f) a designated wetland area of 17 AC; 4. a concrete headgate, 200 feet long by 18.5 feet high, with twenty-five vertical steel gates, each 25 feet wide by 8 feet high, with a sill elevation of 493.0 feet msl; 5. an excavated power canal, totaling 1,050 feet long, with varying widths of 53 to 180 feet, consisting of (a) a 175 foot-long concrete gravity ogee section which has a 3-foot wide by 4-foot-high mudgate and a trash chute; (b) a 200- foot-long by 130-foot-wide forebay, which has an existing 60 degree angled, 150-foot-long trashrack; 6. a concrete and brick masonry powerhouse, about 49 feet wide by 115 feet long, equipped with three existing generating units, with (a) a rated capacity of 1,800 kilowatts (kW) per unit; (b) a hydraulic capacity range of 400 to 3,000 cubic feet per second (cfs); and (c) an average annual generation of 28,000 MWh; the three proposed replacement units would have (a) a rated capacity of 3,600 kW per unit; (b) a hydraulic capacity range of 400 to 6,000 cfs; and (c) an average annual generation of 47,900 MWh; 7. an existing 100-foot-long, 2.3 kilovolt (kV) primary transmission line; and 8. appurtenant facilities. m. Purpose of Project: The purpose of the project is to provide electric energy to several of the applicant's municipal accounts and for sale to Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation. n. This notice also consists of the following standard paragraphs: A4, D9. o. Available Location of Application: A copy of the application, as amended and supplemented, is available for inspection and reproduction at the Commission's Public Reference and Files Maintenance Branch, located at 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Room 3104, Washington, D.C., 20426, or by calling (202) 208&hyph;1371. A copy is also available for inspection and reproduction at the Watertown Municipal Building, 245 Washington Street, Watertown, NY, 13601&hyph;3380 (315) 785&hyph;7730. p. Scoping Process: In gathering background information for preparation of the environmental document for the issuance of a Federal hydropower license, staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is using a scoping process to identify significant environmental issues related to the construction and operation or the continued operation of hydropower projects. The staff will review all issues raised during the scoping process and identify issues deserving of study and also deemphasize insignificant issues, narrowing the scope of the environmental analysis as well. If preliminary analysis indicates that any issues presented in the scoping process would have little potential for causing significant impacts, the issue or issues will be identified and the reasons for not providing a more detailed analysis will be given. q. Request for Scoping Comments: Federal, state, and local resource agencies; licensees, applicants and developers; Indian tribes; other interested groups and individuals, are requested to forward to the Commission, any information that they believe will assist the Commission staff in conducting an accurate and thorough analysis of the site-specific and cumulative environmental effects of the proposed licensing activities of the project(s). Therefore you are requested to provide information related to the following items:
