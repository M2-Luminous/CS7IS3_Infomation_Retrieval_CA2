Soon he will be marking his second anniversary in office, and we will be facing the same man we knew before: hesitant, suspicious, devoid of assertive leadership, loathe to delegate responsibility to the point of obsession, and a military man through and through. These problematic qualities are amply reflected in the arrangement emerging between Israel and the Palestinians. This is a military agreement more than a political one, because it is being formulated by generals and not by politicians. Supposedly, the imminent withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will be the climax of the breathtaking drama on the White House lawn on 13 September. Six months have gone by and it turns out that people are not happy, neither on our side nor on theirs. Some people have been trying hard to spoil the fun. Rabin's reelection as prime minister was one of the most mind- boggling manifestations of political recycling in contemporary times, and not just in Israel. His first year in service only strengthened the impression that here we had a new and fresh politician, very different from the prime minister we knew almost 20 years ago. Everything was going his way. He personally ran the country without neglecting any details. He demanded to know everything his cabinet ministers were doing -- and justifiably so, considering that he chose them based on their qualifications. He closely followed the progress in building roads and overpasses, the state of poverty, the allocation of resources, the absorption of aliyah, and what not. The people liked his style. After years during which Yitzhaq Shamir evinced indifference, if not disregard, toward anything remotely reeking of socioeconomic issues, Yitzhaq Rabin was perceived as a refreshing change. This was reflected in public opinion polls, which indicated vast support for his performance. His popularity soared sky high after the signing of the agreement between Israel and the PLO in Washington. People walked down the streets with a smile in their heart. Except for the settlers who continued to mortify themselves and grieve in their ghettos, everybody felt elated. The world at large, tired of disappointments about peace initiatives gone sour, stared in bewilderment at Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's daring and determination. Even Menahem Begin, who signed the peace treaty with Egypt, did not evince such lavish praise. In the eyes of the world and of many Israelis who saw themselves represented by this government, the signing of the Declaration of Principles symbolized the first act en route to the end of the occupation. What happened, however, is that instead of striving for this goal with kid gloves, in good faith and with awe, Rabin took peace by storm, as if it was a military operation. He shoved politicians and diplomats aside and placed the Army's top brass at the most sensitive junctions of the peace negotiations. As is known, it is hard for soldiers to change their spots overnight. Suddenly they found themselves sitting opposite people who until the night before they had laid in ambush for. They had a hard time making the change. Rabin even had a harder time of it. He was the man who over the last 10 years, except for a brief two-year interval, formulated Israel's security policy in the territories. The intifadah broke out during his term in office and set the territories on fire. Instead of "taking his time to ponder over" the dramatic flare-up, he sent thousands of soldiers to the territories to quash it at gunpoint. Hundreds had to die, thousands had to be wounded and arrested before Rabin realized the limitations of force. In his capacity as defense minister, Rabin drew the distinction between the PLO inside and outside the territories and devised peace initiatives aimed at driving them apart, as if they were pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. Only when he became prime minister did he realize that this was an imaginary distinction. He turned to 'Arafat, as if imbibing in some bitter medicine, and only after he came to the conclusion that the PLO was one single entity. Even after he signed the agreement, he conveyed the impression that he was not really thrilled about the whole business. At times he even seemed to regret having signed the deal. Israelis who sided with him through thick and thin were suddenly confronted with a prime minister who was of two minds, who agonized and dragged his feet, was unenthusiastic, hesitant, and unassertive. Instead of overseeing the negotiations from the comfort of his position, Rabin chose to get involved with the minute details, which ranged from the ridiculous to the pathetic. At his instructions, his aides spent whole days on questions such as the type of security personnel that would be stationed at the border terminals in Gaza and Jericho and how many meters would separate the Israeli guard from the Palestinian one. Not to mention the glass partition at the terminal, its thickness, location, and transparency. Not to mention the type of electronic gadgetry that would replace bodily frisking of people crossing through the terminals. The insistence on details in faraway capitals around the globe, coupled with the use of unprecedented firepower in the territories, did their bit. The public began losing its confidence in peace and in the negotiators. Day in and day out the prime minister could be seen grumbling, furious, threatening, and bickering about the Palestinian partner. Menahem Begin gave back the entire Sinai Peninsula, four times the size of Israel, without grumbling or bickering as frequently as Rabin. That same Begin was not scared by the right wing's threats or of sending his deputy to grovel before the Jewish ayatollahs to tone down their halakic edict. That same Begin evacuated settlements and was not deterred by allegations of a Jewish population transfer. It is at these critical times that an eminent leader is needed. Begin was one such leader, inasmuch as the peace with Egypt was concerned. He adopted big decisions, and the public respected his determination and followed him. Rabin, on the other hand, projects the restlessness of a man who is not at peace with himself or with his actions. Frustration is the antithesis of leadership. His bleak mood radiates to the people who despair in the possibility of peace with the Palestinians. That is why there are no happy people these days.
