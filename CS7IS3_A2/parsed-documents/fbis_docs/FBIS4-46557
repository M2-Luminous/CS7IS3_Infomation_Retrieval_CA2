However, the lack of success in numerous attempts by representatives of the Russian VPK [military-industrial complex] to convince the other sectors of the economy of the enormous benefit of high-tech defense and of their competitiveness in world markets provides grounds for doubting the fundamental possibility of accustoming VPK enterprises to a "peacetime situation" and the budget deficit; yesterday, for the second time, the Kirov plant in St. Petersburg was shut down. After going back to work following the first shutdown and assembling 150 tractors, the Kirov workers were unable to solve the problem of selling them: 400 machines await their fate in the yard at the enterprise. The plant management attributes the lack of buyers for the Kirov tractors to the doubling in cost of the tractors since the beginning of the year, linking this rise to a change in the tax laws (which appears extremely doubtful to KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts; this can justify no more than a 10-percent increase.) Due to the shutdown more than 5,000 workers have been forced to take leave without pay. The most likely date for the renewal of production is 1 October, although "planted' loans by the federal government to the farmers could stimulate demand somewhat, in which case the plant would begin operating as of 1 April. Other, purely military assembly subdivisions belonging to the Kirov Zavod AO [joint-stock association]: the transmission plant, the Spetsmash plant (which produces tanks and artillery) and the steam turbine unit (which produces steam turbines for submarines, among other things). The shutdown of the Kirov plant is yet another manifestation of the already obvious economic crisis in which almost all of the enterprises in the Russian military-industrial complex find themselves. The overall drop in production at Petersburg defense plants was 28.6 percent in 1993, including 38.8 percent in the aviation industry, while indebtedness to the state by 132 military enterprises of the city reached 150 billion rubles. As a result Petersburg has assumed 33rd place in Russia with respect to the reduction in production volumes (Leningrad Oblast, 67th; Moscow, 49th). In this situation it would be logical to expect coordinated actions from the management at the plants, local authorities and the federal government to overcome the crisis. The plant administration is working out plans for respecializing as a rule oriented toward financing out of the budget, however, (papers pertaining to a coordinated plan with the American Caterpillar company were signed quite recently, but implementation of the idea of producing city buses is still in the initial stage. A recent conference showed that Anatoliy Sobchak has still not defined his position--either to restrain the directors of the VPK enterprises with a "Democles sword" or unequivocally to support their demands (which could have a negative effect on the attitude toward the mayor of Petersburg in Moscow). One way or another, all of the main hopes are pinned on a solution involving the federal budget. The end justifies the means in this case. This will put into action the traditional lobbying methods (the signing of demands for reduced taxes by the directors, exemption from duties, the provision of subsidies, the establishment of machine-tool committees and so forth), and some now forgotten foreign economic tricks: delegations of production veterans with Soviet orders on their lapels in government offices. There is no doubt about the choice of the members of the current "government management team": to envelop the plant in the heroic performance of the first five-year plans or not.
