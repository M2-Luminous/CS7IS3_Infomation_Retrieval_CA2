And He Has Come"] [Text] Every spring there is a new Minister of Defense in Georgia.... Tengiz Kitovani became head of the military department in May 1992. The hero of the anti-Gamsakhurdia action and father of the National Guard immediately declared his intention to urgently set about building unified armed forces. But in the wake of the attacks on Russian military units (just take that one incident -- there were casualties on both sides -- with the tank regiment in Gori!), the hijacking of automobiles, the "privatization" of Russian servicemen's apartments, and the political intrigues, the good intention has remained precisely that -- a good intention. What is also indicative is whom Tengiz Kitovani (an architect by education; his military experience consists of three years of draft service in the Belorussian Military District) intended to build an army with. Tengiz Kalistratovich had as his deputy, for example, a man who was a complete civilian, although he had been elevated to general by the former. This was Tamaz Dumbadze, a graduate of the Moscow Institute of Soviet Trade. And another general, also homegrown, with a diploma from a Georgian polytechnic institute, is Dzhemal Chumburidze, chief of the National Guard Main Directorate. He has been Deputy Defense Minister as of March 1993. Incidentally, generals were appointed on the basis of completely farfetched talk to the effect that Georgians were not given promotions in the Soviet Army. And since that was the case, Tengiz Kalistratovich evidently decided, yesterday's colonels, lieutenant colonels, and captains should be raised to the rank of general. Everyone was rewarded! But was this done on merit? Georgiy Karkarashvili. In 1990 he was a captain in the Soviet Army, chief of staff of an artillery division; and since 14 September 1992 he has also been a general in the Georgian Armed Forces. Paata Datuashvili. In 1990 he was a lieutenant colonel and commander of a rocket artillery division in the Transbaykal Military District. He has become a major general and Georgian first deputy defense minister. The list of "wild-growing" generals can be continued. But are we talking only about generals? The commander of a detachment of seven or eight men has already called himself colonel and commander of a battalion. Hence the joke was born: "In the Georgian Army the first military rank is that of major." Either there was no one to get involved in army organizational development or, despite the cunning nature of the propaganda of the time, no "Soviet generals," even retired ones, could be found? But there are some. Colonel General Anatoliy Kamkamidze, Lieutenant Generals Levan Sharashenidze, Mikhail Elbakidze, and Robert Tavadze, Major General Panteleymon Georgadze.... They had served in the Soviet Army for decades, but they nevertheless did not get the top roles in the Georgian Army. Admittedly, Levon Sharashenidze spent four months as minister of defense (January-May 1992), until his first serious conflict with the leadership of the National Guard. Pantaleymon Georgadze (the father of Igor Georgadze, the Republic's current security minister) spent some time in command of Border Guard Troops, but he did not last long after disagreeing with parliament in his views concerning the organizational development of the Army. The other "red generals" became the deputies of yesterday's captains. On the other hand, the "armed men" in Georgia felt free under Tengiz Kalistratovich to earn their living sometimes by robbery and sometimes by terror. Never mind robbery! The fall of 1992. There is war in Abkhazia and parliament is examining the composition of the new Cabinet of Ministers in Tbilisi. The deputies refuse to confirm Tengiz Sigua, Kitovani's comrade-in-arms in the anti-Gamsakhurdia action, in the post of prime minister. By a curious coincidence, it was precisely when National Guard troops started wandering the corridors of parliament (only the slow-witted did not realize why this should suddenly happen) and a rumor spread around town that "Kitovani's guys" want to come to visit for a couple of days from Abkhazia that the deputies voted as one for Sigua. Kitovani got his deserts several months later, in May 1993. The parliamentary deputies suddenly "remembered" that Tengiz Kalistratovich had not been confirmed in the post of minister of defense (and, it turned out, this should have been done straight after the parliamentary elections in fall 1992), and they rebelled, saying that this was out of order. The issue was put to the vote and was rejected. But Kitovani's game was already up by then. The Georgian detachments were suffering defeat after defeat in Abkhazia; it did not prove possible to tame the rebellious autonomous formation, as Kitovani had promised; disagreements with Eduard Shevardnadze intensified, and only one solution remained: To get out. Which he did, having spoken to Georgiy Karkarashvili beforehand. What they talked about is unknown, but Karkarashvili often repeated afterward that if it had not been for the parting words of Kitovani, who "made him a man," he would not have complied with Eduard Shevardnadze's request that he become minister of defense. One way or another the new appointment took place -- and, alas, in a form which ensured continuity of the style of leadership of the Armed Forces: Reforms were not carried out, and at the front things went worse then ever. There were ambitions and promises to launch a large-scale offensive against the Abkhazians (this brought a skeptical smile to the people who knew the state of the Georgian Armed Forces). In a word, Karkarashvili was like his teacher, and observers noted entirely fairly that the former captain was brave and knew how to fight, but was useless as a commander. In February 1994, in the wake of the Abkhazian nightmare, Georgiy Karkarashvili resigned. His relations with Eduard Shevardnadze appeared to have deteriorated seriously after Karkarashvili, during a Zviadist offensive in the west of the republic, repealed an order of the supreme commander in chief and refused to fight against Loti Lobaliya.... After Karkarashvili, the Georgian parliament prevaricated for almost four months over the appointment of a new minister. This time passed amid reflections about the future of the national army. Not just reflections, however. A resolution was adopted on the procedure for awarding military ranks. Given the complete anarchy of previous years in this respect, the step was a prudent one. The 300 Georgian officers who did not respond to the appeal to return from the Russian Army were discussed with bitterness. Furthermore, reports are coming into the Georgian Ministry of Defense's personnel organs with a request...to assist in transfers to the Russian Army: People have gotten fed up with low pay, the lack of social protection, the lack of any service prospects. Parliamentary Speaker Vakhtang Goguadze spoke very emotionally and unexpectedly as follows: "Georgia will be free when a Russian general summons the leadership of the Georgian Army and announces to it: 'Congratulations. Henceforth Georgia is free. I wish you all the best.' And in response, Georgian servicemen will shout a grateful `Hurrah' and swear an oath of loyalty to Russia. There is no other way out...." The opposition claims: "The Russian general has already arrived." By "the Russian" they mean Lieutenant General Varden Nadibaidze, whom parliament confirmed in the post of defense minister in May of this year. (He was born 31 March 1939 in the village of Mleta in Georgia's Dushetskiy Rayon. He graduated from the Ordzhonikidze Military Automobile School and the Rear Services and Transportation Academy. He has served in the Kiev Military District, the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, and, since 1972, in the Transcaucasus, where he rose to deputy commander for armaments of the Group of Russian Forces in the Transcaucasus.) So why "Russian"? Nadibaidze is no arriviste; he is from the real and true Georgian heartland. Admittedly, during his years of service he has forgotten the language somewhat, and only gives interviews to journalists in Russian. And the opposition holds this against him. Once again, a general who has served in Russia has been appointed to the post of minister -- and the opposition has noted this "point" too. Everything can be corrected: The language can be brought up to standard, and the transfer (and that will doubtless happen) to the national army will be officially registered. Something else is far more important: The military department is not headed by an architect or a pianist but by a functioning general who does not represent the interests of any political parties, clans, or groups (unlike his predecessors). This happens once in a blue moon.... As for Russia, then, no matter what it might say, its interest is the same as before: Having for a neighbor a united, stable state. And if the "Russian" General Nadibaidze facilitates this, then what is there in this that runs counter to Georgia's national interests?
