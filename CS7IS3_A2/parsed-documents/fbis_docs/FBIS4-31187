The cirrhosis diagnosis, on the basis of which Nicu Ceausescu today walks around as a free person, was established on the basis of an endoscopic examination that actually did not take place at all. Nicu Ceausescu was "submitted" to that examination by Alexandru Oproiu, state secretary of the Ministry of Health. According to the conclusions of Senator Sandulescu, Oproiu "deliberately falsified the diagnosis." The PNTCD senator also said that he is in possession of a copy of the medical records on the son of the former dictator and that one of the physicians who had been in charge of tending to Nicu Ceausescu in the Colentina Hospital confirmed that the latter's cirrhosis "is merely a bedtime story for children." Senator Sandulescu also stated that the bodies authorized to investigate the 1989 December events "did everything possible to conceal the truth and remove the traces." "Despite the fact that all the persons who were summoned to bear witness in front of the senators' commission swore to tell the truth, they actually lied," asserted Sandulescu.
