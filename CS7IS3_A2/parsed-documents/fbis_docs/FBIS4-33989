What causes even more concern is the foreboding of another political altercation between Argentina and the rest of Latin America. The participation of President Carlos Menem and Cuban leader Fidel Castro also presupposes the possibility of a "quarrel" parallel to the summit, or at least leaves the door open for a verbal skirmish like at the summit in Salvador, Bahia [Brazil]. Seeking to gain the attention of the participating chiefs of state, Menem has sent a letter in which he proposes that they work on a project that contemplates respect for the cultural and ethical values of the region. It is doubtful this hazy proposal will divert attention from a topic that has top priority for the continent: The need to restore deposed Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, that country's first democratically elected president, to the presidency. Latin American governments know sooner or later they could face a situation similar to the one in December 1989 when the United States unilaterally invaded Panama on the pretext of extraditing General Manuel Noriega. The constant failure of the United States -- of Washington in the first place, but the failure also has a hemispheric tendency -- to resolve the situation that began in Haiti in 1991, could prompt the unleashing of this new crisis. The foreboding is based on the fact that Bill Clinton personally announced the possibility of a U.S. military invasion followed by a new multinational experiment in how to create a democracy. Latin American government fear centers on the fact that unilateral U.S. action would weaken the Inter-American consultation system represented first by the OAS and second by the Rio Group. The wounds opened in the region by actions in Panama and Grenada in the 1980's have yet to heal. From what is known at the present time of the U.S. strategy, it can be surmised that an eventual invasion of Haiti will be the exclusive responsibility of the United States, but a second stage will require the participation of the rest of the Americas. It is here where Argentina differs from the other countries of the region because no other Latin American government seems to be convinced of the benefits of an armed expedition that seems to be more related to placating the internal criticism that Clinton has to suffer than to benefiting suffering Haitians. Those responsible for Menem's foreign policy stressed that they have stated as a condition that at least one other Latin American country should give its guarantee and cooperate, but these concepts only seem to be of a formal nature because Buenos Aires -- this is already known -- is the only capital that has not objected to any decision by Washington during the past 3 years. If a consensual solution is not arrived at regarding the way democracy is to be restored in Haiti, it is quite probable that the United States and Latin America will find themselves on opposite sides of the street. If this happens, the position of the Argentine Government is already known -- beginning with its obsession for unrestricted alignment.
