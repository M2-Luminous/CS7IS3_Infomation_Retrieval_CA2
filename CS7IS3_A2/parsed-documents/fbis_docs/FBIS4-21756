The plan was to prepare for a number of terrorist operations following the capture of some of their leaders and the liquidation of others in armed clashes with the police. A responsible security source stated that these terrorists were arrested during raids on dens of terrorism in the slum area of al-Walidiyah in Asyut city. The raid was staged after a terrorist element informed on this group that was shadowing the movements of some police officers, watching their houses, and reporting this information to those charged with implementing the new terrorist plan despite the failure of most of their criminal plans. The source added that the security forces are continuing their encirclement of al-Walidiyah area, which is regarded as a criminal and terrorist den in Asyut. The raids resulted in the arrest of 23 active terrorists, including two important terrorists from Abu Tij, and the capture of two rifles, one Lee Enfield and a hunting rifle. [passage omitted]
