FBIS4-51804 "dreas085_d_94047" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 2 May 1994 South Korea Government Announces `Streamlining' Finalized Government Announces `Streamlining' Finalized SK0205094194 Seoul YONHAP in English 0830 GMT 2 May 94 SK0205094194 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- Twenty-two, or 60 percent, of the 38 central government agencies have undergone streamlining to honor the pledge of a "small government" made in January. At a meeting Monday presided over by Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok, the cabinet confirmed that 1,368 officials have been cut while 829 have been newly employed, resulting in a net reduction of 539 officials. One office, three bureaus, 11 councilor posts and 35 divisions have been closed down. Of the remaining 16 agencies, four agencies are awaiting approval for a manpower increase while 12 others, including the National Unification Board, have yet to submit reorganization drafts. The government streamlining is therefore virtually finalized as the rest of the reshaping is likely to be small in scale. Of the 22 agencies that have finished their restructuring, the Communications Ministry did the most cutting -- 223 officials -- followed by 115 in the Korea National Railroad, 105 in the Construction Ministry, 55 in the Home Ministry, 52 in the Foreign Ministry, 43 in the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry, and 23 in the Government Administration Ministry. In contrast, the Environment Ministry added 223 officials to perform its new task of handling water-related affairs and the public prosecutor's office employed seven.
