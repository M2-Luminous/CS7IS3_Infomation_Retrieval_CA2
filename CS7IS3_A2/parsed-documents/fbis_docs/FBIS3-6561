The meeting, hosted by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, marked the first attempt by the fledgling Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to tackle high finance and other banking issues as a backstop to economic growth. U.S. Officials said the APEC ministers will stay clear of trade-related issues such as removing barriers to financial markets in Japan and other Asia-Pacific countries. "This is not a forum for discussing financial services issues," U.S. Treasury Undersecretary Lawrence Summers said. Finance ministers also appeared eager not to oversell their mission as they assembled at a scenic beachfront hotel for a series of multilateral meetings and bilateral consultations. Professed cooperation and friendly dialogue, rather than confrontation and tough rhetoric, appeared to be the order of the day. "I don't plan to go in and twist arms and bully people around," Bentsen said during a stopover in Los Angeles en route to Honolulu. Japan's Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii appeared equally emphatic on the need for consensus-building among the fast growing but diverse economies in the Asia-Pacific region. "Cooperation is the single most important thing for the economies in this region," Fujii told reporters on arrival in Honolulu. Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said the APEC countries were not in Hawaii to look for specific solutions. "This is the first time that we meet. We are here to exchange our views on economic achievements and problems and issues," Tsang said. The issues on the agenda, Tsang and other APEC ministers said, center on ways to smooth capital investments and financial flows within the region. "We all have very different regimes on these matters, so it would not be a bad idea for us to share with others our respective strengths and weaknesses," Tsang said. Prior to a daylong multilateral session among the APEC ministers Saturday, the ministers held an informal, getting-acquainted reception Friday evening that marked the opening of the two-day meeting. The APEC ministers also took the occasion to hold a series of bilateral meetings, including a brief meeting Friday afternoon between Fujii and Bentsen. Fujii and Bentsen dealt mostly on ways to promote "a spirit of cooperation" in the APEC process, which Fujii presented as an example of how the two countries should handle their bilateral trade disputes, Japanese officials said. APEC -- which brings together 17 member countries in the Asia-Pacific region -- represents the world's fastest growing economic region, with some economies such as China's expanding at close to two-digit growth rates. The market potential of the region, which accounts for 50 percent of the global output and 40 percent of worldwide trade, is underscored by estimates that APEC member nations will spend 1 trillion dollars in infrastructure alone over the next 10 years. "They need phone lines, power plants, ports, water treatment facilities, airports and highways," Bentsen said in Los Angeles in urging American businesses to "look West" -- to the growing markets in Asia. APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua-New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States. Chile, due to join APEC this fall, was also invited to the finance ministers' meeting.
