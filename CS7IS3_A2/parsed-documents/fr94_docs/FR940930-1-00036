FR940930-1-00036 FR940930-1-00014 Section 1621.2␣Grievance Committee The proposed revision to this section would allow a recipient to include more than a proportionate number of clients on a grievance committee. The current rule requires that the committee be composed of lawyer and client members in approximately the same proportion in which they serve on the governing body. However, there is no statutory requirement governing the composition of board committees and, for client grievance issues, it may be preferable in some situations to have more than one-third of the committee membership be clients. In any event, at least one lawyer must be on the committee. Section 1621.3␣Complaints About the Quality or Manner of Providing Services Paragraph (a) is revised to clarify that the grievance procedure is available only to actual clients or their representatives, and not to opposing counsel or some other person who is disgruntled by the recipient's operations. It is also designed to address complaints not only about the quality of legal assistance, but also about a client's general treatment by the recipient's staff, including the receptionist, intake workers, or any other staff member who interacts with clients. Paragraph (a) is also revised to require a program to establish procedures for complaints about PAI attorneys. These procedures need not be the same as they are for program staff. The Corporation has a strong interest in encouraging involvement of the private bar in its recipients' PAI projects and does not want the grievance procedures to act as a deterrent to such involvement. However, the Corporation also sees the value in providing some complaint mechanism for dissatisfied clients. Therefore, the Corporation is especially interested in receiving comments from the private bar on this issue. Such comments should address issues such as local ethical requirements to report malpractice on the part of attorneys, complaint procedures, and appropriate actions that should be taken when a complaint is found to have merit. Paragraph (b) sets out the minimum requirements for a program's grievance procedures. It adds a requirement that complaints be in writing and retains the provision for transcription of oral complaints into writing, so that grievance committees would not have to respond to every oral statement made about a recipient. If a grievance committee does not satisfactorily resolve the matter based on the written complaint, the provision provides that the complainant then has an opportunity to address the committee in person or by teleconference. Although not required by the proposed rule, procedures may include a provision allowing a complainant to appeal the grievance committee's decision to the program's whole board of directors. This provision also clarifies that there is no attorney-client relationship between the complainant and the board's grievance committee. Thus, in order for the grievance committee to investigate a complaint, the client would have to consent to disclose any necessary confidential information. It is important to require that the consent be explicit, rather than simply treating the filing of a complaint as an implied consent. The consent called for is limited to those disclosures to the committee or the board necessary to consider the grievance. Paragraph (c) adds a provision setting out what a grievance committee may do in response to a complaint made pursuant to this Part. This is an effort to make it clear that the committee could recommend any action that is consistent with the applicable rules of professional responsibility, but it would be up to the executive director to determine what action is appropriate and to implement such action. Paragraph (d) requires a recipient to maintain a file, separate from the client's case file, containing a copy or summary of every written complaint and a statement of its disposition. In view of the second sentence of this paragraph, the requirement in the current rule that the file be preserved for review by the Corporation has been deleted. The second sentence adds a provision that prohibits the recipient from disclosing any information in the file that would violate the attorney-client privilege or the applicable rules of professional responsibility. Keeping the information the Corporation may need to see in a file separate from the client's case file would make it easier for the Corporation to have access to complaint information in a manner that would be less likely to jeopardize the confidentiality of client information. The Committee believes that the provisions on access to client information should be consistent with the applicable rules of professional responsibility and with section 1006(b)(3) of the LSC Act, which prohibits LSC from abrogating the authority of states and local jurisdictions to enforce those rules. The ABA's Standing Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants (``SCLAID'') has expressed great concern about the protection of client confidences, secrets, and other information gained in the course of representation, and has urged the Committee to adopt rules that would permit LSC to have access to information only in a manner consistent with the applicable rules of professional responsibility. The Committee proposal makes it clear that complaint information disclosed by a client should not be disclosed to LSC or to any third party, except as permitted by applicable rules. Generally, that would mean that when the identity of a client is not known, information may be made available so long as it does not identify a client, either directly or indirectly. Thus, a client's name and any other information that could associate the document with a particular client, such as an address or the name of an employer, should be redacted.
