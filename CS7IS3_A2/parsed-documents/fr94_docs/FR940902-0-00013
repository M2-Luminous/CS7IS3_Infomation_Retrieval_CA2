FR940902-0-00013 FR940902-0-00005 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Parole Commission 28 CFR. Part 2 Paroling, Recommitting, and Supervising Federal Prisoners: Parole Hearings Conducted by Single Hearing Examiners AGENCY: Parole Commission, Justice. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Parole Commission is adopting a rule that permits parole hearings for eligible federal prisoners to be conducted by a single hearing examiner. Formerly, parole hearings were conducted by panels of two examiners, with single-examiner hearings being the exception. The final rule issued today makes single examiner hearings the norm, with the Commission having the option to order panel hearings when appropriate. Review and voting by the Regional Administrator will provide the Regional Commissioner with a panel recommendation of two examiners before a decision is rendered. The rule will also permit a hearing examiner (or panel) to withhold the recommended decision that is usually given to the prisoner at the conclusion of a parole hearing, if a critical issue requires further consideration. The purpose served by this final rule is to adjust the Commission's procedures to the down-sizing requirements of the Commission's impending abolition, without lessening the quality of justice in parole hearings and decisions. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 3, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard K. Preston, Office of General Counsel, 5550 Friendship Blvd., Chevy Chase, Maryland 20815, Telephone (301) 492&hyph;5959. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Public comment was solicited by publication of an interim rule at 47 FR 11186 (March 10, 1994). Comment was received from the University of Southern California Law Center (USCLC), the Federal Public Defenders for the Central District of California and the Western District of Pennsylvania, and several federal prisoners. This comment was uniformly negative, and emphasized the aura of fairness that is assertedly lost when parole hearings are conducted by a single examiner. Moreover, the public comment advanced various legal arguments to the effect that due process, and the intent of Congress in the Parole Commission and Reorganization Act of 1976, mandate the Commission to continue conducting parole hearings with panels of two examiners. With respect to the constitutional and legal arguments advanced in the public comment, the Commission has rejected those arguments. Contrary to the public comment from the USCLC, the legislative history to the 1986 amendment to 18 U.S.C. ยง4208 clearly states that Congress intended the Parole Commission to ``utilize its resources most efficiently'' by having one examiner conduct the parole hearing, with the second examiner reviewing the case on the record. 132 Cong. Rec. H11291, 11293 (daily ed. Oct. 17, 1986) (remarks of Rep. Berman). Moreover, the analogy drawn in the public comment between the right of a parolee to due process under Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 470 (1972), and the right of an eligible prisoner to a parole hearing, is not a correct analogy. A parole hearing is not designed to test the credibility of live witnesses, but serves the limited purposes of providing the prisoner with an opportunity: (1) to ensure that the records under consideration by the Parole Commission are, in fact, the records relating to his case; and (2) to present any special considerations demonstrating why he is an appropriate candidate for parole. See Greenholtz v. Inmates of Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 15 (1979). Even under the Parole Commission and Reorganization Act of 1976, single-examiner hearings were permitted in special situations, thus precluding the assumption, advocated in the public comment, that Congress made a two-examiner panel a legal necessity regardless of the circumstances. The 1976 law also permitted parole revocation hearings under Morrissey v. Brewer, supra, to be conducted by a single examiner. Hence, the arguments that the Parole Commission is precluded by law from responding to the circumstances created by its abolition in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, are without merit. On the other hand, the Parole Commission is sensitive to the concerns expressed by the prisoners themselves for maintaining the fairness of parole consideration, especially with regard to the deliberations that precede the panel recommendation to the Regional Commissioner. To this end, the Commission will institute every reasonable measure to ensure thorough consideration by the Regional Administrator, who will participate as a panel member in arriving at a well-considered, independent evaluation of the prisoner's case. Although the presence of two hearing examiners provides an eligible prisoner with the outward assurance of fairness, the ultimate fairness of the deliberations that go into a parole decision is not diminished if the absent secondary examiner is given more opportunity for reflection and study of the case file in the regional office, than would be possible when examiners are obliged to complete a docket of hearings in an institution. Finally, the restraints imposed upon the U.S. Parole Commission by its impending abolition on November 1, 1997, require that the Commission balance the objective of a fair parole hearing with the need for appropriate conservation of limited staff resources. Public comment was also received with regard to the provision permitting an examiner to forego the recommended decision normally announced at the conclusion of a parole hearing. The Commission agrees that this should be an extraordinary procedure, and should not be invoked by hearing examiners on a routine basis. The Commission will monitor the practices of its hearing examiners to ensure that overuse of this provision (as predicted in some of the public comment) will not occur. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Statement The U.S. Parole Commission has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and the rule has therefore not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities, within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b).
