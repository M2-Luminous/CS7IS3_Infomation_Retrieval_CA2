Unfortunately, the budget was adopted at the last minute, under pressure, in a typical Bulgarian manner. Pressed by the time limit posed by the international financial institutions as a precondition of allocating to Bulgaria the still illusionary $1 billion, the deputies and ministers had no choice but to dispose quickly of the matter of adopting the budget, which is the most important law of any normal state. Generally, the government received the parameters of the macroeconomic budget framework that it demanded. However, it is clear to all that this framework is unrealistic and unfeasible. Everyone knows that the emperor is naked, but no one dares to admit this publicly. The dollar rate, which was artificially kept within decent limits, immediately reached 40 leva on the real market. The budget's income and expenditure are calculated on the basis of a $1/35 leva rate. There is hardly one normal Bulgarian citizen who believes in the inflation of 45 percent promised by the end of the year and a basic interest rate of 30 percent. After all, every week there is another official price increase--electricity, heating, postal services, and so forth. The citizens, subjected to the price racket of the official and unofficial government, do not appear to have any choice. The 1994 budget contains more restrictions than the budgets of the last four years. Three governments have publicly announced that they will serve in the name of the reform, but they have all limited themselves to the monetary part of the reform proposed by (former Finance Minister) Ivan Kostov. Otherwise, in his statement, Prime Minister Berov did not say anything new regarding supporting private and state business, and socially supporting the poor, whose number continues to grow. He did not make any promises. Basically, the present cabinet can afford this. It stands on relatively solid ground that materialized under its feet with the adoption of the budget, regardless of how impossible it will be to implement.
