The president has voiced his anger over a report published today in EL SIGLO. The report refers to statements by journalist and attorney Jaime Padilla Beliz who said it was learned the very president of the Republic was threatening one of the Electoral Tribunal magistrates with firing his wife from a position to which she was recently appointed if he rules in favor of Mayin Correa, Panama City mayoral candidate, in a case at the Electoral Tribunal. [Begin recording] [Endara] I am suing him for slander, because it is absolutely false I threatened an Electoral Tribunal official with dismissals or any other measure. The meetings and conversations I have held with Electoral Tribunal officials have dealt with what the president can do to benefit the elections. The conversations with Electoral Tribunal officials have been limited to budgetary concerns, special credits, and making their job easier. That is the only relationship I have maintained with the Electoral Tribunal magistrates. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, the fact your wife is also running for mayor of Panama City may create a conflict of interest; what is your opinion? [Endara] I definitely have an interest. I am not going to lie and say I have no interest. I have an interest, but as president of the Republic I will not do anything in favor of that candidacy. [end recording] Meanwhile, Jaime Padilla Beliz, EL SIGLO editor, is out of the country and is unavailable for comment on the president's lawsuit. On the other hand, Endara Galimany said he met with labor leaders of the ports and tourism taxi association as well as employees of the duty-free shops to analyze the crisis generated by the closing of the so-called duty-free shops. [Begin recording] [Endara] The solution is for them to sell items that interest tourists. As is known, here in Panama there are a series of items, electronics, calculators, radios, tape recorders, etc., in which tourists are especially interested. The import duty on these items is nearly zero, precisely to attract tourists. Those shops must sell items for tourists. [end recording] The president expressed his optimism over the results of this meeting, but he did not specify when he will define the status of the duty-free shops.
