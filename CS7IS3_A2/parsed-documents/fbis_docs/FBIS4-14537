The rally, called by the Decolonization Initiative Center, adopted a written appeal to the ministry in which the participants demanded that also retired Russian military left Estonia. "From the position adopted by Russia it becomes evident that the attempt to leave the retired military in Estonia is to be dealt with as a continuing for of expansion rather than a humanitarian issue. Our security interests require that the Estonian Government abstained from bending to the pressure from Russia, but remained firm on its so far position. A compromise at the cost of Estonia's national interests must not be allowed," the document says. Juri Estam, the leader of the Decolonization Initiative, in his address to the meeting was critical of the agreement reached between Latvia and Russia. He said Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt was now trying to convince the naive that the agreement signed between Latvia and Russia was a big achievement. "We don't think so," Estam said. Estam suggested that Estonia at the talks with Russia should set additional conditions from its side rather than back down on its earlier position. The head of the Estonian Progressive Party, MP [member of parliament] Ants Erm, said it was namely the big number of retired Russian military rather than the few thousand active service troops still in Estonia that posed a major threat to the country's security. He called the retired military a Fifth Column, whose presence in Estonia Russia now tries to perpetuate by means of written agreements. MP Mart-Olav Niklus said occupation in disguise was still continuing in Estonia. It ends only after the last Russian soldier leaves the country and weapons are confiscated from non-citizens, he said.
