FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: Richard Lower or Mark Slupek, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, Room 2523&hyph;S, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, D.C. 20090&hyph;6456; telephone: (202) 720&hyph;2020, FAX (202) 720&hyph;5698. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This interim final rule is issued pursuant to the requirements of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (Act), as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), and as further amended December 12, 1989, Public Law 101&hyph;220, section 4(1), (2), 103 Stat. 1878, and August 10, 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;66, section 8b(b)(1), 107 Stat. 312. The Department is issuing this interim final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. The Department will establish a 1994&hyph;95 crop year assessment rate applicable to non-signatory handlers effective July 1, 1994&hyph;June 30, 1995. Segregation 1 farmers stock peanuts received or acquired by non-signatory handlers during that crop year will be subject to the assessment. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this interim final rule. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. There are approximately 45 handlers of peanuts who have not signed the Agreement and, thus, will be subject to the regulations proposed herein. The Small Business Administration now defines small agricultural service firms (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000 and small agricultural producers as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. A majority of non-signatory handlers and peanut producers may be classified as small entities. Since aflatoxin was found in peanuts in the mid-1960's, the domestic peanut industry has sought to minimize aflatoxin contamination in peanuts and peanut products. The Agreement was established in 1965 and plays a very important role in the industry's quality control efforts. The Peanut Administrative Committee (Committee) was established by the Agreement and works with the Department in administering the marketing agreement program. Approximately 95 percent of the area peanut crop is marketed by handlers who are signatory to the Agreement. Requirements established pursuant to the Agreement provide that farmers stock peanuts with visible Aspergillus flavus mold (the principal source of aflatoxin) must be diverted to non-edible uses. Each lot of shelled peanuts destined for edible channels must be officially sampled and chemically tested for aflatoxin by the Department or in laboratories approved by the Committee. Public Law 101&hyph;220, enacted December 12, 1989, amended section 608b of the Act to require that all peanuts handled by persons who have not entered into the Agreement (non-signers) be subject to quality and inspection requirements to the same extent and manner as are required under the Agreement. Approximately 5 percent of the U.S. peanut crop is marketed by non-signer handlers.
