Giving clarifications on the statements regarding the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations in Rajya Sabha today, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee asserted that the interest of the farmers and workers will not be affected by this treaty. Not satisfied with his clarification, almost the entire opposition staged a walkout, alleging that the government has bartered away the interests of the nation by signing the treaty. Refuting the charges of the opposition that most of the foreign investment has come into the consumer sector, he said 90 percent of the investment has been made into the core sector. Denying the charges that the center did not consult the chief ministers before signing the accord, he said he had talks with several chief ministers, including some of the non-Congress-I governments.
