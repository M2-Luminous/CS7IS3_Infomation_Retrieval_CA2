The official newspaper "NODONG SINMUN" said in a commentary that the United States and DPRK should hold their talks on the basis of mutual understanding and cooperation. It added that threats and pressure would only lead to a worse situation. The commentary stressed that only dialogue and negotiation could solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula in a just way. It also appealed to South Korea not to hamper the U.S-DPRK talks which "would seek interests for all Koreans." After two rounds of high-level talks and several contacts since last year, the two countries have reached agreements on some issues. On December 30, 1993, the United States declared that it would stop the annual "Team Spirit" joint military exercises with South Korea while DPRK agreed to accept necessary international inspections of its suspected nuclear facilities to guarantee their security. Meanwhile, the two sides agreed to hold a third round of talks on a package of plans to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.
