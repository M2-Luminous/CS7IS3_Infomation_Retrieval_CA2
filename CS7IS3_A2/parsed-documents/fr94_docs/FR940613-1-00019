FR940613-1-00019 FR940613-1-00003 A. Submission of a Full Appraisal Report The proposed rule would require State Savings Banks that propose to convert to stock ownership to submit to the FDIC, along with the other required materials, a full appraisal report on the value of the converting bank and the pricing of the conversion stock. Many of the states require that a converting mutual savings banks sell its capital stock at a total price equal to its estimated pro forma market value, based on an independent valuation. The purpose of this requirement is to assure that the converting institution receives the full value for the conversion stock sold. As indicated above and in the Request For Comments, the FDIC has identified what may be significant problems with the overall conversion process. As discussed in detail in the Request For Comments, many recent mutual-to-stock conversions have exhibited significant increases in the immediate post-conversion trading market for the stock. The FDIC is concerned that such increases have resulted from appraisal reports (submitted in connection with these recent conversions) that have set the pro forma market value significantly below the true value of the converting institution. If an appraisal is too low and the shares of stock are underpriced, the institution receives less of an increase in capital than it should from the sale of conversion stock; in addition, the deposit insurance fund is provided with less of a capital cushion than would have resulted if the stock was based on a proper and adequate appraisal. Also, an underpriced appraisal could entice insiders to undertake a conversion (in order to acquire shares below their fair value) that may not be in the best interests of the institution. Sophisticated investors also are able to benefit, undeservedly, from the sale of underpriced conversion stock. For these reasons, the proposed rule would require that a full appraisal be provided to the FDIC in a proposed mutual-to-stock conversion of a State Savings Bank. The appraisal report would have to be prepared by an independent appraiser and include a complete and detailed description of the elements that make up the report, justification for the methodology employed and sufficient support for the conclusions reached therein. This would include a full discussion of the applicability of each peer group member and documented analytical evidence supporting any variance (above or below) the converting institution may have from the peer group statistics. The FDIC would require a complete analysis of the institution's pro forma earnings which should include the bank's full potential once it fully deploys the new capital pursuant to its business plan. In reviewing appraisal reports the FDIC would continue to consider the appraisal standards and guidelines, if any, of the applicable state and/or the appraisal guidelines issued by the OTS. The FDIC generally has been disappointed with the appraisal reports it has reviewed in connection with proposed conversions. As noted above, many appraisals have set the pro forma market value of the converting institution significantly below the true value of the institution as derived from its peer group. Reasons for this have included inappropriate peer-group selections, inconsistencies between the analysis in the appraisal report and the business plan submitted with the conversion notice and continued unfounded justification for new issue discounts in stock issuances that have been well oversubscribed. The FDIC has noted that appraisals lack specific detail on the inclusion of peer group members regarding particular information on: the markets within which they operate; the adjustments made to normalize their earnings or design comparable pro forma earnings; and the price appreciations experienced by each member since its conversion. Converting institutions are almost always considered inferior to the peer group_a fact which raises questions about the composition of the peer group. Little or no analytical evidence is typically given in appraisals for the discounts suggested for the converting institution compared to the peer members. In addition, every appraisal contains a new issue discount without any analytical support for exactly how much that discount should be or why it is needed. Our analysis indicates market activity where virtually every conversion has traded up over the last few years. Finally, when subscription offerings are completed and oversubscriptions have occurred (in some case, quite substantially) appraisers have not justified why the original appraisal should not be increased beyond the ``supermax'' but rather in virtually every case confirm the original valuation.
