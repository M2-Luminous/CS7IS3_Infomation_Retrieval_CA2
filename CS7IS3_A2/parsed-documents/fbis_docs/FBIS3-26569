A pilot scheme of this program will be implemented this year in eight provinces, said Vice-Minister of Labor Zhu Jiazhen. The provinces for the try-out are either populous but less developed inland provinces such as Sichuan and Anhui, or coastal provinces of Guangdong and Jiangsu, which are short of labor because of rapid economic development, Zhu said. The scheme focuses on the development of small rural industrial districts and rural towns -- enlarging the existing ones and establishing new ones -- to take in extra laborers from their own regions, he added. The move will also narrow the gap between rural and urban areas, said the vice-minister. Other laborers could migrate to more developed coastal regions, he said, noting that an inter-provincial labor migration plan started last year has achieved initial successes. China now has 130 million surplus rural laborers, and in eight years the rural areas will have 70 million new laborers, the vice-minister said. The employment program was designed by the Labor Ministry, the Agriculture Ministry and the State Council Development and Research Center.
