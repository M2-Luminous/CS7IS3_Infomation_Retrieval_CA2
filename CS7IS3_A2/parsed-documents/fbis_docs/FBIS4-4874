FBIS4-4874 "dreas066_l_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-066 Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 Philippines NPA: `Large Areas' Reclaimed From Government NPA: `Large Areas' Reclaimed From Government BK0504042194 Quezon City MALAYA in English 30 Mar 94 p 2 BK0504042194 Quezon City MALAYA English BFN [By Chit Estella] [Text] The New People's Army (NPA) has resumed its small tactical offensives and has succeeded in getting back under its control large areas that were previously wrested from it by government forces. In a statement issued on the NPA's 25th anniversary, the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) admitted that the leftist underground movement has suffered reverses because of errors which it attributed to those who were subsequently expelled from the party. But Gregorio "Ka [Comrade] Roger" Rosal, CPP spokesman, said yesterday, "Kasabay ng Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas at National Democratic Front, and Bagong Hukbong Bayan ay nagpapatupad ngayon ng kilusang pagwawasto upang puspusang maiwaksi ang mga kamalian sa maaga at di masustening pagpapataas ng antas ng gera at paglalaro sa insureksyon, at upang mapangibabawan ang mga pinsalang dulot ng mga kamaliang iyon [Alongside the Communist Party of the Philippines and the National Democratic Front, the New People's Army is implementing rectifications in order to correct errors as early as possible and to avoid elevating a war that we cannot sustain to a higher level and mocking insurrection; it is also to indemnify the havoc brought about by these errors." As a result of its rectification efforts, Rosal said, "Sa iba't ibang dako muling sumisigla ang mga taktikal na opensiba na isinasagawa ng mga relatibong maliliit na yunit ng Bagong Hukbong Bayan na umaasikaso kapwa sa gawaing masa at gawaing militar. Malalawak na erya ang muling nababawi sa pamamagitang puspusang gawaing masa [In different areas, tactical offensives launched by smaller units of the New People's Army which have charge of both military and civic activities are gaining momentum. We have regained wide areas through intensified civic activities]." He did not say which areas have returned to rebel control but indicated that the Ramos government has not been successful in crushing the rebellion as it claims.
