Papoulias, current chairman of European Union's Ministerial Council, told reporters here the Council may be asked to provide European troops to an international protection force for the Israeli-occupied territories. Papoulias, a long-time friend of 'Arafat, is to brief the Council next Monday to report the results of his tour of Tunisia, Jordan, Israel, Egypt and Syria. The minister said he contacted several European colleagues after his talks here late Tuesday with the PLO chief to tell them of 'Arafat's demands. An aide to Papoulias added that 'Arafat was "in agony" over the massacre and its consequences for negotiations aimed at launching the autonomy accord, which is almost three months behind schedule. He "was not very talkative, kept hammering his preconditions" for restarting the autonomy talks, particularly "security guarantees and the disarming of the settlers." Papoulias told 'Arafat that the European Union was "making every effort to ensure that the dialogue goes on." "The tragic events of Hebron have created a new situation. It will have to be overcome through new measures," Papoulias said. The Greek foreign minister also discussed the Hebron massacre and the autonomy talks with Tunisian President Ben Ali and Foreign Minister Habib Ben Yahya. Papoulias was to visit Tel Aviv later Wednesday to meet with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who has held several negotiating sessions with 'Arafat. The PLO has spurned a call from U.S. President Bill Clinton to hold snap negotiations to finalise an autonomy deal with Israel, while Jordan, Lebanon and Syria broke off talks with Israel in support. 'Arafat said Tuesday he would insist on UN guarantees to protect the Palestinians before resuming peace talks. 'Arafat's "bottom line" included the dispatch of international peacekeepers, disarming the settlers and dismantling some settlements. In New York, the UN Security Council was still struggling over a resolution on the massacre while Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali pushed for a UN presence to keep the peace in the territories.
