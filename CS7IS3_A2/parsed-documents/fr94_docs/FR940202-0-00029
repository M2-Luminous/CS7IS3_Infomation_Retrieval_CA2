FR940202-0-00029 FR940202-0-00005 (4) Setoff allocation rule. If a taxpayer meets the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section with respect to some, but not all of the allocations made under section 482, then for purposes of determining the net section 482 adjustment, setoffs, as taken into account under §1.482&hyph;1T(e)(5), must be applied ratably against all such allocations. The following example illustrates the principle of this paragraph (c)(4). Example. (i) The Internal Revenue Service makes the following section 482 adjustments for the taxable year: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ (1) $9,000,000 (2) 6,000,000 (3) Because of a setoff under §1.482&hyph;1T(e)(5) (5,000,000) n,s Total section 482 adjustments 10,000,000 (ii) The taxpayer meets the requirements of paragraph (d) with respect to adjustment number one, but not with respect to adjustment number two. The five million dollar setoff will be allocated ratably against the nine million dollar adjustment ($9,000,000/$15,000,000 × $5,000,000 = $3,000,000) and the six million dollar adjustment ($6,000,000/$15,000,000 × $5,000,000 = $2,000,000). Accordingly, in determining the net section 482 adjustment, the nine million dollar adjustment is reduced to six million dollars ($9,000,000 ^ $3,000,000) and the six million dollar adjustment is reduced to four million dollars ($6,000,000 ^ $2,000,000). Therefore, the net section 482 adjustment equals four million dollars. (5) Gross receipts. For purposes of this section, gross receipts must be computed pursuant to the rules contained in §1.448&hyph;1T(f)(2)(iv), as adjusted to reflect allocations under section 482. (6) Coordination with reasonable cause exception under section 6664(c). Pursuant to section 6662(e)(3)(D), a taxpayer will be treated as having reasonable cause under section 6664(c) for any portion of an underpayment attributable to a net section 482 adjustment only if the taxpayer meets the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section with respect to that portion. (7) Examples. The principles of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following examples. Example 1. (i) The Internal Revenue Service makes the following section 482 adjustments for the taxable year: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ (1) Attributable to an increase in gross income because of an increase in royalty payments $2,000,000 (2) Attributable to an increase in sales proceeds due to a decrease in the profit margin of a related buyer 2,500,000 (3) Attributable to a decrease in the cost of goods sold because of a decrease in the cost plus mark-up of a related seller 2,000,000 n,s Total section 482 adjustments 6,500,000 (ii) None of the adjustments are excluded under paragraph (d) of this section. The net section 482 adjustment ($6.5 million) is greater than five million dollars. Therefore, there is a substantial valuation misstatement. Example 2. (i) The Internal Revenue Service makes the following section 482 adjustments for the taxable year: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ (1) $11,000,000 (2) 2,000,000 (3) Because of a setoff under §1.482&hyph;1T(e)(5) 9,000,000) n,s Total section 482 adjustments 4,000,000 (ii) The taxpayer has gross receipts of sixty million dollars after taking into account all section 482 adjustments. None of the adjustments are excluded under paragraph (d) of this section. The net section 482 adjustment ($4 million) is less than the lesser of five million dollars or ten percent of gross receipts ($60 million × 10% = $6 million). Therefore, there is no substantial valuation misstatement. Example 3. (i) The Internal Revenue Service makes the following section 482 adjustments to the income of an affiliated group that files a consolidated return for the taxable year:
