In an article carried in the "PEOPLE'S DAILY" today, Xie said the province's gross domestic product last year increased by 12.8 percent over the previous year, its industrial output value by 20.9 percent, and its agricultural output value by 1.5 percent, despite natural disasters. "However, we must be clear about the fact that the development of Sichuan is still behind that of the coastal provinces," Xie noted. According to Xie, 1994 is a key year for China to develop its socialist market economy, and Sichuan has pledged to increase its gross domestic product by 9.6 percent and industrial and agricultural output value by 12.8 percent. "To accomplish the objective," the secretary said, "Sichuan, with a territory of 570,000 sq [square] km and a population of more than 100 million, must rely on itself." The secretary encouraged localities to open wider to the outside world in order to boost its economy. Last year saw the province succeed in holding a number of trade seminars in Hong Kong, Macao, Thailand and the Republic of Korea. It imported investment totalling more than two billion U.S. dollars and set up 1,900 foreign-funded enterprises. More and more international financial groups are showing interest in tapping the province's energy resources and improving its transportation facilities. In addition, Sichuan has made progress in exports, overseas labor service, opening enterprises abroad and tourism, Xie revealed.
