Forced into a corner, the DPRK realized in time that the opportunities of the 20th century were giving it a chance to alter the playing conditions and offer its enemy the following choice: either exist together or perish together. International inspection teams from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) were called upon to clarify the nature of North Korea's nuclear program. However, the experience of such inspections in Iraq and the Republic of South Africa show that the methods used by the IAEA are not always effective. The increased attention devoted by the international community to nuclear facilities in Yongbyon seems excessive if only for the reason that these facilities are located on the Earth's surface. The maniacal secrecy used by the North Koreans to surround far less important defense programs enables us to assume that the nuclear program, if one exists, is being carried out in a deep underground location, inaccessible to satellite observation. It cannot be ruled out that several nuclear devices, even of unpurified uranium, the manufacture of which does not require application of refined technologies, are already being stored somewhere in the womb of one or several of the numerous mountains covering northern Korea. The facilities at Yongbyon constitute probably the second, or even third phase of North Korea's nuclear program. At present, this program probably envisages, first of all, the accumulation of stores of plutonium to build not bombs, but rather more compact nuclear warheads for missiles. Secondly, it is designed to compel the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea to be more tractable. It appears the North does not have suicidal plans to use such a weapon--if one has already been built--to attack the South. At the same time, we can be equally assured that the Kim clan will resort to every means available to avoid a repetition of the fate that befell the Ceausescu and Honecker families. The North has sent a clear signal to the South, and to the West at the same time: Leave us alone--we will not permit you to act this way with our leaders. It is apparent that in order to peacefully resolve the problem, historical compromise must be achieved between the ruling elites of the two portions of the country. If this takes place, inspections between the Koreas might prove effective. A second objective of Pyongyang's use of the nuclear card is to obtain diplomatic recognition by the United States and other Western countries and ensure access to new sources of capital and technologies. Pyongyang understands that in order to legitimize the Korean model of socialism, it must be made economically viable, or at least appear economically viable. These new sources can be found only in the West. But it is clear that the West will not embark upon the development of trade and economic relations with the DPRK without U.S. permission. For North Korea, diplomatic relations with the United States will be valuable only to the extent that they contribute towards the withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea. The U.S. military presence is seen in Pyongyang as the major obstacle to realization of its plans to reunite the country. The first phase of this concept envisages the organization of an "insurrection" by South Koreans against the "puppet clique"; the second phase consists of the rendering of "assistance" to the rebels by the North, "at their request" of course. Meanwhile, there is growing discontent in Seoul with the fact that the Republic of Korea finds itself pushed aside from the solution to a problem of such vital importance to it as the nuclear issue. Seoul is also clearly irritated by the artificial excitation of tension surrounding the nuclear problem. The United States is particularly guilty of this and has been forced to publicly explain to the American people, including from the highest level, that the threat of attack by North Korea against the South, or of the emergence of military conflict for other reasons, is not very likely at present. There are those who lean towards transferring the nuclear problem to the United Nations Security Council for its examination and subjecting North Korea to sanctions. Statements also resound regarding the possibility of a military strike. The logical conclusion of any sanctions could be a second Korean War. Taking into consideration the revolution in armaments following the Korean War of the 1950's, the consequences of new military actions on the peninsula would be catastrophic for Korea, and perhaps for its neighbors as well. Will China, Russia, and even Japan permit the construction of another Chernobyl in direct proximity to their borders? It is not very likely that the People's Republic of China would agree to the formation of a united Korea under the dominant political and economic influence of its traditional enemies--the United States and Japan. Especially now--with a socialist regime being maintained in the PRC and the Communist Party in power. But that is exactly what will happen if the DPRK swiftly collapses. For China, handing the DPRK over to the "imperialists" would mean the undermining of its confidence and prestige in Asia, which Chinese political figures have fought for centuries to achieve. It would be far more advantageous to Beijing if the little North Korean bear cub continued to rather insolently pull on the whiskers of the huge tiger across the ocean, as if to convince the entire world, first of all, that the famous Chinese proverb about the paper tiger is correct and, secondly, that even a small Asian country--if it is an ally of China, of course, or under China's patronage--may feel a sense of relative security even in the face of threats from such a superpower as the United States. This is especially true in view of the fact that now, thanks to United States interest in getting assistance from the PRC to resolve the nuclear problem, Beijing has managed to force Washington to tone down its rhetoric on an issue most sensitive to China--the human rights question. In the light of China's position, the idea of convening an international conference on the nuclear problem raises certain questions. Does it make any sense for China to publicly unite with Russia and the United States in exerting pressure on its ally? Beijing has always preferred to act alone and behind the scenes. Will the DPRK, like any other country, agree to participate in a forum which threatens to turn into a trial of one of the participants by the others? In addition, North Korea is categorically opposed to the presence here of its former mother-state, Japan. Finally, no matter how deplorable it may be, not the United States nor Japan, not even China, has any burning desire to help Russia get more of a say in the matter of a Korean settlement or with respect to the Asia-Pacific region overall. In this regard, it seems absolutely necessary for Russia to operationally distance itself from the politics of other states on the nuclear problem and to develop its own approach with respect to both this issue and the Korean problem overall, an approach which would take into account to the greatest extent Russia's national interests in this region.
