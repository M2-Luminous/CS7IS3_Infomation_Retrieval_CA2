FR941206-1-00076 FR941206-1-00007 The Work Practice Work Group explored the methods currently being used by facilities in the source category to control HAP emissions from cleaning and washoff. They used the survey responses collected by the EPA and the industry group, the experience of personnel from a State Office of Waste Reduction on the Work Group that had worked with wood furniture manufacturers, and the experience of those involved in the manufacture of products in one or more of the industry segments. The Work Practice Work Group concluded (and the Committee concurred) that there were work practices in use by existing facilities in the source category to limit emissions from washoff operations and each major cleaning activity: gun/line cleaning, spray booth cleaning, and general cleaning activities. i. Gun/line cleaning. The cleaning of spray guns and of lines that carry finishing material, solvent, and adhesives from storage to the spray guns is a common practice in wood furniture operations. Cleaning is necessary so that dried resins or other materials do not build up in the lines or spray equipment. The frequency of cleaning varies by plant depending on the different types of material sprayed with a given gun, the extent to which a gun is used, and other plant-specific factors. Typically, a gun is cleaned each time it is used to spray a different material. If a gun is dedicated to one type of finishing material (e.g., topcoat), cleaning frequency may be reduced. The practice of dedicating a gun to a particular coating type is not common, however, especially at smaller shops that have fewer spray stations. One work practice that the Work Practice Work Group agreed could be universally applied was the collection of solvent used for cleaning in a container that can be closed. For example, if a line is flushed, the cleaning solvent could be collected into a normally closed container. Another work practice that the Work Practice Work Group agreed could be easily implemented is the covering of cleaning solvent containers when not in use. As discussed for storage containers associated with finishing and gluing operations, such a practice is straightforward and inexpensive. ii. Spray booth cleaning. In addition to the emission limits identified for strippable spray booth coatings in Table 3, the Work Practice Work Group believed that the proposed rule should prohibit the use of organic solvents for spray booth cleaning except in limited circumstances. Sources subject to this rule could comply by using strippable spray booth coatings that meet the VOC limits identified in Table 3, thereby reducing the use of organic solvents for this purpose. The Work Practice Work Group acknowledged that there were instances in which solvent was necessary. Specifically, it was agreed that conveyors carrying furniture or furniture components through the spray booth and continuous coaters and their enclosures could continue to be cleaned with solvent. Likewise, organic solvent can continue to be used to clean the metal filters located in the spray booth. Neither the Work Practice Work Group members nor the rest of the Committee members were aware of substitute materials that could be used for cleaning this equipment, or of any strippable coating such as the coating that is available for the spray booth walls. Additionally, industry representatives pointed out that small tears and holes may be generated in the strippable booth coating during the manufacturing process. In these cases, some staining of the spray booth walls may occur. The Committee agreed that sources could use small quantities of solvent, no more than 1.0 gallon per booth, to clean these areas when the strippable booth coating was being replaced. iii. Furniture washoff. Another area of concern that the Work Practice Work Group focused on was a practice known in the industry as washoff. Washoff is the practice of removing coating from a piece of furniture or a furniture component. The main reason for washoff is that the finish does not meet company specifications. By washing off the coatings, the substrate can be refinished. Washoff is typically accomplished by dipping the furniture into a tank containing organic solvent; the same solvents used for cleaning are usually used for washoff. The Work Practice Work Group agreed that there were some measures that sources could implement at almost no cost that could limit emissions from washoff. As with finishing and other cleaning operations, the Work Practice Work Group agreed that covering washoff tanks when they are not in use would limit emissions. Also, sources could minimize dripping by tilting and/or rotating the piece to drain as much solvent as possible back into the tank. iv. General cleaning/washoff activities. During the Work Practice Work Group discussions, it was apparent that cleaning and washoff practices are not well documented by sources. For example, most sources do not know the quantity of solvent used for cleaning and washoff operations, how many pieces are washed off, and the fate of spent solvent from cleaning and washoff operations. The Work Practice Work Group agreed that one of the first steps in reducing emissions is to know the quantity of solvent used for the various operations onsite. Only then can a source identify operations that are wasteful or inefficient. Therefore, the Work Practice Work Group proposed that the work practices in the proposed rule require a cleaning and washoff solvent accounting system. Under this system, sources would have to: 1. Maintain a log of the quantity and type of solvent used for washoff and cleaning, the number of pieces washed off, and the reason for the washoff; 2. Record the quantity of spent solvent generated from each activity, and its ultimate fate either onsite or offsite;
