The two countries confirmed the mutual efforts during sheet glass talks resumed under the trade "Framework" negotiations, an official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) told a press conference. "Both parties agreed to continue constructive talks for further penetration by imported sheet glass in this country," the official said. The official noted the two parties agreed to meet again in July or shortly after the Naples summit of the group of seven leading industrialized nations. During Thursday's meeting, the first since December last year, Japanese negotiators explained that the volume-based share of foreign-made sheet glass in the Japanese market increased to 5.6 percent in 1993 from 4.9 percent the previous year, according to the official. The Japanese negotiators were also quoted as saying the number of Japanese wholesalers handling foreign sheet glass rose to 39 at the end of last December from 17 in June 1992. At present, there are 400 sheet glass wholesalers in Japan. The Japanese side said it has taken steps to open Japan's sheet glass market in line with an action plan introduced two years ago, the official said. The Japanese sheet glass industry will send a trade mission to the U.S. in August to study the U.S. distribution system, according to the official. Sheet glass trade is among a basket of existing trade pacts under the framework talks. The trade talks were launched in September last year, and held in October and December. But the talks were suspended following the Feb. 11 collapse of the summit between then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
