FR940628-0-00037 FR940628-0-00017 Discussion: The Secretary agrees with the commenter. Changes: None. Comments: Two commenters asked if this section should be revised to exclude those agencies that are determined to qualify for Exceptional Performer status. Discussion: Designation as an Exceptional Performer means that a guaranty agency has shown a high level of compliance with the provisions of 34 CFR 682.410. That section of the regulations focuses on the default collection process, not the results of the process. Section 682.409 establishes standards that focus on outcomes as expressed in fiscal year loan type recovery rates. The Secretary believes that the collection of defaulted FFEL loans is important and should be governed by both process and outcome requirements. The Secretary does not believe that excusing guaranty agencies from complying with outcome requirements because they have complied (even to a high degree) with process requirements would adequately protect the Federal fiscal interest. Changes: None. Comments: A commenter asked if these provisions would force guaranty agencies to evaluate their entire preclaim and default collection operations, in order to achieve the highest recovery rate. Discussion: The Secretary agrees that guaranty agencies need to evaluate their default prevention and default collection operations. These regulations represent the initial attempt by the Secretary, in consultation with the guaranty agencies, to establish default collection performance standards. The Secretary believes that it is in the Department's and the guaranty agencies' best interest to establish default prevention performance standards as soon as practicable. Changes: None. Comments: A commenter observed that guaranty agencies will be required to monitor their operations constantly, indicating that it will be more difficult for an agency to continue producing recoveries over the 80 percent standard required by the regulations. The commenter noted that once the Secretary imposes additional assignment requirements on agencies that fall below the 80 percent standard, this provision will automatically increase the average recovery rate on which the 80 percent is based. Discussion: The Secretary agrees that guaranty agencies will have to constantly monitor their operations to satisfy these standards. The Secretary also expects that the assignment process based on recovery rate standards will result in the gradual, steady increase in the average recovery rate. Changes: None. Comments: A commenter observed that this section does not require the Department to load and begin collection on defaulted loans assigned to it within a specified time period. Collection activity could cease for months while an account is being processed. The commenter noted that it is in the Department's best interest to ensure that this gap in collection activities is minimized by providing specific time periods to begin the collection of new accounts. Discussion: The Secretary agrees that it is desirable to load assigned accounts quickly so that gaps in collection activity are minimized. While these regulations do not control this process, the Secretary intends to loan assigned accounts as quickly as possible. Changes: None. Section 682.409(a)(2)(i) Comments: A commenter observed that participation in the IRS offset program is required by the Department and recommended that offset collections be included in calculating the recovery rate standards. The commenter believed that this will help assure guarantor participation in the IRS offset program to the maximum extent possible. Discussion: The Secretary agrees with the commenter. However, the Secretary notes that the regulations do not reflect the requirement that guaranty agencies participate in the Federal Income Tax Refund Offset program. The Secretary has modified the regulations to reflect this requirement. Changes: Section 682.409(a)(2)(i) has been revised to reference collections by Federal Income Tax Refund Offset. Section 682.409(a)(3)(i)(B) Comments: A few commenters suggested that the Secretary amend the appeals process for failure to meet performance standards. They asked that the Secretary either permit agencies that have a large number of borrowers making ``reasonable and affordable'' payments as a result of the borrowers' financial circumstances to appeal on that basis or that these loans be excluded entirely from the calculation. Discussion: The Secretary agrees with the commenters that the regulations should be revised to encourage compliance with the provisions in §682.401(b)(4) and §682.405 requiring guaranty agencies to provide certain borrowers with ``reasonable and affordable'' payment plans. However, the Secretary believes that excluding loans with ``reasonable and affordable'' payment plans from the calculation would place an unnecessary reporting burden on the guaranty agencies, as well as increase the costs that would be incurred by the Department associated with collecting and auditing the data. The Department will provide a guaranty agency with the opportunity to demonstrate how ``reasonable and affordable'' payment arrangements have affected its recovery rate. The Department will make a determination on an acceptable agency recovery rate on an agency-by-agency basis. The agency will be required to identify all borrower accounts for which required reasonable and affordable payment amounts have impacted the agency's collection recovery rate. The Department will examine a sample of these accounts to determine how this should be assessed in determining the agency's recovery rate. Changes: The Secretary has revised §682.409(a)(3)(i)(B) to provide that the Federal interest will be served if the agency demonstrates that its compliance with §682.401(b)(4) and §682.405 has reduced substantially its fiscal year loan type recovery rate or rates. Section 682.409(a)(3)(i)(C)(2) Comments: A commenter suggested that as the paragraph is not describing a mathematical derivation, the word ``categorized'' is more appropriate. Discussion: The Secretary agrees with the commenter. Changes: Section 682.409(a)(3)(i)(C)(2) has been revised to replace ``divided'' with ``categorized.'' Section 682.409(c)(1) Comments: A few commenters asked if §682.409(c)(1) needs to specify the manner, information, and documentation necessary for mandatory assignment. Discussion: The Secretary considered expanding §682.409(c)(1) to incorporate the manual assignment and computer tape assignment procedures that are transmitted to the guaranty agencies each year by mail. However, the Secretary believes that this informal notification process has worked particularly well over the last two years, in part because it has been accomplished without the burden presented by the regulatory process. He believes that the current procedures have provided for a flexible process that has been responsive to changing guaranty agency and Departmental needs. Therefore, the Secretary has decided not to expand these regulations to include operational procedures associated with mandatory assignment.
