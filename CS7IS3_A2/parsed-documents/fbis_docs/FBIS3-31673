Foreign Aid Minister Helle Degn has a pool of 45 million kroner [6 million dollars] ready and is calling a meeting to decide on distribution of the funds. [passage omitted] The 45 million kroner will be provided to the Albanians over the next three years, and Degn will invite Danish foreign aid organizations and a Danish consulting group, with EU [European Union] Parliament member Freddy Blak (Social Democrat) as chairman, to a meeting on 31 January to decide how the funds are to be distributed. "Until now we have only granted humanitarian aid of between 2 and 4 million kroner, but the effort needs to be coordinated and targeted correctly," said Degn. "I think we must support the weakest, and this means orphaned children and the handicapped, and to set up an Albanian legal system." The Albanian Government on Sunday [16 January], asked for Danish help in drawing up a comprehensive plan for taking care of the mentally handicapped of that poor country. A comprehensive plan for psychiatric and mental retardation care will be the largest Danish system export ever, amounting to hundreds of million [kroner], and the plan will include decentralizing from Tirana, training of Albanian personnel, and establishing of new housing through [the private] ASF Danish Folkehjaelp. The Danish consulting group, which received a request for help from the Albanian Ministry of Health following an inspection of badly deteriorating hospitals, is gathering funds for the project from, among other sources, already appropriated EU loans. "We have broad experience in the decentralizing of institutions for the develpmentally impaired, and the Albanians wanted our model," said former Director of Social Services Alfred Dam, who has just returned home from Albania and is in the process of drafting a report on the shocking conditions in Albanian institutions.
