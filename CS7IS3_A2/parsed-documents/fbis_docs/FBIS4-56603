FBIS4-56603 "drlat088_j_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-088 Daily Report 4 May 1994 Panama Cuban Official Charges Document Fake Cuban Official Charges Document Fake PA0505223894 Panama City ACAN in Spanish 2108 GMT 4 May 94 PA0505223894 Panama City ACAN Spanish BFN [Text] Panama City, 4 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Miguel Martinez, charge d'affaires of the Cuban Embassy, stated today that the document on which a legislator based his accusation that Fidel Castro's government is meddling in Panama's domestic affairs is counterfeit. The Cuban diplomat, who is his government's top representative in Panama, stated at a news conference that the document on which legislator Leo Gonzalez based his charges is "counterfeit, spurious, and prefabricated." Martinez noted that the bogus document, which reached the Cuban Embassy through "a friendly Panamanian," was delivered by him on 25 April to Panamanian Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero. He warned Cordero about the possibility that it might be used as part of "a disinformation campaign." The document links ranking members of the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) and members of the Papa Egoro Movement with operations to exchange drugs for weapons in Cuba, legislator Gonzalez revealed. Spokesmen for both parties noted that Gonzalez's charges are the result of his low vote expectations in the upcoming election, in which he is up for reelection and, according to political polls, could very well lose. The Cuban charge d'affaires noted today that the document features forged signatures of Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; Panamanian Consul Robert Infante; and Hector Hernandez Pardo, director of the Superior Institute of Foreign Relations of Cuba. To enable reporters to confirm the forged signatures, he showed them official Foreign Ministry documents with the signatures of the officials, which were different from those contained in the controversial document. "They do not match. They have been altered and forged," Martinez said, insisting that the Cuban Embassy "wants to resolve this matter." "We have been and will continue to be objective, and we do not meddle in Panama's domestic affairs," the diplomat stated, describing as "irresponsible" the manipulation of such an "extremely delicate" issue that could affect relations between two states. Miguel Martinez explained that the "counterfeit documents" were available months ago in the Panamanian capital, and he added that people whose identity he did not know were asking up to $20,000 to sell them. Since the U.S. Army invasion on 20 December 1989, relations between Cuba and Panama have been maintained at a nominal level without any diplomatic representative at embassy level.
