From our associate. Whenever you think that it will be easy for you to do something, it usually turns out to be an unsolvable problem, says one of Murphy's Laws, which, whether the Croats like it or not, could have been invented precisely for the "presidium of Catholicism," as President Tudjman likes so much to call Croatia. Why? Just a few days after the signing of the famous declaration on the normalization of Croatian-Serbian relations and on the day that Milan Martic was proclaimed president of the Krajina, something else extremely important happened. Specifically, as we have learned from reliable sources, an agreement was concluded at Plitvice on joint action by the intelligence and counterintelligence services of the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK], the republic of Srpska [RS], and the FRY. At the same time, it is also the first step toward the official merger of the "Serbian republics" and the FRY into one state. After this step, the establishment of a joint command for the armed forces is planned; at first, it will only involve coordinating their work. Then, by March 1995 at the latest, the three current armies (the Yugoslav Army, the RS army, and the Serbian army of the Krajina) will also officially become one army. How important the agreement to merge the intelligence services is to the FRY is also demonstrated by the fact that the chief of the FRY's military intelligence service, General Aleksandar Dimitrijevic, and his assistant for the counterintelligence service, Radenko Radinovic, were in Korenica personally, and General Bosko Kelecevic, Milan Gvero, and Milisav Gagovic also attended the meeting on behalf of the "Serbian armies." Just a few days before, representatives of the newly established Russian intelligence service, the SVR, visited Knin. According to the protocol on joint action by the intelligence services, they decided on this step for the sake of "effective fulfillment of short-term and long-term strategic and security interests, and more effective guarantees of internal and external security." The joint intelligence service will have four administrations: an administration for external relations, an administration for analyses and investigations, an operational administration, and an external security service. The counterintelligence service will also operate as part of the operational administration. The center of the administration will be in Pancevo, and there will be "branches" in Banja Luka, Pale, Knin, and Petrinja. The "branches" will consist of groups that will each have 12 operatives/commanders, operatives who will take care of coordination, and advisers on artillery, engineering, the air force, and the infantry. A branch will be headed by a coordinator whose task will be cooperation with "headquarters." The "branches," in addition to their own coordinators, will also have a joint coordinator, who will officially head the intelligence services of the RS and RSK. General Bosko Kelecevic will be appointed to that position, and his deputy will be Smiljan Geric, who recently came from Belgrade. Both of them are adherents of Ratko Mladic, and are considered the most competent and most intelligent soldiers of the RS. In Knin, the (counter)intelligence service will reportedly be completely reorganized. That task has been entrusted to Generals Nedeljko Boskovic and Vuk Obradovic, who sharply attacked the Knin military leadership in their first reports. In the future the Knin intelligence officers will not be able to act independently. At best, they will receive assignments from Boskovic or Kelecevic. The coordinator (Kelecevic) will decide on wiretaps and investigations, while the important fact is, above all, that intelligence officers from Knin will not be informed about certain actions (read: most actions)--even if Martic or General Novakovic, commander of the RSK army, were to be wiretapped or investigated.
