Lebedev; place and date not given: "Conversion Needs a Strong Legal Base"] [Excerpts] [Lebedev] Since the definition of conversion by some media is pretty vague, could you specify the meaning of this word? What are the goals of conversion and since when has it been under way? [Tushinskiy] Speaking about conversion, it is very important that we distinguish between changing the profile of defense industry enterprises and exploiting their capacity -- as a result of trimming the Belarusian Armed Forces potential -- for civilian needs. Both are otherwise connected with the Army. Of course, the goals of these two directions of conversion are different. Conversion in the defense industry enterprises is designed to reduce military production and reorient their capacity and employees, which were left without any work, toward civilian production. On the other hand, conversion of military potential is aimed at consistently engaging the Army's part of scientific and human potential, available as a result of military scale-downs, in the social sphere of industry. Both directions began in 1991 and are proceeding in several stages. This year marks the beginning of a transitional period. Today, the scientific and technical support of conversion is on the agenda. [Lebedev] Do those conversion programs have specific managers? [Tushinskiy] We established conversion departments at the State Industrial Committee and the Ministry of Economy, as well as the Department of International Security and Disarmament at the Foreign Ministry. Their role is limited to providing expert judgment concerning proposed programs. Legally, all enterprises, including those working for the military, are independent; so they bear single-handed responsibility for conversion, as well. Our ministry has the Conversion of Military Facilities Department. Technically, the "pie" of responsibility for conversion seems to be carved up. However, the industry covered by conversion is very important as it is closely linked with national security. This is why this industry has no place for the provincial mindset. Conversion must be managed by a single center which would coordinate efforts of all links of the conversion chain, including the Defense Ministry and enterprises. For this purpose, we have already sent the Cabinet of Ministers a proposal to set up the State Commission for Conversion and Military Industrial Questions that could become such a center. [passage omitted] [Lebedev] Conversion of defense industry enterprises reduces military orders. The intention is clear: One is supposed to live by his means and spend money wisely. I am wondering, however, where are the limits beyond which a drop in production is inadmissible? After all, we are putting at risk our national defense potential. [Tushinskiy] Of course, one should not live beyond his means. However, the fact is that more than half the industrial capacity of developed countries is dedicated to the defense of their states, compared with only 4 percent in Belarus. Unfortunately, we have long overstepped those limits. There are many reasons for this. The reduction of military orders was caused by the collapse on the domestic market of Russia's Defense Exports Committee, with which we cooperated. However, we must not let conversion devour something that we will need tomorrow to maintain our combat readiness -- our high technology and the expertise of our professionals. The military industry needs orders. To get them, our state should make bolder efforts to enter those foreign markets where our technology is more advanced. However, some of our politicians do not think about it. The most important thing for them is to play their political card and make a career. Take, for example, Deputy Lukashenko, who said that by trading in arms Belarus discredits itself as a neutral country. He is doing a great disservice to his country and its combat readiness. I do not know about his professional skills, but he does not seem to understand the principles of a market economy and conditions that are vital for our combat readiness. If anyone, a deputy must understand this. [passage omitted] [Lebedev] As we know, the Belarusian conversion plan is carried out with the help of U.S. investments as part of the U.S. Nunn-Lugar act. Can you say a few words about its goals and advantages? [Tushinskiy] In the opinion of U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry, the financing of our conversion plans removes the nuclear threat to the United States on the part of Belarus. The Americans have earmarked $20 million for this purpose. However, this aid does not come in the form of money. They directly put their investments into the reequipment of our enterprises and retraining of our personnel. The joint conversion plans primarily cover Minsk defense giants, such as "Integral," the "Computing Equipment" Science and Production Amalgamation, and BelOMO. This promotes the integration of Belarusian enterprises into the world market. So it is to each side's advantage. This year, Belarus will receive a total of $100 million. [Lebedev] America called upon its allies to join the Belarusian conversion program. Did it receive any response? [Tushinskiy] Yes, as of today, we have received a response from Japan. Our governments signed an agreement securing $5 million for Belarus to conduct a number of measures preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, including the installment of ecologically safe storage conditions for radioactive substances. [Lebedev] Defense enterprises in all countries are closed to unasked eyes, especially foreign. In Belarus, foreign specialists were invited to work at these kind of facilities. Do we not fear for our super-advanced technologies? [Tushinskiy] Let me disagree with you on only one thing. Western defense enterprises are open, even to foreign eyes. I myself had the chance to visit a couple of them as a member of military delegations. The production process at such sites is exactly the same as at civilian enterprises. The time of "underground plants" is long past. Presently, enterprises protect only the most advanced technologies, which you cannot see with a trained eye. Generally speaking, so-called intellectual property should be protected by law. Belarus has not yet developed such a law. So, we will guard our national "know-how" with a package of administrative measures. [Lebedev] The collapse of the Soviet Union introduced substantial corrections into the material and technical support of the Belarusian Armed Forces. But we still need weapons, equipment, ammunition, and production. Do the national conversion programs take this into account? [Tushinskiy] By all means. For example, the Minsk Automobile Plant is finishing development work on two models of transportation vehicles for our Armed Forces. [Lebedev] Has the conversion of Belarusian defense enterprises and the military potential of the Belarusian Armed Forces produced any specific results? [Tushinskiy] I think it would be more correct for me to simply point to a number of enterprises which have successfully changed their profiles. These are first of all our leaders, BelOMO and "Integral." The Homel Radio Equipment Plant has also succeeded in this. What should be noted about this plant is that until recently, it turned out 90 percent of all military production. Now, it manufactures the same amount of civilian products. As part of the conversion process, the Lida Optics Plant now manufactures glass lenses instead of optical equipment for space. The U.S.-Belarusian "Belkonvers" joint venture can also be called a fruit of conversion. Based on U.S. technology, it recycles conventional ammunition. Also deserving of attention is the experience of the "Transaviaeksport" company, which employs IL-76 transportation aircraft to train military crews and fill commercial transportation orders serving the Republic's interests.
