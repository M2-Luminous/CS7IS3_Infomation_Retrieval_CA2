FR940404-0-00026 FR940404-0-00013 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Anne-Marie Cooney of the Regional/State/Local Coordination Section at (202) 233&hyph;9013. See the ADDRESSES section for the mailing address. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction This notice describes EPA's final action to approve Tennessee's request to change the federal Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) standard of 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi in the former Knox County ozone nonattainment area from June 1 to September 15. The remainder of this notice is divided into five parts. Section II provides the background for this action. Section III provides the Agency's policy regarding relaxation of volatility standards in nonattainment areas redesignated as attainment. Section IV reviews the Tennessee request and supporting evidence. Section V reviews EPA's redesignation of Knox County as attainment. Finally, Section VI presents EPA's action and rationale. II. Background On August 19, 1987, EPA proposed a two-phase national program to reduce summertime gasoline volatility. 1 EPA found that gasoline had become increasingly volatile, which caused an increase in evaporative emissions from gasoline-powered sources. These emissions are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), a precursor of ozone. These gasoline-related emissions are currently a major contributor to the nation's serious ground level ozone problem, which harms human health and the public welfare. The Agency published a Notice of Final Rulemaking on March 22, 1989 that promulgated Phase I of the program to require VOC reductions by the beginning of the 1989 summer ozone season. 2 The Phase II volatility standards were finalized on June 11, 1990 3 and went into effect May 1, 1992. 1 52 FR 31274 (August 16, 1987). 2 54 FR 11868 (March 22, 1989). 3 54 FR 23658 (June 11, 1990). The final rule for the Phase I program established a federal volatility standard in Tennessee of 10.5 psi for the months of May and June, 9.5 for July and August, and 10.5 for September 1 through September 15. The Phase II rule required a further reduction in the volatility standard to 9.0 psi for May and 7.8 psi for June 1 through September 15 beginning in 1992. The Phase I and Phase II standards were applicable on a statewide basis. Congress established slightly different requirements for the fuel volatility program in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Section 211(h)(1) of the Act, as amended, required that EPA promulgate regulations making it unlawful to sell, offer for sale, dispense, supply, offer for supply, transport, or introduce into commerce, gasoline with an RVP level in excess of 9.0 psi during the high ozone season as defined by the Administrator. It further provides that EPA shall establish more stringent RVP standards in nonattainment areas if EPA finds such standards are ``necessary to achieve comparable evaporative emissions reductions, on a per vehicle basis, in such areas, taking into consideration the enforceability of such standards, the need of an area for emissions control, and economic factors.'' Section 211(h) prohibits the regulations from establishing a volatility standard more stringent than 9.0 psi in an attainment area, although it allows EPA to impose a lower standard in any former ozone nonattainment area which is redesignated as being in attainment. On May 29, 1991, EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which modified the Phase II summer ozone volatility standards to reflect new section 211(h) of the Act. 4 In this notice, EPA proposed that, beginning in 1992, the RVP standard be 9.0 psi in all attainment areas where this standard was not already in place. The effect of this proposal was to prohibit the sale of gasoline with a Reid Vapor Pressure above 9.0 psi during the summer ozone season in all areas designated attainment for ozone for 1992 and beyond. For areas that have been designated as nonattainment, EPA proposed that the original Phase II standards published on June 11, 1990 should not be changed. On December 12, 1991 EPA finalized these modifications. 5 4 56 FR 24242 (May 29, 1991). 5 56 FR 64704 (December 12, 1991). On November 6, 1991, EPA issued its ozone nonattainment designations in the Federal Register pursuant to section 107(d)(1)(C) of the Act, as amended. In the November 6, 1991 notice, EPA designated Knox County as a ``marginal'' nonattainment area for ozone. Under the original Phase II rule, a statewide standard was established in Tennessee that required 7.8 psi gasoline to be provided from June 1 to September 15. In the December 12, 1991 final rule, EPA modified RVP standards for Tennessee to require that those areas designated in Tennessee as nonattainment in the November 6, 1991 notice be provided with 7.8 psi gasoline, and that the remainder of Tennessee be supplied with 9.0 psi gasoline. III. EPA Policy Regarding Relaxation of Volatility Standards in Nonattainment Areas Redesignated as Attainment Under the amended Phase II regulations, any change in the volatility standard for an area must be accomplished through a separate rulemaking revising the applicable standard for that area, even for an area that was designated as nonattainment in the November 6, 1991 notice but is subsequently redesignated as being in attainment. 6 Thus, for nonattainment areas where EPA mandated a phase II volatility standard of 7.8 psi RVP in the December 12, 1991 rulemaking, the 7.8 psi standard will remain in effect, even after such an area is redesignated as being in attainment, until a separate rulemaking is completed that revises the RVP standard in that area from 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi. 7 6 Relaxation of RVP standards associated with the redesignation process was discussed in the preamble to EPA's final rule modifying the Phase II volatility standards (56 FR 64706, December 12, 1991). 7 Similarly, when an area originally designated being in attainment is redesignated nonattainment, the volatility level of the gasoline will stay at 9.0 psi RVP unless and until EPA promulgates a rulemaking changing the RVP in that area (56 FR 64706 December 12, 1991). The Agency believes that relaxation of any RVP standard change is best accomplished in conjunction with the redesignation process. In order for an ozone nonattainment area to be redesignated as being in attainment for ozone, revised section 107(d)(3) of the Act requires the state to make a showing, pursuant to section 175A of the Act, that the area is capable of maintaining attainment for the ozone NAAQS for ten years. This maintenance plan may demonstrate that the area is capable of maintaining attainment for ten years without the more stringent volatility standard. However, the maintenance plan could also show that the more stringent volatility standard is or may be necessary for the area to maintain its attainment with the ozone NAAQS. Therefore, in the context of a request for redesignation, the Agency will not relax the volatility standard unless the maintenance plan demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Agency that the area will maintain attainment for ten years without the need for the more stringent volatility standard. 8 8 As stated in the preamble for the Agency's initial Phase II volatility standards ( see 55 FR 23609), and in the preamble in the proposal to revise those standards (56 FR 24244), EPA may also promulgate a rule to revise the volatility standard in a particular nonattainment area in order to enhance local air quality and/or increase the economic efficiency of the program. The Governor of a state, or his designee, may petition EPA for a less stringent standard if such a standard is consistent with the requirements of the Act and if the state can document (1) particular local economic impact that makes the less stringent standard appropriate and (2) sufficient alternative programs to achieve attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS for ozone. IV. Tennessee's Redesignation Request and Maintenance Plan; Request for Change in Federal RVP Standard On August 26, 1992, the State of Tennessee, through the Tennessee Department of Conservation and Environment, submitted to EPA both a request to redesignate Knox County (classified as a marginal nonattainment area) from nonattainment to attainment for ozone and a maintenance plan. The redesignation request was based on three years of ambient monitoring data which showed that Knox County had no violations of the ozone standard during the three year period of 1989 through 1991, and was also based on Tennessee's implementation of EPA-approved ozone control strategies. 9 9 It should also be noted that there were no exceedances of the ozone standard during 1992 or 1993.
