This is what our correspondent Valentin Nikulin has told us: [Nikulin] The situation on the Tajik-Afghan border remains complicated. Almost daily the Russian border guards have to repel provocations from armed detachments of the Tajik opposition which is based in the northern provinces of Afghanistan. The leaders of the opposition, aware of the large military potential of the border guards, as well as of the 15,000-strong contingent of peace-keeping forces that have arrived to support them, have resorted to the very wily tactics of silent infiltration across the border by small, well-armed, and trained groups instead of a massive spring-summer offensive. Their aim is to set up bases and arms depots on the territory of Tajikistan, as well as to carry out acts of sabotage. The movements of the bands and formations are under the close observation of the Tajik special services. As a result of a recent three-days operation carried out jointly with the Russian border guards, about 30 transgressors were destroyed, a Pakistani military advisor among them. A depot containing 200 nonguided missiles and antiaircraft guns was destroyed, as well as a lot of other arms. A dozen attempts to violate the almost 1,200km-long border have been foiled. In particular, in one of the sectors of the border in the Pamir mountains, border guards' fire stopped 25 armed transgressors from illegally crossing the border. By the way, 10 of them were of Arab origin, according to military intelligence. This fact proves once more that the claim of the Tajik opposition leaders that no foreign mercenaries are taking part in their fight against the present regime in Tajikistan is false. And one more scandalous fact from life on the border which was related to us at a press conference by Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of a group of Russian Federation border troops. On 8 June an explosive device was discovered and deactivated here by a Russian border guards detachment. It had been placed by unknown persons on a barge that transported refugees returning home from Afghanistan. The resolute and skillful actions of the border guards averted the death of 242 persons, mainly women and children. A day later, at 0610 on 9 June, the 11th outpost of the Moscow border guards detachment suffered concentrated shelling from the territory of Afghanistan. Twenty-six missiles were fired directly at it over a short period of time. As a result of this action one serviceman of the Tajikistan Defense Ministry was killed, and another was wounded. Both of them were serving in a subunit of the republican Defense Ministry, which was sent to reinforce border security.
