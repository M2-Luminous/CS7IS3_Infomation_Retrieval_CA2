FBIS4-60370 "drnes100_l_94009" FBIS-NES-94-100 Daily Report 23 May 1994 ISRAEL Alleged Likud Opposition to Netanyahu Detailed Alleged Likud Opposition to Netanyahu Detailed TA2305183994 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 23 May 94 p B2 TA2305183994 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by 'Amira Segev] [Text] Time and time again Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu has been rescued by current events from the need to directly respond to the harsh criticism leveled by his party associates. It happened against last week. In retrospective, the assault on Netanyahu seems to be a well-planned military operation. True to the routine he repeats every two to three months, Ari'el Sharon tried to check the party's pulse by launching a direct assault on Netanyahu in a Qol Yisra'el interview, in which he charged Netanyahu with failing to lead the Likud as a militant opposition. Sharon's remarks were carried prominently on two newscasts, but were forgotten as soon as the unofficial tape of 'Arafat's Johannesburg remarks arrived. Another item that drowned in the ocean of reactions to 'Arafat's declarations was the story of an anti-Netanyahu mutiny which almost broke out in the Likud after Netanyahu blatantly left the Knesset plenum during the vote on the peace plan; this story was exposed one week after the fact. The following day, Sharon exposed "the establishment of the first organized group since the primaries seeking to replace the Likud chairman." Sharon said: "Together with several colleagues, I am planning moves designed to establish a more appropriate Likud leadership soon." The following day the level of the Sharon-David Levi talks rose from tete-a-tetes in the Knesset members' [MK's] cafeteria to official meetings in Tel Aviv. Political correspondents were notified of a meeting after it took place, but the communication came with the abject denials of David Levi -- who has been persistently refusing to be interviewed on the Netanyahu subject -- and with an evasive denial delivered on behalf of "Sharon's confidants" (a quick poll conducted among Likud MK's did not reveal a single name which could fit in this category). The denial maintained that the conversation dealt merely with political issues and their future repercussions. Since a lethal terrorist attack took place on the day after the meeting, the matter petered out again. "All these events," Netanyahu says, "are an attempt by a few frustrated party activists and a few bored journalists to make headlines. It is not serious." [Segev] Are you satisfied with your standing in the Likud then? [Netanyahu] Satisfied? Satisfied is not the right term. I am not worried. [end Netanyahu] About a month ago Netanyahu asked YEDI'OT AHARONOT for an interview in order to publicly apologize to David Levi for having accused him in the famous tape affair. As will be remembered, Levi's reaction was: "Too little. Too late. He should apologize to the entire nation." "Netanyahu is acting out of the depths of history," senior Likud officials rhapsodized off the record. Limor Livnat, formerly from Sharon's entourage and currently one of the three MK's officially identified with Netanyahu, says Netanyahu is preoccupied with planning, not with history. "Netanyahu wanted to show the Likud voters that he was taking action, that he was trying to unite the ranks, and if he fails, everyone should know who is to blame," she says. The same explanation lies at the foundation of this week's establishment of the political Likud forum, to which ten MK's, including Sharon and Levi, were invited. A party spokesman says: "Now everyone will see who does not want the Likud to function properly." Sharon and Levi did not come to the forum meeting. "There is no serious activity against Netanyahu," Me'ir Shitrit, Dan Meridor, Beni Begin, Limor Livnat, David Magen, Moshe Qatzav, Mikha'el Eytan, and Ehud Olmert say. None of them is able to name a single person capable of mustering a 75-percent Central Committee majority, which is required for any step from amending the Likud constitution and deciding to hold a convention more than once every four years, down to a decision to repeat the primaries. One of these MK's says: "Netanyahu has exhausted the early enthusiasm with his election, and he has most likely established his standing until after the next elections in two and a half years. Although two and a half years are a long time in politics, I do not expect Likud figures with contrasting interests to unite, not even to topple Bibi Netanyahu -- although some of them truly believe this is the most dire need of the hour." Thus, there is apparently no anti-Netanyahu activity at the moment, but the intensity of the charges against him -- voiced by the radical right wing in and outside the party, by moderate party members, and even by his own people -- is growing. Radical Likud figures, such as Ari'el Sharon and Dov Shilansky, accuse him of sloppy action against the government peace moves and of relegating the struggle over the integrity of Eretz Yisra'el to the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza. Central Committee members, such as Meridor, Begin, and Shitrit, claim that Netanyahu is the victim of squabbles between Yehoshu'a Matza and Tzahi Hanegbi, who are competing over proximity to him and are provoking him, with the assistance of his close aide Yvette Liberman, to extravagant proclamations in the style of Ari'el Sharon and Rehav'am Ze'evi. Begin and Meridor, for instance, refuse to attend mass right-wing demonstrations and to fly slogans such as the "Treason Government" and "Rabin Is a Traitor." The two men do not disguise their demand that the Likud action follow its own course of action, rather than toe the line with Ze'evi. Meridor refuses to comment on frictions in the Likud in general and Netanyahu's standing in particular. Begin, on the other hand, issues temperate statements about Likud unity and the need to back the elected leader. Shitrit, on his part, claims that Netanyahu's belligerent, unbridled allusions to the peace process "removed the Likud from the public debate on the issue and made the party totally irrelevant in this context. If Rabin achieves a peace package including Syria and Jordan before the elections, the Likud, as it is now, will be unable to survive. Today the party is paralyzed. There is a feeling that it is a one man's party, and there is no sense of togetherness. "Despite that," Shitrit says, "I will not lend my hand to any move seeking to unseat Bibi. He is the man until the next Knesset elections. Until then, we must help him to succeed, because his success is the success of the Likud." The anti-Netanyahu arguments recently heard in his own camp stem from his undermined public image. Netanyahu likes American methods, and public opinion polls are his beacon. And the latest polls -- one of which was published last Friday -- show that his popularity is waning. "If this is the situation," one of the most prominent Likud headquarters functionaries says, "perhaps he is really not the man who will bring the Likud back to power. He attracted great support and was elected by a vast majority. If he is doing so badly in the polls, and the polls are what matters, then perhaps we made a mistake." Several weeks ago, the Channel 2 Television Network prepared a report marking Netanyahu's first year in office. Many Likud MK's, including Shitrit, Sharon, Levi, Qatzav, Meridor, Begin, Nisim, and Magen were invited for an interview. The only one who came was Yitzhaq Shamir. "I do not attach great importance to talk against Bibi Netanyahu," the former prime minister said in that report. "Opposition and subversion existed during Begin's and my time, too. The elected chairman should focus only on vital issues." Shamir refused to answer a question on how he explains the fact that barring him, no one agreed to make complimentary remarks about Netanyahu. Meridor refuses to comment on frictions in the Likud in general and Netanyahu's standing in particular. Begin, on the other hand, issues temperate statements about Likud unity and the need to back the elected leader. Shitrit, on his part, claims that Netanyahu's belligerent, unbridled allusions to the peace process "removed the Likud from the public debate on the issue and made the party totally irrelevant in this context. If Rabin achieves a peace package including Syria and Jordan before the elections, the Likud, as it is now, will be unable to survive. Today the party is paralyzed. There is a feeling that it is a one man's party, and there is no sense of togetherness. "Despite that," Shitrit says, "I will not lend my hand to any move seeking to unseat Bibi. He is the man until the next Knesset elections. Until then, we must help him to succeed, because his success is the success of the Likud." The anti-Netanyahu arguments recently heard in his own camp stem from his undermined public image. Netanyahu likes American methods, and public opinion polls are his beacon. And the latest polls -- one of which was published last Friday -- show that his popularity is waning. "If this is the situation," one of the most prominent Likud headquarters functionaries says, "perhaps he is really not the man who will bring the Likud back to power. He attracted great support and was elected by a vast majority. If he is doing so badly in the polls, and the polls are what matters, then perhaps we made a mistake."

The elected chairman should focus only on vital issues." Shamir refused to answer a question on how he explains the fact that barring him, no one agreed to make complimentary remarks about Netanyahu. Even if there is no organized opposition to Netanyahu within the Likud, there are more than enough initiatives which could be construed that way. Since last November, MK David Magen (a former Sharon follower) has been promoting the notion of Dan Meridor as leader of the Likud, trying to summon a party convention in 1995, and calling for the reelection of officials at all levels. Meridor categorically denies being involved. "I did not ask or initiate anything," he said. "It was the initiative of Magen, and I believe, also of Ya'aqov Verdugo. I asked them to get me out of it at once. At the moment, I am not running. In due course, if the matter comes up I may consider it." And what about Magen's initiative to summon a party convention? "He has never discussed the issue with me," Meridor says. A political correspondent says that Magen recently told him: "Things will be interesting in the summer. You had better be prepared for the summer." [Segev] MK Magen, what did you have in mind? [Magen] What I had in mind is that my efforts to summon a party convention would be demonstrated in the summer. Politics is too dynamic an art to have it reassessed only once every four years. The Likud should not become fossilized, and all its levels should be put up for reelection every two years. [Segev] Did you officially raise this initiative? Has Netanyahu reacted to it? [Magen] Not yet. I am now working on the issue, so far without results. I cannot yet demand it officially. Also, I do not know what Netanyahu's reaction was to what he has already heard. [Segev] Does it have to do with your initiative to promote Dan Meridor as leader of the party? [Magen] I have never said I had such an initiative. [Segev] So, you do not have such an initiative? [Magen] I am only saying that I have not yet raised it anywhere. [Segev] Your initiative to summon a party convention is perceived as a move against the chairman of the Likud. [Magen] My effort is positive, not negative. Any other comment will only harm my initiative, which I consider very important. [Segev] Do you have supporters? [Magen] I do not operate in a vacuum. [Segev] How do you operate? [Magen] I use persuasion. I persuade people in key positions in our party branches. I hope we will manage to advance the idea. [end Magen] "One convention more, one convention less," Binyamin Netanyahu responds, "what difference will it make?" [Segev] Even with the candidacy of Dan Meridor--who overtly opposed your move to stalk out of the Knesset plenum during the vote on the peace agreement--hanging in the background? [Netanyahu] If that is what you call "opposing me," then it is not serious. My relations with Dan are excellent, and this is not the first time that he has voiced views opposed to mine, especially on this issue. [end Netanyahu] The Likud's failure in the Histadrut labor federation elections did not contribute to Netanyahu's position. He took a lot of criticism on the issue, among others from Limor Livnat, who is considered a follower. "Whatever I said after the failure I also told him to his face, loud and clear," says Livnat. [Segev] Will you second Magen's initiative? [Livnat] I supported Beni Begin's move to have an additional round of primaries before the Knesset elections. The Likud Central Committee's decision not to have such a round remains in effect, and as far as I am concerned, this is the end of the story. [Segev] And you have no problem with it? [Livnat] Anybody planning a move against Bibi Netanyahu will be damaging the Likud. That does not prevent me from leveling criticism or make me automatically agree to everything. On the Histadrut elections Bibi made a mistake, and I told him as much. This does not mean that I will lend a hand to rebellion and defiance. No way. [Segev] Does the Likud have an alternative to Bibi Netanyahu? [Livnat] He was only chosen a year ago. What's the big rush to throw the party into a frenzy? I keep hearing about absurd initiatives, such as to bring back Moshe Arens, the man who got up and left the Likud one minute after it was beaten. People who have not come to terms with their defeat in the primaries feel frustrated and resentful, by way of "if we go down, we will take you down with us." [Segev] How is the party dealing with this? Is it up in arms over it? [Livnat] You could say it does not make life easy. [end Livnat] Ehud Olmert is also opposed to coming out against Netanyahu. "I am against any action which might harm Bibi," says Olmert. "He was elected, period. Such actions create a self-fulfilling prophecy. People predict his downfall, initiate moves to bring it about, and when they succeed they say: We told you so, he is on his way out." Says a senior Likud official off the record: "Constant subversion by these two lesser players against the head of the pyramid has become chronic. They did the same to Shamir and Begin. Magen joined them about six months ago; they embraced Shitrit's harsh criticism of Netanyahu and accorded a measure of certain elegance to the whole affair. All the rest is constructive and legitimate criticism. As far as Bibi is concerned, the broader the forum the larger the support for him. His lowest support is in the Knesset, and his broadest is among the Likud's 180,000 registered voters. Levi and Sharon have no support from the ranks, and this was confirmed in all recent confrontations. Sharon has no followers at all, while among Levi's followers I have heard grumbling that because of his pet peeves they were left behind and were not given any jobs." "I do not wish to discuss the issue of Bibi Netanyahu at all," David Levi says. [Segev] So, what was the reason for the meetings with Sharon? [Levi] Where are those meetings being held? In the cafeteria here, right? [Segev] So, are you doing it to anger everybody? Levi laughs. "You said it."
