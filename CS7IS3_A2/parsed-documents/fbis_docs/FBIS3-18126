With a view to the SPD's election chances, Scharping defended his position -- which was developed in accordance with Deputy SPD Chairman Lafontaine -- against criticism from parts of the party's left wing. Yet, according to the chairman of the Party Council, Ringstorff, the session was characterized by broad agreement. Unlike the past, it was distinguished by the determination to concentrate on "essential" issues. The SPD will not be diverted from its course by attacks from the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU], a course intended to shift the fight against unemployment to the center of the election campaign. Ringstorff said the criticism of the CDU/CSU to the SPD's past Germany policy showed that the CDU and CSU would prove to be "bad losers" after the election. In addition, in communities in eastern Germany, the CDU was not hesitating to enter into alliances with the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] against the SPD. The spokesman for the "Frankfurt Circle," the group of left-wingers within the SPD, Von Larcher, warned against a "deflationary austerity policy." In view of the mass unemployment the SPD must not do without a policy of stimulating the economy. Also on behalf of other representatives from the party's left, Von Larcher called for a state "future investment program." In a second address, Scharping rejected the views of the party's left-wingers. Before, at their meeting in Oer-Erkenschwick at the weekend, Scharping had criticized their catalogue of demands by emphasizing that, in its economic policy, the SPD must not bank on state measures alone. Even representatives of the party's left showed that they were impressed by Scharping's claim to leadership on Friday. The Party Council avoided a discussion on differences between Lafontaine and Presidium Member Dressler in connection with pension policy. These differences were sparked off by Lafontaine's remark that the pensioners might have to suffer a loss in income in real terms depending on the result of the wage agreements. Dressler had then demanded that, if necessary, the pensioners be entitled to compensation measures; yet, fundamentally, he did not want to challenge the "pension formula." Lafontaine brought up reservations in terms of finance policy and described Dressler's position as an "individual inconsiderate opinion." According to members of the SPD leadership, the SPD Executive Committee did not finally close the matter in its discussion on Monday. The leadership of the Party Council was confirmed in its offices. However, with 34 votes, Chairman Ringstorff received significantly fewer votes than his deputies Poss (55) and Mrs. Weber (51). The bad result for the chairman of the SPD land group of Mecklenburg Western Pomerania was explained by the way in which he did his job so far. In the past debates on asylum policy, he once published a list, which later turned out to be wrong, on supporters of and opponents to a Basic Law amendment. Only about half of the 110 members of the Party Council attended the session in Bonn. It was said that due to heavy snowfalls and difficult road conditions the remaining members were unable to attend the meeting; their absence, however, also proves the importance of this party body within the party: The Party Council is not a decisionmaking body but only a consultative one. SPD Federal Manager Verheugen presented the Party Council with a paper on fighting right-wing extremism. The fight against right-wing extremism must be stepped up. They have to be stripped of the false image of "respectability." The behavior of those who officially represent the party should be the subject of public debate.
