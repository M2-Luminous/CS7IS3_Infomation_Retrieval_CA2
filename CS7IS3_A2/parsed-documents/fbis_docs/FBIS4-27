FBIS TRENDS-12APR94-SLOVAKIA SLOVAKIA: Anti-Meciar Parties To Form United Front SLOVAKIA: Anti-Meciar Parties To Form United Front With fall parliamentary elections looming and former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) continuing to top the opinion polls, two splinter parties in the governing coalition have announced plans to merge into a single party forming a united front against Meciar. Former Foreign Minister Milan Knazko said that during a 23 April founding "congress," the newly created "Slovak Democratic Union" (DUS) will unite his Alliance of Slovak Democrats (AD SR), whose eight deputies in the 150-seat parliament split from the HZDS last year, with the Alternative of Political Realism (APR), a group of ten deputies who were expelled from the HZDS in February (CTK, 7 April). Distinguishing the new party's platform from Meciar's emphasis on the state's role in the economy, Knazko added that the DUS will "push for a liberal policy" and "for changes to support the private sector" (SME, 29 March). Prime Minister and APR leader Jozef Moravcik also suggested the possibility of coalescing with other parties in the governing coalition, saying that the DUS "already has an agreement" to form a "joint preelection front" with "all the other centrist parties" (Warsaw, Rzeczpospolita, 8 April). Similarly, former Prime Minister Jan Carnogursky called for "loose cooperation" during the election campaign between the DUS and his Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) (CTK, 7 April). Perhaps limiting the electoral success of this "centrist," anti- Meciar coalition, Peter Weiss, the leader of the strongest party in the governing coalition, the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (SDL), has suggested that his party will not join or agree to electoral cooperation with it. During an interview published in the 30 March Denni Telegraf, Weiss said that there is a "realistic chance" of the SDL and a number of labor and farmer parties not currently in parliament forming a "social democratic grouping." Separating the political spectrum into three groups, Weiss said that this group would offer an "alternative" to Meciar and to a coalition centered around the KDH, adding that he did "not think the majority of voters" would favor the KDH group.
