The commission, created to study the problem of American missing, held a press-conference on Friday to discuss the results of its latest plenary session. Co-Chairman of the commission Dmitriy Volkogonov declared that the group's work has reached a new level and taken on an international character. The embassies of Great Britain, Australia, and Italy appealed to the commission today to help them learn more about their missing servicemen. Volkogonov said the group's work was "very important evidence of the improvement in relations between Russia and the USA." Congressman Pete Peterson, co-chairman of the commission from the American side, noted that their work has been based exclusively on facts and personal testimony. The "cold war" group was able to uncover the remains of American pilot John Robertson Dunham, who was shot down over the Soviet Union in October 1952. New information about the pilots shot down in April 1950 and September 1952 has also been gathered. The commission's sub-group for the Korean war has been able to get new information from Russian archives, and even the intelligence archives were opened up to shed more light on the Vietnam war. The commission also noted that the American side has been able to provide the Russians some additional clues concerning Russian servicemen reported missing in Afghanistan.
