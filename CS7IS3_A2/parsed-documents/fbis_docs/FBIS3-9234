According to a decision of the Serbian leaders of the Prishtina commune, 50 construction sites will be given to Serbians who will be settled in Kosova. The sites are located in the "Dragogan" Quarter in Prishtina. The place is sufficient to provide residence for 15,000 inhabitants, that is the same number of Serbians are expected to live in this area. In this context, 150 houses are foreseen to be constructed near the Technical Faculty while 100 construction sites will be granted at the "Tasligje" Quarter. All the sites will be given to Serbians free of charge. The sale of the construction sites is prohibited, leaving no possibilities for the Albanians to buy them. Such undertakings of colonization have existed before in Kosova and will also continue in the future in other Kosova zones.
