Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP Policy Affairs Research Council, said the draft shows that the issue of a budget for construction of new bullet train lines and other difficult problems has been sidestepped and left unsettled. The chief LDP policy-maker said his party will press the government in the Diet to meet its budget demands. Noriaki Sasaki, chairman of the JCP Economic Policy Committee, said it is unacceptable that the budget limits income tax cuts to one year. He said the draft shows that if income tax cuts are to be on a permanent basis, there would have to be a major raise in the consumption tax rate and such an increase is quite unacceptable.
