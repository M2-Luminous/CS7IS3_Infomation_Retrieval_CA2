He commented on the rumors of a coup in preparation in his own way: [Begin recording] [Rutskoy] The Supreme Soviet got in the way so they destroyed it, they shot up the parliament. Now something else has to get in the way. But who? What? You have to distract people's attention. Nobody was ever even dreaming of any coups. The coup has already happened, the coup d'etat has already happened in this state. So what coups are there to talk about? [Unidentified correspondent] The idea of civic accord is not an undisputed one for Aleksandr Vladimirovich. [Rutskoy] Agree with who? With those who plundered the state and destroyed it? With those who shot up the parliament? You want me to agree with them? [end recording] [passage omitted] [Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian at 1900 GMT on 22 March carries the following voice recording of Rutskoy at the Russian Exhibition, answering reporters' questions: "Industrial instability, rocking the boat, playing games, agreements, money-centrism -- all of this will end badly. One cannot play games with laws. Laws exist to be fulfilled. When we learn to obey the laws we shall live well. Otherwise there is no democracy, there is anarchy."]
