In the interview, President Kim indicated his government's position on the North Korean nuclear issue, and how it analyzes and sees the issue. However, he did not indicate concrete prospects for a South-North dialogue. Even on possible talks with North Korean President Kim Il-song meanwhile, President Kim Yong-sam said: "We are not going to approach the North from our side," thus backpedaling from his position in February when he viewed the second year of his government. It seems the interview reflects South Korea's difficult position and disappointment over its loss of a diplomatic channel for possible dialogue with North Korea, following its decision to abandon an exchange of special envoys for the time being -- which South Korea says is a precondition for a third round of talks between high-ranking U.S. and North Korean officials. Concerning the possible South-North dialogue, President Kim merely said: "If talks between the United States and North Korea are held, the situation will then enter a stage of mutual nuclear inspections in both South and North Korea. In this sense, North (Korea) will have to show its sincere position on resuming the South-North dialogue." In his written answers to ASAHI questions, he took care not to directly commit himself in answering the issue of South-North dialogue. Moreover, President Kim said: "North Korea's economic situation, including food supplies, will become increasingly serious as time goes by. This is the reason for North Korea's desire to improve its relations with the United States. Time is on our side." In this way, he indicated his view that North Korea will eventually compromise although he did not refer to the timing of North Korea's concession. In the middle of April, following the South Korean government's decision to no longer exchange envoys with North Korea, the United States and South Korea discussed the issue of South-North dialogue. They agreed to set the resumption and "meaningful progress" in negotiations as preconditions for the third round of high-level talks between the United States and North Korea; along with North Korea's acceptance of full inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). As a new form of dialogue, the holding of South-North prime ministerial talks and resumption of the nuclear control joint committee based on a joint denuclearization statement (announced in December 1992) are being considered. However, prospects for North Korea's acceptance of such proposals are dim. It seems that South Korean President Kim's lack of concrete proposals for resuming South-North dialogue reflect gloomy prospects. On possible summit talks with North Korean President Kim Il-song, South Korean President Kim Yong-sam said: "The previous government took positive action in working on North Korea to hold the summit talks. But I think the summit talks will naturally materialize, and in this sense, my government has not taken positive action." At a news conference last February when he saw the first anniversary of the inauguration of his government, President Kim said: "I want to promote efforts to seek summit talks with North Korean President Kim if the talks help solve the nuclear issue." This remark drew the attention of the international community because he had previously said: "We do not want to hold a summit meeting for talks." However, in the ASAHI interview, he backpedaled from his position of last February, and now can be seen as reflecting South Korea's difficulties in prospects for a South-North dialogue. In a written letter to ASAHI SHIMBUN, he said: "We are making efforts to create a favorable atmosphere for U.S.-DPRK working-level talks in the hope of bringing about an early solution to the nuclear question. We hope the working-level talks to be held soon will bear substantive results." Judging from his above remarks, it can be said that South Korea's decision to abandon the envoy exchange is in order to promote a dialogue between the United States and North Korea; and that, underlying such a decision is its aim to show both domestic and foreign nations, including North Korea, its stand of being deeply involved in U.S. policymaking even after the abandonment of envoy exchanges.
