Eyewitness saw more than ten boxes belonging to the inspectors at the airport. The inspectors told XINHUA that the boxes contained equipment for the inspection. However, they refused to reveal any details about the inspection but said that their activities would last about one week. In March, the IAEA inspected the Yongbyon Radioactive Chemical Laboratory which is located 100 km north of Pyongyong. But the agency is not satisfied with the results and so inspectors have to carry out another inspection, according to reports. However, the reports say that the new inspection will not include monitoring the change of fuel rods at the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor.
