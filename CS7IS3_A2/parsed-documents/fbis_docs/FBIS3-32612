The Armed Forces, and thus the Air Force, are traditionally one of the basic guarantors of the electoral process, giving the citizens the necessary security to vote freely," he said. He added: "This is the way it is and this is the way it will be." He stated: "An essential condition for this is the fact that all military personnel on active service in the Air Force, from the commander in chief to the lowliest soldier, must strictly obey without exception this constitutional concept."
