Since the mid 1980's, a number of large and medium-sized Chinese enterprises with solid foundations, in conformity with the trend of the world's economic internationalization and regionalization, have stepped out of the country, have taken an active part in international competition, have established transnational companies with Chinese characteristics, and have scored gratifying achievements. The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and other units recently held the first exhibition on China's transnational operation in Beijing, displaying the course of development of China's transnational operations. Great Achievements Attained in Transnational Operation Since reform and opening up, the Chinese Government has vigorously encouraged and supported those large and medium-size enterprises which have the requisite conditions to seize the opportunity, take part in international competition, and engage in transnational operations. There are now more than 7,000 various types of foreign economic and trade enterprises. Their import and export volume has increased 750 percent over the past 15 years to reach $195.8 billion. The volume of their imports and exports has leaped to 11th place internationally. Their investment abroad totals $5.16 billion, where they now own 4,500 enterprises. The volume of foreign contracts undertaken and labor services offered totals $32.4 billion, with a turnover of $20 billion. Over the years, they have sent more than 800,000 contract laborers to 169 countries and regions. The transnational operations of Chinese enterprises developed from simply setting up trade offices abroad and running processing enterprises to commodity trade, contracting foreign projects and offering labor services, international tourism, exploitation of resources, production and processing, transportation, catering, consultation, finance, and insurance, which formed a multi-level and all-directional opening up structure at various levels and channels. Of this, the China Petrochemical Corporation, China Foreign Shipping, China Hardware and Minerals Corporation, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Company, China Construction Corporation, Guangdong Investment Group, and the international economic cooperation companies in Liaoning, Shanghai, Fujian, and Beijing are the most outstanding transnational companies. The China Petrochemical Corporation has become a comprehensive transnational group operating in crude oil, chemical fertilizer, chemicals, and rubber and plastic goods. The corporation's business volume in 1993 totaled $13.211 billion, ranking first in the country's foreign trade sector. The corporation was also selected by the United State's FORTUNE magazine as one of the top 30 of the world's 500 largest comprehensive service enterprises for four years in a row. The China Port Engineering Company and four other companies also joined the ranks of the 255 largest international engineering companies. By focusing on their own trade, China's transnational enterprises developed diversified businesses. Most of them have transformed from a single business to a diversified operation and from a special company to a comprehensive company. Internationalization, industrialization, and the formation of groups has become a trend. For example, the groups represented by the China Resources and China International Trust and Investment Corporation engage primarily in trade and investment. They are also involved in production, technology, services, finance, consultation, information, and other business areas. A number of engineering, construction, and international economic and technological cooperation companies, represented by China Construction, China Port, and China Fujian shoulder the mission of China's aid to foreign countries. Focused on contracting foreign projects and offering labor services, they are also engaged in other businesses. Make the Most of Advantages and Develop New Markets Although the transnational operation of China's enterprises is no match for the transnational groups of the developed nations in terms of capital and scale of business, they do have their unique advantages. The first advantage: The state encourages and supports most of the transnational enterprises. The state bears responsibility for these companies and offers certain preferential policies. As these enterprises have strong backing in materials and capital, they enjoy high prestige. For example, in developing a real estate project, the Huarong (Macao) Engineering Company, which has done an outstanding job in recent years, smoothly proceeded with the construction of Huarong Square, which involved an investment of millions of Hong Kong dollars, and attained marked economic results because it got enormous financial support from the Fujian Finance Department and the Huaxing and Huafu companies. The second advantage: China has gradually established a comprehensive industrial foundation and has advantages in applicable technology and traditional techniques. Some enterprises have superior operation and management experience in technology and products. At the same time, they have trained a number of qualified personnel for transnational operations. The third advantage: The comprehensive competitiveness of enterprises is enhanced in the course of the merger. In face of the competitive international market and a small number of transnational conglomerates, China's transnational enterprises have adopted the method of gradually forming combinations at home and mergers abroad, vigorously developing export-oriented enterprise groups at home, and making full use of their economies of scale to attain superiority in cost of operation and production, technology, and management. A small number of large enterprises with solid financial foundations have started transnational mergers abroad, making full use of the available technology, management, and supply and sales network of the local enterprises to expand their operations. In coordination with the Academy of Sciences, Qinghua University, and the Nonferrous Metal Research Institute, the China Hardware and Minerals Import and Export Corporation invested in a series of high-tech products. They also merged a number of relevant enterprises at home and abroad, gradually developed a coordinated process of raw materials extraction, processing, and export, and made marked progress in running enterprises abroad. The Shoudu Iron and Steel Complex, which has made a major breakthrough in transnational operations since the early 1990's, has 12 enterprises abroad, involving a total investment of $180 million. The complex invested $120 million in purchasing Peru Iron Ore in 1992, which has become one of China's largest enterprises abroad. Subject to Conditions and Facing Challenges The transnational operations of China's enterprises are developing vigorously, but, on the whole, they are still in the initial development stage. As there continues to be a wide gap between China's overall national strength and that of the developed nations, and reform and opening up must still be deepened further, the transnational operations of China's enterprises are conditioned by various factors and are facing challenges. First, capital shortages are still a prominent problem in transnational operations. As China is not yet a capital exporting nation, capital shortages will continue to condition the enterprises which have investment abroad for a long time to come. There are two ways to settle the problem: First, accommodate capital abroad and, second, enterprises pooling funds by issuing shares. Second, attention should be given to improving the management and operation level and to speed up the training of qualified personnel. The operation and management of some of China's enterprises abroad are not ideal, and their economic efficiency is not high enough because of the low level of operations and management and unqualified managerial personnel. There are also problems in the management system, distribution of interests, enterprise organizational structure, and the operational mechanism, which must still be further improved and settled. Moreover, as the export volume of China's technology-intensive products accounts for a very low proportion of overall exports, most of the products lack competitiveness in the international market. Meanwhile, there are defects in the regional distribution and trade structure of China's enterprises abroad. Some enterprises have no access to information and have failed to make sufficient feasibility studies on running enterprises abroad, resulting in blind investment. Looking forward to the future, with the development of China's economy and the enhancement of China's national strength, China will continuously develop, improve, and upgrade its transnational operations.
