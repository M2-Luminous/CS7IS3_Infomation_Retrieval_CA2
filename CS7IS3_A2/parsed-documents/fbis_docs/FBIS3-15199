In an interview with Interfax, Aliyev's spokesman Tofik Abbasov has described the talks as productive. In his words, the Russians were familiarized with Baku's attitude toward a settlement. He said that Moscow's plan for a settlement took Azerbaijan's view only partially into account. In his words, Aliyev wants the belligerents to stop fire immediately, withdraw their troops, get down to negotiations. However, all these steps should be backed up by the pull out of Armenian forces from the occupied Azerbaijani lands, the guaranteed return of refugees to Karabakh and other seized territories, and their subsequent safety. Asked by Interfax whether Baku agrees to cease fire this month in line with the protocol signed in Moscow on February 18 by the defence ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan with a Karabakh representative through Russia's mediation, Abbasov explained that these documents are not binding but are only a document of intent, which could take effect only after a presidential visa. So far Aliyev has not signed the accords, but, as Abbasov believes, Azerbaijan's official consent to a truce is possible. IF Note: According to the Moscow protocol, a cease-fire in Karabakh is to be followed by a disengagement of troops by the warring sides and by a pull out of military hardware from the zone of fighting. Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Karabakh are to post inspectors in the corridor that will form to monitor compliance with the protocol. 35 mixed monitoring teams are to be deployed in three zones, including the Kelbajar, Agdam, Fizuli, Jebrail, and Zangelan regions of Azerbaijan. Food will be supplied to Karabakh through the Lachin Pass. Russia's Defence Minister Pavel Grachev warned that if this accord on a settlement in Karabakh were wrecked, he would resign as a mediator.
