[Giscard] [passage omitted] I think we have to look very carefully at this operation, which poses problems, because it is not a United Nations action, it is a national action being carried out by France. [passage omitted] Our mission is thus in fact a humanitarian mission, but one which must be temporary and extremely cautious, because Africa has responsibility for the situation, not Europe, much less France. [passage omitted] It is a mission which has a chance only if it is strictly humanitarian and above all temporary, and its objective is to wait for the planned arrival of UN forces, which may arrive late. So, you see, it is an operation which must be carried out very carefully. The French forces must remain close to the border and must not penetrate into the interior of the country. Their mission is to protect groups of men, women, and clergy against the threat of massacre. It is not to take part in the fighting inside Rwanda.
