This is the increasingly insistent theme taken up by business leaders and members of parliament, which Edouard Balladur will shortly discuss with representatives of the banks. As was the case last November, the Matignon [office of the prime minister] intends to bypass all problems which are tending to slow down the distribution of credit to small- and medium-sized businesses: interest rate levels, access to financing, and lender guarantees. Point of Turnaround in August 1993 The monthly statistics published yesterday by the Bank of France, which go up to the end of February, confirm the economy's volatility. "Over the past seven months, M1, i.e., currency in its most limited definition such as banknotes and cash deposits, rose 4.1 percent (i.e., 7.1 percent annually)," according to the statement released by the Bank of France. Using the situation seven months ago is justified by the fact that the month of August 1993 corresponds to the beginning of the recovery. The bank experts feel that there is no doubt that this takeoff of "cash transactions" is "linked primarily to the improved prospects for economic activity." The other monetary and financial indicators, however, are more uncertain. The money supply M3, which includes virtually all means of payment, is continuing a downward trend (3.8 percent in one year). This is the result, we were told, of intense arbitrage "in favor of savings and loan savings plans, just before the announced drop in their yield rate." If we go to the other side of the balance sheets to take a look not at the money in circulation and savings, but at the financing which has been made available to the economy, there is not much change in the landscape. Overall, "total domestic indebtedness" has risen 5 percent over one year. However, this is used primarily to finance the public deficit, the financing of which has risen by 26.3 percent over one year. On the other hand, business debt has shrunk by 2.7 percent. Only households are once again looking for credit (up 3 percent over 12 months), a phenomenon which is relatively recent. Curious Paradox If the recovery actually materializes, businesses will have increased need for operating capital. Paradoxically, the recovery is showing an upsurge in bankruptcies, warns Paul-Henri Denieuil, the president of SFAC, the French Credit Insurance Company. "Access to credit" has become the main concern of small- and medium-sized businesses. The cost of money takes second place, although it has not disappeared. There is a curious paradox: Banks are tending to no longer pass on drops in the Bank of France's standard rates. "Like in the United States, French financial establishments must become more solid before they start lending again," an adviser on monetary policy explained. There is still a trump card that can revive the banks' desire to lend: the reform of the 1985 law on bankruptcies. The text, as it emerged from the joint (National Assembly-Senate) parliamentary committee today, reestablishes the safeguards that were requested by creditors.
