The following provisions shall replace Paragraphs 30.1. and 30.2 of Law No. 34 of 1989 on the election of National Assembly representatives, as amended by Law No. 2 of 1990: ``30.1. Local councils or [local council] executive committees shall elect the secretaries and two members of returning boards, based on proposals submitted by council executive committee secretaries, in due regard to persons suggested by the various parties. In every local jurisdiction, each party fielding candidates, and each independent candidate running in the elections shall designate one additional member to serve on the returning board. Several parties and independent candidates may jointly designate members to serve on returning boards. If in any local jurisdiction the parties and independent candidates designate only one or two persons to serve on the returning board, the local council or the executive committee shall elect three or four additional persons to serve on the returning board, so that the returning board is composed of five members. ``30.2. The municipal council of Budapest, and the councils of various counties, or the executive committees of these councils shall elect the secretaries and two members of individual and regional voting district election boards, based on proposals submitted by the respective council executive committee secretaries, in due regard to recommendations made by the various parties. In every jurisdiction, each party fielding candidates, and each independent candidate running in the elections shall designate one additional member to the election boards. If in any jurisdiction the parties and independent candidates designate only one or two persons to serve on an election board, the local council or its executive committee shall elect three or four additional persons, so that the election board is composed of five members. 2. The following provisions shall replace Paragraphs 53.1. and 53.2: ``53.1. The minister of the interior shall direct the organizing and technical implementation of state functions related to the elections, and the activities of working groups operating alongside the administrative boards /, as well as the computerized vote tallying system./ The minister of the interior shall present a report concerning these activities at a [plenary] session of the National Assembly. ``53.2. Deadlines, and starting and ending dates specified in this Law shall be expressed in terms of calendar dates, and the order of tallying votes shall be provided in the form of a decree promulgated by the minister of the interior, and published by the press.'' 3. This law shall take effect upon its proclamation. [In lieu of signatures] Dr. Arpad Goncz, president of the Republic; Gyorgy Szabad, acting president of the National Assembly LEGISLATIVE INTENT 1. The expeditious administration of elections within the constraints of legality demands that the number of members of the administrative boards involved in the elections (returning boards, individual and regional voting district election boards) amounts to at least the minimum number of members required by law. The mandates of members of administrative boards could cease for various reasons, and this could hinder the functioning of administrative boards in the course of elections. The law provides for the replacement of members who have dropped out, only on the basis of decisions by council bodies. Council bodies generally hold meetings once every three months. For this reason it is appropriate to also authorize council executive committees to supplement the membership of administrative boards, because council executive committees meet more frequently. 2. The computerized vote tallying system is an extremely costly method to tally votes. For this reason it is appropriate to provide a simpler method for the tallying of small volumes of data. Therefore, it is appropriate to authorize the minister of the interior to decree--immediately before the elections--the order for tallying votes. The decree must be publicized in the press.
