In particular, we read in a release from the League's press office that the "worrying" approach taken by President of the Republic Oscar Luigi Scalfaro toward PDS Secretary Achille Occhetto is open to criticism. "The Northern League," we read in the communique, considers as unacceptable the statements made by PDS member of parliament Correnti, for whom "justice is too serious a matter to be left in the hands of the judiciary," and is even more concerned at the intervention of the head of state who, after convening the chairmen of the lower house and the Senate to the Quirinale [president's palace], felt obliged to reassure Occhetto, explaining to him that he himself was acting as guarantor of a correct and calm outcome of the election campaign, with the responsible assistance of all the organs of state, the judiciary included, evidently." The memo also includes several statements by Roberto Ronchi, in charge of the political secretariat, who wonders "why Scalfaro did not show a similar concern when, during the past electoral campaigns, other political forces were involved." "The League genuinely hopes," Ronchi wrote, "that this election, which is so important for the future of our country, will not be disturbed by the final thrashings of a style of politics now in its death throws."
