The circular calls for continued efforts to implement the "methods of Jilin Province for management of the salt industry." Salt administrative bureaus at all levels are administrative departments for salt industry to take charge of the unified distribution of the salt used for various purposes. No units or individuals are permitted to engage in the production, retail sales, or wholesales of salt without approval. We should ensure the quality, supply, and marketing of iodized salt. The units and individuals who sell and supply substandard iodized salt, uniodized salt, and low-quality salt to disease areas or breweries and livestock breeders will be sternly dealt with according to law in the same way as we deal with sellers of fake medicines. Wholesales of marketable salt are managed by salt industry companies at all levels in a unified manner, and a business license is needed. The provincial salt administrative bureau will verify and issue "permission for salt business" to Jilin's salt wholesales units before 31 May, which should than register with local industrial and commercial administrations and obtain new business licenses. State-owned (collective) grain enterprises, commercial units, and supply and marketing cooperatives engaged in the retail sales of edible salt (iodized salt) should purchase from designated salt whole sellers, and they are not permitted to purchase from unlicensed units. Individual industrial and commercial households which sell edible salt (iodized salt) on a commission basis should hold the "permission for retail sales of edible salt by individual industrial and commercial households" issued by salt industry administrative departments at and above the county level. Industrial and commercial administrations, salt administrative departments, public health departments, and technological supervision departments should work in close coordination to strictly deal with the units and individuals who violate the laws, regulations, and circulars on the salt industry.
