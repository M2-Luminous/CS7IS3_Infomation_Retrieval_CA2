The railroad, electrical power production and communications occupy the leading and strongest place in this register. The oblast anti-monopoly administration has recently filed four claims in court against just the Sverdlovsk Railroad and its sections. The program of demonopolization adopted at the meeting of the Sverdlovsk Oblast government is called upon to stop unfair competition, limit monopolistic activity, and protect consumer rights. It is intended for a period of two years. But, as the chief of the Sverdlovsk Oblast Anti-Monopoly Administration, Nikolay Uzhegov, noted, demonopolization, judging by all, will be a more prolonged process. Such criteria as scientific and legal justification, socio-economic effectiveness of enterprises and their controllability and manageability were selected as basis of the program. Democracy, openness and a consideration of public opinion were proclaimed as the principles for the program's realization. The program on demonopolization of the economy of Sverdlovsk Oblast includes numerous measures, which are grouped into nine blocks. Particular attention is focused on developing competition on the commodity markets in the sphere of scientific-technical progress, in trade, public catering, and consumer services. The program also defines its priorities--provision for the development of commodity markets in the sector, support of small and medium-sized enterprise, control and regulation of state monopolies, prevention of the emergence of various subjects which occupy a dominant position in the economy, as well as the deconsolidation of such monopolist enterprises, if this is economically justified and expedient. Aside from the territorial administration, a special commission has been formed in Yekaterinburg in order to implement control over the realization of the program on demonopolization of the economy. It will include various representatives of the administrative agencies, entrepreneurial structures, scientists and specialists. The commission will not have authoritative powers and authorities. Its activity must have an advisory character.
