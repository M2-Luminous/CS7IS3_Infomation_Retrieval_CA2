[passage omitted] The Russian side believes that Baykonur will not be able to exist in the foreseeable future without the Russian Federation space forces that currently ensure virtually all of the functioning of the cosmodrome. Kazakhstan, however, is coming out in support of withdrawing the military from its territory. Russia, therefore, proposed to its partner to consider a compromise solution--that is, a lease. Kazakhstan supported this option in general. The current meeting is a step toward implementing the compromise. The experts are to determine the time limits of the lease, payments under it, and whether Leninsk should be included in the leased territory. After completing the talks, the experts will go back to finalize the documents so that the agreement and the treaty are ready for signing when Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin visits Kazakhstan in late February.
