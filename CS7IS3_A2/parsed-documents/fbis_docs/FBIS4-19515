Speaking at a meeting of the EU's Ministerial Foreign Affairs Council, EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan said the two sides had narrowed their differences over trade in nuclear fuel, one of the issues holding up an accord. Brittan also urged a rapid aid programme for Ukraine involving agricultural and energy support in order to brake an economic slide in the former Soviet republic. And the EU foreign ministers formally acknowledged the receipt of applications from Hungary and Poland to join the union. The applications were given to the European Commission for evaluation. An EU spokesman said: "We believe the time is ripe for a push to complete the negotiations with Russia." The accord would support economic reform in Russia by giving it better access to European markets leading eventually to a free trade agreement. It was supposed to be signed last June but has been held up mainly by disputes over sales of nuclear fuels such as plutonium and restrictions on the operations of foreign banks in Russia. France in particular has been trying in the face of Russian opposition to have the trade in nuclear fuels excluded from the partnership agreement, so that curbs can more easily be applied on Russian exports. The officials said France, the principal producer in Europe, was worried that export surges of Russian nuclear fuels could lead to a price collapse damaging to its own nuclear fuel producers. But German Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Ursula Seiler-Albring said Russia had promised to restrain its sales of nuclear fuels if the trade could be included in the agreement. The officials said no progress had been made in another dispute involving restrictions on foreign banks operating in Russia, which bar them from accepting Russian deposits. Russian envoy Alexandr Shotkin is expected in Brussels later this month to continue negotiations. The European Commission also presented the outlines of an aid programme for Ukraine to be presented to the ministers for approval next month. Brittan said it involved sending seed and fertiliser to help support the country's crumbling agricultural system, plus aid to finance the purchase of EU agricultural produce. The European Commission is also proposing aid to help Ukraine build new nuclear power stations, on condition that Kiev closes down dangerously outdated plants such as the Chernobyl station which was damaged in a 1986 accident.
