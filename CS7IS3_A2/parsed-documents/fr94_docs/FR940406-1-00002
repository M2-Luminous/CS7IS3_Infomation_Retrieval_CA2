FR940406-1-00002 FR940406-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Food and Nutrition Service 7 CFR Part 246 RIN 0584&hyph;AB53 Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC): Homelessness/Migrancy as Nutritional Risk Conditions AGENCY: Food and Nutrition Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would amend regulations governing the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) to comply with the mandate of section 204 of the Child Nutrition Amendments of 1992, enacted on August 14, 1992. Consistent with that legislation, this rulemaking would add homelessness and migrancy to the predisposing nutritional risk conditions for the WIC Program. This proposed rule would also alter the current WIC nutritional risk priority system by placing individuals certified for WIC due solely to homelessness or migrancy in Priority VII, along with previously certified participants who might regress in nutritional status without continued provision of supplemental foods. The use of Priority VII for this latter group of individuals would remain a State agency option. However, State agencies would be required to use Priority VII for homeless or migrant individuals who are certified solely due to their homelessness or migrancy. The intended effect of this proposed rule is to allow categorical and income-eligible homeless or migrant individuals, who lack any other documented nutritional or medical condition, to receive WIC Program assistance. DATES: To be assured of consideration, written comments must be received on or before June 6, 1994. Since comments are being accepted simultaneously on several separate rulemakings, commenters on this proposed rule are asked to label their comments ``Homelessness/Migrancy.'' ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Stanley C. Garnett, Director, Supplemental Food Programs Division, Food and Nutrition Service, USDA, 3101 Park Center Drive, room 540, Alexandria, Virginia 22302, (703) 305&hyph;2746. Submission of comments in duplicate would be appreciated. All written submissions will be available for public inspection at this address during regular business hours (8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.) Monday through Friday. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Contact Barbara Hallman, Supplemental Food Programs Division, Food and Nutrition Service, USDA, 3101 Park Center Drive, room 542, Alexandria, Virginia 22302, (703) 305&hyph;2730. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Classification Executive Order 12866 This proposed rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866. It has been designated ``not significant'' and did not require clearance by the Office of Management and Budget. Regulatory Flexibility Act This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612). Pursuant to that review, William E. Ludwig, Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service has certified that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. WIC local agency participant caseloads may potentially increase and thereby affect demand on local food vendor business.
