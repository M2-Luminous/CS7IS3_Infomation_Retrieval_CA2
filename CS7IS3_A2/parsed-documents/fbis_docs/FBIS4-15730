He is in Strasbourg with a Russian parliamentary delegation, which is taking part in the regular session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe here. First, procedural and legal aspects of these actions are unclear, Lukin said. As we know, the UN Security Council has decided that such actions are possible, as long as they are sanctioned by the UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali following consultations with the Security Council and are to achieve tangible, definite goals. That is why I believe that one should convene the Security Council and find out whether these actions are in line with the adopted resolution. I seriously doubt it though. Besides, they were undertaken without preliminary consultations, including those with Russia. Lukin also stressed the other serious aspect of this problem. Such actions had been attempted for the first time in Sarajevo, but they had then been blocked--mainly because of the active efforts of Russian diplomacy--he recalled. Following that, a special envoy of the Russian Federation president made some effective steps, and the crisis around Sarajevo was thus resolved. The same happened in the Serb Krajina. One would think that a way has been found to defuse such critical situations that imminently occur in a civil war. "Therefore, when the situation in Gorazde aggravated again--and here I admit that the Serb side, some Serb commanders, may have been at fault--it was necessary to take additional steps in order to give an immediate boost to the peace process. That is exactly what Russia has done," Lukin said. A special Russian Federation presidential envoy sent to Belgrade held very serious and intensive conversations there. Exactly at the same time, the blow--not agreed with anyone--was dealt. This looks very much like a provocation. Such an air strike will unavoidably complicate the situation and excite the right wing of all hues--both Serb, Muslim, and foreign, Lukin concluded.
