Equipment performance has met the required specifications, which are comparable to those recorded during Spot-1 and Spot-2 flights. Radiometric and geometric image quality are "excellent," as the bulletin emphasized. The Spot-1 satellite, currently on stand-by, has retained its direct viewing capabilities, while Spot-2 is still carrying out its operations. The high precision DORIS radio localization system aboard the satellite "is functioning perfectly" and the American experiment POAM II (Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurements) has begun gathering data, particularly on the ozone layer above the poles. Developed by CNES in cooperation with Belgium and Sweden, with participation from the National Geographic Institute (IGN), Spot was built by Matra Marconi Space as prime contractor.
