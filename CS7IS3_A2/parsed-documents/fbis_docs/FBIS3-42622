Some 350 enterprises, already registered as open joint-stock companies, passed through municipal and all-Russian check auctions last year. A real basis has therefore been created for a second securities market. Mikhail Manevich, chairman of the Committee for Municipal Property Management (KUGI) of the municipal council, informed us that out of 854 -- the total number of enterprises subject to privatization -- the documents for 487 were examined and approved at KUGI. In the course of last year, check auctions were intensive (held several times a month) in the city, and 5,328,545 vouchers were accumulated at them. This amount exceeds the number of inhabitants in the city. Since we know that not all the Petersburg citizens have parted with their vouchers yet, this means that there is a process of drawing in checks from other regions. This makes it possible to draw a conclusion as to how attractive Petersburg's enterprises are to potential shareholders. An analysis of the choices of privatization variants in 1993 reveals the following picture: over 120 enterprises preferred the first variant, 330 liked the second and 15 were privatized according to the third variant. In a percentage ratio, choice of the first variant of privatization (the most "capitalistic") was higher in Petersburg than in other regions of Russia. Investment marts (a constituent link to privatization complexes) began only last year. There are no grounds as yet for talking about their mass success. Manevich thinks that the reason why investors do not display the desired activity at the marts is the lack of high-quality business plans worked out in detail. Nevertheless, as an example of the successful holding of investment marts, he mentioned the experience of the Samson Meat-Processing Combine Joint Stock Company and of the 5th Dairy Combine, in which the well-known Parmolat firm acquired a block of shares. Re-outfitting these production facilities with modern equipment had already yielded results in the form of new meat and dairy products. According to plans approved in KUGI, another 10 investment marts will be held in Petersburg in the next two months. Specialists feel that marts like these are the optimal variant for changing the form of ownership and are really contributing to drawing funds into the production sphere. Petersburg's leading position is established not only by its quantitative indicators, but also by the "running-in" of new investment schemes. The charter documents of a number of enterprises specify a 50-percent increase in charter capital after part of the investment programs are fulfilled. An investor acquiring 20 percent of the shares in alliance with the initiative group of enterprise workers, actually turns out to be the owner of the controlling block. Almost a year's experience in carrying out "large-scale" privatization in Petersburg makes it possible to speak of certain special features in it, and of the general stabilization of the privatization process. One stabilizing factor is the presence of a legislative state and normative-regional base, lacking at the start of privatization. Among the special features is the appearance of a competitive market in Petersburg. Today the owner of a voucher can choose from enterprises producing goods of the same description and invest in its stock. A second feature is the appearance of really active investment institutions: banks, brokerages and financial investment companies. A third feature lies in the change in the psychological climate surrounding the process of privatization. While at the beginning of last year, notes Manevich, the associates of KUGI and the municipal property fund had to convince enterprise directors and workers of the advantages and need for shareholding, the picture is now just the opposite. Representatives of enterprises are pressing KUGI to be included in the privatization plan. Moreover, practical experience in stock-holding increasingly proves the inefficiency of the second variant of privatization, according to which the controlling block of shares should theoretically belong to the work collective. In reality, the shares are bought from the workers by outside parties, and the enterprise loses control over the production and also the possibility of attracting sound investors. Privatization of privatization itself has become another special feature. A system is forming in Petersburg of check auctions being held, not by a property fund, but on the instructions of banks, financial-investment companies or other middlemen. In this way, separation of the privatization process from the state is observed. Mikhail Manevich also noted that the method, adopted at the start of privatization, of evaluating the property of an enterprise by the residual value has proven itself and has not affected the sale of stocks. Nevertheless, despite the widescale distribution of privatization, it is still too early to talk about the economic efficiency of enterprises which have changed the form of ownership. Investment marts, which must be regarded as post-privatization support of enterprises, are still in store for many of them. The formation of the municipal program of privatization-94 is ending in Petersburg. Since, according to the federal program of privatization-94, the functions and powers of the regions are expanded, the Petersburg program has its own special features. In particular, privatization according to the first variant only is permitted for hotels. The allotting of a "golden share" for the state is specified in the privatization of publishing and printing enterprises and book traders. One must also include among the special features the permission to buy up built-in and added-on facilities, for which long-term lease contracts are concluded according to the results of competitions and auctions.
