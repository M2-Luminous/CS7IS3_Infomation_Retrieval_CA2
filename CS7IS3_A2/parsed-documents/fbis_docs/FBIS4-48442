At the center of these demands for a boycott of the conference is the newly formed National Democratic Coalition, and as Sola Odunfa now reports from Lagos, the coalition's efforts are doing particularly well in Western Nigeria: [Begin Odunfa recording] The boycott campaign, spearheaded by the National Democratic Coalition, appears to be spreading. The support for a boycott of the Constitutional Conference is gaining popularity, especially among political leaders in Western Nigeria, home of Chief Moshood Abiola, the acclaimed leader of last year's annulled presidential election. Nearly all the major political leaders in the Yoruba-speaking west say that they have withdrawn from the first stage election, scheduled to be held on Monday. Chief (Shegun Oshoba), the last civilian governor of Ogun State says Nigeria is facing a crisis more important than the constitutional conference, and the crisis should first be resolved by reviewing the annulment of the presidential election. Chief Michael Ajasi, who claims political leadership of the Yoruba people, says none of the prominent politicians who collected nomination forms in his home state, Ondo, returned them. Significantly, the former national chairman of the disbanded National Republican Convention, NRC, Dr. Hameed Kusamotu, while not explicitly endorsing the boycott campaign, called on the government to first convene a meeting of all leaders of thought in the country to discuss the state of the nation before the planned constitutional conference. Preparations are in top gear in other parts of Nigeria to ensure the success of the election of delegates. The current situation suggests that the boycott, if it is effective, will be only in the western states, and this will mean the absence of credible Yoruba leaders from the constitutional conference. [end recording] Well as you heard, the campaign of the National Democratic Coalition has been doing rather well in the south and southwest of Nigeria. One of the prime movers of the boycott campaign of the National Democratic Coalition is retired Admiral (Ndibisi Godwin Kanu). On the line to Lagos, Mustapha Ibrahim asked him what the coalition's boycott call was all about: [Begin recording] [(Kanu)] The call is really expressing the true wishes of Nigerians from all over the country. What Nigerians want is a sovereign national conference, where issues of proper federalism and other restructuring will be done. So it is more of voicing out entirely what the people want. [Ibrahim] The National Democratic Coalition seems to have brought together a lot of people from only a certain part of the country. What effort has the movement made to become a broad-based, national movement? [(Kanu)] As you know, Nigeria is made up really of many nations. It is a country of many nations. You mention the few from what you may call the southwestern part, or you may say the Yoruba nation. I am not from the Yoruba nation. There are people from the middle belt, there are people from the far north -- you have Dambazau there -- but more than that, as I said, it is not just a matter of the individuals you are looking at on the paper, but a matter of all well-meaning Nigerians, and they are all over the place. [Ibrahim] Don't you fear being accused of being lackeys of Chief M.K.O. Abiola? [(Kanu)] The issue of Abiola is absolutely secondary. Nigerians were called out to vote and they all voted -- and it was a very peaceful and fair election in this country -- and it got annulled. The people came out to vote and they left everything else, ethnic considerations, religious bias, and voted. It was very peaceful, and in a very good spirit of brotherhood, and that is the position. So it isn't a matter of Abiola at all. He may have his faults, he may have his good points, but that is not what people are saying. They exercised a franchise and they want to exercise that, and it is not a matter of being a lackey to him. He is rather talking about our national interest, and that goes for everybody, whether in the present provisional government or outside of it. We have to look at that, and the intention is to have a proper federalism and a structure where there is a sense of belonging to everybody. Right now, nothing is moving because patriotism is not there. [Ibrahim] Now, what will happen if the present military regime defies this ultimatum that the National Democratic Coalition has given that it must step down by May 31? [(Kanu)] We believe it is in the interests of everybody, including even those now in the government, to achieve this democracy in accordance with the June 12 election and mandate. We believe also they ought to consider it that way. It isn't a matter of any challenge -- it is a simple matter that we, all of us Nigerians, including those of them that are in government -- a few of them who are in the military and in government. The bulk of the Armed Forces too is having things very rough. [end recording]
