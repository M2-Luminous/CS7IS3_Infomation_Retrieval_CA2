They present their readers with a ``megatonne'' sensation: A breakdown situation has developed at five nuclear weapons storage facilities located on Russia's western border near Kaliningrad. These items also reported another rather sinister episode: Apparently, the chief engineer at the Ignalina Nuclear Electric Power Station ``was caught introducing a virus that he had developed himself into the computer that regulates the station's work; his intention was to knock out the security system.'' Moreover, this staggering information came from a fully competent official source--Dmitriy Sorokin, chief of the Russian Gosatomnadzor [Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety] North European District Inspectorate--who, it is alleged, had just carried out an inquiry into defense storage facilities off his own bat. These articles, which quoted the ECO DEFENCE INFORM information bulletin published in Kaliningrad, were published by the SEA digest. More than anyone else, the people who were most shocked by these sensational reports were...the actual staff of Gosatomnadzor's North European District. A special investigation was commissioned by the district leadership. It showed that the clamorous ``facts'' cited in the interview were actually arrant nonsense. It turned out that Dmitriy Sorokin had of course not inspected the local military storage facilities. And he had basically not made any statements to the press. Who would have benefited by organizing such a provocative hoax? Here is the view of Yuriy Khripunov, chief public relations specialist with Gosatomnadzor's North European District: ``The information (or, to be more precise, disinformation) fed to the correspondent was given out by a man impersonating Sorokin. We have `figured out' this impostor. To be more precise, he is a businessman from Kaliningrad who in exchange for good money would take radiation pollution measurements of dacha plots and market goods without having appropriate permission to do so, without possessing a specially certified apparatus, and without having the slightest professional knowledge in the field of radiation monitoring. Sorokin had unmasked this enterprising shyster and brought his illegal `business' to a halt. Whereupon the latter clearly decided to take revenge on the chief of the inspectorate in such an elegant manner.'' But it is still too early to close the file on this story for another reason. Even having exposed this scandalous disinformation, Gosatomnadzor finds itself unable to calm public opinion. Because Gosatomnadzor itself does not know the real state of our nuclear defense storage facilities, are they not fraught with the danger of full-blown accidents? Unfortunately, nobody knows whether this is true except the military themselves who are religiously keeping their military-departmental secret and do not allow Gosatomnadzor inspectors into their installations. Meanwhile, back on 5 June 1992, the Russian president approved the Statute on Gosatomnadzor: ``Gosatomnadzor...makes decisions within the limits of its competence which are binding for...military units stationed on Russian Federation territory....'' And on 9 April 1993 a new presidential directive was published. It states the task even more specifically: ``Before 1 December 1993 Russian Gosatomnadzor is to investigate enterprises, organizations, and military units...under the Russian Ministry of Defense in order to check the maintenance of nuclear and radiation safety.'' But neither the first nor the second directive from the state's highest executive officer was implemented.
