It renewed its rejection of the "undertaking statement" which the occupation forces want the detainees to sign before they can be released from detention centers. A statement issued by Hamas, a copy of which AL-HAYAH's Damascus bureau has received, says: "We demand the immediate release of Shaykh Yasin and his detained brothers. We condemn discrimination between detainees on the basis of their political and ideological positions. Yasin has rejected all the enemies' bargaining over his release. He has also turned down the offers made by (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq) Rabin and (Foreign Minister Shim'on) Peres to release him immediately in return for supporting the so-called peace agreement." The movement warned of "the deterioration of Yasin's health. We condemn the obstruction of his receiving medical treatment and undergoing surgical operations and the enemy government's persistence in refusing to allow a national team to supervise Ahmad Yasin's treatment. We hold the Rabin government responsible for anything that may happen to him." The movement renewed its absolute rejection of "the humiliating document (the undertaking statement) which the enemy authorities" say must be signed. The movement said that "while Hamas salutes the steadfastness of Palestine's Shaykh and his brothers detained in the occupation jails, it stresses that their detention will lead only to further escalation and resistance against the occupation. All sincere people and mujahidin will continue their efforts to secure the release of Shaykh Yasin and his heroic brothers." Meanwhile, a statement issued by the "Palestinian Forces Alliance" opposed to the Oslo accord has urged governments of the Arab and Islamic states and international organizations to work to secure Yasin's release. It said: "It is meaningless to release some detainees and continue to hold others. Human rights are indivisible." Abu-Hamad Mustafa, Hamas' representative in Damascus, told AL-HAYAH that the alliance yesterday staged a sit-in outside the International Red Cross offices. Alliance representatives demanded Yasin's release. Hamas' representative added that the representatives submitted a memorandum to the UN office for delivery to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali.
