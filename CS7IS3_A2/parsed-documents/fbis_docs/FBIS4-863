FBIS4-863 "drafr075_a_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda Kigali Battle Intensifies; Heavy Shelling Reported Kigali Battle Intensifies; Heavy Shelling Reported AB1904081594 Paris AFP in English 0750 GMT 19 Apr 94 AB1904081594 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Kigali, 19 Apr (AFP) -- Fighting intensified in Kigali early Tuesday [19 April], with "heavy shelling and lots of gunfire" as rebels battled government forces for control of the body-strewn Rwandan capital, a United Nations official said. The increase in fighting followed an admission by Army commanders Monday that 1,000 rebel reinforcements had entered Kigali. Acting Armed Forces chief of staff General Marcel Gatsinzi said the military was prepared to consider all rebel conditions for a ceasefire. But UN officials contacted by telephone in Kigali said the two sides had failed to meet to negotiate a ceasefire because they had rejected each other's demands. The rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front wants the disbanding of the interim government proclaimed after the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana in a mysterious April 6 plane crash. Habyarimana's death triggered a frenzied bloodbath as hardliners from his majority Hutu tribe, led by the presidential guard which accused the rebels of shooting down the president's plane, massacred members of the minority Tutsi group that dominates the rebel movement. The Red Cross said tens of thousands of people had been killed in the past 12 days of frenzied ethnic carnage in the capital and around the small central African highland nation. Most of those killed were Tutsis or people accused of supporting the rebels, though some witnesses have reported revenge killings by rebel guerrillas or Tutsi civilians. The massacres triggered an exodus of tens of thousands of refugees to neighbouring countries, the Red Cross said.
