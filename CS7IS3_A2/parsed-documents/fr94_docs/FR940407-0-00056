FR940407-0-00056 FR940407-0-00012 40 CFR Part 271 [FRL&hyph;4860&hyph;1] Colorado; Final Authorization of State Hazardous Waste Management Program Revisions AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Immediate final rule. SUMMARY: The State of Colorado has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Colorado's application and has made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that Colorado's hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Colorado's hazardous waste program revisions. Colorado's application for program revision is available for public review and comment. DATES: Final authorization for Colorado shall be effective on June 6, 1994 unless EPA publishes a prior Federal Register action withdrawing this immediate final rule. All comments on Colorado's program revision application must be received by the close of business by May 9, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of Colorado's program revision application are available during regular business hours at the following addresses for inspection and copying: Colorado Department of Health, Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division, 4300 Cherry Creek Drive South, Denver, Colorado 80222&hyph;1530, phone number: 303/692&hyph;3300; and USEPA Region VIII, 999 18th Street, Suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2466, phone number: 303/293&hyph;1444.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6929(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows states to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the HSWA requirements under section 3006(g), of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements. Revisions to state hazardous waste programs are necessary when federal or state statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, state program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260&hyph;266, 268, 124 and 270. B. Colorado Colorado initially received final authorization on November 2, 1984. Colorado received authorization for revisions to its program on November 7, 1986, on July 14, 1989, and on July 9, 1991. On February 28, 1991, Colorado submitted a draft program revision application for additional revisions, and on October 1, 1993, Colorado submitted a final program revision application. Today, Colorado is seeking approval of these program revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). EPA has reviewed Colorado's draft and final applications, and has made an immediate final decision that Colorado's hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to Colorado. The public may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until May 9, 1994. Copies of Colorado's application for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the Addresses section of this notice.
