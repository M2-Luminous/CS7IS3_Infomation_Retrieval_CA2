Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-29Mar94-Russia NATO Partnership Proposal Meets Hedged Support, Ambivalence SUMMARY While campaigning to convince the new legislature of the value of Russian accession to NATO's Partnership for Peace, Russian government officials continue to portray the program as merely an interim step toward broader European security measures that will provide prominent status for Russia. Influential members of the Duma, on the other hand, are taking a skeptical attitude, expressing concern that the terms of Russia's association with NATO will be dictated, rather than negotiated, and will harm Russia's security interests. Although the Defense Ministry newspaper has supported joining the program, other media commentary across the political spectrum appears to reflect nationalistic fears that Russian interests will be damaged whether or not it joins the Partnership. END SUMMARY Testifying at 16-17 March Duma hearings, government officials promoted accession to the NATO Partnership for Peace program, arguing that Russia will gain influence by joining but risks isolation if it does not. Yuriy Nazarkin, head of the coordination and interaction department of the Security Council's staff; Yuriy Ushakov, head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' (MFA) Department for European Cooperation; and Major General Pavel Zolotarev from the Defense Ministry all stressed that to "disregard" Partnership for Peace would mean a disastrous self- isolation that would damage Russia's security. Nazarkin and Ushakov warned that refusing to join would strengthen those who were pushing for NATO expansion and argued that in joining Russia could influence the program (Interfax, 17 March). In enumerating a long list of membership advantages, Zolotarev contended that by joining Russia would demonstrate to the world its interest in collective security and "neutralize" the anti- Russian forces that are seeking to exclude Russia from the international arena (Krasnaya Zvezda, 18 March). Moscow's Mixed Signals Despite this supportive testimony and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's statement that Russia would join the program soon, other signals from the government suggest that it is unsure about how fast to move ahead. After his 17 March meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry, Grachev told reporters that "groups of experts" are "already completing work" on Russia's membership application, adding optimistically that "we shall be able to join the concept by the end of the month" (ITAR-TASS, 17 March). More cautiously, however, First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin said it was "too early" to discuss when Russia would sign on to the program (Interfax, 18 March). A 19 March Nezavisimaya Gazeta article, discounting speculation that Grachev meant that Russia would "definitely" sign in March, cited a Foreign Ministry "clarification" that the signing might take place in late March or more likely later. The article attributed the delay to the need to finish drafting the documents, "wind up interdepartmental consultations," and "solve a number of technical problems"--including who would sign, Grachev or Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. In addition, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and other senior officials have continued to express reservations about the program--particularly its implications for NATO expansion--and to press for movement toward alternative European security measures: -- In his 24 February address to the Duma, Yeltsin warned against any NATO expansion without Russia and made clear that, while Moscow supported Partnership for Peace, it viewed the program as a waystation to building a pan-European partnership "open to all states of the greater Europe" in which CSCE would take the lead and NATO would be relegated to a subordinate role (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 February). -- After a meeting with FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe in Berlin on 11 March, Grachev intimated that he views the program as only a stopgap measure until new European security structures emerge, touting the CSCE as the "main peace-keeping organization in Europe," and noting that "time will tell what the [NATO] structure will be like" (ITAR-TASS, 11 March). These remarks echoed his suggestion to reporters on 2 February that the program was transitional, providing for a coordinated effort to defuse tensions in Europe by NATO and other countries, including Russia, during "an interim period following the breakup of the Warsaw Pact." He also reiterated his previous warnings against the accession of former Warsaw Pact members and the Baltic states to NATO (Interfax, 2 February). -- Kozyrev, likewise, has continued to warn against NATO expansion and laud CSCE merits. In an address to a 10 March MFA Foreign Policy Council session, he complained about "NATOcentrism" within the alliance which has led to a push for a "mechanical" expansion, adding that this demonstrates a "vacuum of strategic thought" and undermines the goal of "moving toward a single, Greater Europe" (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Kommersant-Daily, 11 March). Although Kozyrev said Russia is close to signing Partnership for Peace documents, he continued to argue that CSCE should become the core of Europe's security system. Like Grachev, he hinted that collaboration within a NATO framework might be only temporary, saying that a "necessary historical period" perhaps "two to three years in length" had "opened up" to "elaborate and implement cooperation programs." Similarly in a 17 March Izvestiya article, he said that NATO was "inadequate" and "unsuitable" for "current purposes" and contended that while Partnership for Peace would provide "a partial answer" to security problems, it could not "be considered the pinnacle of achievement." In a sign that not all of Yeltsin's administration share the view that Russia has more to gain than to lose by joining the program, Presidential Council adviser Andranik Migranyan, in a 15 March Nezavisimaya Gazeta article titled "Why Join, If It Is Better Not To Join," strongly opposed Russian accession. Claiming that there is no consensus on the issue within the Foreign Ministry, he listed numerous adverse consequences if Russia joins. He contended that the program would deepen Russia's isolation and "sharply limit its freedom for foreign policy maneuvering." Doubts in the Duma Many influential members of the Duma apparently remain ambivalent about the Partnership plan, opposing what they view as NATO's "dictat," and worried that a broad range of security interests from the competitiveness of Russia's defense industries to its security arrangements with other CIS countries will suffer: -- Former Ambassador to the United States Vladimir Lukin, a member of the moderately reformist Yavlinsky bloc and chairman of the Duma's international affairs Committee, conceded the Partnership idea was good, but said the "devil was in the details," which had been insufficiently thought through (Moscow radio, 17 March). He said that Russia, "instead of trying to "push to the head of the line" to join, should carefully analyze what should be done for a more active rapprochement with NATO and closely follow NATO's reorganization. Lukin also expressed concern that involvement with the Partnership program could wreck Russia's "strategic intentions to create security structures within the CIS framework" (Krasnaya Zvezda, 18 March) -- Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of the Duma's defense committee and a Russia's Choice member, said while in Washington with a Duma delegation that he objected to membership on the grounds that "the framework agreements were drawn up without [the Duma's] participation and do not conform to Russia's status" and that NATO standardization would be "simply destructive" for Russia's defense industries. He advocated instead a security alliance between Russia and other countries in which the guidelines would not be set by NATO, as in the case of Partnership for Peace, but would be worked out "jointly" (Interfax, 9 March; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 18 March). More recently, however, he appears to have changed his position on joining. During the Duma hearings Yushenkov said he supports Russian membership, but maintains it should be carried out on special terms given Russia's "status as a nuclear power." Like many government officials, he contended that the NATO program should be viewed as "the beginning of a path toward a common security system" (Interfax, 17 March). -- Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the Duma's CIS affairs committee and co-chairman of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord faction, warned the MFA Foreign Policy Council session that Russia's participation in the "Partnership" program would dash its hopes [unspecified] in the "near abroad," because even now CIS countries were trying to "blackmail" Russia by appealing to the West for help (Kommersant-Daily, 11 March). Media Reaction Russia media commentary on the Partnership for Peace program has reflected fears about isolation if Russia fails to join, suspicion that Russian interests may suffer if it does join, and resentment that Russia's options thus are limited. NATO bashing has been a staple of procommunist newspapers like Pravda and has intensified in the wake of the February NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, but even reformist and pro-Yeltsin newspapers appear ambivalent toward membership, although the Defense Ministry newspaper, Krasnaya Zvezda, supported it: -- The procommunist newspaper Pravda printed a long diatribe on 16 March by retired general Viktor Chudov, who charged that Partnership for Peace was designed as a cover for "peace U.S.- style" and "world domination." The article, which claimed that planned U.S.-Russian exercises were designed to counter "reunification sentiments" in former Soviet republics and to inspire "separatists and nationalists" to "vigorous activity," lambasted the Defense Ministry's "top brass" for engaging in such exercises instead of carrying out its own war games designed to repel aggression "by a coalition of nuclear powers." -- The reformist newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta, which printed the highly critical Migranyan article, frontpaged another article on 15 March titled "Russia's Partnership With NATO Is A Misalliance." The article maintained that Russia could have received better terms if it had held out longer before agreeing to join, claiming that there had been growing sentiment in the West to offer Moscow something more in line with its "great power" status. Now, the article warned, Moscow confronts a new dilemma: to face isolation and discrimination if it does not become a full member of NATO, or to place its armed forces, military plans, and budget under the command and control of the United States if it does join, since "under a long-standing tradition, the NATO commander in chief has always been and remains an American general." -- A 23 March article in the mass-circulation newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda contended that, although Moscow had little choice, it would be "humiliating" for it to follow "in the wake of U.S. policy," "jostling for space on the margins." Complaining that "Washington is the banker and Russia is "forced to play blind," the article noted sarcastically that "you can judge for yourselves how far such 'partnership' can be called mutually beneficial and equal." -- A 16 February article in the usually pro-Yeltsin newspaper Izvestiya warned that Russia could lose its arms market in Eastern Europe as countries switched to NATO standards. A 19 March Izvestiya article admitted that the program was not popular in the Duma and gave minimal support to the government's campaign to promote it, confining its advocacy to pointing out that without Russia the program was "meaningless" and that Moscow had made clear to Secretary Perry that Russia intends to join "on its own terms." -- On 22 March, prominent Krasnaya Zvezda commentator Aleksandr Golts, echoing the government's line, strongly backed Partnership for Peace and criticized the "emotional" arguments of its opponents. Claiming that the actual partnership program had emerged because Washington "was forced to take Moscow's tough stance [on NATO expansion] into consideration," Golts stressed that the main point in the program was that each country would develop its own relationship with NATO on a bilateral basis and that Moscow is elaborating terms "which will take maximum account of Russian interests." Golts insisted that "the fears that Russia condemns itself to a secondary role by signing the partnership program scarcely hold up," while the risks that Russia faces if it does not join "are as clear as can be": the program would "acquire an unambiguously anti-Russian thrust." Outlook While government officials support joining the NATO Partnership for Peace program as beneficial to Russia's security interests, they clearly view the program as a stop gap measure and hope it will foster the creation of a European security system in which Russia will play a major role. Influential legislators, in contrast, appear more fearful that NATO affiliation will further marginalize rather than foster Russian influence in Europe. This reaction from the legislature, coupled with the skeptical reaction from even the independent press, may pressure the government to demonstrate that it remains an equal and assertive player in the working out of the terms of any NATO partnership.
