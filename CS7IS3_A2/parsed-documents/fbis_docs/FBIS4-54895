Do you see any chances at all to take future-oriented steps in such a short period? [Moravcik] Absolutely. We have put together a cabinet of experts. Priority will be given to stabilizing the economic situation, stimulating exports, and, most important, providing social security for the people. [Frank] Is Vladimir Meciar, your former party colleague and now political adversary, making life difficult for you because he is in the opposition? After all, his political style was not always exactly fine. [Moravcik] Quite so. I think that we will not give him any chance to make commentaries that are beside the point. He has to deal nfow with experts and not with political functionaries. [Frank] If the fall election were to result in a hung parliament, would you be ready to enter into a coalition with him? [Moravcik] For this he would have to change his political style fundamentally. [Frank] By his statements on the Romanies living in Slovakia, Meciar triggered a storm of indignation in the international media. What do you think about this problem? [Moravcik] As so often, Meciar chose the wrong tone and the wrong words. On substance, however, I must say that he was right. The crime rate among this part of the population is above average, and it constitutes a burden for our budget through the high children's benefits it claims. [Frank] Are you working on a solution? [Moravcik] Creating employment means more jobs for everybody, including the Romanies. As far as child benefits are concerned, we will have to make cuts, such as freezing the increase in child benefits as of the fourth child. [Frank] According to a survey, more than 60 percent regret the separation from the Czech Republic.... [Moravcik] In the long term, it was our only chance.
