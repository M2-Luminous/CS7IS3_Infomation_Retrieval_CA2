FBIS4-48652 "drafr100_c_94023" FBIS-AFR-94-100 Daily Report 22 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Discusses Program Discusses Program MB2205165094 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1423 GMT 22 May 94 MB2205165094 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [By Dirk van Zyl] [Text] Cape Town May 22 SAPA -- Mr Tony Leon, appointed interim leader of the Democratic Party [DP] on Sunday, has pledged himself to promoting liberal democracy as the "salvation of South Africa". In his first press interview after he had beaten DP Federal Chairman Ken Andrew to the position, Mr Leon, 37, told SAPA he also intended writing a letter to President Nelson Mandela on Monday, pledging the DP's support in principle for the African National Congress' Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP] and for Mr Mandela's "very valued effort" at nation building. But he stressed the RDP would only touch peoples' lives if it was sustainable and cost-effective. "At the moment it is a menu with a variable price list. We've got to create durable job opportunities, not just once-off job creation schemes," Mr Leon said. He also believed Deputy President F W de Klerk should be called to the bar of Parliament to explain the "squalid" KwaZulu land deal. Mr Leon said the DP could make a "very postive" contribution and the party had to "come into its own through glasnost (openness)". Total public accountability had to be applied in all facets of public life -- including the KwaZulu land deal. Mr Leon said a second "acid test" facing South Africa in the immediate future was whether the judges of the Constitutional Court would be appointed through a process of public hearing. Mr Leon added: "I also want to expand very rapidly and transcendingly the DP's base in South Africa. We have a rare opportunity to do so." He said he was "humbled but challenged" by his leadership appointment. The election -- in the 75 member DP Federal Council -- had been "the most creative of all contests I've been in." Mr Leon joined the Progressive Party youth wing at the age of 11, was a Johannesburg city councillor at 29, and succeeded Mrs Helen Suzman as MP for Houghton in 1989 at the age of 32. He is a son of Mr Justice Ramon Leon, head of the Independent Media Commission. Sources at Sunday's Federal Council meeting -- which was called to appoint an acting leader to replace Dr Zach de Beer, who retired from public life recently -- said Mr Leon had been given a standing ovation after the straight contest with Mr Andrew in which he had obtained a clear majority. Mr Andrew had gone up to congratulate him immediately after the results had been announced, one of the sources said. The DP is to elect its permanent new leader at a federal congress, scheduled for Durban in September.
