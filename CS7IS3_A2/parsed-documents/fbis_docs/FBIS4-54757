In what kind of goods, apart from special equipment [euphemism for arms], oil, and gas, are we interested? [Schmognerova] The Russian side actually does not even want to discuss the repayment of the debt with oil and gas deliveries. It wants to repay the greatest possible part in dollars and, thereby, actually defer payments. The other possibility is repayment in kind. This applies to some products for the defense department, but also other products, a list of which we will prepare and send to the Russian Government. Part of the debt could also be covered by deliveries for the completion of the Mochovce nuclear power station. [Vargova] The third possibility is to swap debt for equity [kapitalizacia dluhu]. Has a decision been made about companies Slovak capital might have a stake in? [Schmognerova] The next phase of privatization will start in Russia on 1 July. This time, it will be privatization through auctions, tenders, and sale on the capital market. What complicates our position is the steadily declining offer of enterprises and the absence of legislation on the Russian side that would make it possible for us to enter Russian companies. Here, too, we will send them a list of companies, in which the Slovaks would be interested. We have agreed on one pilot company where this method will be tested. [Vargova] Russia has not yet resolved the financing of the Yamal gas pipeline across our territory. I assume that this issue was also raised during your talks.... [Schmognerova] We asked Deputy Prime Minister Y. Yarov if the Russian Government could speed up the decision on whether the gas pipeline will lead across the Slovak Republic as well. As soon as this decision is made, we can start talks on ways of financing the project. I suppose the Russian Government will be interested in taking part in financing the project. We will seek foreign investors. [Vargova] Is there a chance of arriving at specific agreements by the end of September? [Schmognerova] Definitely. The signing of an agreement on the prevention of double taxation and of an intergovernmental treaty on cooperation in the sphere of nuclear energy will be the first steps. The two countries' experts will work on preparing an agreement on the defrayal of Russia's debts toward the Slovak Republic.
