Aid projects for the future autonomous areas, among other things, were discussed. The Orient House is the headquarters of the PLO in East Jerusalem. Here, Erhard Busek started the third day of his visit to Israel. His Palestinian interlocutors were headed by Faysal al-Husayni, the PLO leader in the West Bank. He expressed both concerns and wishes. There are still numerous difficulties concerning the implementation of the autonomy, Al-Husayni pointed out. The Palestinians need political, financial, and technical support from Europe and Austria, he stressed. Money for the salaries of Palestinian officials is particularly urgently required. The meeting with State President Ezer Weizman, one of the most brilliant figures in Israeli politics, was a highlight of Busek's visit. Mr. Busek, the most important meetings of your visit to Israel have already taken place. What is your balance sheet so far? [Busek] The balance is very positive for Austria. I believe that the relationship between Israel and Austria is excellent. After a difficult period in the past, good contacts and close friendship and cooperation have developed within a short period. [Segenreich] A visit to several museums along with former Mayor Teddy Kollek was part of the relaxing part of the program. At Tel Aviv University, the vice chancellor delivered a major speech on the topic "Policy for Europe." He particularly stressed the Jewish contribution to European culture.
