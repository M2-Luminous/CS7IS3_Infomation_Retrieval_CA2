I consider that the transatlantic alliance and relations are as vital today as they were before the end of the Cold War. And our relationship is also crucial for the future. New challenges are arising and important political and economic changes are taking place both in the European Union [EU] and in the United States and also in the rest of the world. Europe and the United States have a common world responsibility. That is the reason why the agreement reached on the Uruguay Round is of great importance. It is really a major achievement and especially for European Union-United States relations. After a period during which European Union-United States relations were subject to some strain, the first visit of President Clinton to Europe provided opportunity to revitalize the European Union-United States dialogue. It was a very good surprise that President Clinton so clearly, supported European integration, expressing the view that Europe should be a very strong and equal partner. He underlined the importance of the European Union for the United States and made it clear that "America's commitment towards Europe's safety and stability remains as strong as ever." [passage omitted] Let us come now to the prospects of European Union-United States relationship. The European Union and the United States have the most important interdependent relationship in the world. Both sides have major, concrete, overlapping interests in the other. The European Union and the United States are each other's largest single trading partner. Both share fundamental political principles and both have an interest in promoting these principles in the world. Given the depth of EU-U.S. economic and political interdependence and the order of magnitude of global political, economic, trade and environmental problems which neither side can any longer solve on its own, it is imperative that both work together in order to develop common strategies and actions. This close relationship between the United States and the EU is fully reflected in the transatlantic declaration of 23 November 1990, which provides the institutional framework for the transatlantic dialogue. In it, both sides agreed inter alia on regular and intensive consultations, by making full use of and further strengthening existing procedures. With the end of the cold war, new economic and political challenges have emerged. The European Union, together with the United States, is bound to remain in the forefront of regional crisis management, especially in the framework of the United Nations. Both partners are contributing to stability and constructive change in Central and East Europe and the former Soviet Union and to the achievement of peace in ex-Yugoslavia. Both partners continue to share a common interest in the management of other political issues: China, the Middle East, and the promotion of democracy and human rights throughout the world. At the same time the EU and United States together with Japan have the common responsibility and the economic strength to stimulate world trade, to revitalize global economic growth, including employment and to reduce exchange rate instability. At the NATO summit the approval of the partnership for peace approach established a framework for enhanced political and operational military cooperation with the Central and East European countries. With respect to ex-Yugoslavia, a converging approach emerged also from the NATO summit. Formal consultations with the United States as called for by the EU have contributed to better policy coordination in this area. Following seven years of tough negotiations on the Uruguay Round, which quite often put extreme strain on the transatlantic relationship, the successful conclusion of the round in December 1993 demonstrated that both the US and the EU still have the political will to work together constructively. On the basis of competitive and cooperative partnership, the EU and the United States remain a pole of stability for the international community. But if both want to remain each other's key partner on the world scene, timely changes and adaptations will be needed in the transatlantic dialogue in order to contain potential sources of friction and to build up an agenda based on joint interest and cooperation. It is important to improve transatlantic channels of information and communication in order to avoid misinformation and the resulting friction over each other's share of the burden of financial, economic and trade efforts necessary to assist the reform process in the Central and East European countries and Russia. In order to achieve a better cooperation between the EU and the United States it is essential that the EU gets its act together and speaks with one voice on foreign and security policy issues. On the economic and trade side, it is now necessary to implement the Uruguay Round and to keep the process under political purview. The EU and the United States will have to tackle the so-called next generation of trade issues such as trade and environment, trade and social issues, trade and competition and work closely together on global issues such as population growth and environmental degradation. It is very important that an active bilateral dialogue be developed on all issues of common interests. As a European Commissioner in charge of taxation and customs, I have initiated a new dialogue in these fields between the European Commission and the United States administration. That has been fruitful in the case of the difficult problem of unitary taxation. Other tax problems of common interest could be discussed in the same way. Another field which seems to me to be crucial for the coming years is new technologies. In that field, European Union/United States cooperation should be strengthened. It is not only a matter for cooperation at governmental or public agencies level. It is a matter for business cooperation between European and American companies. In some areas, such as the new information highways, if Europe and the United States want to keep or to get a technological leadership, they must work more together. A kind of common leadership often seems to be the only way to face competition from Japan and Asia. As you can see, there are a lot of reasons why I think that the United States and Europe need each other. The challenges and common responsibilities which both the European Union and the United States have to face clearly call for more coordinated approaches, common action and closer cooperation. It is a question of political will on both sides but it is also a question of a better consciousness at all levels in the business communities and public administrations on both sides of the Atlantic ocean. Thank you for your attention.
