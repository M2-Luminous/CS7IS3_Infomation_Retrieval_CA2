This was connected with pollution by nonferrous metal industries and the occurrence of climatic conditions unfavorable for the dispersal of the city's air mass. Dust: there was a great deal of dust in the air in Aqtaw City in particular. It was four times greater than permitted levels. At the same time, the amount of airborne dust was three times above permitted levels in the cities of Zyryan and Shymkent. In comparison to the third quarter of last year, there was no appreciable change during the third quarter of this year in conditions in these cities other than the accumulation of a great deal of dust in Aqtaw City. The administration of Aqtaw City is devoting attention to these facts and will carry out measures to prevent dust from spreading in the city. Sulfur dioxide: This harmful substance is above permitted levels in Leninogorsk City (2.5 times), Oskemen City (two times) and Balqash City (1.5 times). By comparison with the third quarter of last year, it has been observed that sulfur dioxide has decreased in the air of Leninogorsk City. There have no appreciable changes in the other cities. Carbon dioxide: in as much as it has accumulated at moderate levels, this harmful substance is not above permitted levels in Kazakhstan cities. It is at permitted levels in Petropavlovsk, Semey, and Oskemen cities where concentrations are greatest. By comparison with the third quarter of last year, heavy concentrations were observed in Semey City. There were no changes in the other cities. Nitrogen dioxide: in half of the cities tested, levels of concentration were equal or less than permitted levels. The areas where concentrations were greatest were Oskemen City (1.8 times above permitted levels), Almaty City, and Aktobe City (both 1.5 times greater). By comparison with the third quarter of 1992, the level of air pollution by nitrogen dioxide had increased in Oskemen but decreased in Pavlodar. The other cities remained unchanged. Nitrogen oxide: Levels of this dangerous substance were noted in 10 Kazakh cities. On the average, levels of concentration were not above permitted levels. It was most concentrated in Oskemen City and levels there were about 70 percent of permitted levels. By comparison with the third quarter of last year, nitrogen oxide concentrations increased in Almaty, but decreased in Zhambyl. Quantities in other cities remained unchanged. Phenol: this harmful substances was also observed in 10 Kazakhstan cities. In Leninogorsk City it was four times above permitted levels, and three times in Temirtaw. Average amounts accumulating in Oskemen, Almaty, Zyryan, Qaraghandy, Petropavlovsk, and Semey were one-two times above permitted levels although concentrations in Pavlodar were at permitted levels. By comparison with the third quarter of 1992, phenol concentration levels had risen in Oskemen, Semey, and Qaraghandy, but there were no appreciable changes in other cities. Formaldehyde: it was found in the air of nine cities. It was determined that in Zhezqazghan, Leninogorsk, and Almaty concentrations were six times above norms (permitted levels). Concentrations in Qaraghandy, Aqtobe, Zyryan, Oskemen, and Shymkent were four-five times above norms. In Petropavlovsk concentrations were twice norms. By comparison to the third quarter of last year, formaldehyde concentrations increased in Almaty, Zhezqazghan, Qaraghandy, and Oskemen and decreased in Zyryan and Leninogorsk. Ammonia: this was observed in five cities. Shymkent was the city with the highest concentration, 3.5 times above norms. Aqtaw, Zhambyl, Qostanay, and Temirtaw were more or less at norm levels. By comparison to the third quarter of 1992, ammonia concentrations increased in Shymkent but decreased in Temirtaw. Hydrogen floride: average concentrations of this substance were two times above norms in Aqmola City. Concentrations were at permitted levels in Zhambyl and Shymkent. By comparison to the third quarter of 1992, concentrations were up in Aqmola while concentrations were on the decline in Zhambyl. Arsenic: concentrations in Leninogorsk and Oskemen equaled norms. Chlorine: chlorine concentrations were not above permitted levels in Pavlodar, Oskemen, and Shymkent. Pollution by airborne metals such as cadmium, nickel, copper, lead, and zinc was determined in 13 cities. In just Shymkent alone, lead concentrations were 1.5 times above norms. By comparison with the third quarter of last year, a decrease in lead pollution was observed in Balqash and Leninogorsk. Quantities of copper, nickel, cadmium and zinc in the air were at public health levels in all cities. Water Pollution Levels Research carried out by units of the Kazakh Bureau of Climatic Research have shown that in the third quarter of the year water was primarily polluted with nitrogen and nitrates, oil products, metals (copper and zinc), and phenol. The quality of water in the Zhayyq [Ural], Nura, Ile, and Qaratal basins had improved compared to the same period last year. However, water pollution had become worse in a few places. The Yelek river in the vicinity of Algha City was polluted between the fourth and the sixth class; that is, it was considered very polluted. The flow of the Sherubay and Nura was polluted between the fourth to the fifth class. It was observed that water quality in Lake Balqash, in the Yertis Canyon, and in Toranghylyq strait of Syrdariya had deteriorated considerably. It was not observed in the third quarter that the waters of the Zhayyq, the Syrdariya, Shu, Talas, Ile, Qaratal, Nura, Sarysu, Tobyl, and Yesil river basins and Lake Balqash were polluted above acceptable levels. Facts regarding the pollution of water in the basin of the Yertis River were not presented in the third quarter. Due to fuel shortage, an analysis of its water chemistry was made at the end of the month but there has been not time to analyze the materials. Radioactivity Radiation near natural sources in Kazakhstan was nine-15 microcuries per hour, and 20-60 microcuries per hour at places where there were major layers on cliffs. Increased radiation was observed in Kokshetaw Oblast. There are a number of natural sources of Uranium there. Contributing to the increase of radiation in Kazakhstan were the effects of nuclear tests carried out in Kazakhstan, the industrial activities, the Selebe and Chernobyl disasters, and the Lobnur Testing Area in China. At the same time radiation was connected with precipitation. Since 1949 there were 510 nuclear explosions in Kazakhstan. Some 470 were in the Semey Testing Area, eight at Kapustin Yar (Ed.: according to other information it has been proved that there were 11 tests at Kapustin Yar, that is in the Oral Area), one in Aqtobe, 17 in Atyraw (at the Azghyr Testing Area), 17 in Aqmola, seven in Western Kazakhstan Oblast (Ed.: one may add in the above eight), three in Mangghystaw, three in Shymkent, one in Qostanay. The combined power of these explosions, that is radioactivity, was 12.9 million curies. Most of this was concentrated in the center (epicenter) of the explosions. We are currently researching the effects of this radioactivity on the environment. It is possible that the technical activities of various industries spread radioactive pollution into the environment as well. For example, judging from preliminary information, uranium production and processing industries have accumulated 419 million tons (252,000 curies) of radioactive waste. There are 1.6 million tons (500 curies) in mining industries not producing uranium. It is estimated that there are 11.4 thousand units (32.6 thousand curies) in industries utilizing products produced by the "Izotop" Production Union and 12.3 million tons (12000 thousand curies) of waste products at energy and experimental reactors. Based upon preliminary data, the total amount of radioactive waste is 233 million tons with a total radioactivity of 13 million curies. Leaving aside nuclear explosions on the surface and in the air, highly radioactive substances producing 0.03-700 roentgens per hour have been lost and have remained unknown. It is well known that such sources were found in 1990 in Almaty and Qzylorda. They were found in 1991 at Almaty and in Kokshetaw, and in 1992 in Mangghystaw, at the "Ozenmunay" fence (not one group but four). Similar radioactive materials have been stolen from an oil plant in Atyraw Oblast. There has been observed contamination from radioactive sources due to the disintegration of storage containers at the Belogor Combine, at the Qaraghandy Metallurgical Combine, at the Mangghystaw Expedition. The fact that industrial radioactive substances used by oil producing plants have been turned over to the people, and that we have lost control over them, is extremely dangerous. Such pipes and hoses have been used at the "Khimik" and "Qurylysshy" companies in Mangghystaw Oblast, at the 58th Mobile Column of the Northern Kazakhstan Oblast Water Administration, and by garden crop producers in the area of Oskemen City. At the same time, it is well known that radioactive equipment was used on 40 occasions at the Zhanga Ozen fields, and on 21 occasions at the Zhetibay fields. The Republic of Kazakhstan chief procurator is looking into the fact that radioactive pipes were given to Taldyqorghan Oblast in 1992. Dear reader! If you read this, you must be careful about receiving and using whatever you receive, from wherever it comes. Now What About Our Food and Drink? State sanitary control organs in our republic have continued to test specially certified products (i.e., products having special permission) to prevent the spread of pesticides and nitrates into the environment and likewise to prevent harm to human health. Official services are carrying out an internal control (veterinarial, in the markets, botanical protection and planning-research stations in the fields). Looking at some facts: contamination of food products with pesticides during the third quarter of 1993 increased somewhat (0.9 percent) over the same period last year. Pesticide residues were above republic averages in Kokshetaw and Taldyqorghan oblasts (respectively 5.4 and 4.6 percent). Pesticide residues have increased in milk products. It is alarming that harmful substances in milk products brought to factories in Almaty City from Almaty Oblast have not decreased. Pollution of plant agricultural products prepared as food has remained unchanged. The figure was 3.2 percent for the third quarter of this year for the entire republic (compared to 3.1 percent for the third quarter last year). This indicator is higher than the republic average in Northern Kazakhstan Oblast, 10.5 percent, in Qyzylorda, 9.4 percent, in Eastern Kazakhstan Oblast, 8.2 percent, and in Aqtobe Oblast, 5.6 percent. Nitrates were especially noticeable in Zhambyl, Aqtobe, Eastern Kazakhstan, Northern Kazakhstan, Qaraghandy, and Kokshetaw Oblasts. Some Measures To Protect the Environment Harmful substances issued into the air are decreasing primarily due to the decline of industrial production. On the other hand, they are increasing in Zhezqazghan, Pavlodar, and Almaty Oblasts. Since, during the nine months of the present year, the "Balqashmys" Production Union and the "Zhezqazghantustimetall" Corporation produced 83.2 thousand tonnes of pollution above what was allowed, the chief state inspector of the Republic made the decision to stop work at "Balqashmys" from 1 July. Only since then have the interested parties devoted attention to the problem of the processing of sulfur anhydrides and halting the production of pollution above norms. A fine of 3 billion rubles has been levied on the industry and 1.8 billion rubles has been paid. A complaint has been made to the government and to the Republic procurator's office. The Shymkent lead plant has violated laws on the protection of the atmosphere. (As a result sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid vapor have increased excessively in the small Qazyghurt Rayon of Shymkent City.) The responsible workers have been punished and a fine has been imposed on them. The fact that the public raised the alarm allowed measures to be taken against the "Silikat" Corporation in Semey City. Since rubber was used to heat bitumen in the residential rayons of Oskemen City (when roofs were being tarred), the quality of the rayon worsened considerably. This method was prohibited at the request of the oblast environmental administration. We note that in the process of testing measures were taken to reduce the issuing of harmful substances into the air at the Pavlodar Reinforced Concrete Plant, at Almaty Healing Center No 1, at the Qaraghandy Metallurgical Combine, etc. However, planned measures and the demands of inspectors were not always carried out. Work was ordered stopped at the Leninogor Polymetal Corporation on 21 September due to violation of environmental laws but this order was not carried out. The affair is now being prepared for prosecution by the procurator's office. Land is being ruined, polluted, and mineralized in our republic. The Shalqar Agricultural Union in Aqmola Oblast has dumped trash wherever it wants. The "Aqtobemunay" Union has dumped residual fuel at drilling sites. The Qostanay Administration for Mechanized Work has obtained soil without permission; industrial wastes have been dumped on fertile land in Bozvyshen Rayon of Northern Kazakhstan Oblast, etc., etc. Fines have been levied as measures against violation of law. Republic cities and urban settlements are still not adequately equipped with plumbing. Reservoirs to collect drainage water in Oral, Petropavlovsk, Qostanay, Zhambyl, and Pavlodar (Bylqyldaq) are overfull. Measures have not been taken by the Ministry of Energy and of the Fuel Industry to process drainage water at Ekibastuz, and at the Leninogor Thermo-center. For these and other deficiencies, the Qaraghandy No 1 Machinery Factory, the Taldyqorghan Kazakh-German Union (hide processing) Industry and others have been halted. Moreover, the case of the chief engineer at the Aqtobe Chrome Fittings Factory has been turned over to the procurator's office. There has been no control exercised over the placement of wastes in Zhezqazghan, Pavlodar, Qyzylorda, Kokshetaw, Semey, and Eastern Kazakhstan Oblasts. On 14 July, 1993, the Cabinet of Ministers issued a resolution on "Development of State Resources and National Parks in the Republic of Kazakhstan." According to this resolution, funds are to be allotted to them and facilitations for workers at natural reserves are foreseen. The Ministry for the Environmental and Biological Resources has drawn up a "Scheme for the Development and Disposition of Republic of Kazakhstan Natural Reserve Resource Projects During the Period Up Until the Year 2005" and the scheme has been turned over to the Cabinet of Ministers. Chiefs of oblast governments, in collaboration with the Ministry of the Environment, have been given until 1 January, 1994 to produce other organizations out of reserves and national parks.
