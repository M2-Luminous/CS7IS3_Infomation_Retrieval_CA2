"Indonesia, like other developing countries, is concerned over efforts to link trade and labor, which will be counter-productive," Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told reporters here yesterday. The United States and France have agreed to push for clauses on labor conditions to be included in the planned trade agreement, which will be finalized at a formal meeting of GATT ambassadors at their April 12-15 meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco. "The efforts are not productive because they are forced while the Marrakesh meeting is expected to merely endorse what has thus far been achieved," Alatas said. He said the meeting should only clean up the text of the December agreement, instead of introducing additional clauses. [Passage omitted]
