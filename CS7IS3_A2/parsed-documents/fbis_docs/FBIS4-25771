Sung in Beijing] [Text] China's President Jiang Zemin has stressed that patriotism is essential for maintaining stability in Hong Kong in the transitional period and has warned that confrontation could cost the territory its future. Mr Jiang met a 20-strong delegation of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing yesterday. He told the local unionists that it was now very important for Hong Kong people to unite closely to cope with transitional matters. Mr Jiang stressed that Hong Kong people should love China and avoid confrontational action. FTU chairman Cheng Yiutong said the president urged the unionists to do more work in Hong Kong in uniting those who were willing to be loyal to China. Mr Jiang was quoted as saying that achieving stability in transition was a big issue. He offered a formula for the British colony with its history of more than a hundred years rule--that it should uphold patriotism toward its original motherland. To love China and Hong Kong were key matters. And it was especially important to love China to affect a smooth transition, he was quoted as saying. It would not be a problem for Hong Kong people to love the territory, Mr Jiang said. But loving China was quite a different matter for many Hong Kong people, for the historical reason that Hong Kong had been separated from China for about 150 years. The Chinese leader called for an improved understanding of China by Hong Kong people. He said this was a good way to strengthen the ideology of patriotism in the territory. He said more communication between China and Hong Kong would be necessary for this. Uniting Hong Kong people under a banner of patriotism could guarantee stability and a smooth transition, Mr Jiang said. He told the unionists that the Chinese position on Hong Kong was that the key to the territory's prosperity lay on the mainland. Hong Kong had to co-operate with China, and good coordination between the two systems was vital. He stressed that Hong Kong must not take a confrontational attitude to China or reject China. He told the local delegation that Hong Kong would come to an end without any future if it took the latter attitude. Mr Jiang said the policy of "one country, two systems" and a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong after it reverted to Chinese control in 1997 should not be doubted. This was the central government's fixed policy on the territory, he said.
