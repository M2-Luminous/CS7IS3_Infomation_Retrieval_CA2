In an interview with Jack Katzenell, Posuvalyuk said Russia is coordinating its Middle East policy with the United States. He dismissed the suggestion that Yasir 'Arafat is trying to exploit the traditional rivalry between the two superpowers to obtain last minute concessions from Israel. [Begin recording] [Posuvalyuk] I think that Yasir 'Arafat adequately and in a right way understands that Russian cosponsor stands, let us say, in the middle between the two parties as the American cosponsor does. We are trying to help both parties. My concept is that the Israeli Government and the leadership of the PLO are in one boat. So, they are moving ahead with this peace process. They are helping each other, and they are serving their own interests. There is no contradiction. [Katzenell] Have you had a warm welcome here in Israel? [Posuvalyuk] Yes, yes. And I thank the Israeli Government for this warm welcome. [Katzenell] What are you going to do next, sir? [Posuvalyuk] I suppose in a few days, maybe -- in two or three days -- I am going to take part in Russian-American consultations on the Middle East. [end recording]
