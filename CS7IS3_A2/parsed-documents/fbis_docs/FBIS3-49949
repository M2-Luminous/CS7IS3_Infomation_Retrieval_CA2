Diplomatic circles in Belgrade set out on Thursday that the agreements signed between the F.R.Y. and Croatia and between the Serb Republic (RS) and Herceg-Bosna in Geneva on Wednesday will also facilitate the resolution of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to the same circles, it is extremely important that the agreements signed in Geneva proceed from the de facto situation which is practically becoming a de jure one. The RS and Herceg-Bosna, the states of the Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats, respectively, have signed the document on the normalization of relations although they have not internationally been recognized as sovereign states. At the same time, Croatia has signed a similar document with the F.R.Y. which is recognized as a state, although its right to continuity in relation to the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is disputed. It is believed in Belgrade that, by signing the document on the normalization of relations with the F.R.Y., Croatia has abandoned the option of war as a means of resolving its relations with the Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK). It is set out in Belgrade in that context that what is involved is only the beginning of a normalization process, which absolutely in no way delves into relations between Zagreb and the RSK and in no way prejudices the eventual solution. It is said that the mutual recognition between Belgrade and Zagreb and the establishment of diplomatic relations between them has most likely been left for the final stage of the process. As far as the Bosnian Muslims are concerned, it is obvious that they have in a way been isolated in Bosnia-Herzegovina since Wednesday, since their hitherto strategy of insisting on the war option has totally been defeated. It is beyond doubt that the Bosnian Muslims will no longer be able to use Serbs as an alleged excuse when they sit down at the negotiating table in Geneva again on February 10. RS President Radovan Karadzic was right when he said on the eve of the latest round of the Geneva talks that "nothing will any longer be the same" in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
