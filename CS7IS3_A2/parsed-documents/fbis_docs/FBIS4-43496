In further reaction, the chairman of the Lower House Constitutional Affairs Committee [Gustavo Selva] urged the resignation of RAI management and the naming of a special commissioner and a former Lower House speaker [Giorgio Napolitano] spoke against government tampering with the broadcaster as members of the RAI editorial staff demonstrated and Berlusconi talked to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro about the RAI case. Against the backdrop of headlines reporting the opinions of the premier, whose Fininvest holds the commercial television monopoly, the Democratic Party of the Left, Communist Renewal and other opposition parties met to push for mobilization "in defense of the right to information and as an immediate reply to the premier's exceptional infringement in the issue of the radio and television system," said a communique issued by these leftist alignments. Also today, the public broadcaster's editorial staff staged a demonstration in front of the Lower House building on what they called, D-Day, or "the longest day." Leaflets handed out by about 50 RAI journalists said, "As opposed to what happened in Normandy, where the invaders brought freedom, there is today the threat of a new `occupation,' of the public service." "Berlusconi lets it be known that RAI must get into line, otherwise he'll take care of things personally in a few days. So were the other premiers who personally `handled' RAI right, in degrading it professionally and loading it with debt?," asked the flyer. With the arrival of MPs, the demonstration turned into an open-air debate, with some of the "stars" of the airwaves on hand, and then into a "happening" when protesting miners whose jobs are threatened were called over to join the show. Inside, Constitutional Affairs Committee Chairman Gustavo Selva, of the neofascist National Alliance, said the "professors" who head RAI should have tendered their resignations some time back. "If they don't, approaching is a solution proposed by me for the naming of a commissioner for RAI." He also said a "save-RAI" bill, a supplementary funding package for the heavily indebted broadcaster, should be rejected by the Parliament because RAI should not be allowed to have three sources of income, advertising revenues, annual fees paid by the viewing public and public funds to level off debt. Selva applauded Berlusconi's remarks, made yesterday, and declared: "It is evident that RAI programs are anti-government. This is an anomaly. In Germany, France, Britain, the public broadcaster does not allocate an opposition attitude to the government as does RAI. This is an anomaly to correct. But perhaps the RAI editorial staff should do this," added the committee chairman. Taking the opposite view was Giorgio Napolitano, the former Lower House speaker, who wrote a letter to the speakers of the two new houses in which he argued, "It is admissible for the new ruling coalition to demand the resignation of the RAI board, named on the basis of a law approved by the Parliament. Laws cannot be torn up like this." He went on say he thought it correct to submit his views to Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio, of Berlusconi's Forza Italia, and Lower House Speaker Irene Pivetti, of Northern League government ally, because of their roles "above the sides and their scrupulous balance." If the present government upsets recovery and revision under way in RAI, argued Napolitano, the result would be only the application of a new spoils system which would "deal the public service a death blow." In conclusion, the former speaker said, "RAI must be reformed, as provided for in the law passed by the Parliament in June, and reform must define the way for naming a future board after the present one completes its mandate. But RAI cannot be manipulated in violation of the law and the constitutional principles which safeguard it." [passage omitted] The premier, talking later in the day about the turn-out of RAI journalists, said, "This reaction conceals the usual disinformation of certain communications mediums which, thinking only of maintaining the status quo at RAI, evidently cannot even stand to have the problem brought up." After disclosing that he and the head of state had discussed the RAI problem, "seeing that this is disinformation," Berlusconi said that many newspapers had totally turned around the meaning of what he had said. "I think I expressed a very balanced opinion, perhaps banal, and that is that I hoped that the public service would stay independent, autonomous, balanced and that it would look to government activities with a free spirit, talking well of it or badly, according to the time and what the executive does," he said. In the meantime, Berlusconi's Forza Italia said the clamour raised in the newspapers today only shows "once again the prejudicial position against this government taken by most of the press." This communique also urged, as regards RAI news, "a return to the objectivity, independence and pluralism which takes into account that the greater part of the voters have determined the formation of the coalition ruling the country."
