In the Sulaimaniya area, thousands are fleeing from the fighting, Eberhard Walde, chief of the German Liaison Bureau in the region, told DPA in Bonn in a telephone interview on 19 May. He said that while Iranian artillery attacked Kurdish settlements from the east, Turkish aircraft dropped bombs from the north, which has led to another stream of civilian refugees. Meanwhile, the autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq has virtually been shared between the two rival parties, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Democratic Party of Kurdistan, which are continuing their armed conflicts, Walde said.
