However, their production is continuing in Russia, a fact which threatens the ecology. Lev Fedorov, a scientist and chemist, made this declaration intending to cause a sensation, on the occasion of presenting his book "Chemical Weapons in Russia: History, Ecology, Politics." In the scientific work which he presented, Doctor of Chemical Sciences Fedorov makes public a survey of the events connected with the activities of the military-chemical complex, whose secrets have traditionally been held "behind seven seals." The book is full of sensations. In particular, the scientist asserts that there are about 100 geographic regions in Russia, where it is a threat to one's life and health to live, as a result of the production, testing or storage of toxic substances for military use.
