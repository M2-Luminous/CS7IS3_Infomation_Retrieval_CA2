[passage omitted] The additional areas are primarily regional communities that meet the criteria for both EU one and six subsidies. The Ministry would still like Etela-Pohjanmaa to be a subsidized area. The province's population density is over the required limit, or more than eight inhabitants per square kilometer. On the other hand, the national product per inhabitant is under 75 percent of the average EU figure and the second-lowest in Finland. The Ministry has also listed a couple of districts that are large in terms of number of people, which just barely exceed the eight-inhabitant limit: the Nivala (43,000 inhabitants) and Iisalmi (72,000) areas. Their gross naitonal product is under the 75-percent limit. The districts of Pyhanta, Ii, Viitasaari, Kaustinen, Saarijarvi, Virrat, Nilsia, Sysma, Hankasalmi, Savitaipale, Liminka, Suonenjoki, and Keuruu are also new areas. If category six subsidies could be gotten for the entire area the Ministry plans to include, the subsidized area would cover 24.4 percent of the population. At the beginning of the week the EU offered Finland a "category six subsidy," which is about 10-percent smaller, instead of the highest area subsidy. The subsidized area would be the same as the category one subsidy planned earlier, that is, Lapland, Kuusamo, Kainuu, Pohjois-Karjala, and Etela-Savo.
