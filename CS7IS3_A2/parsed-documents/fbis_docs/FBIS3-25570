Speaking to the Radio Mozambique's correspondent in Quelimane, (Domingos Jambe), Frelimo provincial secretary for organization and mobilization, condemned what he described as the prevailing one-party system in areas under Renamo's control. (Jambe) said that it was dishonest for Renamo to do its political work with impunity in government-controlled areas while preventing other parties from doing the same in its areas.
