The Romanian Government had an open attitude in 1992, when King Mihai I was in Romania; in autumn 1993 he was asked to adopt a clear position toward the rules of the Romanian Constitution. "I do not want to take similar measures to those taken throughout history by France, Italy, or Greece (in connection with former monarchs and their direct descendants). Therefore, we want to have a clear statement from him," said President Iliescu, who avoided giving a clear answer to the question: "Will King Mihai be granted an entry visa to Romania?"
