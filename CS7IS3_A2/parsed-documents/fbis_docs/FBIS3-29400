That was up 0.2 percentage point from a revised 1.4 percent year-to-year expansion for December, the report said. The broader measure of liquidity, including postal savings, government bonds and investment trusts, rose 3.0 percent in January from a year before, after a preliminary 2.9 percent year-to-year gain in December. The closely watched money supply figure measures cash in circulation, time and demand deposits and certificates of deposit (CDs). Its outstanding balance for January averaged 513.7 trillion yen, the central bank said. The January 1.6 percent year-on-year increase marked the first growth pace pickup in four months. Although January's year-to-year money supply growth exceeded that of December, it represented one-time factors rather than a change in trend, a central bank official said. He predicted money supply growth would stay in the 1.0-2.0 percent range for the next couple of months, as it has since May. One factor making the January figure look bigger was the end of the effect on year-to-year comparisons caused by a change last year in the tax system to monthly payments of inheritance taxes, the official told reporters. They had been paid in twice-yearly lump sums before that. Also, a weaker yen last month inflated the value of foreign- currency holdings in yen terms, he said. Asked about the effect of this week's sharp surge by the yen, the official said it is too early to tell if it will continue and contribute to lowering the February money supply results. During January, CDs declined from a year earlier, but growth picked up in time and demand deposits. January's 1.6 percent money supply growth roughly met the expectations of economists at 12 financial institutions who had predicted 1.5 percent year-to-year growth for January. The survey earlier this week by KYODO NEWS SERVICE found predictions ranging from 1.3 percent to 1.9 percent.
