"It's certainly the case that Japan has the capability to possess nuclear weapons but has not made them," Hata told reporters inside the Diet building. He said Japan has abstained from doing so in line with its obligations as a nonnuclear power under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Hata made the comment in connection with an alleged remark he made in a House of Councillors Budget Committee meeting earlier in the day. The prime minister was quoted by parliamentarians as having said he "agrees absolutely" with an interpellator's view that Japan should confirm to other nations that it can indeed produce nuclear weapons, though it is refraining from doing so for political reasons. The interpellator, Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Hiroshi Oki, cited the NPT and Japan's so-called three nonnuclear principles -- to not possess, manufacture or introduce nuclear weapons on its territory. Hata denied to reporters that he made the alleged remark, though Oki insisted the prime minister "roundly affirmed" Japan's potential for producing nuclear weapons. It is believed to be the first time for the Japanese Government to directly acknowledge such potential in the Diet or publicly. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai called Hata's remarks a somewhat insufficient explanation of the government's true position. He told reporters that Japan "limits its use of nuclear energy to peaceful purposes, abstains from military utilization and does not endeavor to possess nuclear weapons technology or know-how."
