The Serbian and the Montenegrin peoples have their authentic national histories, however, there would be no survival for us had we not united our flags of the same colors for a joint future. For centuries, our people have had to watch for and defend itself from the conquerors, to ensure their biological survival and living space with arms, bravery, and collective intelligence. We have had our own national armies and each of them -- the Serbian and the Montenegrin -- veiled history in timeless epics. July 16 is a symbol of the unification of the military forces of two peoples of the same blood and one of the foundation stones in the heroic history, which confirms that only with joint forces and in aspiration of the same goals can we defeat any enemy. There is a war going on in our vicinity. The Serbian people in the Srpska republic and in the republic of Serbian Krajina are fighting the decisive battle for their survival. The preservation of their freedom and territory would not be possible without the policy of peace pursued by the FRY. The determination for peace has been made conditional on the manner of outcome of the Balkan drama and we greet wholeheartedly all the solutions that are leading toward just peace. The enemies of the Serbian nation, unfortunately, want war, by trying to transform their blatant military defeats into diplomatic victories with foreign forces. Because of the just struggle of the Serbs on the territories that they have inhabited and created over centuries, our fatherland has been punished. All the sanctions are now a dark symbol of the confinement of an entire nation, and a squaring of accounts on children, helpless, and ill people who are the innocent victims of the ruthless intentions of the international superpowers to reshape the Balkan territory to suit their interests. Currently, the FRY is also being threatened with military force. Some so-called humanists from the wide world have demanded the bombing and further decimation of our population. Unfortunately, they have been joined by some citizens of this country, who have thus cast a curse upon their own nation and their fatherland, and called for the [word indistinct] on their towns and co-residents. This has never happened before in the famous history of the Serbian and the Montenegrin peoples. The FRY Army does not want a war. The participants of the war know what it brings and what it takes away and that is why peace is the goal of all our goals in the FRY. However, not a single army that cherishes the traditions on which it was built can accept peace at all costs and if the freedom, dignity, and pride of the nation is endangered. We are building an army of professionals that will protect peace with its readiness for war and capability to win it, if it is imposed on us.
