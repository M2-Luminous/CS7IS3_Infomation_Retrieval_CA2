This is what Spanish officials think, and this is the view they will argue in discussions about Spanish participation in Eurocorps, the embryo of the future armed branch of the European Union. Talks will begin in February and are expected to conclude by sometime this spring. Belgium for its part insists on equal status for the Dutch language. After 45 years of NATO, English is today the lingua franca of the armed forces, according to Spanish officials. A historical paradox: Spain, the last country to join the Alliance, is acting as the principal defender of the "Atlantic language." At this point, language is the Eurocorps' biggest stumbling block. Originally it was expected that the 50,000-person European army corps initiated by President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl at the Franco-German summit at La Rochelle in May 1992 would have two official languages: those of its two founders. Belgium, which decided to join on 25 June, about the time it assumed the EC presidency, demanded equal linguistic treatment for Dutch, its other official language. "I can't imagine myself having to go through an interpreter to give orders," warned French General Francois Clerc, the Eurocorps chief of staff. With Eurocorps threatening to become a tower of Babel, agreement was reached on a formula that would be satisfactory to the Belgians, preoccupied as they are with problems of internal cohesion and estrangement between the francophone and Flemish communities, but without, according to Spanish sources, putting Dutch on the same footing as German or English. What it amounts to is that orders will be translated into Dutch whenever they must be translated into French or German--something that would not occur under ordinary circumstances, since most of the command structure is bilingual. Spain, less nationalistic in its approach, is not demanding coequal status for Castilian and will conform with normal usage respecting official acts and documents. Polyglot Soldiers Spain has a different, less chauvinistic demand: It is insisting English should be the working language, substitutable for any of the other languages in daily operations. Spain maintains that the other partners need to know only one foreign language, while Spanish soldiers, working in proud isolation until just a decade ago, are asked to be polyglot. At least that is the demand being made on the 12 NCO's and officers, one of them a general, who will be detailed by the Spanish Army to the Eurocorps headquarters established on 5 November in Strasbourg (France). Modest in its pretensions, Spain does not aspire to command Eurocorps, not even on a rotating basis like General Helmut Willmann of Germany, though perhaps Spain could fill a high-level position on the headquarters staff. After all, its contribution is less than those of its other partners: a Spanish brigade (3,500 men), compared to the division (10,000) contributed by each of the other three countries. The government decided on 10 December that the unit assigned to Eurocorps will remain in Spanish territory, leaving Spain only for maneuvers or to carry out a mission. The formula for transferring command of the unit, still under discussion, will have to be compatible with Spain's obligations to NATO and with the accord reached in January 1993 between Eurocorps and the Alliance. Under the accord, Eurocorps will be placed under the allied command in case of conflict in Europe.
