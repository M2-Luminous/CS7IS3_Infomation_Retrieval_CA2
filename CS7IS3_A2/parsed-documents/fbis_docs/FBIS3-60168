Drug raids and hauls are being severely hampered because of the inadequate facilities and this comes amidst a rise in drug trafficking over the last six months. There are only about 11 officers now on staff at the Narcotics Division, less than half the required cadre of 25, said Senior Superintendent Oswald Dwyer, chief at the Narcotics Division. Raids Added to this problem, the Division does not have enough vehicles for the officers and this is affecting movement during emergencies and raids. Although Superintendent Dwyer was unable to say how many vehicles the Division has and how much [words missing], THE GLEANER understands that there is frequent rotation of vehicles used by the Narcotics Division. Even sniffer dogs, the most important drug detection component, are in limited supply. However, a move is being made to get and train additional dogs. The dogs are used to detect illegal drugs at the island's ports and the two international airports. The Narcotics Chief, however, pointed out that the Division is trying its best to detect, as much as possible, all contraband drugs coming in and going out the island through the island's airports and ports. About 33,979 kg of ganja were seized between January and August this year. In 1991 about 41,393 kg were seized, 1.2 kg less than the amount seized last year. Up to August this year, 61 kg of cocaine had been seized along with 511 pieces of crack. In 1991 the division seized some 68 kg of cocaine and 1,057 pieces of crack while in 1992 the amount of cocaine seized had risen to 661 kg.
