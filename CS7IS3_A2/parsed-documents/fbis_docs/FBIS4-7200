Sato, 70, has advocated that Japan should abolish the death penalty. Sato, a House of Representatives legislator of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a core political party in the coalition government led by new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, is also a Buddhist priest. Japan, one of the few remaining developed countries with capital punishment, had not executed death row inmates for three years and four months from November 1989, but resumed hanging last year, putting three people to death in March and four in November. Sato has been elected to the House of Representatives nine times since 1969 from the sixth constituency of Osaka Prefecture. Before becoming a politician, he was a bureaucrat at the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and later served as posts and telecommunications minister from 1984 to 1985. He was a member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) -- the former ruling party now in opposition -- until last summer and once belonged to the LDP faction of late former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. Sato quit the LDP last June and formed Shinseito with other defectors including Hata. His late father had served as Defense Agency chief and Osaka governor.
