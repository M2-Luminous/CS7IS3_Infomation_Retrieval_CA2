In this regard, moments ago we interviewed Colonel Gustavo Socha Salamanca, general director of prisons. [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Col. Socha, what are the measures that the Penitentiary and Prison Institute is announcing in relation to the strike declared by guards at La Picota, La Modelo, and El Buen Pastor Prisons in Santa Fe de Bogota? [Socha] I want to clarify that prison guards have not declared any strike. At this time there is nothing of this sort occurring in the country's prisons. I ordered the inspection division to conduct the pertinent investigations. I also requested support from the Attorney General's Office to disclose all reports on developments during and after the search to determine who failed to carry out their duties and who behaved improperly, if there was any improper behavior. In short, we want this situation resolved. [end recording]
