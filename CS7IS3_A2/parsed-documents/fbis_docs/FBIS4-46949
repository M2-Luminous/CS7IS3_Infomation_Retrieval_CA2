A letter of the tax department, the official distribution of which began yesterday, contains a quite detailed and specific listing of such receipts of foreign companies taxed "at the source of payment." The new document has considerably expanded the list of taxable receipts which, in the opinion of KOMMERSANT experts, may be viewed as a harsher tax regimen. In keeping with existing taxation procedures, only foreign companies operating on the territory of Russia through permanent representative offices pay taxes on profits through general procedures. Taxes on foreign legal entities which do not have permanent representative offices in Russia but generate receipts on its territory are levied in a special way--at the source of payment. This tax is withheld by the enterprise that pays receipts to a foreign legal entity in the currency in which the payment is made, from the full amount of receipts when each transfer toward the payment is made. The new letter of the State Tax Service is devoted to the taxation of receipts of foreign legal entities not operating through permanent representative offices. The document specifies what exactly amounts to taxable receipts in their case. In particular, as the letter notes, in addition to receipts for leasing property located on the territory of Russia, the tax should also be withheld on receipts from the increment in the cost of property received as a result of its conveyance, for example, sale. The notion of "taxable interest receipts" has been expanded considerably: Not only will amounts due on debt obligations now be taxed at the source, but also the interest on insurance premiums, fines, or penalties for violation of contractual obligations. However, innovations concerning the taxation of trading broker operations attracted the greatest attention of KOMMERSANT experts. The tax is still not levied on the receipts of foreign companies from trading operations. However, when imported goods are sold in Russia on trading brokerage terms (for example, under a consignment contract), the Russian company will have to withhold the tax prior to remitting abroad the portion of receipts generated by the sale of goods and due to the foreign company. In the process, the amount of such receipts will be determined as the difference between the sale price set by the foreign company and the price at which the Russian intermediary actually sold the goods. Of course, in this case the "difference" means the amount directly remitted to the foreign company; the receipts of the Russian enterprise are taxed through usual procedures. It is significant that these procedures for the calculation of taxable income may only be used if documents confirming the importation of goods from abroad by a foreign legal entity are available. The entire amount of gross proceeds paid to the foreign company will be taxed otherwise. It is quite understandable that agreements on the avoidance of dual taxation between Russia and other states which are in force are taken into account in the taxation of receipts. The new expanded listing of the receipts of foreign legal entities taxed at the source of receipts which takes effect at the time of official publication will make it possible for the tax organs to considerably replenish the Russian treasury and solve the problem of the failure of foreign companies to pay taxes on receipts generated on the territory of Russia.
