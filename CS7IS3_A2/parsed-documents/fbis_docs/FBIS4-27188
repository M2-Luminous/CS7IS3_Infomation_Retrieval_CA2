The decision follows the overall extension of the UN peacekeeping mission in Mozambique until November due to the delay in disarming antigovernment guerrilla forces there, the officials said. The Japanese will stay until Feb. 15, 1995 in the second extension of their dispatch. The first extension was granted in November last year. The group, who currently serve in the headquarters of the UN mission in the African nation, left Japan on May 18 to replace another group of five SDF members who returned on Sunday after serving a year there. In addition to the five, 48 SDF members are serving in two provices in Mozambique.
