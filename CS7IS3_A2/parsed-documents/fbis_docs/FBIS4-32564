Precisely the other way around. The past as well as the present government--after all, they both share credit for the independent state--are thus faced with a basic problem: how to explain to themselves as well as to the nation the escalating bankruptcy. And how to achieve the promised growth. After the Moravcik government was installed, it may have appeared for a while, especially under the influence of Rudolf Filkus's statement, that the new Cabinet will respond with a solution conforming to market conditions: appreciable devaluation that would slow down imports and at the same time promote export and economic growth. But a different tendency prevailed: Meciar's rate of exchange from the beginning of the year was affirmed in the end, and the Slovak economy is therefore gradually barricading itself from the world. The introduction of quality certificates--meaning, administrative barriers to imports--are merely one of the manifestations of this tendency. To tell the truth, the communist influx into the economic departments could hardly have led to anything else in Bratislava: Weiss's people took the office of deputy prime minister for economy (B. Schmognerova), as well as the Ministry of Economy (P. Magasi) and the Ministry of Agriculture (P. Koncos). In this configuration, there is nothing left to liberal Filkus but to try and find the money to cover the budget deficits. No matter how specific the position of the new Slovak Government is, one thing is certain: On the banks of the Danube, they began once again to "manage" the economy; they placed their subjective rationality above the objective rationality of the market. According to this approach, the customs union is good when it suits, and vice versa. In the future, not customers but officials will make decisions about imports: One barrier after another will go up, exactly the way the Slovak producers will pressure their officials to do it--or even pay them for doing it. But let us leave the consequences of this policy--that is, increasing prices and declining competitiveness--to the Slovaks themselves. The dilemma of our government is this: keep the customs union or rescind it? And, if so, when? The complexity of the answer stems from the fact--and the Slovaks are taking advantage of it--that we will necessarily also pay for the dissolution of the common economic zone, although substantially less than Bratislava itself. The macroeconomic view advises (for the time being) us to grit our teeth. But what will the specific Czech producer say about it, who cannot sell on the Slovak market, while, at the same time, the way in the opposite direction is open? Making concessions never leads anywhere, it seems to me.
