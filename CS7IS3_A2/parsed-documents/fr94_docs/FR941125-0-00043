FR941125-0-00043 FR941125-0-00019 Discussion: The NPRM made clear that §682.410(a)(3) applies only to ``reserve fund reporting,'' and in that respect it merely formalizes the existing instructions to Form 1130 (59 CFR 41185). Thus, the fact that the effective date of this regulatory requirement is in the middle of a Federal fiscal year and may be in the middle of an agency's fiscal year should not be a concern, and there is no need to specify an effective fiscal year. The new paragraph is not intended to require any change in a guaranty agency's published financial statements or the method of computing its fund balance used in those statements. It would not be appropriate, however, to change the accounting basis for Form 1130. Certain accrual and deferral items are already collected by Items E&hyph;17 to E&hyph;22 of the form. Moreover, the Secretary believes that the statutory reserve ratios of section 428(c)(9) of the HEA were selected by the Congress on the basis of the cash reserve data collected on Form 1130, and a change in the method of computing the reserve ratio would accordingly also require reconsideration of the appropriateness of the ratio itself. On the other hand, some agencies publish a so-called reserve ratio that is computed in a different manner from that required by the statute and regulations. The Secretary considers it to be misleading for a guaranty agency to do so without also publishing its statutory reserve ratio and explaining the difference in computation. Changes: None. Section 682.410(a)(5)␣Investments Comments: A commenter requested the Secretary to issue clearer guidelines for low-risk investments or to approve individual agencies' investment policies. Discussion: The courts have confirmed that a guaranty agency's role with respect to its reserve fund and assets is ``analogous'' or ``akin'' to that of a trustee. See e.g., Education Assistance Corp. v. Cavasos, 902 F.2d 617, 627 (8th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 111 S.Ct, 246 (1990); Ohio Student Loan Commission v. Cavasos, 900 F.2d 894, 899 (6th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 111 S.Ct. 245 (1990). Thus, there is a whole body of existing fiduciary law to flesh out the Secretary's regulatory provisions for guaranty agency reserve funds and assets. To eliminate any uncertainty, however, the Department is willing to review the investment policies of agencies at their request. Changes: None. Section 682.410(a)(6)␣Development of Assets Comments: One commenter requested qualitative or quantitative guidance on the meaning of ``substantial'' with respect to situations in which asset sharing for program and non-program uses requires cost sharing. Discussion: As indicated in the NPRM (59 FR 41185), this amendment was the subject of intense debate at the negotiated rulemaking proceeding. Significant concessions were made by all negotiators to reach agreement on the amendment. As one commenter put it, ``the guaranty agency negotiators gave up litigable positions'' on this provision, among others, to make consensus possible. Therefore, the Secretary is particularly gratified that there has not been any negative comment on this amendment. With regard to the word ``substantial,'' the Secretary is using it as an antonym for the word ``nominal,'' denoting situations in which it would not be productive to attempt to quantify the extent of nonprogram use. Although even more specificity on substantiality might be desirable, the Secretary believes it is preferable to have that arise from case-by-case analysis rather than initial regulatory prescription. The Secretary is willing to give advance advice on particular situations in which there may be uncertainty. Finally, although there was no formal comment to this effect, the Secretary understands that there may be some misunderstanding of the effect of the amendment when a guaranty agency makes a correct cost allocation at the outset. The statement in the NPRM (59 FR 41186) that subsequent events would be governed by the recorded ownership interest of the asset obviously assumes that the recordation is consistent with the cost allocation. A guaranty agency may not allocate substantial costs to the reserve fund and then not give it credit for a proportionate ownership interest in the asset. Changes: None. Section 682.417␣Determination of Reserve Funds or Assets To Be Returned Section 682.417(b)␣Return of Unnecessary Reserve Funds Comments: One commenter requested that the Secretary analyze the economic impact of OBRA on guaranty agencies before requiring the return of any reserves. Another commenter urged that the Secretary consider 10-year rather than five-year projections in determining whether a guaranty agency has ``unnecessary'' reserves to be returned. Other commenters questioned the sufficiency of the 60 days provided for the agency to provide the projections. Discussion: Requiring a complete analysis of the economic impact of OBRA before allowing the use of the Secretary's new power under section 422(g)(1)(A) of the HEA would be the practical equivalent of delaying the effective date of the implementing regulation. The issue of the first Federal fiscal year in which reserves could be called back under this new rule was thoroughly discussed at the negotiated rulemaking proceeding. The Secretary's position that the rule should not be delayed beyond July 1, 1995, was ultimately accepted as part of the overall consensus. By that time actual data will be available on the impact of the profit margin reductions resulting from various changes made to the HEA by OBRA and on the first academic year of the Direct Loan Program. OBRA's future impact will be assessed through the agencies' projections for the 1995 and next four Federal fiscal years. The Secretary considers the assumptions necessary for 10-year projections, however, such as aggregate student loan volume and general rates of interest and inflation, to be too unreliable to be used as a basis for decision. This issue was specifically discussed at the negotiated rulemaking proceeding, and five years was agreed upon as the term for the projections. Finally, since the guaranty agency should already have provided the Secretary with projections under the new data collection program, 60 days should be ample time to supplement them for this purpose. Changes: None. Section 682.417(c)␣Notice Comments: One commenter suggested that a guaranty agency should be able to request additional information if the notice initiating a proceeding for the return of reserve funds or assets does not contain sufficient information for it to prosecute its appeal. Another asked that any protective order under paragraph (c)(2)(v) not be allowed to endanger its daily operations in the absence of fraud or abuse. Discussion: No specific procedure is necessary for a party to request additional information from the Secretary. If the information is in fact necessary, the notice directing the return would be defective if the information were not provided. Since any protective order would only affect reserves to the extent that they had already been determined to be ``unnecessary,'' it is hard to understand how it could endanger the agency's daily operations. In any event, the deciding official could expedite this aspect of any appeal. Changes: None. Section 682.417(d)␣Appeal Comments: One commenter expressly agreed with the appeal procedure included in the proposed rule, while another requested that the appeal be heard by a neutral third-party arbitrator. Discussion: The latter commenter misunderstands the nature of the appeal process. This is not a quasi-judicial administrative proceeding. The appeal is merely an opportunity for the guaranty agency to have the authorized Departmental official's action reviewed by a superior or peer within the Department. It would be inappropriate to place the Department's responsibility on an outside decisionmaker.
