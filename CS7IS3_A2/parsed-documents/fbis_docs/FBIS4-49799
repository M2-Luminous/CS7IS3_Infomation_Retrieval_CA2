Six Taiwan criminals were separately sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or jail terms. The case occurred in 1987. At that time Wu Wenxin, a resident of Penghu in Taiwan, collaborated with Zhang Liguo, deputy manager of a mainland export and import trading company, and other persons in planning and finding sources of firearms in Shenzhen, Beijing, Jinan, and Fuzhou. They successively smuggled a total of 1,900 firearms and 45,300 rounds of ammunitions, earning illegal profits worth $170,000. This case has attracted great attention from both sides of the Taiwan Strait. The Xiamen Municipal People's Procuratorate prosecuted these criminals in 1990.
