And this is by no means journalistic affectation on my part, but literally the opinion that the Greek visitor and his Russian counterpart A. Kozyrev voiced after their talks yesterday. The said understanding has been observed on a whole range of issues. In particular, we are demonstrating total unity of views on the problem of a Yugoslav settlement. And this unity presumably enabled the two ministers, by the Russian foreign minister's admission, to outline a number of future steps in this noble work. Andrey Kozyrev and Karolos Papoulias were both happy with the way in which economic ties are developing between Russia and Greece. Admittedly, I would like to add on behalf of the representatives of big business with whom I spoke: We are still a long way from perfection since we still prefer the wide-ranging barter of furs and citrus fruits to wide-ranging cooperation in major spheres. But it is a source of joy that "we have the political will" to achieve this perfection (I am again quoting Andrey Vladimirovich). However, we (Russia) are particularly delighted by the fact that Greece, currently president of the European Union [EU], has kept the promise that it made on taking up office and has, where possible, promoted rapprochement between our fatherland and the EU. Minister Kozyrev thanked the Greek Government for this support. After which he intrigued the journalists at the press conference by admitting that "there may be major events in this sphere" shortly. Journalists were naturally interested as to what events these might be. Since before he left for Moscow in an interview with ITAR-TASS Karolos Papoulias spoke of the possible signing of a partnership agreement between the EU and Russia -- during the EU leaders' coming meeting on the Greek island of Corfu. Nevertheless Andrey Vladimirovich did not satisfy my colleagues' interest. And instead of providing a concrete answer said that this summer children from the North of Russia will be going to Greece for a vacation "due to" Greek charity. Evidently in order to ease our disappointment he revealed a family secret: His wife, who is head of the "Concern" [Zabota] Children's Fund, is in charge of sending the children.
