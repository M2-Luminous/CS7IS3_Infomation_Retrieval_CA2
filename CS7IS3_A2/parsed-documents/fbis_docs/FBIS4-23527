The bulk of the decline stemmed from a R29.6 million reduction (to R196.5 million) in the government's allocation for operating and technology expenditure, with the balance coming mainly from additional spending in the areas of market promotion, legal proceedings and upgrading of computer network cabling. Sales were static at R110.2 million. The net value of group assets rose by 15.6 percent to R338.1 million. Armscor is a public corporation and its financial results are therefore of interest primarily to the taxpayer. It is an acquisition organisation and the financial results therefore do not reflect the scale of the activities in which it is involved. Thus, for example, the acquisition cash flow for which it was responsible in 1993-94 totalled R4.5 billion. A major portion (2.5 billion) of this cash flow went towards its aerospace portfolio, with the balance accounted for by vehicles and weapons, and electronics and maritime. Because of reducing allocations of state funds for defence, Armscor is examining various areas to enable it to retain its capabilities, among them: - Making its acquisition services available to other public organisations. - Offering its counter-trade capabilities to South African industry at large. - Becoming involved in regional co-operation on defence in African and southern Africa. - Providing acquisition support to defence forces of other African states. Chairman I.J. Moolman notes: "The proven capabilities of Armscor to determine client needs, to establish technology, to obtain military systems and equipment, both locally and abroad, and to provide life-cycle product support will be indispensable to the local security forces, as well as within the southern African region."
