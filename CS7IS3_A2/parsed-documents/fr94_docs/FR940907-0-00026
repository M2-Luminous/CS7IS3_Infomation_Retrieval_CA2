FR940907-0-00026 FR940907-0-00012 40 CFR Part 52 [GA&hyph;23&hyph;1&hyph;6346a; FRL&hyph;5066&hyph;1] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans Georgia: Approval of Revisions to the State Implementation Plan AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action approves revisions to the Georgia State Implementation Plan (SIP) adopted by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division (GA EPD) on November 17, 1993, for the purpose of implementing a program of Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS). This program is required in all ozone (O 3 ) nonattainment areas designated as serious, severe, or extreme. The submitted revisions meet the plan requirements for serious nonattainment areas of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA). The revisions were submitted by the State of Georgia through the GA EPD for the Atlanta O 3 nonattainment area. DATES: This final rule will be effective November 7, 1994 unless adverse or critical comments are received by October 7, 1994. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Written comments on this action should be addressed to Scott Southwick, at the EPA Regional Office listed. Copies of the documents relative to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the following locations. The interested persons wanting to examine these documents should make an appointment with the appropriate office at least 24 hours before the visiting day.

Reference file GA&hyph;23&hyph;1&hyph;6346. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The CAA provides for classification of O 3 nonattainment areas according to the severity of their O 3 problem. On January 6, 1991, the thirteen (13) county Atlanta area was classified as a serious O 3 nonattainment area and required to meet all of the nonattainment requirements of the CAA for serious areas. Pursuant to the CAA, Georgia is required to adopt specific air quality control rules and incorporate them into the Georgia SIP. The air quality planning and SIP requirements for O 3 nonattainment and transport areas are set out in subparts I and II of part D of title I of the CAA. Section 182 of the CAA sets out a graduated control program for O 3 nonattainment areas. Section 182(c)(1) requires areas serious and above to adopt and implement an enhanced monitoring program. The program must require enhanced monitoring of ambient concentrations of O 3 , oxides of nitrogen (NO x ) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Each SIP for a serious nonattainment area shall contain measures to improve the ambient monitoring of such air pollutants. On November 8, 1993, the State of Georgia submitted the Georgia SIP for PAMS and the Atlanta PAMS Network Description. The SIP submittal meets the criteria required by 40 CFR 58.20 as amended February 12, 1993. In order to obtain more comprehensive and representative data on O 3 air pollution, the Georgia SIP revision requires enhanced monitoring for O 3 , NO x , monitoring for speciated non-methane VOC's, carbonyl sampling, and meteorological measurements (wind direction, wind speed, relative humidity, temperature, barometric pressure, and solar radiation and upper air soundings). The monitoring is to be accomplished through the establishment of a standard, isolated network of five (5) PAMS. Final Action EPA is approving the revision to the Georgia SIP requiring enhanced monitoring. This action is being taken without prior proposal because the EPA views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this Federal Register publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action will be effective November 7, 1994 unless, by October 7, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received. If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective November 7, 1994. The EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the SIP for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms with those requirements irrespective of the fact that the submittal preceded the date of enactment. Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 7, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (See section 307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2)). This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for a revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP Actions SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
