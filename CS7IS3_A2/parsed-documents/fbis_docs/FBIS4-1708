On behalf of the provincial people's government, Secretary Liu Fangren expressed appreciation and thanks to the broad masses of cadres and people in Liupanshui City. While inspecting Liupanshui City, Liu pointed out: At the moment, we should make continued efforts to emancipate the mind and brace ourselves. Only by furthering ideological emancipation will it be possible to deepen reform. Ideological emancipation is the precursor of economic development. Without ideological emancipation, it would be impossible to quicken the pace of reform, opening up, and economic development and seize opportunities. We should make both vertical and horizontal comparisons to find shortcomings, update concepts, and speed up economic growth. Secretary Li Fangren stressed: Now that the CPC Central Committee and the Guizhou Provincial CPC Committee have formulated a clear-cut train of thought and a series of feasible measures, we should waste no time in carrying out this train of thought as well as the relevant measures and work in a creative manner. Secretary Liu Fangren also called on cadres at all levels across the province to transform work style in a down-to-earth manner, go to the grassroots level to carry out investigation and study, adhere to the principle of firmly grasping two key aspects of work simultaneously, and make a success of all types of work.
