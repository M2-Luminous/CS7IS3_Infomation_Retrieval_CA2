FR940426-1-00095 FR940426-1-00008 The Administrator made this statement based on EPA's belief that the ZEV sales mandate does not, given the existence of the NMOG standard, create any additional requirements that will have any effect on NMOG emissions from light-duty vehicles in California. The ZEV sales mandate does not require that the overall NMOG emissions from California vehicles be any lower than they would have been in the absence of the sales mandate. The amount of emissions produced by such vehicles is controlled by the NMOG fleet average requirement, not the sales mandate. The ZEV mandate merely restricts the manufacturers' choices with regard to the type of vehicle they must produce to meet the NMOG requirement. Therefore, as the ZEV sales mandate does not limit the quantity, rate or concentration of NMOG emissions, EPA stated that the mandate was not an emission standard, but instead was an accompanying enforcement procedure. In its recommendation, the OTC States that the ZEV sales mandate is an accompanying enforcement procedure and is not required by section 177. EPA requests comment on whether the ZEV sales mandate should be considered an emission standards. EPA is also requesting comments regarding whether the ZEV sales mandate will have or is likely to have a clear effect on emissions of NOx and CO, whether such effect is substantial, and whether such a potential effect is relevant to the question of whether the sales mandate is an emission standard. The second question presented by this issue is whether States are required under section 177's identicality provision to promulgate all of California's motor vehicle emission standards for a given model year, or whether only a certain subset of these regulations must be promulgated. Section 177 provides that a State ``may adopt and enforce *␣*␣* standards *␣*␣* if such standards are identical to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted.'' The statute does not necessarily indicate that if a State adopts one California standard for a year it must adopt all of them. EPA believes that adoption of the California LEV program does not require adoption of the California heavy-duty engine program, which deals with different types of vehicles. However, EPA has not finally determined whether section 177 requires a State to promulgate all California emission standards related to a type of vehicle once a State has determined that it intends to promulgate any California standards related to that type of vehicle. Certainly, where a State intends to incorporate some portion of California's emission standards, the State must promulgate all regulations that are necessary to ensure that California cars are not prohibited from sale in the State and all regulations necessary to prevent the requirement of a third car. Must a State promulgate all California vehicle-based emission standards relevant to a particular type of vehicle? May a State promulgate only those provisions necessary to ensure that the State program receives the emission reductions California receives from its program, or only those provisions that are central parts of the program? May a State promulgate merely those regulations that ensure that its program is as protective of the public health and welfare, in the aggregate, as the federal program? Under this approach, a State would have considerable flexibility to determine which parts of a particular program the State would promulgate, but the State would not be assured of receiving the same SIP credits as California for such a program. In addition, this approach may be inconsistent with section 177's goal of preventing myriad different motor vehicle programs in the several States and also may be inconsistent with the statutory language and the legislative history of section 177. EPA requests comment on this issue. The identicality issue is also implicated by the form of the OTC's initial recommendation to EPA. The OTC recommendation states that it intends the OTC-LEV program to be consistent with section 177 and 184 of the Act. The recommendation also states that the program contains standards identical to the California LEV program. However, rather than directly incorporating California's regulations into its recommendation, or citing to California's regulations, OTC gave a brief overview of the parts of California's LEV program it intended to incorporate and the time frame for the regulations. EPA initially had questions regarding whether the OTC intended to incorporate certain secondary provisions in California's LEV program into the OTC-LEV program (in particular, the hybrid electric vehicle provisions, banking and trading of NMOG credits, the small and intermediate volume manufacturer provisions and reactivity adjustment factors). EPA also had questions regarding whether California's NMOG fleet average requirements were intended to apply to heavier light-duty trucks (3751&hyph;5750 lbs) and whether the OTC intended medium-duty vehicles to be included in the LEV program. EPA requested that the OTC clarify these issues, becuase failure to incorporate certain secondary provisions into the OTC program could conceivably have raised identicality problems. On April 15, 1994 Bruce Carhart of the OTC sent a letter to EPA stating, in part, the following:
