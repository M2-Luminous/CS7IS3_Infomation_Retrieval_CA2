Reporting from Maglaj, Hajrudin Fermic says that "the chetniks are once again showing their criminal face and as well as an intention to kill as many civilians as possible and ruin the city. To do so, they are indiscriminately using all means, shells of all calibers, snipers, antiaircraft weapons. Yesterday afternoon, a new massacre was carried out in Maglaj: One person was killed and 13 civilians seriously wounded from a tank shell fired on the very center of the city from (Procijep). Many of those people will remain permanently disabled. Unfortunately, before this, four people were also killed yesterday by snipers and howitzer shells and mortar bombs. If we recall that the chetniks have again sent back a convoy carrying food, the picture of the Maglaj inferno, of the sufferings and agony of the population will be complete." Hamiz Deronjic reports from Brcko that "last night on the Brcko battlefield did not pass without aggressor's attacks. The enemy used 82-mm mortars to pound Vranovaca, Cupici, (Kladanj), and [name indistinct], while infantry battles were waged in [words indistinct] of the Brcko battlefield." Further on, Deronjic says that "the aggressor's regrouping on the Brcko battlefield is more and more (?intensive). During last night, movements of enemy military trucks were noticed along the Donja Mrka-Lipovac-Donji (Radjici) line. Movements of chetnik armored vehicles have been observed on the central section of the Brcko battlefield, as well as along the Potocari-[name indistinct] line." A correspondent reading a report by the 3d Corps (?Press Center) reports that "the chetnik offensive on the Zavidovici battlefield is going on" and that, as for other regions covered by the 3d Corps, "chetnik artillery is shelling (?Bugojno, (Dubac), and the free villages of the Donji Vakuf and Gornji Vakuf regions. Zenica and Travnik were shelled with a shower of projectiles. The truce signed between the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian Defense Council (HVO) is being respected in general. However, there are still provocations, particularly by sniper fire." Izudin Durakovic reports from Gracanica that "last night on this section of the battlefield passed in occasional provocations with antiaircraft machine-guns and antiaircraft guns on the defense positions and with Bofors guns on populated places. The defense lines are still stable and unchanged." Mirza Sadikovic reports that "in the last 24 hours, the Serb aggressor's attacks on Bihac gained in intensity. Artillery and infantry assaults on the defense lines on both Bihac section of the battlefield and the Grmusko-Srbljanski Heights are particularly frequent." "Several howitzer shells were fired from (Goriok) at Bihac (?and its) outskirts and [name indistinct] region, as well as the Bihac-[name indistinct] road and villages on the right bank of the Una River are under constant artillery fire."
