The former governor resigned his position to run in the 3 October general elections. The Bahia legislative assembly had approved a law allowing the election of a successor to finish the gubernatorial mandate. A group of parties resorted to the STF, stating that the law was unconstitutional because gubernatorial elections must be handled by Congress. They also alleged that voting for the successor could not be open as established in Bahia State law. By a seven-four vote, the STF justices ruled the state law was based on the Constitution and that Gov. Antonio Carlos Magalhaes' successor must be elected in 30 days. Vice Governor Paulo Souto also resigned his position to run in the October elections.
