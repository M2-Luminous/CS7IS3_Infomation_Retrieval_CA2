ACTION: Notice of Temporary Restraining Order Enjoining Implementation and Effectiveness of Interim Regulations. SUMMARY: This document gives notice that a temporary restraining order was issued by the United States Court of International Trade on July 25, 1994, enjoining Customs from implementing and making effective the interim regulations regarding express consignments, formal and informal entries of merchandise and administrative exemptions that were published in the Federal Register on June 13, 1994. The interim regulations were to become effective on July 28, 1994. Unless extended by the court, the temporary restraining order expires on August 10, 1994. A hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for August 9, 1994. DATES: As of July 25, 1994, the effective date of the interim regulations published at 59 FR 30289 is delayed by the temporary restraining order. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard McManus, Office of the Chief Counsel (202) 927&hyph;6900. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 13, 1994, a document was published by U.S. Customs in the Federal Register (59 FR 30289) as T.D. 94&hyph;51 setting forth interim regulations implementing certain statutory amendments to the Customs laws contained in the Customs modernization provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act and clarifying certain procedures for shipments brought into the U.S. by express consignment operators or carriers. The document provided for a 45-day delayed effective date, with a 30-day comment period preceding that effective date. The effective date was to become July 28, 1994, and comments were requested by July 13, 1994. On July 25, 1994, the National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association of America, Inc. filed a motion for a temporary restraining order with the United States Court Of International Trade (Court No: 94&hyph;07&hyph;00423). Pursuant to the motion, the temporary restraining order was issued by the court; consequently, Customs is restrained and enjoined from implementing and making effective the interim regulations. Pending the outcome of the hearing on motion for a preliminary injunction, unless otherwise extended by the court, Customs is enjoined until August 10, 1994, from making T.D. 94&hyph;51 effective. Consequently, the interim regulations will not become effective prior to August 10, 1994. A hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for August 9, 1994. When appropriate, Customs will provide further notice, to be published in the Federal Register , concerning the effective date of the interim regulations. Dated: July 26, 1994. Harold M. Singer, Chief, Regulations Branch. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18586 Filed 7&hyph;27&hyph;94; 10:35 am] BILLING CODE 4820&hyph;02&hyph;P
