Among those appearing at the conference were Anatoliy Sereda, leader of "Working Kharkiv," Anatoliy Perepylytsya, head of the "Union of Communists," and Alla Alyeksandrovska, second secretary of the oblast committee of the CPU. The results of the first round of voting were described as a victory for the CPU, and they stated that they expected to win the elections. Responding to a question regarding what he would do in parliament if elected, A. Sereda said that he would "be in charge of repressions and work in the Cheka." He did not specify against whom these repressions would be carried out, but a shout rang out from the audience: "The first people we will put up against the wall will be Khmara and Chornovil, then ravchuk and Plyushch, and all speculators, businessmen, and you correspondents." Following this shouted remark, most journalists left the press conference. Ivan Latin, docent of the agricultural institute and a candidate for the office of deputy to the Supreme Council of Ukraine, answering a question from one of the few remaining journalists regarding whether repressions against businessmen would not result in increasing the number of beggars in Ukraine, replied: "The more beggars there are in Ukraine, the more communism and socialism there will be."
