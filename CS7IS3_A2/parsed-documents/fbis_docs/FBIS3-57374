[Text]The Central Electoral Committee appointed the second round of Crimean presidential elections for 30 January. The leader of the Crimean Republican Party, Yuriy Meshkov, and the chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council, Nikolay Bagrov, will compete for the post. The difference in the number of votes they received in the first round of elections was quite significant. That is why the present speaker's chances of victory are assessed as illusory. Besides, those candidates who had quit the struggle called upon the voters to cast their votes for separatist Meshkov. How does Nikolay Bagrov himself see the situation? Our correspondent phoned him and asked him to answer a few questions. [Bagrov] I will take part in the second round -- this is not so little. All of my opponents campaigned against Bagrov and accused me of all the shortcomings of Ukraine's economic policy and of all the difficulties. Of course, it is a serious struggle. However, I am an optimist, and I think that I have a real chance of winning. For this, it is necessary to struggle. People have already started thinking.... [DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA] Yet, Nikolay Vasilyevich, you probably counted upon greater support in the first round. [Bagrov] I was honest with the people. Meshkov promised them that Russia would take them into her open arms. He said everywhere that once people vote for him, they will receive prosperity and peace. The Crimea will become Russian. I am not promising people a rose garden, because one will have to meet the bills after the elections. I am openly saying at all meetings that the secession of the Crimea from Ukraine is out of the question. Meshkov's policy leads to an impasse. Let us look at things realistically. There exist the Helsinki Agreements on the inviolability of borders that emerged after World War II. There exists an agreement between Ukraine and Russia where the inviolability of the borders of the two countries is recognized. Finally, a tripartite agreement was signed in Moscow between the United States, Ukraine, and Russia on the elimination of nuclear weapons; these aspects are also reflected there. Ukraine received guarantees of European countries in addition to those of the United States. It is naive to assume that Russia will want to violate these agreements. I believe that we have not yet fully implemented, in the interests of the Crimean people, the possibilities of the autonomy offered to us by Ukraine's legislation in both economic and political spheres. [DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA] The election campaign in the Crimea has been accompanied by a series of murders. The assassination of your adviser Iskander Mamedov near his family's house is simply appalling. What can you say about this? [Bagrov] Iskander organized my election campaign. He was a very good and decent person. I deeply mourn his death and sympathize with his relatives and friends. A criminal case has been initiated, and competent organs must answer who needed this. I will say one thing: I want to live in the Crimea and do everything in order that harmony and peace prevail on the peninsula and that it becomes a bridge connecting Ukraine and Russia, and not a new Karabakh.
