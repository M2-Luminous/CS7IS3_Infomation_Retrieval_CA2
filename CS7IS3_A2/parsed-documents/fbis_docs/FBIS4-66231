Or a Crisis Ridden Future?--An Analysis of China's Present Condition and Future Prospects." A note at the end of the article reads: "The article originally appeared under the title `China's Direction,' but is here given in a shortened form due to the constraints of space."] [Text] Editor's Note: Hu Jiwei, a former president of the RENMIN RIBAO Publishing House, had accepted the invitation for a three-month lecture tour in the United States, during which he gave speeches or held symposia in some ten universities and academic societies, mainly analyzing the present condition of, and future prospects for China. Before every lecture, Hu would write out a draft of his speech, but he did not read from the draft; rather, he expressed some of his views freely as the occasion demanded. He has attracted great interest among students of the Chinese scene. The present article points out that the direction of China's development justifies optimism, but that there are also serious problems. Hu also points out that only with "peaceful gradual advance [heping jianjin]" can China's prosperous development be ensured. [end editor's note] The world's attention is fixed on China's internal situation. In my opinion, generally speaking, that situation is good; I am optimistic as to the direction China is going. Small Turbulences Cannot Be Avoided China's situation is good, especially its economic situation. However, some observers only look at the speed of its economic growth and speak of it as very good. They say, for instance, that China is already third among the large economic powers. This, in my opinion, does not conform to reality. Internally, China still has problems of considerable seriousness, but then there are also observers who will only see the bad side and make it out to be too bad. They even talk of China being beset with crises, and think outbreaks may be triggered at any moment, much as if China will soon be one total chaos. That too does not conform to reality. What one may say, I think, is that the situation is very good, and that the developmental trend justifies optimism, but that there are also some serious problems. In the following I will give my reasons and my analysis: First, in a broader perspective, to speak of the larger basic reason, there is the basic turn for the better in the new international situation, which also determines the developmental prospects for China. The disintegration of the socialist camp and the fundamental elimination of confrontation between the two armed camps; the situation of having two ideological blocs facing each other, backed by armed forces, is becoming more and more relaxed. Times are gone when great powers staked their fate on their military power. A new era has begun where the world situation will be one of peaceful development. This has a decisive influence on China's future, as China too will then also, inevitably, develop into a peaceful, democratic, and modern state. In this international situation, great changes will also, inevitably, be engendered internally within the country. The era of wars, when armed forces were relied upon to fight off foreign aggression and to ensure the state's independence, has essentially come to a close. The era of armed forces being relied upon to consolidate the internal political system and to protect economic construction should long ago also have come to a close. The idea of a proletarian dictatorship--having the guns means having everything--has already become outdated. The times of violent revolution and violent rule have passed, never to return. This peaceful, democratic development cannot be reversed anymore and cannot be stopped. Anything that stands in the way of this great principle, any high-handed reactionary policy, will have no chance of success, and will be compelled to undergo change. Whatever countercurrent or whatever obstruction appear, all will ultimately end up in defeat. Some people believe that large-scale armed turmoil and armed suppression may erupt in China, warlords will get tangled in warfare in some kind of feudal separatist regime, nationalities will split off, or ethnic fighting will break out.; however, all these assumptions are overpessimistic. I believe it may not be possible to avoid small disturbances, but still the possibility of large-scale turmoil is very, very small. In sum, viewing the overall situation, all those autocratic powers and autocratic measures are headed for extinction, and they are not headed for any growth in strength. Two Reasons for an Optimistic Attitude There are two important reasons for my optimistic attitude as to the situation in China. One reason: Those democratic forces that actively advocate learning advanced science and technology and economic management from the capitalist countries, that advocate importing foreign capital and technologies, and that formerly had been thought of as the most dangerous forces of bourgeois liberalization, are now right among, and of the masses, and they are now the ones that are more and more considered "advanced personalities," in that they firmly advocate reform and opening up to the outside world. If one were, under these circumstances, to advocate and actually try in present-day China to strengthen total dictatorship of the proletariat, if one were to think of inciting to "class struggle as the key link," even extreme leftist forces who oppose that sort of "bourgeois peaceful evolution" would become highly unpopular. Peace is bound to replace violence, democracy is bound to replace dictatorship, that is the developmental trend of the world, and even more so the developmental trend in China, and any move against this current will just get nowhere. The second important reason is that the reform of China's economic structure is proving increasingly successful, and that the reform of China's economic structure has actually induced a reform in China's political structure, which in fact has already gained some gratifying achievements in quite a few respects. Judging by the actual situation in China, it is not by a sudden change, but by a gradual change that economic reform is inducing political reform. It is a process of moving from quantitative changes to a change in substance, it is a gradual change of which the effects will only become apparent after the lapse of a considerable period of time. Some people see some of the obnoxious phenomena and conclude that things will take a sudden turn and then develop rapidly into a gigantic chaos. I don't agree. Some people see all the good phenomena and conclude that the situation will become all rosy, will assume a completely new look. That too is an unrealistic fantasy. However, judging by the trend of overall developments, the reform of the political structure in China will take a step forward. That is the general trend which no man's will can deflect. The Chinese authorities have decided on the extremely important policy decision of "grasp with two hands, two hands?" It is to mean grasp material civilization with one hand and spiritual civilization with the other hand. This is of course correct and very good, but in its actual implementation this move was usurped by ultraleftist forces, who made it out to be something like "oppose bourgeois liberalization" and "oppose the bourgeois peaceful evolution." In the ideological field, they launched a political movement to condemn and attack those who hold different views, and what they promoted was still nothing else but an ideological dictatorship and cultural dictatorship. In actual fact they did not dare, and even opposed, instituting a reform of the political structure. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, some authoritative persons erroneously summed up the Soviet experience by blaming two reasons for the disintegration of the Soviet Union: One being the failure to institute economic reforms, their economy having been in a depressed state for a long time; and the other, having first started a political reform, when people were allowed to think and speak out, thereby confounding the political situation. The said "authoritative persons" then decided to go the opposite way: If the Soviets failed to start economic reforms, they would precisely start economic reforms; that was right. If the Soviets started political reform, they would precisely not start political reforms, but that was wrong. This is in reality creating the lopsided situation of economic reform without political reform. Some of these "authoritative persons" would even concoct the theory that economic reform without political reform is the only way that will suit the national condition of China, and they would arrive at the important policy decision that they would thereby be creating socialism with Chinese characteristics. In actual fact, this is totally wrong. Economic Reform Without Political Reform Is a Monstrosity According to the actual situation during the ten years that followed our smashing the Gang of Four, economic reform has in fact frequently been conducted accompanied by political reform, and any mechanical separation of the two is impossible. First, did we not smash the autocratic regime of the Cultural Revolution time with its feudal, fascist dictatorship, which was then followed by the discussion of truthful objectives and the achievement of a liberation of the mind, and did we not smash the political rule of the personality cult with its "two absolutes" [observance of Mao's decision and obedience to his directive]. All these are extremely important reforms of the political structure. Without these reforms of the political structure, the great reform in the structure of China's rural economy could not have been realized. Rural reform started with the institution of the system of fixing farm output quotas for each household. This system, outwardly, appears as a reform of the agricultural production of the peasants, but in actual fact it was a reform of the rural economic structure. Through a protracted, tireless struggle of four, five years, it was finally possible to abolish the people's commune system with its integration of government administration and commune management, and its worker-peasant-merchant-student-soldier unison. It was then only that the 800 million peasants truly became masters of their land, and that the 800 million peasants gained initial democratic power. Democracy for 800 million peasants is an extremely valuable contribution for the eventual establishment of a democratic regime in China. The great significance of this fact is not understood by many people and is ignored by many who advocate democracy for China. The reason for economic reform to have as consequence so huge an effect on political reform is that at the same time as the economic reform was implemented a political struggle was waged simultaneously, a struggle which breached certain conventional political barriers. This was the only way that so great a victory could have been achieved. For instance, when persisting on implementing the system of fixed farm quotas for households, it was necessary to offend against and violate the directives and provisions on establishing the people's commune system, as previously ordered by Mao Zedong and the CPC Central Committee. It was furthermore necessary to offend against and violate relevant provisions of the CPC Central Committee, such as earlier documents that prescribed that "fixed farm output quotas" would be permissible for "work teams," but not for "households." Later documents changed this and allowed the system to be applied to households, but only in the "three hardship regions" (such poverty and hardship regions as the national minority districts, remote mountainous districts on the country's borders, and regions that had suffered calamities which had reduced farm output). The system was not permitted for the other vast rural areas. Later this was again changed, allowing application in the villages, but not on state farms. However, all these provisions were ultimately violated, and we must therefore not mechanically separate reform of the economic structure from the reform of the political structure. We must not conduct economic reform isolated from simultaneous political reform. This is a Chinese characteristic that has become manifest in the actual life of China, and that is something that man's will cannot alter. The positive significance of 800 million peasants gaining this much initial democratic freedom is something that is difficult to comprehend. For instance, peasants in some advanced districts with flourishing agricultural production have begun to disbelieve and to break away from the old set pattern of "take grain as the key link and regard agriculture as the foundation," and are experimenting with village and township enterprises. They are developing small enterprises into large enterprises, and income from industrial and sideline undertakings gradually overtake income from agriculture. They, furthermore, use income from industrial and sideline undertakings to help modernize agriculture, for extensive improvements in agricultural products, and also to achieve high and stable yields over long periods of time. The extensive development of village and township enterprises in the rural areas has not only increased peasant incomes and improved the rural economy, but also opened the way for agricultural modernization, urbanization of the rural areas, solving the problem of surplus manpower--in excess of 100 million--in the rural areas, and to narrow the disparity between city and countryside. All these enormous and amazing changes nobody would have ever expected. In August, year before last, I toured the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou triangle, and I was extremely pleased and surprised by conditions there. In that area, many village and township enterprises were of a larger scale than state enterprises, their machinery and equipment was more advanced than in the state enterprises, their management was more rational than in the state enterprises, their productivity was higher than in the state enterprises, and they turned in more taxes and profits than state enterprises. There are now many, many villages whose output value exceeds the 100 million yuan mark. In short, the reform of the rural economic structure has abolished the people's commune system, and 800 million peasants have gained initial democracy. This is an amazing change in China. It is an enormous victory achieved by the high pressures of a top-to-bottom directed assault against the "Leftist" political forces. After victory in the economic structural reform in the rural areas, the next reform target was the system of the highly centralized planned economy. Abolishing the people's commune system took four years, while abolishing the planned economy system has taken ten years. There was first the need to overcome the unitary economic component of the public ownership system: First, to revive the private economy that had been extinct for over 30 years; second, to convert what nominally had been a collective ownership system, but actually a system of ownership by the whole people, truly into a collective economy of large, medium and small types, especially to restore the various service trades, such as commerce, and transportation, that are so closely linked with the life of the people. After privately managed or collectively managed enterprises had developed, a new force broke in on the scene: foreign-invested enterprises, that is, Sino-foreign joint ventures, Sino-foreign contractual joint ventures, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises, and this development opened up a wide breach in the centralized system of the planned economy structure. "Foreign-Invested Enterprises" Opened Breach in Planned Economy Development of foreign-invested enterprises took off only after the establishment of the special economic zones [SEZs]. Establishment of the Shenzhen SEZ was a final resolution in 1980. The plan at that time was to establish a special zone on the country's border, emulate the Hong Kong model, attract foreign capital, and to open a window that would allow to study foreign experiences on mainland territory, and thus set up a small experimental station for the practice of market economy. However, unexpectedly it developed into a miracle, and results were excellent. Finally SEZs were also established at Zhuhai, Shantou, and Xiamen, and later the whole of Hainan Island was designated one large special zone. Later, economic development zones were set up along the coast, foreign capital kept flowing in, and the foreign-invested enterprises kept increasing. China's economy became increasingly invigorated. The SEZs mainly adhered to the law of market economy, and they thereby dealt the planned economy structure a serious blow. In the SEZs many conventional provisions of the planned economy system were quite naturally tossed aside. That the planned economy system was changed into a market economy system was not only a great reform in economic respects, but also in political respects. In the past it had been the government (actually the party) that had decided everything, directed everything, controlled everything, concerned itself with everything. People's work, employment, school attendance, salary and wages, welfare, food, clothing, housing, marriage, childbirth, moving home, and business trips; everything was strictly controlled. After abandoning the highly-centralized planned economy structure, people became gradually liberated from all these controls and restraints. As the people gained an enhanced feeling of being masters of their own affairs, democratic awareness increased. This is a point that is very often ignored. Again from the economic angle, this is also a great reform, because in this way, great changes will also come about in the relations between the central and the local authorities and in the relations between the government and the enterprises. The former rigid system of having people, finance, materials, production, supply, and marketing highly centralized and unified had inevitably to undergo fundamental changes. At long last a way had been found to revitalize the large and medium-sized state enterprises and to break down the rigidity of the former state of affairs, and it is now a matter of implementing and making it become reality. The large and medium-sized enterprises will finally be revitalized, that is quite certain, and the prospects also justify optimism. Power Monopoly Leads to Various Malpractices However, we must also realize that China's problems are problems that have come down to us after having accumulated over an extended period of the country's history. They are not problems that have accumulated only during the 40-odd years of total proletarian dictatorship, still these problems are indeed extremely complex and extremely serious. If one were only to look at this serious state of affairs without considering its historical development, especially without fully assessing the achievements gained by the Chinese people in their persistent and dauntless upward struggle, and the particular developmental direction determined by the strength of this people, one could then easily regard the problems as excessively serious and come to negative and pessimistic conclusions. Talking now about the serious circumstances that presently exist in China: The highly centralized system of planned economy of the past few decades had resulted in an autocratic political system with a highly centralized power monopoly. Following the collapse of the planned economy system, this autocratic system with its power monopoly, although also badly shaken, was still able to maintain its position with extreme tenacity. The strongest power had also been the strongest corrosive agent. Under this system of a highly centralized power monopoly, larger or smaller power-holders and larger and smaller organs of power, are misusing their powers to engage in malpractices for selfish ends to an extent that is hard to imagine. For instance, most startling way of getting rich without own capital is to rely on the domain of one's superior official, appropriate property to oneself, and to engage in real estate trading. For instance, an organization with certain power will suddenly change its identity and become some kind of corporation, a general company, while still, as before, keep rigidly controlling the state-run enterprise, and as before enjoying the high profits of the enterprise. They will then still control important materials, such as steel, or significant products, such as arms and ammunition, and one transaction in such materials will yield profits into the millions. There is also misuse of special powers to effect power-backed investments and take out power-backed loans ("friendship" loans). These cases are frequent and show no decline, rather a tendency to increase, and are important reasons for excessive investments and currency inflation. Under the protection of larger and smaller powerholders, there is much tax fraud and tax evasion, much lavish feasting, travelling at public expense, and increases in collective expenditure. Repeated countermeasures, but repeated offenses, attempts at control but never an effective stop. Utilizing the manufacture by larger or smaller powerholders and under their protection, false and inferior products are flooding the market. In the case of some consumer goods that are daily necessities, 70 to 80 percent are false or inferior products, inflicting great harm on the people. There is also the extremely serious problem of such crimes as robbery, train banditry, illegal usurpation of highways, drug trafficking, smuggling, trade in human beings, crimes which continue to be rampant, and which are committed by criminal gangs in collusion with powerholders. As to crimes committed by higher ups and emulated by the lower ranks, such as graft and bribery, malpractices for selfish ends, extortion and blackmail, and even paying bribes to obtain official posts, such crimes too are prevalent throughout society. They add to the ever growing burden on the people, and their burden on the peasants is particularly serious. Yet another extremely frightening phenomenon is the really alarming decadence of the press. The Chinese press is the area most strictly controlled by those leftist princelings and leftist big chiefs. While they loudly proclaim such slogans as "oppose bourgeois liberalization" and "oppose peaceful evolution," moral degeneration is spreading among them in a bad way. In the very own party paper of the Central Committee, the RENMIN RIBAO, the situation is also extremely serious. There are many jingles about this on the mainland, a recent specimen goes like this: First reporter sells "secret information". Second reporter gambles in shares. Third reporter sells whole page layouts. Fourth reporter canvasses advertisements. Fifth reporter fishes for envelopes containing gratuities. Sixth reporter is moonlighting by writing for other places than his own paper. It is impossible to list all the serious problems one by one. The details of many alarming incidents are first "exported" and then become "marketed" domestically; the outside gets to know them faster and to know more of them than the inside. The chief root of the affliction in this serious state of affairs is the autocratic system with its highly centralized power monopoly. The problem cannot be remedied by treating single symptoms piecemeal and not the whole disease. In economic respects, going the old road of pressuring, adjusting, and rectifying will not do anymore, and in political respects, issuing of directives, launching formalistic investigative movements will also not do anymore. What is necessary is to conduct a resolute reform of the political structure concurrently with the reform of the economic structure; what has to be done is to firmly resolve to fundamentally reform this autocratic system. Government System Requires Fundamental Reform The broad masses of the people have reached the limits of their endurance. Reference to last year's openly visible disturbance in Shenzhen about the sale of shares, the anti-tyranny struggle of the Renshou peasants, and the huge fraud case involving the Changcheng Corporation, can well explain the seriousness of the situation. It will also explain that the people have reached a stage when they will be forced to wage struggle, it will also explain that some relatively good results have already been achieved, and will also explain that the upward struggle of the masses is expanding in breadth and in depth. Of course, it is hoped that the urgent upward struggle will be coordinated and receive support, from top toward the bottom, by the CPC and the government. It is hoped that with coordinated action from the top toward the bottom a fundamental reform of the political structure will indeed be accomplished. People who advocate economic reform alone and oppose political reform say that they are emulating Singapore, and that they highly esteem the example set by Singapore. However, they do not understand that the reason why Singapore has been doing so well is that the Singapore Government does not directly control economic affairs. Besides, the Singapore Government is an absolutely honest government, also a government that operates with a proficient yet suitably limited personnel, a government of the rule of law, a government performing at high efficiency, and a government that has the welfare of its people at heart. If we are to truly emulate Singapore, then we should as quickly as possible get on with the reform of the political system. We should then, first of all, start with the reform of the government system. The government that we must subject to change is one that is highly centralized, that determines everything, directs everything, controls everything, concerns itself with everything, a government with an unwieldy organization, with bloated agencies, with overstaffed offices, affected by routinism and bureaucratism. This government has to be changed into one that is honest, that employs proficient yet suitably limited personnel, that is operating according to the rule of law, that is efficient and welfare-conscious. This is the reform of the government system that is presently absolutely needed with regard to every one of the above-mentioned characteristics; it is a reform that also cannot be delayed any longer. Think, if a reform of this sort could be implemented, and if it were possible to gradually establish a government like Singapore's, there would indeed be every hope that the many serious problems that we are presently having could all be resolved. China's affairs are extremely complex, all good ideals and good aspirations must be gradually realized on the basis of the actual conditions. Otherwise, haste will not get you to your goal and good intentions will not get good results, as so often happened. It is my opinion that with realistic and sustained effort, China's prospects are definitely bright. "Peaceful Gradual Advance" Will Benefit China's Development Summing up all that was said, we may gain valuable experiences and lessons, namely: 1) Economic reform must be conducted simultaneously with political reform; 2) Whatever the obstructing forces, the Chinese people have always found ways and means to wage their struggle, a struggle from the bottom upward; 3) China's reform must always be a continuous effort to smash the conventions of the "Leftist" forces; 4) The struggle is a protracted one. Only by pursuing it realistically, persistently, and untiringly, will there come a time when the enormous change will have been achieved, namely the change from quantitative changes to the change in substance. Xu Jiatun put forward the idea of "peaceful evolution," my idea is "peaceful gradual advance." The great difference is that Xu speaks of socialism and capitalism progressing together in a "peaceful evolution," to gradually heading for a world of universal harmony. My idea of "peaceful gradual advance" speaks only of the future political situation within China, and asserts that peaceful methods should be used in a gradual advance. I emphasize "peaceful" because innumerable historical events have proven that violence and democracy are as incompatible as fire and water. If violence is used to topple a violent regime, the new regime is bound to use violence to maintain its rule, and however democratic its pronouncements, in reality it cannot possibly be a democratic regime. It would only be replacing one violent regime with another violent regime. I emphasize "peaceful," because in so large a country as China the political situation is extremely complex, and the influence of autocracy lingers on, as a left-over from several thousand years of history. It is therefore impossible to effect a "great leap forward" and to "advance at the double," also impossible to "overtake England and the United States" within a short period of time, or to cross all of a sudden over a "golden bridge" right into "paradise." Only by realistic and persistent effort will it be possible to achieve an emphatically peaceful, stable, protracted, and gradual advance. At the same time I very much disagree with those who advocate "strike down the communist party, overthrow the Chinese Government." That way is fraught with great danger, a way one should not take. I believe that by the methods of "striking down" and "overthrowing" it is not possible to achieve a truly democratic society, it could only replace violence by violence. For this reason I emphasize: I am not a man of democracy in general, but of peaceful democracy. I propose to urge the communist party to effect self-reform, urge the communist party to effect a democratic reform within the party. In the China of today, it is impossible to have a reform of the Chinese society without a reform of the CPC, and without internal democracy within the CPC, it is impossible to have democracy in Chinese society and democracy in the state. In my opinion only by adopting the method of "peaceful gradual advance" will it be possible to achieve a prosperous and thriving China. I believe there are indeed powerful reform forces and democratic forces generally extent within the CPC, forces that would exert a top-to-bottom effort. Although the Chinese people have lost much confidence in the CPC, they have not given up all hope. They are still very hopeful, and they still hope that their untiring upward struggle will be met with a coordinated downward effort by the party and the government, so that even greater achievements will be unceasingly accomplished in China's reform. This is how I assess the direction of China's development, and these are also the reasons for my optimistic attitude.
