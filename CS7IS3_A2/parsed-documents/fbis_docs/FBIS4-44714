The underwater craft will travel to its Ile-Longue operational base in Brest in early May. Ten years after initial drawings, Le Triomphant--which will be followed by three other missile-launching nuclear submarines of the same type--will prepare to set sail for its sea tests from Brest. The ship will be declared "ready for active service" in the summer of 1996. Now under the command of ship captain Francois Dupont, Le Triomphant was put on slipway at the Cherbourg naval shipyard directorate in June of 1989. But the first studies for the submarine began over 10 years ago, and it has been 8 years since the first piece of sheet metal was welded in place. The goal with Le Triomphant was to build as quiet a submarine as possible, able to fire more sophisticated nuclear missiles than those carried aboard such first-generation ships as Le Redoutable and its enhanced version L'Inflexible. Hence Le Triomphant's undersea tonnage of 14,355, against 8,920 metric tons for its predecessors. This huge underwater displacement is similar to that of modern submarines in service in the United States and Russia, which meet roughly the same technical criteria. Engineers made four specific design choices to reduce radiated noise and make Le Triomphant quieter during operations. First, they equipped it with a steel hull of very high elastic limit so that it could dive deeper (beyond 300 meters). Second, they made the submarine more hydrodynamic and streamlined its propeller. Finally, they insulated propulsion and auxiliary installations from the hull and suspended them on springs to avoid vibrations and shocks. A Fr81 Billion Program Likewise, Le Triomphant carries renovated weaponry. In addition to defensive weapons consisting of torpedoes and Exocet SM39 submarine-launched missiles, the submarine will transport 16 M45 missiles. Each M45 can disperse six nuclear warheads--staggered over time or space--that can strike targets more than 6,000 km away from their underwater launch point. Moreover, the M45 features penetration devices and electronic countermeasures to help it thwart enemy defenses. France has decided to begin building three other submarines of the same model, two of which, the Temeraire and the Vigilant, have already been named. In the past, the Strategic Ocean Force has included as many as six strategic submarines. By 2005, that number will have dropped to four. Construction of the four new submarines is estimated to cost a total of Fr81 billion, not counting spending on the M45 missiles. The decision whether to replace the M45 in 2010 by a missile dubbed M5 is not expected to be made before 1997. Following Leotard's on-board tour, Le Triomphant will sail to the Ile-Longue base, in the Brest roadstead, between next 2 and 4 May. It will be presented to Francois Mitterrand on 7 May when the head of state travels to Brest to witness the launch of the first French-built nuclear aircraft carrier, the Charles-de-Gaulle. The prime minister is scheduled to join the president on his visit to Le Triomphant submarine. During the following two years, the submarine will perform a series of sea trials--a crucial step before it enters active service, i.e., makes its first operational patrol. The tests to enable the crew--two rotating crews of 110 men each--to learn how to handle the ship at maximum submersion will take place in the Atlantic. Le Triomphant will later effect a full-scale launch (minus the explosive charge, of course) of an M45 missile, and fire torpedoes and SM39 missiles. This will enable the Permanent Programs and Testing Committee (CPPE), which makes proposals concerning the rating and active service acceptance of the submarine to the general staff, to hand down its verdict. Active service is slated for the summer of 1996.
