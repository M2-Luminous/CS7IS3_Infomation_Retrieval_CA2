In the manoeuvres due from the end of May to the end of June in the Pacific, United States intends to tie Japan and the South Korean puppets tighter to its war chariot and use them for attaining its dominationist aim, the analyst says, and goes on: It must not go unnoticed that the timetable of the manoeuvres was announced at a time when the United States, Japan and the South Korean puppets were bringing the situation on the Korean peninsula to the extreme pitch of strain over the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. The United States is now beefing up its forces in South Korea, crying for "military counteraction" against the DPRK, Japan is intensifying the anti-DPRK campaign, calling for the enactment of "a law on the case of emergency" on the Korean peninsula and the South Korean puppets are seeking military adventures after making public what they call "new operational plan". It is a logical conclusion that the Rimpac joint military exercises projected by the United States, Japan and South Korea will be targeted against the DPRK. The manoeuvres will result in a more strained situation in the Asia-Pacific region. Trying to frighten our republic with the demonstration of force is a dream of an idiot.
