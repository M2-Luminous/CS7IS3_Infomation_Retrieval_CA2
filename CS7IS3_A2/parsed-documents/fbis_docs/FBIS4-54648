[Szekerees] I very seriously think that it is certain that Hungary will not have a one-party system. In my view, some six to eight parties will be in Parliament. It is not a realistic alternative, either, that the government will have a one-party system. I expect that the mandates will be in proportion to the popularity of the parties, however, we will only find this out on 29 May. The MSZP will not come to power -- as you claimed -- when it comes to government, because governing is not the same as being in power -- power, fortunately, is divided. It has many actors and the government is not the only factor in power. Parliament, the president of the republic, the Constitutional Court, and publicity are similar kinds of tools. Therefore, I say that the MSZP will be one of the parties in government. In my view, Hungary will have a coalition government. Whatever the election results are, it is certain that a stable government that is able to operate can only be established in Hungary if it stands on the broadest possible political basis. [Szekely] If membership in the government does not mean that someone possesses power then why do you attack the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] by saying that, in possession of the power, it has not done such and such things? [Szekeres] Rather than saying that in possession of power, the MSZP says that the government's -- and not the MDF's alone -- performance was not good enough to entitle it to continue in government. The next government -- providing that the MSZP is in it -- will change mainly in the sense that it wishes to rely on expertise to a greater extent, including the state's expert teams and the social organizations, interest groups, and other professional organizations. In my view, it will change because governing will become predictable, therefore, people will be able to know in advance what the government will represent. Governing will also become more open, the government will be able to have a better dialogue with society. As a result of all this, governing can and will change. [passage omitted] [Szekely] Are you really honest and predictable? [Szekeres] I trust that we are and will remain so. [Szekely] This is contradicted by the pragmatically demagogic socialist election program, in which the planned economic measures almost correspond to the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] type orthodox-liberal shock-therapy concept and will have exactly the opposite effect to the promises made to poor people on improving their living standards. Your planned tax changes will also affect people on low incomes the worst. You also promise things in your program that have already been achieved by the current government, for example curbing inflation. Where is the honesty here? [Szekeres] I believe that we talk very honestly about what can be expected and what measures we will take. When we talk to people about our concept, we talk on the basis of this program and we do not make promises. I know that both the conservative and the liberal press has raised this criticism against us, but this is unfounded. We very honestly tell that we are facing a very difficult 18 months, so we even mention the length of time our planned measures will take to bring results. I believe that our program is not a liberal one. I do not even know what the term liberal economic policy means, I cannot interpret this in Central-Eastern Europe in a transitional society. I cannot see that it is liberalism that creates the similarities between the our economic program and that of the SZDSZ and the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]. I emphasize this because, surprisingly, economic research institutes pointed out that the Fidesz's and the MSZP's concepts are closest to each other, and not the SZDSZ's and the MSZP's. The reason is that the room for maneuver has become narrow. Whoever is in government, he will have very little room for maneuver. [Szekely] If you are offering the same as the Fidesz or any other party then why should we elect you out of all the parties? [Szekeres] I think that this has psychological conditions. I myself have been thinking about the reasons for the increase of our public support in the past 18 months. We have had some research done for us on this issue to see what people actually think about the MSZP. Three factors were emphasized, and our increased support is probably due to these factors. The first is that a view has emerged that the MSZP is an expert party. To put it more simply, they believe that the Socialists know what they want and they are good at their jobs. Another factor people emphasized was that we are a predictable party, therefore, it can always be known in advance what stance we would take on an issue. This makes us a little boring -- I admit this -- but this is a very important value for people in a transitional society like ours, which is in a flux. The third reason is that they consider us to be an open party because they say that they feel we are dealing with their problems. People have more faith in us than in other political parties for these three reasons. [passage omitted] [Szekely] Perhaps even you did not believe four years ago that you would win the next elections. If the MSZP thinks in the long term, and if its governing will be the same kind of disaster for the country as the previous one, then what strategy do you have to survive even this? In other words, do you not think that this possible return is too early? [Szekeres] Personally, I did not think four years ago that the MSZP's public support would increase to such an extent. I thought that this would take 10 to 12 years. I thought that the government or the liberal opposition would put up a better performance, therefore, I accept what you say. However, for a political party, if it feels responsibility for the country, it is not a good question whether it wishes to govern in a given situation. We have to consider whether, today, it is possible to form a stable government in Hungary that is able to operate without the MSZP. I think that it is not, because only an MDF, Christian Democratic People's Party, SZDSZ, and Fidesz cooperation could successfully counter us, but this would not be able to function. However, if we do not now take on the governmental role, who knows in what condition the country will be in two, three, or four years' time? Possibly much worse. Therefore, we have to accept the responsibility of government and we have to try to avoid losing people's confidence. The only method to achieve this is through complete openness. [passage omitted]
