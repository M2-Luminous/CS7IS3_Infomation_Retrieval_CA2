Is the Arab League now limiting its ambitions to the economic sphere after the permanent setbacks in the political sphere -- the Gulf War, the civil wars in Yemen, Sudan, and Somalia? ['Abd-al-Majid] Our organization is, after all, an association of individual sovereign states, and we must not reduce this sovereignty in any way. Yes, there are joint political interests of the Arab states but, unfortunately, time and again there are also differing positions. Still, politics remains our main cause. Yemen is certainly an example of misguided cooperation within the country. In my opinion certain elements have caused this fighting, for personal reasons and because of problems between individual parties. [Harrer] Are you also thinking of groups outside Yemen, individual countries of the Arab League, to be more precisely -- such as Saudi Arabia, for whose interests Yemeni unity is running counter? ['Abd-al-Majid] No, in my opinion the war in Yemen is homemade. There was no need of outside intervention. Just think of the ideological differences between the Marxist south and the conservative north. Unity, which was concluded in 1990, was incomplete, there has never been just one army or a single currency. What unity is that? Not even a military or an economic one. [Harrer] When all other Arab countries support Yemeni unity, why then has the Gulf Cooperation Council, which is actually nothing more than a regional cooperation forum within the League, in a statement de facto accepted the breaking off of South Yemen? ['Abd-al-Majid] No, that statement is not that clear. It was only meant to say that unity cannot be forced upon one partner, which is also my opinion. [Harrer] So no war by proxy? Media reported that Iraqis were fighting on the side of North Yemen, whereas Saudi Arabia has old resentments against North Yemen not least from the time of the Gulf War. ['Abd-al-Majid] I know nothing of Iraqis in North Yemen. No, this is certainly not the right approach to the Yemeni problem: First one has to stop fighting and then seek ways and means for reconciliation. [Harrer] You have also repeatedly appealed for Arab-Arab reconciliation with Iraq. ['Abd-al-Majid] I have never been under the illusion that the problems with Iraq could be solved overnight. What I wanted to say was that we finally have to face these problems and that we must learn from past mistakes. This also implies to admit to faults and responsibility. I said very clearly that in the case of Iraq, the fault was its aggression against Kuwait. This now means: Implementing the UN resolutions, recognizing borders, compensation for victims. Iraq is about to fulfill the resolutions, but not all of them yet. [Harrer] Is it justified to maintain the UN sanctions? ['Abd-al-Majid] I have personally repeatedly demanded to end the suffering of the Iraqi people, not for political but for humanitarian reasons. The quicker Iraq fulfills all the conditions, the quicker the sanctions will be lifted. [Harrer] What is the Arab League's position on the progress in the Palestinian-Israeli agreements? Do you feel left out? ['Abd-al-Majid] One thing people tend to forget is that in September 1991 -- even before the Madrid conference, which was held in October, the Foreign Ministers' Council of the Arab League adopted a resolution with only two out of 21 votes against, that welcomed the peace process. As I said, that was before the Madrid Conference, which proves the will for peace on the part of the Arab countries. Yet, Israel can, of course, not have the cake and eat it: This means, peace for occupied territories. [Harrer] One subject, which, among others, also applies to your home country, is radical Islamism. ['Abd-al-Majid] Islam does not tolerate violence and terrorism. Thus, Islamism must be seen as a social, political, and economic phenomenon, and radicalism of this sort exists in non-Islamic countries, too. In Egypt, the situation is meanwhile under control. [Harrer] Is there no alternative to the very violent way in which the cause of Islamism is waged -- I am thinking of the many death sentences? ['Abd-al-Majid] Each country has its own way of dealing with terrorism. Yet, why should we accept the killing of innocent people while the criminals then claim human rights for themselves? We must first of all think of the victims.
