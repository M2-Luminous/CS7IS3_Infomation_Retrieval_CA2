The agreement was signed by the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd, and the Indian High Commissioner to Britain, Mr. L.M. Singhvi at 10, Downing Street, in the presence of the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, and his British counterpart, Mr. John Major. Britain is the first country with which India has signed such an agreement, aimed at creating conditions conducive for investments in each other's country and designed to increase investor confidence. Protection of a wide range of investments, including moveable and immoveable property, mortgages, liens, pledges, shares and stocks and intellectual property rights is covered by the agreement. An official spokesman for the Indian delegation said the central idea behind the agreement was that each of the contracting parties would ensure fair and equitable treatment as well as full protection and security to investments from the other country. He said that initially, the agreement would remain in force for a period of 10 years. Thereafter, it could be terminated if either contracting party gave notice of termination to the other. If such a step is taken, it would be on a non-discriminatory basis and would entail fair and equitable compensation to the affected investor. Article 5 and 6 of the agreement guarantee that investments of investors of either contracting party shall not be nationalised or expropriated except for certain public purposes related to the internal requirements for regulating economic activity. Moreover, the investor would also have a right to review by a judicial or another independent authority of the contracting party. Investors, whose investments suffer due to war, other armed conflicts, national emergency or civil disturbances are guaranteed of a treatment as regard compensation which would not be less favourable than which the contracting party accords to its own investors or the investors of any third State. Several dispute resolution mechanisms are dealt with including amicable settlements through direct negotiations between the parties to the dispute, international reconciliation under the conciliation rule of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, and recourse to be international centre for settlement of the disputes.
