After hearing a government representative deliver a report and representatives of relevant National Assembly committees express their views on various bills, including those dealing with the labor code, the revised law on the organization of people's councils and people's committees, the revised law on the election of people's councillors, the tax law on the right to land use, and the law promoting domestic investments, the National Assembly Standing Committee gave its views on these bills and tasked various agencies with drafting these laws and relevant National Assembly committees with continuing to study to rectify them. Depending on the requirements of each project, they must solicit the views of the people and of various sectors and echelons, as well as of certain target people. On this basis, if these bills are found to be viable, they will be submitted to the National Assembly for consideration. 2. The National Assembly Standing Committee passed a regulation on procedures for resolving various economic court cases, regulations on supplementary taxes for those households using agricultural land exceeding the allocated quota, and a resolution on revising the tax rates of some groups of goods in the import tax chart. The promulgation of a regulation on procedures for resolving economic court cases will create a legal basis for economic courts to resolve promptly various economic court cases in order to protect the state's interest and the legitimate interest of juristic persons. The regulation on supplementary taxes for those households using agricultural land exceeding the allocated quota is designed to implement the agricultural tax policy promptly and uniformly to ensure the fair and reasonable character between the rights and the tax debt of those households using agricultural land. The resolution on revising the tax rates of certain groups of goods in the import tax chart is designed to overcome gradually those irrationalities which have arisen in the process of economic management in order to protect and develop local production, protect consumer interest, increase the sources of revenue for the state, and suit the export-import situation in our country. 3. After giving its views on the draft of a regulation on providing favorable treatment to those having meritorious deeds with the nation and on the draft of a regulation revising certain articles of the regulation on home and land tax, the National Assembly Standing Committee asked relevant drafting organs to cooperate with the National Assembly's Social Affairs Committee and Economic and Budget Committee in studying ways to refine these two draft regulations in order to submit them to the National Assembly Standing Committee for approval in a later meeting. 4. The National Assembly commented on plans to ensure compliance with the statute governing the enactment of laws and regulations that was promulgated by the Council of State and the Eighth National Assembly in August 1988. This plan is designed to condense past experience and renovate the legislative work. On this basis, there have been necessary supplementary corrections on procedures and sequences in this work. 5. The National Assembly Standing Committee discussed and passed a resolution to promulgate a statute governing the cooperation between state organs in providing leadership for and organizing the implementation of a National Assembly resolution on practicing thrift and fighting wasteful spending, corruption, and smuggling in order to carry out effectively the National Assembly resolution on this matter. 6. The National Assembly Standing Committee decided to send out various teams of the National Assembly Standing Committee to review the situation regarding law enforcement, state budget distribution and spending, and the resolution of letters of complaints and denunciation in a number of sectors and localities. 7. The National Assembly Standing Committee heard a report on the results of the 21 February-1 March 1994 official friendship visit to the People's Republic of China by a Vietnamese National Assembly delegation led by National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh. The National Assembly Standing Committee warmly welcomed and highly valued the fine results of this visit, saying that this marked a new development in the friendly, neighborly, and cooperative relations between the people and National Assemblies of Vietnam and China, thus contributing to the cause of socialist consolidation and construction in each country for the sake of peace, stability, cooperation, and development in the region and the rest of the world. Also at this meeting, the National Assembly Standing Committee heard a report on the results of the 3-5 February 1994 visit to Vietnam of a parliamentary delegation from the Kingdom of Thailand led by His Excellency Marut Bunag, chairman of the Thai Lower House, and the 2-5 March 1994 visit to Vietnam of a National Assembly delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia led by Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the National Assembly and acting head of state of Cambodia. The National Assembly Standing Committee warmly welcomed the results of these two significant visits, noting that they helped consolidate and strengthen the friendly, neighborly and cooperative relations between the people and the National Assembly of Vietnam on one side, and the peoples and National Assemblies of the Kingdoms of Thailand and Cambodia on the other for the sake of peace, stability, cooperation, and development in Southeast Asia and the rest of the world. 8. The National Assembly Standing Committee heard a report on the situation regarding the activities of various National Assembly delegations in deploying various resolutions of the recent Ninth National Assembly's Fourth Session.
