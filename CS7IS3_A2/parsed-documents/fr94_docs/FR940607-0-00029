FR940607-0-00029 FR940607-0-00012 33 CFR Part 165 [CGD01&hyph;94&hyph;052] RIN 2115&hyph;AA97 Safety Zone; Onset, MA Fire Department Centennial Celebration AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone in Onset Harbor, Onset, MA, on July 9, 1994 during the Onset Fire Department Centennial Celebration. While this safety zone is in effect, no vessel traffic will be allowed into or out of Sunset Cove. This safety zone is necessary to protect pleasure craft and personnel aboard these vessels from injury due to potential hazards associated with the fireworks. EFFECTIVE DATES: This regulation is effective between the hours of 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. on July 9, 1994. In the event of inclement weather, the regulation will be in effect on the rain date of July 10, 1994 at the same times. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LT Eric Washburn, Marine Safety Field Office Cape Cod, (508) 968&hyph;6556. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are LT E. A. Washburn, Project Manager, and LCDR J. D. Stieb, Project Counsel, First District Legal Office. Regulatory History Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days after Federal Register publication. Due to the date when this office received the application, there was not sufficient time to publish proposed rules in advance of the event. Publishing a NPRM and delaying the event would be contrary to the public interest since the fireworks display is for the centenial celebration of this weekend. Background and Purpose On July 9, 1994, the town of Onset, Massachusetts, plans to sponsor a Onset Fire Works Centennial Celebration between the hours of 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. Approximately 200 spectator boats are expected to attend this event. A safety zone is needed to prohibit spectator vessels from transiting or anchoring in the area over which the fireworks will be launched. The safety zone will include all waters from the Shell Point Beach south to buoy C ``1'' then southwest to a danger buoy at position 41 degrees 44.13 ’ North and 70 degrees 39.83 ’ West then northwest to the mouth of Sunset Cove, between the hours of 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. on July 9, 1994. While this safety zone is in effect, no vessel traffic will be allowed into or out of Sunset Cove. Regulatory Evaluation This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies of DOT is unnecessary. These regulations will be in effect for only a short period, specifically for one hour on one day. The entities most likely to be affected are pleasure craft wishing to view the fireworks from the water. These vessels will still be able to view the fireworks from the water but will be required to do so at a distance more than 300 yards from the staging area, which will not cause them undue hardship. The effect on commercial traffic is negligible due to the minimal amount of commercial vessel traffic in that area. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominate in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). For the reasons outlined in the Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard expects the impact to be minimal on all entities. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
