If the three conflicting parties (Azerbaijan, Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh) sign a relevant agreement in Vienna, CSCE will send 34 observers to Karabakh within three days (10 of whom would be mine clearing experts), the CSCE's Karabakh rapporteur, Ambassador Jan Eliasson, told correspondents on Thursday [19 May]. Within another two weeks, this CSCE team would be increased to 66. Twelve CSCE states are prepared to provide military personnel for the Karabakh mission. Eliasson stressed that this mission will be a first step toward a peace process. He said that the Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents, Ter-Petrosyan and Aliyev, have pointed out to him that this is an "historic chance" to end this "war that has been forgotten by the world" (Eliasson). So far, cease-fires in the Karabakh conflict have always been broken shortly after they were signed. International supervisors would contribute a "new quality" to securing the cease-fire, Eliasson said.
