FR940711-2-00100 FR940711-2-00042 [Docket No. 93N&hyph;0378] North Carolina Memorial Hospital; Revocation of U.S. License No. 314 AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the revocation of the establishment license (U.S. License No. 314) and product license issued to the North Carolina Memorial Hospital, doing business as the Clinical Coagulation Laboratory, for the manufacture of Source Plasma. In a letter to FDA dated February 10, 1993, the firm voluntarily requested revocation of its establishment and product licenses and thereby waived an opportunity for a hearing. DATES: The revocation of the establishment license (U.S. License No. 314) and product license became effective August 24, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen Ripley, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (HFM&hyph;635), Food and Drug Administration, 1401 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852&hyph;1448, 301&hyph;594&hyph;3074. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FDA has revoked the establishment license (U.S. License No. 314) and the product license issued to the North Carolina Memorial Hospital, doing business as the Clinical Coagulation Laboratory, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC 27514, for the manufacture of Source Plasma. FDA conducted an inspection of the Clinical Coagulation Laboratory between July 30 and August 15, 1991. The inspection documented serious deviations from the applicable Federal regulations and the biologics standards in the firm's license. Deviations identified during the inspection included, but were not limited to, the following: (1) Failure to adequately determine donor suitability, in that: (a) three donors who admitted to a history of hepatitis, liver disease, or jaundice were regularly accepted for Source Plasma donation (21 CFR 640.63(c)(11)); (b) two donors who previously tested repeatedly reactive for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) continued to be accepted for donation, despite having never met the established criteria for donor reentry as described in the December 2, 1987, FDA HBsAg protocol (21 CFR 610.41); (c) two donors who failed to donate for a period of 6 months were not processed as new donors (21 CFR 640.65(b)(1)(iii)); and (d) five donors did not have serum protein electrophoresis testing performed every 4 months (21 CFR 640.65(b)(1)(i)); (2) failure to limit the frequency of Source Plasma donation to two times within a 7-day period, in that at least two donors were allowed to donate three times in a 7-day period (21 CFR 640.65(b)(5)); (3) failure to observe, standardize, and calibrate equipment used in the collection, processing, and distribution of blood components (21 CFR 606.60); (4) failure to maintain adequate and complete standard operating procedures for all steps in the collection, processing, storage, and distribution of blood components (21 CFR 606.100(b)); and (5) failure to report important changes in responsible personnel or manufacturing methods to FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (21 CFR 601.12 (a) and (b)). FDA determined that the deviations from Federal regulations were significant and constituted a danger to public health, warranting a suspension pursuant to 21 CFR 601.6(a). In a letter to the North Carolina Memorial Hospital dated September 3, 1991, FDA detailed the violations noted above and suspended the firm's establishment and product licenses for the manufacture of Source Plasma. In a letter to the firm dated May 20, 1992, FDA indicated that the firm had responded satisfactorily to FDA's September 3, 1991, suspension letter. In the same letter, FDA permitted the firm to resume collecting and storing Source Plasma on a limited basis for the purpose of reinspection to determine compliance. FDA conducted a followup inspection of the firm between July 27 and July 29, 1992. The inspection documented several continuing deviations from Federal regulations. These deviations included, but were not limited to, the following: (1) Inadequate facilities to provide for the storage of blood or blood components; (2) incomplete or incorrect disposition records; and (3) incomplete or inadequate written procedures. FDA permitted the firm to continue to collect and store Source Plasma on a limited basis, but FDA did not permit the firm to distribute the prepared plasma until otherwise notified by FDA. FDA attempted to conduct a reinspection of the firm on February 2, 1993, to, in part, determine the firm's status. During this inspection, it was observed that the donor chair had been removed and that no plasma had been collected since the inspection ending July 29, 1992. The inspection was terminated because a meaningful inspection could not be performed. In a letter to FDA dated February 10, 1993, the firm requested voluntary revocation of its licenses and thereby waived its opportunity for a hearing under 21 CFR 601.5(a). The agency granted the licensee's request by letter dated August 24, 1993, which revoked the establishment license (U.S. License No. 314) and the product license for the manufacture of Source Plasma. FDA has placed copies of the letters relevant to the license revocation on file under the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document with the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. These documents include the following: FDA letters of September 3, 1991, May 20, 1992, and August 24, 1993; and the firm's letter of February 10, 1993. These documents are available in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. Accordingly, under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262), 21 CFR 601.5, and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Director, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (21 CFR 5.68), the establishment license (U.S. License No. 314) and the product license issued to the North Carolina Memorial Hospital, doing business as the Clinical Coagulation Laboratory, for the manufacture of Source Plasma were revoked, effective August 24, 1993. This notice is issued and published under 21 CFR 601.8 and the redelegation at 21 CFR 5.67. Dated: June 27, 1994. Michael G. Beatrice, Deputy Director, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.
