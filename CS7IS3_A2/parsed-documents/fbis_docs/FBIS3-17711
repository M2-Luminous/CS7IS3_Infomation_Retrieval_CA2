Among other things the program suggests immediately freezing prices, stopping privatization and invalidating the privatization documents that "ignore the rights of workers and the public interest." The former chairman of the USSR Supreme Soviet Anatoliy Lukyanov said: "Presidency in general is alien to Russian and Soviet mentality."
