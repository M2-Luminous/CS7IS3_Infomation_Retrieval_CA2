"At last, spring came to U.S.-Vietnam relations," Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. "I perceive it as a very hopeful development." The top government spokesman also said, "I hope the improved ties between the two nations will not be restricted to them alone but contribute to the peace and prosperity in the broader Asia-Pacific region." Takemura issued the comment shortly after U.S. President Bill Clinton announced he is lifting the 19-year-old embargo against Vietnam. Clinton also said the United States and Vietnam have decided to exchange liaison offices in Hanoi and Washington to facilitate more progress on the missing Americans issue. He removed the sanctions a week after the Senate voted overwhelmingly in favor of lifting the embargo in recognition of Vietnam's cooperation in accounting for the fate of 2,238 Americans still listed as missing in Vietnam, and also in the hope that Hanoi will cooperate more on the issue. The United States imposed an economic embargo on communist-ruled North Vietnam in 1964 and extended it to the whole country when the U.S.-backed regime in Saigon fell to communist forces in April 1975.
