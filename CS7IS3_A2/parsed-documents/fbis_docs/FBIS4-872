A year ago on 16 April 1993, I was sworn in as president of the Republic and head of state. The celebration of this important event should in no way eclipse another even more important event -- the first anniversary of the final establishment of the democratic process in our country. Indeed, thanks to God and to the will of the sovereign people of Niger, democracy is henceforth an indispensable reality in our country. [passage omitted] Dear countrymen, on this solemn occasion we deem it important to briefly recall the socio-political and economic context in which we founded the state of Niger. On the socio-political scene, the atmosphere was marked, among other things, by an armed rebellion brought about by previous regimes' inability to create conditions for the balanced and harmonious development of the various regions; an increasingly dangerous situation of insecurity in cities and the countryside; constant growth in the unemployment rate, caused notably by the closing down of some enterprises and with difficulties in getting a job in the civil service; social conflicts, notably between farmers and livestock rearers, and workers and employers. On the economic scene, the report on the ad hoc commission's review of the country's economic situation revealed the catastrophic situation in which our country found itself on the advent of the institutions of the Third Republic. This report stated, first of all, a great imbalance in public revenues, which resulted in arrears in salaries, scholarships, student allowances, and the inability of the government to pay other state expenditures. Then there also was the weight of the external debt, estimated at several hundreds of billions of CFA francs, and domestic debt, which was estimated at dozens of billions of CFA francs. Dear Niger citizens and countrymen, as you know, our country has had to cope with many socio-political difficulties within the past 12 months. These difficulties include a refusal to carry out a democratic change in the government, ethnocentrism, regionalism, an armed rebellion, and religious intolerance, which caused losses in human lives. [passage omitted] Apart from these numerous difficulties we have to cope with, it should be admitted that the bottom line of the situation we are dealing with is that there is an unprecedented financial crisis, a loss of working hours due to the intransigence and impatience of social partners, rallies and demonstrations which are often marked by violence, acts of vandalism, and organized insubordination. These, dear countrymen, are some of the many dangers which threatened our young democracy, social peace, and national cohesion throughout the year. Therefore, in order that the democratic process, so dearly acquired, is not perverted or spoiled, it is important to emphasize once and for all that democracy does not mean anarchy, a license to do whatever one likes, or apathy towards the state. [passage omitted] Fellow Niger citizens and dear countrymen, the difficult situation, we inherited as well as the numerous obstacles we have encountered, have at no moment shaken our firm and irreversible will to successfully implement our program. Our members of parliament were conscious of this indispensable reality, when they courageously and massively approved the government's general policy statement, after detailed study. Our action program gives priority to the settlement of social issues, and that was why high priority was given to the settlement of the problems affecting the university and other schools, notably the payment of arrears in scholarships, allowances, and registration fees. On the health scene, considerable efforts were made to provide our health centers with adequate personnel and essential medical supplies. This shows that the aspect of human development constitutes a very high priority for us. The government attempted to tackle the painful issue of armed rebels as soon it took office, following several meetings and with mediation of friendly countries. We were then able to embark on the first stage of negotiations in the search for lasting peace. The frame of reference given to us by the Coordinating Committee of Armed Resistance at the last Ouagadougou meeting was analyzed by all the various groups. All the information we received was compiled into source documents for the government to be used in its negotiations with the rebels. We have often solemnly reiterated that the Niger Republic is one and indivisible. It is a democratic and social country. We sincerely hope that at the forthcoming meeting in Paris, we will find a quick solution to the tragedy which is tearing our people apart. [passage omitted] Our efforts at solving the socioeconomic crisis, which has seriously affected our country, would have been even more successful had it not been for the devaluation of the CFA franc which forced us to realign our strategy. We are fully aware that a country as poor as Niger needs foreign financial assistance to achieve economic and social recovery. The government of the Third Republic therefore renewed contacts with leading bilateral and multilateral financial backers as soon as it took office to establish an atmosphere of trust and serenity which is indispensable [words indistinct] for acquiring foreign aid. The ensuing results are highly encouraging and bode well for a better future. However, no matter what aid we receive and how much it is, foreign aid is subject to several restrictions and conditions. It cannot therefore be the sole answer to all our problems if there is no true national awakening. [passage omitted] The past year has been enlightening in more ways than one. We have learned many lessons from being in power. The phase we are about to embark upon will not be very easy. At a time when we are trying to solve our problems on our own, we are faced with the additional problem of social tension brought about by opposition parliamentarians' desertion of the National Assembly. Regarding the recommendations the National Assembly made to the government in January following the debate on discrimination in the various institutions, some people have the impression that we have overlooked the pertinent measures contained in our 29 January parliamentary resolution on human resources management. This is not so. We would like to reassure you all that we will personally see to it that technical skill, moral values, and loyalty are considered above all other factors and are used as the only criteria for appointing people to any position of authority. I give you my solemn pledge on this as guarantor of the Constitution and head of state. We therefore call on the opposition parliamentarians to forget all bitterness, show high-mindedness and a sense of true love for their country, and join their colleagues from the majority group at the National Assembly in order that the first regular session of the year might proceed unhampered. My dear compatriots, the time has come for forgiveness and consensus. We should all do our utmost so that there will be peace, social harmony, union of hearts and minds, and tolerance in our country once and for all. We should not lose our legendary values of fraternity, harmony, serenity, and national solidarity as a result of insidious political intrigues. All sons and daughters of this country should accept the principle of dialogue to solve all our differences in order to participate actively in building a new Niger. [passage omitted including indistinct portions] May the Almighty God assist us and reward us with bountiful rains. Long live democracy! Long live the Republic! Long live Niger!
