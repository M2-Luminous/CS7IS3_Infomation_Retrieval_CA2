Pointing to the situation in former Yugoslavia in an interview with the NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG (Tuesday [11 January] edition), Kohl said peace and freedom could still not be had free of charge. For him, it is still decisive "that our armed forces are capable of meeting our alliance obligations, prepared for action, and equipped to modern standards, and that we retain conscription," Kohl said. Kohl warned against setbacks to the process of reform in the states of the former Warsaw Pact, above all in Russia. This would have "unforeseeable consequences." So far, Germany has provided the lion's share of aid --amounting to 80 billion German marks -- to Russia and the states of the former Soviet Union (The interview was prereleased to DPA in edited form).
