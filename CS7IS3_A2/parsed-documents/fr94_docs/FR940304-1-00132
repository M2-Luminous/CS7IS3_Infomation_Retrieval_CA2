FR940304-1-00132 FR940304-1-00014 Standards will also result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated NO 2 reduction would be 47,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of NO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.03 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;7, the reductions are 103,000 tons; 205,000 tons; 234,000 tons; 353,000 tons; 467,000 tons; and 698,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.35 percent. Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO 2 reduction would be 24 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of CO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.03 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;7, the reductions are 53 million tons; 105 million tons; 119 million tons; 181 million tons; 240 million tons; and 360 million tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.35 percent. Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 4.91 million barrels over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2&hyph;7, the reductions in oil imports are estimated to be 10.76, 21.5, 24.45, 37.14, 49.21 and 73.69 million barrels, respectively. 5. Conclusion Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard level 7 for amended room air conditioner standards. Of the standard levels analyzed, level 7 would save the most energy (5.22 quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the Department assumes that all room air conditioners would incorporate improved and increased heat transfer devices and high efficiency and variable-speed fan motors and compressors. However, the payback at this standard level of 16.1 years for the representative class, and up to 23.9 years for other classes, exceeds the 15-year life of the product and causes life-cycle cost increases of $86 for the representative class, and up to $178 for other classes. This level also drives the short-run manufacturer return on equity from 8.6 percent to negative 4.3 percent. The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 7 for room air conditioners outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level.
