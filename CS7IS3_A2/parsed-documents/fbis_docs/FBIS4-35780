Prithvi, or Earth, which has a range of 250 kilometres (156 miles), would be tested during the next 48 hours, the Press Trust of India (PTI) quoted unnamed defence sources here as saying. A spokesman for the defence ministry here confirmed that preparations had begun for the trial, which was postponed from May 15 until Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's return from a visit to the United States. "The test will be carried out provided all systems are found to be working well and there are no last-minute snags," the spokesman said. Top army experts and defence scientists have reached the test site at Chandipur-on-Sea in the eastern coastal state of Orissa, PTI said. The missile has been successfully tested several times by the Department of Defence Production, but it would be the first "user-trial" ahead of its possible mass-production for deployment in the army. US Ambassador-Designate Frank Wisner has urged New Delhi to reconsider deploying the missile. Washington has voiced fears that India's missile programme might lead to another arms race between India and arch rival Pakistan, with whom it has fought three wars since 1947.
