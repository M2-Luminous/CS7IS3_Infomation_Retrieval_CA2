An official of the Xiamen Haicang Management Committee disclosed that the visit by senior level officials from Beijing is the largest and highest level of its kind to Xiamen. On the second day after their arrival in Xiamen (4 February), they will conduct on-the-spot inspection for a day and then discuss what should be done on the 20 square km of land. Reportedly, one of the topics to be discussed is what kind of industry will be developed in Haichang, whether it will continue to be petrochemical industry or other industries such as automobiles, electronics, or machine-building. As for investors, it does not constitute a problem. A number tycoons of Chinese origin in Southeast Asia have expressed on numerous occasions their interest in investing in Haicang. When an official announcement is made by China on Wang Yongqing's withdrawal from the zone, they are willing to invest in Haicang and develop whatever industries China propose. They may even fly to Beijing or Xiamen on the second day to hold talks on investment. The move of senior Beijing officials is apparently unusual. It indicates that Haicang is a development zone of Xiamen and also a state-level development zone directly under control of the central authorities. The move also declares an end to "Wang Yongqing's investment in Haicang," which had created a furor, and a new period for Haicang's development. Su Zengtian, deputy secretary of Xiamen CPC Committee and executive deputy director of the Haicang Management Committee, said today: It is estimated that the decision of the central government on the 20 square km of land will be made public sometime in March or April. Whatever the result, it will definitely be a big project, which will bring along other trades. By then, Haicang will become a very popular place attracting investment from all sides.
