On February 9, the 16 countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) passed an ultimatum demanding the warring parties in Bosnia to lift the siege of Sarajevo and withdraw or put under UN control all the heavy weapons within a 20-kilometer range of the city before a 10-day deadline. NATO will launch air strikes on the mortar positions that do not respect the ultimatum. Balladur hoped that the Bosnian warring sides would conform to NATO's demand and "return to the negotiating table." "If they don't," he stressed, "it goes without saying that what has been said will be done." Balladur said that his government was deeply concerned with the situation of the French peace-keeping troops in Bosnia, who are on an "extremely dangerous" humanitarian mission. He said that the government would "take every measure to ensure their security." The latest statistics showed that by February 1 this year, a total of 10,760 soldiers of the UN Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) were stationed in Bosnia, 4,077 of whom were French. Balladur said that France accounts for the largest share in the UNPROFOR but it would be "meaningless" for them to continue their presence if the fightings there "should go on for five, ten or even 15 years."
