The meeting was devoted to Ukraine's repeated requests to initiate direct railroad links between the Ukrainian juncture of Khyriv and Kroscienko in Poland. This would grant Ukraine additional access to Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Having spent 222 million karbovanetses on preparations for this undertaking, Ukraine planned to open the route on 31 December 1993. However, the Polish side declared that the lack of appropriate infrastructure for customs and border troops would hinder the process. The Poles also did not agree to operate a joint customs and border checkpoint on Ukrainian territory. Following this declaration, Lvov Railroad Deputy Manager Tkachuk threatened to block the Polish Przemysl-Kroscienko route stretching in part via the Ukrainian station of Khyriv. According to MOLODA HALYCHYNA, the threat worked and the Polish side gave in. Volodymyr Kulyk, head of the International Routes Department deemed as "absolute nonsense" the report on Tkachuk's ultimatum. According to him, the route will open no sooner than 31 May 1994.
