About 3,000 students demanded an audience with President Nicephore Soglo to present their grievances, an AFP correspondent said. At least one student was wounded during the clashes and two demonstrators were arrested. An earlier demonstration took place on 17 March when 3,000 students joined the march in the center of Cotonou. Beninese students are demanding the doubling of their current scholarships in order to cushion the impact of the devaluation of the CFA franc that took place on 11 January. They are also protesting the expulsion of two of their comrades who are union leaders from the university accused of triggering disturbances on the Calavi Campus (15 km north-east of Cotonou) at the beginning of last month. Since then, the teachers of the National University of Benin had embarked on a strike to demand the reinforcement of security on the campus.
