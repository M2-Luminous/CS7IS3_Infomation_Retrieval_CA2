[Unidentified correspondent] This is a breakthrough in our bilateral relations because, out of seven our neighbors, Lithuania was the only one with which we did not have a bilateral treaty. The treaty was prepared not without difficulties, with accompanying protests from extreme nationalists on both sides. The Lithuanian side wanted to condemn in the treaty the occupation of Vilnius region in the period 1920-39 and regard as illegal all the effects of the presence of the Polish state in that region. This was not acceptable to us, among other things because of the Poles living in Lithuania. Apart from that, it would be difficult to find a country which would condemn its own history in a treaty. Finally, both sides agreed that historical entries should be included in a separate declaration which would not have the force of an international agreement. As a result, we are talking about the bad experiences of the past. Instead of a condemnation of the occupation there is a statement that Warsaw is the capital of Poland and Vilnius is the capital of Lithuania. This confirms Lithuania's historical rights to Vilnius. Neither Poland nor Lithuania have any territorial claims on each other. Both countries consider the present border as inviolable.
