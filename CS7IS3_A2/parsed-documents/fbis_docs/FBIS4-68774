The end of the Cold War, the failure of communism as a global political ideology, the collapse of the world socialist system and disintegration of the Soviet Union have created fundamentally new opportunities for overcoming divisions within the international community. Virtually all leaders of the countries of Central Europe and the new nations of Eurasia have proclaimed "returning to the community of civilized nations" and close cooperation with former political and ideological enemies in the most diverse areas as their primary foreign policy objective. Western leaders, for their part, have all welcomed this desire of the post-communist countries and expressed readiness to facilitate their rapid integration into multilateral Western structures and institutions. However, soon serious obstacles began to appear in Central Europe on the road to such integration. The very fact of new nations taking the place of the USSR, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia has complicated the work of international organizations and made multilateral negotiations and assessments of subregional balances of political and military forces more difficult. The appearance of Ukraine--the largest European nation after Russia--on the map Europe has in itself produced major changes in the continent's entire geopolitical landscape, requiring extremely cautious and well thought-out reaction on the part of the West[.sup]1[/]. At the same time, all military-political structures and institutes created by the West during the Cold War period (even those not designed specifically for confronting communist countries) have been faced with the need to redefine their functions and tasks and prove their suitability for work in the new conditions. Another factor that makes the integration of post-communist states into the Western community more difficult is nationalism. As expected by many scholars, nationalism has become one of the prime movers of the political process in the east of the European continent. The rise of nationalism has been, as far as one can judge, an inevitable consequence of the crisis and failure of communist ideology and the communist system, which had for a long time impeded the establishment of mature forms of social relations on both the domestic and international levels. Following the anticommunist revolutions of 1989-1991, national-ethnic self-identification became one of the main forms of social existence in countries where no civic society in the western sense had ever been established. Of course, in some countries of Central Europe other forms of socialization continued to exist all through the communist period: in Poland the ferment of civic society was the Catholic Church and, from the early 1980s, Solidarno; in Czechoslovakia (in the Czech Republic to a greater degree than Slovakia) a stable semi-underground dissident subculture persisted even after 1968; in Hungary the party-state leadership headed by Janos Kadar inclined towards liberal experimentation. However, most post-communist states lacked even such modest counterbalances to ethnic nationalism and statism. Nationalist movements also thrived because considerable segments of the former communist elites in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe readily embraced the ideology of nationalism in an effort to use it as a new source to legitimize their power. Nationalistic ideas were frequently popularized by the surviving machinery of communist propaganda, though now it was directed not so much against the West as against adjoining neighbors among the post-communist countries; such propaganda contributed to rising xenophobia and a sense of national exclusiveness. Nationalism often went hand in hand with right-wing populism, and in some cases with various forms of fundamentalism. The integration of Russia and other former soviet republics into the political, economic and military structures of the West was complicated by the fact that it had to be effected in the context of the formation of a fundamentally new balance of forces in the world, and especially the European continent. By the time of the disintegration of the USSR unified Germany was already becoming the dominant economic and political force in Europe. It possessed the greatest capabilities for extending financial aid to Central European countries, as well as to the republics of the Soviet Union. The role of NATO in the future Europe became a topic of animated debate in the course of which it became apparent that by the end of the decade a large part of U.S. armed forces would be withdrawn from Western Europe. It was suggested that even before the advent of the 21st century Western Europe would become an independent military force. The process of economic integration in the EC framework acquired new dimensions, with people gradually getting used to the prospect of confederation. At the same time, the West was unable to avoid a degree of political destabilization associated with the end of the Cold War and the profound crisis of most left-wing political parties, as well as with accumulated socio-economic problems. By the early 1990s extreme right-wing groups and movements were gaining strength in almost all countries of Western Europe, with the rising popularity of nationalistic leaders (the most vivid, though far from only, example of this trend was the rapid growth of Le Pen's party in France). The further development of West-European integration, to say nothing of the possible expansion of the European Community, aroused concerns in some countries for the preservation of independence and national unity. Fears of the prospect of millions of immigrants pouring in from the East and apprehensions about the influx of cheap goods into West-European markets from the post-communist states also contributed to rising xenophobia and even nostalgia for the collapsed "iron curtain." Discussions concerning the integration of Russia and other former soviet republics became especially acute after the 1990-1991 political crisis in Yugoslavia escalated into a bloody civil war. The question here is not only of human sacrifices and material losses on a scale unknown to Europe since World War II. The Balkan conflict has clearly demonstrated that the West is not ready to develop and enforce any more or less consistent strategy towards the post-communist world. The need for collective action and establishing a system of incentives and sanctions for the former Yugoslav republics was apparent already at the initial stage of the crisis, yet neither NATO, the CSCE, the EC, nor the UN were able to demonstrate the requisite readiness for action or propose solutions commensurate with the problem. Throughout the entire initial phase of the civil war in Yugoslavia (1990-1991) many Western experts predicted that the internal conflict in that country would be quickly localized and isolated from European big politics[.sup]2[/]. This view was apparently based on the notion that, with the end of the Cold War, the main threats of the escalation of regional conflicts were no longer cogent. However, the civil conflict quickly began to acquire international aspects: Hungary expressed concern over the situation of the Hungarian minority in Yugoslavia and, according to some reports, even declared the possibility of intervening[.sup]3[/]; Greece and Bulgaria displayed heightened interest in the fate of Macedonia, and Albania was concerned with the situation in Kosovo. This course of events on the territory of Yugoslavia substantially undermined hopes that possible conflicts on the territory of the Soviet Union could be fenced off from the rest of the world. It should be noted that since the debate began in 1991 it was conducted as it were on two levels. On the one hand, there was (and still is) an insistent need for urgent, immediate solutions capable of preventing a repeat of the "Yugoslavian variant" in different regions of the former Soviet Union. On the other, there is the no less apparent need for long-term strategic programs that would make it possible to organically merge CIS countries into regional and global systems of international relations. Whereas in the former case the main role was to be played by existing institutions (NATO, CSCE, EC, UN), in the latter qualitatively new mechanisms and structures could be built. However, in the course of the debate these two levels were frequently mixed, which led to confusion and mutual misunderstanding. Confusion was also caused by different interpretations of the very concept of "integration." Some politicians and scholars viewed the concept as cultural-civilizational in content. To them, the formal inclusion of Russia in Western structures seemed essentially a secondary matter, a derivative of her ability or inability to master and accept the basic values of Western democracy, the Western view of human rights, etc. Accordingly, the demands on Russia were extremely severe and the process of integration (or, more precisely, of cultural-civilizational assimilation of Russia) was viewed as historically protracted and spanning at least several decades. More, justifiable doubts were expressed as to the very ability of Russia to meld completely with the West. Another interpretation of the concept of "integration" centered mainly on its political and military-strategic aspects. The task of the quickest accession of Russia, as well as other former soviet republics, to Western security structures was considered to be much more important and urgent than the vague prospects of their cultural-civilizational assimilation. That is why, at least during the first stage of integration, the new nations of Eurasia were faced with less stringent demands, bearing, moreover, almost exclusively on their foreign and military policies. As stated in a special workshop report of the Center for National Security Negotiations in Paris, "basically, Russia must continue to develop in a direction that does not lead to the emergence of a new military threat against the West. Even a Russian nationalist government could meet that requirement: for example, an authoritarian regime relying on centralized economic planning, provided such a regime concentrates on the solution of domestic problems, without attempting to restore its lost hegemony in Europe."[.sup]4[/] According to this viewpoint, interaction among state political institutes should precede interaction among societies as such, creating the prerequisites for subsequent cultural integration while at the same time resolving the most important, from the Western point of view, problems of regional and global stability. One of the most widespread variants of Western strategy assumes the gradual integration of Central and Eastern Europe into Western security structures using NATO mechanisms[.sup]5[/]. The first step in that direction was the inclusion of former republics of the Soviet Union in the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, which is frequently regarded as a "connecting link" between NATO and the CIS. Along similar lines are proposals about forming a bilateral Russian-American military political alliance which would either be a component of NATO or would operate in close connection with it[.sup]6[/]. In the opinion of American experts, this integration variant could be of special importance for preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons on the territory of the former USSR. It is hardly possible to create a stable balance of forces on this territory; without an element of nuclear deterrence, any anti-Russian coalition of republics would inevitably be loose and unable to function. Consequently, the U.S. and NATO could face a difficult choice: either provide some countries of the region (for instance, Ukraine) with reliable security guarantees, including against potential threats from within the region itself, or accept the prospect of nuclear proliferation with vague but possibly dangerous consequences. Many Ukrainian leaders, including President Leonid Kravchuk, directly link Ukraine's nuclear disarmament with providing Kiev with reliable Western security guarantees. Naturally, only NATO is capable of assuring security guarantees commensurate with the possession of nuclear weapons. NATO supporters suggest taking advantage of favorable political conditions to ensure maximum internationalization of Russia's nuclear weapons, as well as of nuclear arsenals in the West. In their view, NATO mechanisms can be used to integrate Russian nuclear weapons at least at three levels: 1. Financing the work of Russian nuclear specialists and research institutes, help in implementing the provisions of the SALT-1 and SALT-2 treaties, increasing the safety of nuclear facilities in Russia, and keeping Russian nuclear technology and nuclear weapons components from going abroad; 2. Coordination of nuclear planning, expansion of confidence-building measures in the nuclear field, exchange of information about trends in the development of nuclear technologies; 3. Creation of joint multilateral nuclear forces of NATO and Russia. Noting that "multilateral nuclear forces [were] an old NATO objective which was never realized because of the imbalance between America and its European nuclear allies, as well as because of European distrust of the American strategy of expanded deterrence," supporters of this point of view note in a book published recently in the U.S. that "this goal can be achieved if Russia places a portion of its nuclear systems in a 'dual key' system with NATO. The formation of multilateral nuclear forces could commence if Ukraine transfers the nuclear systems on its territory to NATO for subsequent destruction or internationalization. Since Ukraine does not want to transfer nuclear weapons to Russia before receiving security guarantees from NATO, the transfer of nuclear systems directly to NATO may prove to be a reasonable solution."[.sup]7[/] Of course, the creation of NATO multilateral nuclear forces is hardly possible without fundamental changes in the nuclear strategy of the Western countries themselves. The key issue is whether the U.S. is prepared to place a portion of its nuclear arsenal under the control of a new multilateral structure. So far this idea has not been seriously considered in Washington. Supporters of this variant of integrating the former USSR republics into Western security structures consider it attractive because at present NATO is beginning to diversify its functions. Along with traditional military-political tasks, NATO agencies are seeking to contribute to the solution of problems of converting military production and ecology, coordinate the scientific and industrial policies of member countries, etc. Thus, linking with NATO is especially worthwhile for the former republics of the Soviet Union, while NATO, for its part, receives another important lever for influencing the new countries' foreign policies and defense strategies. Expansion of the North Atlantic alliance's "zone of responsibility" in the east of Europe would, in the view of supporters of this variant, answer two fundamental NATO questions: concerning the new role of NATO in the current transitional period in the development of the European situation and the basic possibility of preserving the bloc in the longer term. As is known, the creation of NATO in the latter 1940s was prompted by the United States' desire to resolve three interrelated problems: creation of a force center in Western Europe capable of withstanding Soviet military might and political influence; creation of a structure for controlling the postwar development of Western Germany in the political and military spheres; and the establishment of mechanisms capable of overcoming, or at least alleviating, contradictions within Western Europe. In addition, the U.S. had a fourth objective, apparent to all but never expressed officially: the formation of reliable instruments of American influence on the European continent. These objectives were never fundamentally revised over the course of four decades of Cold War and guaranteed the maintenance of a stable consensus in questions of NATO actions among its participants. Moreover, even the unofficial fourth objective was never challenged in Western Europe (except for Gaullist France in the 1960s), since American political leadership created an additional guarantee of stability on the continent. The end of the Cold War and disintegration of the Soviet Union, coupled with the changed correlation of forces between Western Europe and the U.S., as well as the process of West-European integration, cast doubts on the earlier objectives of NATO, albeit not to the same degree. The first--confronting Soviet might--had virtually disappeared. Although some NATO generals and Western politicians claim that even given all the changes in the geostrategic situation Russia remains a major military power of the continent, an objective assessment of Russia's offensive capabilities (to say nothing of an analysis of her political objectives) indicates the absence of any military threat from her against Western or Central Europe. At present the quantitative ratio of the military potentials of NATO and Russia is approximately 3:1, with NATO's clear superiority in the quality of its weapons and the combat readiness of its troops. When assessing the force ratio between Russia and the rest of Europe (including the countries of Central and Eastern Europe) the figure is approximately 1:6. That is why many Western military experts have a much more sober and restrained assessment than politicians of the actual prospects of a "new threat" to Europe from a right-wing regime in Russia. The rationale of preserving NATO for the purpose of preventing or settling Western contradictions or conflicts is also strongly questioned. In the last few decades political and economic structures have been set up outside the NATO framework to deal precisely with the resolution of such problems, and in many cases they operate much more effectively than NATO. Moreover, the center of gravity of problems dividing West-European countries has shifted from the military-political to the commercial, economic and social spheres, i.e., to areas in which NATO has neither the requisite experience nor authority. The possibility of maintaining NATO out of concerns on the part of West-European countries to keep a unified Germany in a rigid NATO framework also appears to be fairly problematic. In general, it is hard to imagine how a leading European nation (when the unification process is completed Germany will have a quarter of the population of Western Europe, its industrial potential will be the second in the world, and its GNP will be equal to the combined GNP of France and Great Britain) can be kept in modern conditions in any kind of "rigid framework." Already in 1990, Germany's position with regard to the crisis in Yugoslavia differed significantly from that of other West-European countries, as well as from American approaches to the crisis. Moreover, neither consultations within NATO nor coordination of the foreign policies of EC countries brought the Germans to an "Atlantic common denominator." Apparently, Germany's attitude towards the Yugoslavian crisis can be seen as a precedent for its future policy, and in future it may be even more clearcut. At the same time, it would be unrealistic to expect Germany, with thousands of economic and political ties with the U.S. and West-European countries, to opt for any open confrontation with its NATO partners by taking a nationalistic course and acting unilaterally. Germany's policy will be guided for the coming years, if not decades, by balancing between multilateral and unilateral solutions, between preservation of Atlantic cooperation and the building of a "Middle Europe." It is, however, obvious that NATO's impact on Bonn's foreign policy decisions will increasingly decline. For the United States, the question of the potential for NATO intervention in affairs on the territory of the former Soviet Union is additionally linked to the broader question of the future role of the U.S. itself in NATO. As noted before, one of the bulwarks of the bloc's existence throughout the entire Cold War period was America's desire to use NATO mechanisms as a means to secure its political interests in Western Europe. Washington's readiness to carry a disproportionate burden of NATO expenses allowed it to overcome many differences among the allies. Today the need for, or even expediency of, preserving NATO as a conduit of American influence in Europe is being increasingly challenged, both in Europe itself and the United States. The shifting of the center of gravity of relations between the U.S. and Western Europe to the sphere of trade, finance, competition in world markets, etc., in large measure devalues NATO mechanisms created to coordinate actions in the military-political sphere. The Americans were unable to adjust NATO to U.S.-EC relations even during the Cold War years, still less since the end of the Cold War. That is why, ever since the beginning of perestroyka in the USSR and the development of Soviet-American cooperation in the latter 1980s, anti-NATO sentiments have been on the rise among the American political elite, both liberal and conservative; questions of reorganizing the bloc and reducing U.S. armed forces in Europe are more than ever linked with reduction of the federal budget and "redistribution of the financial burden" among members of the alliance. A wide range of arguments in favor of "getting out of Europe" have been presented. Some political scientists and public figures were guided primarily by financial considerations[.sup]8[/]. Other experts felt that reducing the American presence would make U.S.-European relations more stable and help consolidate political mechanisms of cooperation. They also called for expanding economic links between the U.S. and Western Europe to prevent it from becoming a closed center of regional integration[.sup]9[/]. Still others felt that the close linkage of the U.S. to West-European security restricts the maneuverability of American policy and impedes the use of opportunities opening up in other regions. It has been suggested that politically Western Europe, if not losing its significance for the U.S., should at least give way to East Asia (or in some cases the Western Hemisphere) as the main area of American foreign policy strategy[.sup]10[/]. Finally, some claim that large-scale American military presence is simply meaningless, insofar as the linkage of American security to Western Europe can be secured by purely symbolic contingents of U.S. troops on the continent and that a sharp reduction in American forces will have no effect on nuclear deterrence[.sup]11[/]. President Bush, who undertook the initiative to develop a NATO disarmament plan in 1990, proceeded from the idea that U.S. forces in Central Europe should not go below 195,000. One year later the Republican administration revised its plans in the direction of further reductions down to 150,000. Senator Sam Nunn, who favored an alternative approach, called this "unrealistic" even before the disintegration of the USSR and called for a reduction down to 75,000 over five years. The Clinton administration has supported the "Nunn plan," with emphasis on preserving the potential for rapid transfer of American troops from the continental U.S. to Europe in case of a crisis. However, even more radical proposals have been aired in the new Congress, including the complete withdrawal of American troops from Europe and a revision of U.S. military commitments towards its allies. From this point of view the plan to integrate the new CIS countries into Western security structures through NATO has the purpose of stabilizing the situation not only in the East, but in the West as well, giving the bloc new functions and new incentives for development. It is not accidental that it is actively supported by American politicians and experts close to the bloc's leadership. More, certain steps have already been made in that direction: throughout 1992 NATO representatives were involved as intermediaries in negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorny Karabakh problem[.sup]12[/]. Here the concept of "integration" is interpreted very broadly, not only in the military-political sense, but in the historical-philosophical as well: NATO is seen as a mechanism facilitating the modernization of societies, the overcoming of nationalism, the formation of new political elites, etc.[.sup]13[/] Historically, four models of integrating individual states into NATO's political and military mechanisms have already formed. The first (the "German" model) presumes complete integration of a state's armed forces in NATO structures. The second ("French") model, on the contrary, is restricted to political cooperation while retaining complete independence in the military sphere, which does not preclude consultations and collaboration on specific military issues. The third ("NATO" model, which applies to most of the other European NATO members) provides for subordinating the greater part of national contingents to the NATO joint command in case of war or a major crises, while retaining autonomy in military planning, command and control in peacetime. Finally, the fourth ("American") model provides for allocating a smaller portion of national forces (deployed in Europe) to the joint NATO command, with a commitment to place approximately one-half the national forces deployed in other regions of the world under it. Which of those models is applicable to Russia? The most conservative authors consider that the most plausible, at least in the foreseeable future, is the "French" model of integration, since any other would require too much painful restructuring within NATO. Besides, exponents of this point of view note, at present Russia is not ready for closer ties with NATO; like France in the 60s and 70s, it must go through a period of nationalism (if even in moderate and nonaggressive form), including in foreign and defense policies. Only after 10 or 20 years would it be appropriate to speak of Russia's full integration into NATO political and military institutions. The "American" model also has its supporters. They note a certain "symmetry" in the location of America and Russia vis-a-vis the European continent. Since Russia, like the U.S., is not a purely European power and its strategic interests extend to other regions of the world, it is hardly worth insisting on total geographic integration. On the other hand, the other old, and possibly new, NATO members are hardly interested in automatically making any commitments with regard to the southern and eastern borders of the Russian Federation. At the same time, from the point of view of the interests of strategic and political stability in Europe, both the "French" and "American" variants of the integration of Russia may prove inadequate. In the final analysis, the main problem of Russian foreign policy in Europe is not a shortage of political links with the West but the fact that most of Russia's immediate western neighbors, both former soviet republics and in Central Europe, view Russia as a potential threat to their security and even existence. One may argue over how justified such fears are and whether it is legitimate to regard Russia as a direct successor of imperial policies. But one cannot deny the existence of distrust and suspicion in the capitals of neighboring states with regard to Moscow's policies. In that sense the problem of Russian integration into the Western security system indeed has much in common with the problem of integrating West Germany into NATO in the 1950s. Germany after World War II, like Russia today, was faced with distrust and suspicion on the part of its immediate neighbors, which, actually, was what required the development of a special "German" model of integration. It was precisely the complete integration of Germany into the North Atlantic alliance, the "dissolution" of the Bundeswer in NATO structures, that made it possible to overcome anti-German fears and suspicions in Western Europe. It is hard to imagine that the "German" model of the 1950s could be literally copied for Russia in the 1990s, if only because Russia is not a conquered and occupied country, its sovereignty is not restricted, and its war machine is far from destroyed. But if we are speaking of incorporating Russia into NATO, such an inclusion would be politically significant only if it were comprehensive and far-reaching. The higher the degree of internationalization of Russian armed forces, the easier it will be for Russia to resolve its political problems with its immediate neighbors. In the view of proponents of the integration of Russia and other CIS members into NATO structures, an additional incentive for them could be a proposal to create a single American-European-Russian market of weapons and military technologies, in which Russia and Ukraine would occupy a worthy place. Such a market would envisage standardization of basic types of weapons, the removal of restrictions to the access of former soviet republics to Western military technologies, the adoption of uniform rules of producer competition in the framework of a common market, creating a system for controlling exports of military technologies to developing nations, etc. In addition, as noted before, in a NATO framework it would be possible to coordinate efforts to convert military enterprises, in the sphere of political and military intelligence, and also to develop and deploy a multilateral system of strategic antimissile defense. Radical restructuring of NATO, changing the composition and functions of this military-political alliance, and the creation of new mechanisms and institutes--all this raises the question of revising the North Atlantic treaty. Indeed, the necessary changes are so great that they could hardly be codified in several new protocols supplementing the 1949 treaty. New negotiations, a new treaty and, perhaps, even a new name for NATO would seem preferable for a number of reasons. Firstly, such an undertaking would be a clear demonstration that both West and East are ready for really radical changes. Secondly, negotiations would make possible a frank discussion of problems unrelated to the legacy of the Cold War. Thirdly, they would involve states truly interested in creating a security system in Europe, while those NATO members which favor preserving the status quo would not be able to prevent the signing of a new treaty. At the same time, such negotiations and a new treaty also have some drawbacks. First of all, a break with the old North Atlantic treaty would signify a rejection of established traditions. For all its shortcomings, NATO enjoys a certain legitimacy which may not necessarily be inherited by a new organization. Furthermore, the current international situation (the end of the Cold War, acute economic conflicts between the U.S. and Western Europe, isolationist trends on both sides of the Atlantic) do not contribute to the acceptance of rigid binding documents by the participants in future negotiations. In such circumstances the new treaty could prove to be a step back rather than forward. This problem could be resolved if the parties to the negotiations committed themselves in advance to preserving the basic principles of the NATO alliance in a future treaty. However, this variant of Western strategy gives rise to serious objections, including from experts close to the current Democratic administration. On the one hand, it is not hard to predict that the U.S. and NATO will try to avoid providing any reliable security guarantees to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe so as to avoid being drawn into a conflict against their will. It should be said that historically the U.S. has always carefully selected its military-political allies and allowed various interpretations of the concept "allied relations." The tendency toward more restrictive interpretations clearly took the upper hand after the American defeat in Vietnam, when President Nixon identified the group of U.S. allies for which Washington was "prepared to fight." That privileged group included the members of NATO and the ANZUS bloc, Japan and Israel. These are the allies which can be viewed as full-blooded military-political partners of the U.S. All others would be more correctly characterized as aid recipients, as clients belonging to the zone of American influence. The U.S. has especially many such semi-allies in its own hemisphere (for example, the OAS, countries that signed the Rio de Janeiro Treaty in 1947), as well as in Asia (South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore). Equally apparent is the rigid hierarchy of military-political alliances to which the U.S. belongs. Thus, it is apparent even from diplomatic rhetoric that the Rio de Janeiro Treaty does not rank among priority links like the North Atlantic alliance or the American-Japanese treaty. A graphic example of the practical choices of American diplomacy was the Falkland crisis, when prior to the active phase of the conflict the U.S. expressed allied sympathies with both Great Britain and Argentina, but during the conflict itself unequivocally sided with the former. It is obvious that with respect to the former republics of the Soviet Union the U.S. will seek to apply the second model of allied relations which, in particular, provides no guarantees of automatic military help in crisis situations. But even if it provided such guarantees NATO would hardly be capable of convincingly confirming their veracity. (We could recall the years of debate between Western Europe and the U.S. concerning the reliability of American security guarantees to Europe; throughout the entire Cold War American leaders were never able to fully convince their West-European colleagues that U.S. security was inseparable from the security of its NATO partners.) Furthermore, the new role of the U.S in NATO and NATO's new role in the world is still an open question, and the integration of new states into the system of Atlantic relations may complicate its solution even more. The transformation of NATO into an embryo of a new security system for Europe is also being criticized from another aspect: the phases of integrating East-European countries remain unclear, as well as the criteria to be used in selecting candidates. If in the first phase NATO were to include countries from Central Europe, the former republics of the USSR could justifiably claim discrimination. If in the second phase the alliance were joined by Ukraine, Belarus and the Baltic states, then Russia would be in a highly vulnerable geostrategic situation. If progress in democratization and movement towards a market economy are adopted as criteria the political landscape of Europe may acquire the weird shape of an incorrectly assembled child's jigsaw puzzle. In addition, selective participation of countries of Eastern and Central Europe in NATO could indirectly provoke new conflicts on the continent. For example, if Hungary became a NATO member while Rumania did not, Budapest could doubtlessly be tempted to take advantage of its new status and the institutional support of the West to increase pressure on Bucharest concerning the issue of Transylvania. Selective inclusion in NATO of individual republics of the former Yugoslavia is also capable of changing the balance of forces in the Balkans, with possible negative consequences. Finally, it is extremely doubtful that NATO can radically expand its zone of responsibility in the east of the continent, to include such distant areas as, say, the Caucasus or Central Asia. According to optimists, NATO's reaction to the Persian Gulf crisis in 1990-1991 could serve as a model for other crisis situations, including on the territory of the former USSR. Indeed, when NATO policy towards the Iraq-Kuwait crisis was being formulated none of the alliance members had any reservations about participating in a confrontation not associated with the Warsaw Pact organization. More, all members stressed the need to display a united front, using the NATO infrastructure in place in Europe. This was all the more significant as the U.S. and its European allies had frequently clashed over so-called security interests outside the "NATO zone." West-European allies have traditionally opposed Washington's attempts to expand NATO's role beyond its charter tasks. It would, however, hardly be right to draw any conclusions regarding NATO's capabilities in Eurasia or even in Central Europe from this experience. The Persian Gulf crisis was in many ways a unique case, when the strategic and economic interests of the leading Western powers coincided, it was possible to gain, as a minimum, favorable neutrality on the part of Moscow, achieve unity in the UN Security Council, clearly define military objectives, and conduct the military operation in the shortest possible time. None of these conditions will be present in potential conflicts in post-soviet territories. The economic and strategic interests of the U.S. and Western Europe will not coincide (for example, in the Caucasus and some Central Asian countries they may not be apparent at all), Russia will take a position of its own, which will in large measure determine NATO's capabilities, there may be no clearcut military goals, and instead of a quick war one may expect protracted "low-intensity conflicts." In fact, the Yugoslavian experience (the apparent inability of NATO to influence events in the country despite their impact on the strategic security interests of at least two of its members, Greece and Turkey) is in most of its parameters much more applicable to the CIS than the experience of the Gulf war[.sup]14[/]. Besides, the idea of expanding the "NATO zone" clashes with trends towards strengthening the role and significance of the UN Charter, which are increasingly manifest in today's international relations and gaining growing support in Europe and the world. Extension beyond the sphere of the NATO mandate is a violation of provisions of the UN Charter regarding the right to regional defense and the creation of regional security organizations. More importantly, it is getting harder and harder to define where the "NATO zone" ends. If Russia became the bloc's eastern frontier, like Germany was during the Cold War, and the "NATO zone" was extended to the Pacific Ocean, the bloc would objectively acquire an anti-Chinese and anti-Islamic aspect, which hardly corresponds with U.S. objectives. It is hardly accidental that in late 1993 it was Washington that actively resisted attempts of some West-European countries to consider the question of giving Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic NATO membership and appealed to its partners to make greater use of other mechanisms to integrate the East-European nations into Western security systems, in particular, CSCE and UN mechanisms.

It is interesting to note that similar ideas were voiced long before the disintegration of the Soviet Union. See, for example, W. Lind, "Western Reunion: Our Coming Alliance with Russia?", POLICY REVIEW, summer 1989, p. 18. 7. Changes Needed for Including Eastern Europe and Russia in NATO.

Record, "Revising U.S. Military Strategy: Tailoring Means to Ends," Washington, 1984; Z. Brzezinski, "Game Plan: How to Conduct the U.S.-Soviet Contest," Boston, 1986, pp. 181-195. 11. K.

The new function of integrating Central and East European countries does not necessarily mean that the NATO bloc should abandon its more traditional functions. Several publications suggest merging its old and new tasks, thereby ensuring needed succession and gradual evolution. Thus, the report of the American Center for Negotiations in the Sphere of National Security, prepared jointly with the French Institute of International Relations, formulates eight NATO tasks in the transitional period: 1) Continuation of American leadership and American political presence on the continent; 2) Providing security guarantees for countries of Central and Eastern Europe; 3) Discussion of nonmilitary problems of transatlantic relations; 4) Securing a place for united Germany in the system of Western democracies; 5) Maintaining an "insurance mechanism" in case of a rebirth of Russian expansionism; 6) Maintaining an infrastructure to support operations outside the area of NATO responsibility, for example, the Middle East; 7) Development of instruments to prevent nuclear catastrophes and minimize their consequences; 8) Formation of forces which could be used in multilateral peacekeeping operations.--European Security and the U.S. Role: 1990s and Beyond. 13.

Virtually the only effective measure undertaken by NATO in the Yugoslav conflict was implementation of the Security Council mandate to set up a naval blockade of Serbia and Montenegro. See W. Drozdiar, "NATO Agrees To Impose Blockade of Serbia," THE WASHINGTON POST, 19 Nov 92.
