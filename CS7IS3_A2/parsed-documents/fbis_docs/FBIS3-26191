Ossetia Conflicts OW0302204494 Beijing XINHUA in English 1934 GMT 3 Feb 94 OW0302204494 Beijing XINHUA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Moscow, February 3 (XINHUA) -- Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze said on Thursday that his country is eager to settle its conflicts with breakaway Abkhazia and South Ossetia, according to reports reaching here. Speaking at a joint news conference in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, together with visiting Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Shevardnadze said, "a favorable influence of Russia" will enable Georgians "to resolve these problems very soon." He described Georgia's conflicts with Abkhazia and South Ossetia as "most acute and most complicated," noting the Caucasian nation is interested "in the settlement more than anyone else because the country is now on the verge of hunger and poverty." At the news conference, Yeltsin said, "Russia is proceeding from the need to respect Georgia's territorial integrity while fully honoring the interests of Abkhazia and South Ossetia." "Russia is for the full-scale settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian and Georgian-Ossetian conflicts by peaceful political means, as well as for the mutually acceptable solution of the problems relating to their state and political systems," the Russian president added. Abkhazia, an autonomous republic of Georgia, declared its independence in July 1992, while South Ossetia, an autonomous region of the former Soviet republic, did that in November 1991. As concerns the Russian troops deployed in Georgia, Shevardnadze told reporters that the two sides signed a protocol on Thursday morning to set up a working group to study thoroughly all aspects of the stationing of Russian troops in the former Soviet republic. According to Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev who is accompanying Yeltsin during the Georgian trip, both sides have reached agreement to create three military bases for Russian servicemen in Georgia. The news conference followed a signing ceremony, in which leaders of the two nations signed 25 documents including the treaty of friendship, good-neighborly relations and cooperation. Praising the treaty, Yeltsin said it laid down a "firm framework" for relations between Russia and Georgia. Shevardnadze stressed that the treaty will "facilitate the strengthening of cooperation not only between our countries but among all members of the commonwealth of the independent states as a whole." Yeltsin, who held a face-to-face summit talks with Shevardnadze right after his arrival and a welcoming ceremony, is scheduled to return to Moscow late Thursday evening. Their talks and their ministers' negotiations held at the same time resulted in the package of accords on bilateral cooperation in the political, economic and military spheres.
