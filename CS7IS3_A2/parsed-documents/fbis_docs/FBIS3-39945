It is no coincidence that he was born in Salonika, the capital of Greek Macedonia, and was minister for Northern Greece in the eighties. EUROPEO asked him his opinion of Italy's recent initiative for the recognition of Macedonia. "It is a serious mistake. A move that cannot be considered an expression of the solidarity that should exist between two member states of the European Union. And I do not think that it favors your country's real interests." [Lyghounis] Are you referring to another boycott of our spaghetti, as happened before, three years ago? [Papathemelis] The Greek Government does not encourage such initiatives. But we cannot prevent the people's reactions from influencing trends in consumption. [Lyghounis] What is your grievance with Italy? [Papathemelis] Its failure to understand that the key to everything lies in the name, "Macedonia." The population of Skopje are Slavic and have every right to give themselves a name that relates to their own history. But they cannot appropriate a name that has belonged to the Greek region of Salonika for thousands of years. Especially since the place name, Macedonia, was adopted by Stalin and Tito for the Skopje region with the clear intention of destabilizing Greece! As a politician, I think that vital interests of the Greek people are in jeopardy. [Lyghounis] And as a Macedonian? [Papathemelis] I feel insulted. This, because Skopje's official ideology is irredentist: They are supposedly the "free Macedonians" who have territory and enslaved brothers in Greece. That must be liberated as soon as possible. How can we accept this? And how can Italy recognize a government that has such an ideology?
