Assistant Commissioner David Hodson, the Deputy Director (Crime), said yesterday it was clear that tough new laws were needed. Latest international intelligence showed that organised crime might seek to use Hong Kong as a base for arranging deals to buy weapons of mass destruction, especially in relation to targeting nuclear storage depots in the former Soviet Union. He said the territory was vulnerable to profits from nuclear arms sales being laundered locally, if it had not already taken place. Mr Hodson also lamented the failure of local legislation to fight money laundering. "It is an example of a maximum problem scenario," he said on the risk of nuclear infiltration. "We have to be prepared for the worst -- and hope for the best. "We have got to keep up with the times. We need to be able to make sure we can keep these people from abusing our financial laws, to stop organised crime from using this place as a scene for financing this sort of activity. And, of course, laundering the proceeds of this activity." In the United States, FBI director Louis Freeh and the CIA head, James Woolsey, have repeatedly voiced their concern about the threat of organised crime hoarding stockpiles of nuclear material capable of being used in terrorism. The problem stems from the collapse of security in the former Soviet bloc and the formidable strength of Russian organised crime. The German Federal Police -- the Bunderskriminal -- last year reported 243 "incidents" involving breaches of security with nuclear-related material. In April, Mr Woolsey told a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Russian crime was "actively involved" in the "illegal transport and sale" of nuclear weapons. He said the CIA paid "particular attention to the potential illegal sale of fissionable nuclear material". "We've not seen significant quantities of weapons grade materials or any other nuclear warheads smuggled out," he said. "But there have been... reports of thefts of low grade nuclear materials. In many cases the thieves or smugglers have been apprehended." Mr Hodson said U.S. authorities rated Hong Kong-based organised crime as one of the most significant threats to their national security. He added it was unthinkable that Asian criminals would not try to become involved in nuclear transactions. Mr Hodson said Hong Kong maintained "unimpressive" laundering laws and had "hardly an impressive record" in seizing the proceeds of crime. This made the territory ripe for brokering sophisticated criminal enterprise. He said it was disheartening that no one had been convicted of laundering. "We have to play our part. I think we have got to learn lessons from other countries. "We have got to recognise that organised crime, in its many forms, is a very different animal now than what it was 20 to 25 years ago." When asked of the threat of nuclear deals being organised from Hong Kong, he replied: "I think it important that we take reasonable, rational measures to protect ourselves from it. "I am saying these are the concerns expressed by highly respected leaders. "Traditionally, police have investigated crime after it occurred but we can no longer afford to take this sort of approach -- we must go after it. "When you have strong organised crime, you have something that is an ongoing activity. "You become aware of the people involved in this kind of activity. But it requires a different approach -- a different style. "It is also international in nature and we have to look at things occasionally from the viewpoint that it is essential we play our part on the international scene." Mr Hodson's comments highlight the concern felt by police . It also marks the depth to which morale has slipped in senior ranks over the failure for 23 months of the Legislative Council to pass the Organised and Serious Crimes Bill.
