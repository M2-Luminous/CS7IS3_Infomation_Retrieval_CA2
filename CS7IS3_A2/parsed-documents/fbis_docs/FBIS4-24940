The activist wrote to the ministry of civil affairs to formally register the group, which already has 167 members in several provinces, the friend, a lawyer, said by telephone. His application, he said, was filed Saturday -- the fifth anniversary of the crushing of the pro-democracy movement in 1989. It was the second such protest to mark the crackdown, which according to official count claimed 300 lives. Human rights organisations and independent observers say the true toll was several thousand, and estimate that several hundred demonstrators remain behind bars. In Beijing, a dissident teacher, Ding Zilin, and her husband began a 48-hour hunger strike on Thursday to protest at weeks-long police harassment. The couple's 17-year-old son was killed in 1989. Bao, 31, has been under round-the-clock police surveillance since early May. At least five other dissidents have been detained by the Shanghai authorities, and they, like Bao, have had their phones cut off. Police have thrown a security net around Beijing, especially in Tiananmen Square and the university district, which was a hotbed of unrest in 1989, in order to forestall any show of discontent on the anniversary. Prominent dissidents in the capital who have not been rounded up have been told to leave the city until the anniversary is over.
