Meanwhile, Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj Muhammad, the official spokesman for the government delegation to the peace negotiations, has revealed that some elements of the so-called national democratic alliance have arrived in Nairobi with the aim of aborting the IGADD initiative. During a press conference he held yesterday he said he had apprised the Kenyan authorities of this negative development, saying that the members of the alliance, who represent the opposition parties, aimed at bringing about the overthrow of the government and wanted to exploit the issue of the south to bring their ambitions to realization, while the issue of peace in Sudan was of no concern to them. His excellency appealed to the Kenyan Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the current peace efforts did not fail and that the solution should be purely an African one. His excellency said that the members of the alliance who had arrived in Nairobi were Mubarak al-Fadil al-Mahdi, 'Abd al-Rahman Ahmad Sa'id and al-Harith Idris. Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj Hassan said the government delegation did not object to their presence provided they did so as part of the delegation of the rebel movement. Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj said the entry of foreign quarters or of a foreign dimension had always been at the root of failure to arrive at an agreement with the rebel movement. His excellency appealed to John Garang to throw off foreign hegemony. He said the purpose of his convening a press conference was to inform the outside world of the facts of what was happening and to confirm the eagerness of the government delegation that the negotiations should succeed.
