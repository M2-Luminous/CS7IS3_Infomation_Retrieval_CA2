FBIS4-58418 "drnes086dd_94004" FBIS-NES-94-086 Daily Report 3 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Ghawshah Denies Agreements Between Hamas, Fatah Ghawshah Denies Agreements Between Hamas, Fatah PM0305151694 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Arabic 3 May 94 pp1, 4 PM0305151694 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Arabic BFN [Report by Mufid 'Awwad: "Ghawshah Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: No Agreements Between Hamas and Fatah; We Are Facing Pressures in Jordan and Britain"] [Text] Amman -- Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), has accused Fatah and Yasir 'Arafat's leadership in Tunis of "launching a misleading information campaign about political dialogues between the two movements with the aim of peddling the autonomy agreement." He denied any agreements or meetings with Fatah other than the field agreement in the occupied Gaza Strip to prevent any tension between the Fatah Hawks and and the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions. Ghawshah reaffirmed Hamas' rejection of autonomy and refusal to participate in the elections but emphasized that it is very much opposed to any Palestinian infighting. He denied the arrest of any of its members in Jordan but admitted that the movement is facing pressures in the Jordanian, British, and American arenas. This was in an interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, the first by Ghawshah or any Hamas official for over two weeks since they stopped making statements after the pressures which followed recent operations in the occupied territory. On the claims about a meeting between Hamas and Fatah in Cairo under the auspices of the Muslim Brotherhood there, he said that these were fabricated, unfounded reports and that the field meetings held in Rafah were for the purpose of tackling the issue of mutual kidnapping by the military organizations of the two movements to prevent the recurrence of such incidents and prevent any provocations or clashes. He added that, as a result of that and following the large-scale arrest by Israel of Hamas members -- reaching 3,000 -- after the 'Afula and al-Khudayrah operations, and following the pressure brought to bear on Hamas in several areas, especially in Jordan, the PLO's leadership, Yasir 'Arafat's leadership in Tunis, through its information organs, tried to spread these reports about political dialogues and claims that Hamas wants a place in the autonomy authority. He said that Hamas has stopped its political dialogues with 'Arafat and the PLO leadership since 13 September 1993 when the Oslo agreement was signed. He revealed that Hamas rejected Arab mediation for the revival of dialogue between Hamas and 'Arafat and his leadership. He reaffirmed that that is still the Hamas position on that issue. The Hamas spokesman urged the Palestinian police to play a patriotic role by defending the Palestinian people against the aggression of Israeli soldiers and settlers. He also said that the release of the Palestinian detainees from enemy prisons is a sensitive matter. He warned that the release of 5,000 supporters of the Oslo agreement and the failure to release 5,000 Hamas supporters and opponents of the agreement would cause a major crack in the Palestinian society. He rejected ideological discrimination as a basis for the release of prisoners because that would be blackmail. He drew attention to the "cunning Israeli link between the release of detainees and full amnesty for those who collaborate with Israel." He said that "the traitors must be punished." Ghawshah said that his movement will maintain its information activity in Jordan on the grounds that Hamas' role [there] is informational and political and has nothing to do with the jihad military operations in Palestine because such operations are fully planned and carried out internally. He said that the role of the symbols and spokesmen of Hamas is to express daily political and informational positions within the current laws of any state they may be in.
