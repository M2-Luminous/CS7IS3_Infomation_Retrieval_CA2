FR940803-0-00031 FR940803-0-00012 After careful review of all available information, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed. The FAA estimates that 118 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 1 workhour per airplane to incorporate the charts into the AFM/POH. Since an owner/operator who holds a private pilot's certificate as authorized by sections 43.7 and 43.11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 43.7 and 43.11) can accomplish this action, the only cost impact upon the public is the time it takes to incorporate these charts. In addition, this action requires the same thing as AD 91&hyph;20&hyph;14, which is replaced by this action. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. Section 39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing AD 91&hyph;20&hyph;14, Amendment 39&hyph;8168 (January 30, 1992, 57 FR 3516), and by adding a new airworthiness directive to read as follows: 91&hyph;20&hyph;14R1␣Beech Aircraft Corporation: Amendment 39&hyph;8992; Docket No. 91&hyph;CE&hyph;76&hyph;AD; Revises AD 91&hyph;20&hyph;14, Amendment 39&hyph;8168. Applicability: The following model and serial number airplanes, certificated in any category: ␣ 1Model 1Serial Nos. B300 FL&hyph;1 through FL&hyph;110 B300C FM&hyph;1 through FM&hyph;8 Compliance: Required within 10 hours time-in-service after February 20, 1992 (the effective date of AD 91&hyph;20&hyph;14), unless already accomplished. To ensure that the affected airplanes achieve required minimum takeoff and climb performance for each approved combination of takeoff configuration, weight, pressure altitude, and temperature, accomplish the following: (a) Incorporate the takeoff and climb performance charts, B2 revision, part number (P/N) 130&hyph;590031&hyph;1, dated September 1991, into the Model B300 and B300C Pilot's Operating Handbook and FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM/POH). Note 1: The charts sent in the priority letter AD 91&hyph;20&hyph;14 package and B2 revision, P/N 130&hyph;590031&hyph;1, dated September 1991, are the same. (b) Incorporating the climb and takeoff charts as required by this AD may be performed by the owner/operator holding at least a private pilot certificate as authorized by Section 43.7 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 43.7), and must be entered into the aircraft records showing compliance with this AD in accordance with Section 43.11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 43.11).
