According to local authorities, this decision was adopted because on 10 and 11 February several groups of people -- less than 100 in all -- approached the office with the intention of entering the office. These people said they heard U.S. radio stations broadcasting to Cuba report that U.S. visas were going to be issued to everyone who wanted to travel to the United States and that the protection to diplomatic installations would be lifted [que retiraria la proteccion de las instalaciones diplomaticas]. Regarding these rumors, PRENSA LATINA has learned that an official of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana has officially stated to a Cuban Foreign Ministry representative that such reports are completely false. An official communique issued by the diplomatic office today said the office will continue to operate normally and that only people with previous appointments will be interviewed. The situation around the office was quiet this afternoon.
