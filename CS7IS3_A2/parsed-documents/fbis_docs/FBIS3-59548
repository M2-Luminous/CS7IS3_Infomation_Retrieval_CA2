The small car prototypes of Mercedes and BMW stole the Frankfurt Show. But the vehicles were not created with the economic recession in mind, nor to exploit a market segment that generates more volume than profit margins. Upcoming administrative deadlines simply leave the automakers with no other strategic choice if they want to continue selling their traditional top-of-the-line models. The Clean Air Act stipulates that, beginning 1 January, 1998, two percent of all cars sold in California be "zero emission" vehicles -- in other words, electric cars. And electric cars mean small cars confined by their limited range to the city. Besides zero emission, there will be an ultra-low-emission category which European standards will adopt in 2000. Small motors will make it easier to meet stepped-up restrictions on the carbon oxide, unburned hydrocarbon, and nitrogen oxide content of exhaust. Indeed, over equal distances, small engines emit smaller quantities of gas than bigger ones. This reduction in the cubic capacity of engines is another argument in favor of small cars. Finally, by 2005 the EC would like to mandate average fuel consumption for each automaker's line of 5 liters or less per 100 km. "Pushing down" the average will require both small cars and diesel engines, which consume 25 percent less fuel for the same use as gas engines. Consumption is defined as the mathematical average, dubbed Euromix, of three standardized measures: consumption at a steady speed of 90 km/h, at a constant speed of 120 km/h, and for a typical city run. The current European average, all makes combined, is 7.05 liters/100 km. Renault and Peugeot SA (6.54 and 6.37 l/100 km respectively) do not have as far to go as BMW or Mercedes (9.18 and 8.65 l/100 km) to meet the 2005 requirements. Moreover, Mercedes's greater use of diesel engines gives it an advantage over BMW. Of the two prototypes presented, Mercedes's Vision A is obviously the more innovative in terms of design. A comparison with Renault's Twingo highlights the distance between an ideal, but realistic, project, and an admittedly unusual car whose commercial viability will depend on coming to terms with industrial and commercial realities. Both models favor a minivan shape, wheels that have been moved out to the four corners of the body, and the simplest possible overhangs for the best tradeoff between footprint and spaciousness. Both offer an attractive rear-seat adjustment feature: The back seat on the Twingo can be moved forward or backward 17 cm, compared to 10 cm on the Vision A, depending on whether more trunk or back room is needed. The seat folds up or can be half removed in both models, transforming them from sedans into a small station wagons. The Mercedes's wheel base is a little shorter (-3.7 cm), as is its total body length (-8.3 cm), yet it still offers a more spacious interior similar to that of the new Class C! To achieve this roominess, Mercedes is innovating by shifting a front engine under the passengers' feet, as on some Japanese commercial vehicles and minivans (Toyota Previa and Nissan Serena). That is what makes the Vision A so clever: a rigorously flat floor supported by two straight, parallel sills is "sandwiched" between occupants and the car's mechanical components. The 60-degree-angle engines, the gearbox, and the fuel tank are below; the interior is above. The immediate consequence is that the Vision A is very high -- 15 cm higher than the Twingo! Those who have already driven four-wheel drives in the city have had the chance to appreciate this "above-the-crowd" lookout, which has its charms. The Vision A's added height optimizes its functionality, albeit at the expense of aerodynamics, which can be sacrificed in a car designed to travel at generally low speeds. Nonetheless, at 120 km/h, Mercedes claims its car consumes 5.2 l/100 km, against 7.0 l/100 for the Twingo, despite the latter's smaller front surface. Here again, however, a distinction must be made between the ideal and reality. The only thing the two cars' gas engines have in common is their cubic capacity (1.2 liters) and power (55 hp). In contrast, the Vision A's three-cylinder is experimental, while Twingo's engine was simply borrowed from Renault's components bank -- it is taken from the 1960's R8 Major -- and adapted to reflect today's tastes at least cost. In addition, the sandwich structure of the Mercedes model offers a substantial safety advantage. In case of a head-on collision, the engine snaps off from its anchor points and slides under the floor, where it cannot force its way up into the interior. The nose can then function fully as an energy absorber, buckling or changing shape as planned. Side impacts affect the very tough sills -- which are underneath the occupants -- instead of the doors. Here again, there is much less risk of components jutting into the interior. The Vision A's final trump is a volume that makes it easier to lay out mechanical components. Every millimeter of space under the Twingo's hood has been used; its structure could not accomodate a diesel engine and there is no place for a conventional automatic tranmission. In contrast, the Vision A's electric model has room to house the nickel sodium chloride battery that supplies the 54-hp induction engine (120 km/h peak speed and 150 km of autonomy in the city), the electronic control module, and the bulky cooling equipment in a well-protected area. It is even possible to envision the use of a hybrid propulsion system, including thermal turbine, buffer battery, and electric motor. Moreover, thermal versions (gas or diesel fuel combined with a continuous variation transmission) of the Vision A still have some room left to stow baggage under the floor. For now, the least realistic features of the Vision A are its structure and its aluminum body. Mercedes estimates a weight gain of 70 kg over conventional steel structures. The entire prototype weighs 75 kg less than a Twingo, despite more elaborate equipment that includes airbags, power (electrical) steering, ABS (antislip brake control system), air-conditioning, and an on-board navigational system. Unlike its rival Audi, which has promised to bring out series aluminum cars in the near future, Mercedes admits that the industrial use of aluminum is not feasible. That being the case, the fuel consumption profile of a marketable Vision A would be less spectacular than the 3.8 l per 100 km claimed for the direct-injection turbo diesel prototype. Nonetheless, the "small" Mercedes offered for sale around 1996 cannot differ too substantially from the Vision A without losing luster. For reasons of prestige, the automaker must apply its innovations, without trying to compete with the 55,000 French franc [Fr] Twingo. However, the Fr123,000 sticker price of the Clio Baccara proves that, even for small cars, there is a demand for top-of-the-line models. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Troubling Analogies Between Prototypes and Commercialized Models | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Twingo |Gas Vision A |Diesel Vision A | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Engine (cylinders)|4 |3 |3 direct inj./tur-| | | | |bo | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cubic capacity |1,239 cubic cm |1,199 cc |1,199 cc | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Valves/cylinders |2 |3 |4 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Power (hp - rev/m-|55 - 5,300 |55 - 5,500 |44 - 4,000 | |in) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Transmission |AV/5-speed gear |AV/cont. autom. |AV cont. autom. | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Front suspension |McPherson |McPherson |McPherson | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rear suspension |torsion axle |torsion axle |torsion axle | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Wheel base |234 cm |231 cm |231 cm | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lock diameter |965 cm |950 cm |950 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Length |343 cm |335 cm |335 cm | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Width |163 cm |166 cm |166 cm | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Height |142 cm |157 cm |157 cm | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Weight |790 kg |715 kg |735 kg | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Payload |385 kg |400 kg |400 kg | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Maximum speed |150 km/h |150 km/h |150 km/h | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Time to accelerat-|14 s |14 s |12 s | |e from 0 to 100 k-| | | | |m/h | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Consumption at 90 |5.1 l |3.7 l |3.1 l | |km/h | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Consumption at 120|7.0 l |5.2 l |4.5 l | | km/h | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |In-city consumpti-|7.4 1 |6.0 l |3.9 l | |on | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Average consumpti-|6.5 l |4.9 l |3.8 l | |on | | | | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
