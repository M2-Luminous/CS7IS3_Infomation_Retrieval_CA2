FR940912-2-00129 FR940912-2-00090 [Release No. 34&hyph;34639; File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;34] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., Relating to Fees for the Late Payment of Service Charges September 2, 1994. I. Introduction On May 27, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to adopt a uniform and consistent methodology for assessing fees for late payment of Nasdaq Stock Market service charges. On July 29, 1994, the NASD filed with the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. 3 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). 3 Amendment No. 1 to the proposal corrects a mathematical error in an example provided in the language of the proposed rule change, and explains that the new late fee established by the proposal will be assessed to accounts that are in arrears prior to the implementation of the new late fee charge. Letter from Joan Conley, Corporate Secretary, NASD, to Elizabeth MacGregor, Branch Chief, Commission, dated July 28, 1994. The proposed rule change, as amended, was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34479 (August 2, 1994), 59 FR 40632 (August 9, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. II. Description of the Proposal The NASD proposal amends Part IX of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws to establish a uniform and consistent methodology for assessing fees for the late payment of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (``NSM'') charges. The late fee will be applied to all charges imposed by NSM that are past due 45 days or more. The late fee will be computed by taking the summation of one and one-half percent (11/2%) of the amount past due for the first month, plus one and one-half percent (11/2%) of the amount past due for any month thereafter, compounded by late fees assessed for previous months. For example, if an account is past due $1,000 for 45 days, the late fee would be $30.22. This charge reflects a charge of $15 for the first month past due ($1,000 × 11/2%) and $15.22 for the second month past due ($1,015 × 11/2%). The new late fee structure will replace the existing structure (found in section H of Part IX of Schedule D to the By-Laws) which provides that charges for Nasdaq Level 1 and Nasdaq/NMS Last Sale services which are past due 45 days will be assessed a fee equal to 11/2% per months of the unpaid balance. For all other Nasdaq charges, namely, charges for the Nasdaq Level 2/3 service, Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (``OTCBB''), Mutual Fund Quotation Program, and Nasdaq Workstation service (collectively referred to hereinafter as ``Nasdaq charges''), the late payment fee presently is equal to 10% of the amount past due for 60 days or more. By eliminating the current practice of using these two different methods to assess late fees for various NSM charges, the NASD believes its operational efficiency will be enhanced and public confusion concerning the NASD's late fee policy likely will be diminished. The proposal also will amend Section H of Part IX of Schedule D to the By-Laws to provide that the section governs fees for the late payment of NSM charges instead of ``NASDAQ charges.'' This amendment reflects the merger, effective June 30, 1993, of two of the NASD's corporate subsidiaries, Nasdaq, Inc. and NASD Market Services, Inc. (``MSI'') into one consolidated subsidiary called The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. In addition, this amendment serves to subject charges for services provided by MSI (the NSM after the merger) to late payment fees ( e.g. , SOES, SelectNet, and ACT charges). Currently, other than for Nasdaq/NMS Last Sale service charges, there is no fee for the alter payment of service charges that previously were assessed by MSI but now are assessed by the NSM after the merger. III. Commission's Findings The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 15A(b)(5) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(5) requires that the rules of a national securities association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any facility or system which the association operates or controls. Specifically, by instituting a uniform and consistent policy for assessing fees for the late payment of service charges, to be imposed as described above, the Commission believes the late payment of fees is reasonable and equitably allocated. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 4 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;34) is approved. 4 15 U.S.C. §78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 5 5 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;4(a)(12) (1991). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
