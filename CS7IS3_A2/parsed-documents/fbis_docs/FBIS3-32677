The widow, who appeared on television for the first time since her husband's death, said the family's economic situation is precarious and has become even more difficult without Crescencio Diaz' support. Blanca Molina de Diaz and her three children, two of whom are permanently disabled by disease, no longer have the financial and moral support of the head of the family, Diaz, who was murdered while working as a bodyguard for U.S. Major Mike Lopez. This crime has left a mark of deep uncertainty on the survivors. [Begin Molina recording] My husband supported my three children and me. Now we have been left with no support. Who will help us? We have no one to ask for help. My husband was our only support. [end recording] Molina has appealed to the U.S. Embassy for help. [Begin recording] [Molina] I have received nothing except a bouquet of flowers and condolences. [Reporter] Will you request the Embassy's assistance? [Molina] Yes. [end recording] There is no law that could force the U.S. Embassy to compensate the survivors because Diaz worked for a private enterprise under contract with the embassy. The murdered man's brother has said that aid for this home, which has been virtually decapitated, is urgent. [Begin recording] Two of the children are disabled. One of them suffers from mental disorders, and the other is crippled. [end recording] The only assistance the family could get is from the Social Security Fund, which provides a very small amount to the widow for her minor children. No one knows for how long that aid will last.
