Expressing the hope that the Serbs will understand this warning and withdraw from the areas surrounding the city, Cetin said: If they do not withdraw, it is certain that the operations will continue. In a statement to TRT, Cetin recalled that since the onset of Serbian attacks around Gorazde, Turkey has advocated adopting measures. Turkey wanted NATO to take action against Gorazde, which was declared a secure area by the United Nations, just like in Sarajevo, Cetin remarked. He added: It was, however, the United Nations that was supposed to decide and make a request on this subject. Cetin recounted that following the UN Secretary General's assessment yesterday, the United Nations applied to NATO and asked for a limited operation around Gorazde. He continued: Within the framework of a previously adopted decision on the matter, NATO was ready to undertake this operation. It made a decision quickly and conducted an air operation against certain military targets around Gorazde. This is an important warning. The Serbs should understand this. The Serbs must cease being a country that disrupts peace in front of the whole world and that continues attacks. I hope they will heed this warning and immediately withdraw from positions they are occupying around Gorazde. Otherwise, it is certain that the operations will continue.
