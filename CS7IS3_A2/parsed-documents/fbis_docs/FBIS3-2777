The talks proceeded in a "candid and business-like" atmosphere, sources from the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. In the talks, Qian noted that the meeting between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Seattle last November marked a new phase of development in bilateral relations. Since then, a momentum for improving bilateral ties has emerged, with contacts increasing and cooperation expanding. Over a month ago, Qian recalled, he and Christopher met in Paris and discussed every aspect of the bilateral ties, with both sides expressing the wish for improving bilateral relations with joint efforts. "We hope that your current visit would achieve positive results," Qian told Christopher. However, "we are deeply disappointed at things which have happened prior to the visit of the secretary of state," Qian said. A top U.S. Government official came to prepare for Christopher's visit, and in disregard of Chinese laws, the official took actions interfering in China's internal affairs, he said. Following that, the U.S. media made a fanfare of the event and U.S. Government officials time and again attacked China. All those acts clearly go against President Clinton's statement in Seattle that the U.S. supports a strong, stable, and prosperous China, Qian said, adding that it also constitutes a harrassment to the current visit by the secretary of state. Qian stressed that dialogue needs a good atmosphere and sincerity from both sides. "I hope to conduct dialogue with the secretay of state on the basis of candidness and mutual respect" so as to enhance mutual understanding, reduce troubles, avoid confrontation and make the dialogue conducive to the improvement of the Sino-U.S. relations and to the success of Christopher's visit, Qian said. Christopher elaborated to the Chinese side issues of U.S. concern. Qian responded that China is a country ruled by law. "We can only do what Chinese laws allow us to do," Qian said. Qian also elaborated what the Chinese side is concerned about, such as U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and the sanctions it has posed against China. On Sino-U.S. cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking, Qian noted that the two sides have signed a memorandum on jointly fighting against drug trafficking. He said that in January 1990, a U.S. court, in disregard of China's judicial sovereignty, granted political asylum to Wang Zongxiao, a criminal of the goldfish case, who had gone to the U.S. for the purpose of testifying. This has imposed an obstruction to Sino-U.S. cooperation against drug trafficking, Qian said. Discussing the most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status, Qian pointed out that MFN is a reciprocal and mutually beneficial arrangement reached according to the bilateral trade agreement. It is the basis of normal Sino-U.S. trade relations and the disruption of it would ruin the prospects of Sino-U.S. trade relations, Qian said. "This would bring harm to both China and the United States," Qian noted. He reiterated, "The Chinese side is firmly opposed to any linkage between trade and issues that have nothing to do with trade." Christopher said that both the United States and China are countries that bear global responsibilities. Both sides share common interests in maintaining peace and security and have identical or similar views concerning many regional and international issues, he said. He said the mutually beneficial trade relations are expanding, which is contributing to the prosperity of both countries. Christopher reiterated that a strong, stable and prosperous China conforms to the interests of the United States. President Clinton hopes that more constructive relations would be developed between the U.S. and China, Christopher told Qian. Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei and Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Xu Huizi attended the talks. On the U.S. side are Ambassador Stapleton Roy, Undersecretary of State for International Security Affairs Lynn Davis and Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner participated in the 130-minute talks. Following the talks, Qian hosted a luncheon in honor of the U.S. visitors.
