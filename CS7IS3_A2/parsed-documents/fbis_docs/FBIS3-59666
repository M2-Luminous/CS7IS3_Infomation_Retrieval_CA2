(The discussion group was held at 3-6-32 Nakanoshima, Kita-ku, Osaka-shi. Kensaku Imaichi, Professor Emeritus at Osaka University and President of Osaka Hoki Seisakujo was the delegate. Tel: 06-443-4640.) In order to respond with concrete technical support, a subcommittee was established by industry, academia, and government, to exchange technical know-how such as patents held by member companies, between companies, the collection and publication of the seeds and needs were undertaken. The objective is to open the door to small and medium-sized businesses in joint ventures between industry and academia that overemphasize large companies and to support improvements in their technologies. Exchanging Technical Know-How The joint industry-academia subcommittee established at the forum examines the best ways to solve the various technical problems presented by committee members and advises the requesting company about solutions. Yoshio Miyoshi, assistant professor of machinery and materials at Osaka University, was placed in charge of a committee discussion group consisting of five professors from universities in Kansai and experts in measurement control, image processing, and manufacturing processes. Already the results of automatically measuring fish kept for food used by breeders have been presented. When a solution was found, payment for the success, such as research assistance funds, is paid to the professor in charge. Furthermore, a publications and information subcommittee was newly established. It is to link the seeds information of companies that would like to spread technology by selling it to the needs information of companies interested in becoming active in those technologies. Specifically, the seeds and needs, product introductions, and technical information of each company will be collected in an organizational publication and presented to committee members twice a year. Information related to seeds and needs is received regularly by the business office on printed forms. Information from companies other than committee members is handled in the same manner. Urgent information is presented to associated committee members in a timely fashion. The forum began as a subordinate organization of the Kansai chapter of The Japanese Society of Mechanical Engineers. It is composed of the management organizations of leading companies, small and medium-sized businesses, and public research organizations, professors from the universities, about 80 businesses, and individuals.
