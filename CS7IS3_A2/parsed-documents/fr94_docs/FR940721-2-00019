FR940721-2-00019 FR940721-2-00015 The international community has long recognized that the characteristics of warships pose special problems for strict compliance with MARPOL 73/78, which reasonably focuses on civilian vessels which are far more prevalent than warships on the world's oceans. Article 3 of MARPOL 73/78 recognizes the special nature of warships by exempting them from strict compliance with the provisions of the Convention. It provides that the Convention: [S]hall not apply to any warship, naval auxiliary or other ship *␣*␣*. Each Party shall ensure by the adoption of measures not impairing the operational capabilities of such ships *␣*␣* that such ships act in a manner consistent, so far as is reasonable and practicable. For U.S. public vessels, implementation of MARPOL 73/78 generally preserves the sovereign immunity of warships and public vessels, excluding them from strict application of the standards but requiring the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations ensuring ``so far as is reasonable and practicable without impairing the operations or operational capabilities'' of the ships that they act ``in a manner consistent with the MARPOL Protocol.'' See 33 U.S.C. 1902(b) and (d). As required by MARPOL 73/78 and APPS, 33 U.S.C. 1901 et seq. , the Navy has prescribed discharge limits and operational practices for Navy ships that are at least as protective as those required under MARPOL 73/78 under most circumstances. Under the MPPRCA, however, Navy ships were required to come into full compliance with the requirements of Annex V of MARPOL 73/78. Under the MPPRCA, the Navy was to come into full compliance with Annex V to MARPOL 73/78 by January 1, 1994 or to notify Congress if it was unable to comply. Navy Compliance Efforts Since the early 1980's, the Navy has been developing technological means to eliminate or mitigate discharge of solid waste from its ships. Through a combination of material substitution, source reduction and management practices, for example, the discharge of plastic waste was cut by over 70 percent. The Navy also pursued development of other technology to help manage solid waste at sea. By 1993, the Navy had installed equipment and imposed procedures to fully comply with MARPOL restrictions on non-plastic waste everywhere but in special areas, and had achieved an estimated 70 percent compliance with restrictions on plastic waste. In addition, the Navy developed new technology that, when finally procured and installed, will allow Navy surface ships to come into full compliance with restrictions on discharge of plastic waste. Concurrent with the technical studies, the Navy engaged numerous stakeholders in a dialogue in which the Keystone Center acted as a facilitator. The stakeholders included Federal and state agencies, Congressional staff, and environmental groups. The dialogue allowed the Navy to provide information to the participants about the special problems it faces in continuing military operations on the world's oceans while still complying with restrictions on the discharge of solid waste. The Navy was also better able to understand the concerns and interests of the representative stakeholders on the subject. The Navy reported its efforts at managing shipboard solid waste in ``U.S. Navy Compliance with the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987'' (June 1993). Congress responded by extending the original deadlines in the MPPRCA. As required by section 1003(a) of the DAA&hyph;94, surface ships must eliminate all discharges of plastics by December 31, 1998 and must comply with limits on discharges of other solid waste in special areas that are ``in effect'' by December 31, 2000. Submarines must comply with both requirements by December 31, 2008. Plan for Compliance in Special Areas
