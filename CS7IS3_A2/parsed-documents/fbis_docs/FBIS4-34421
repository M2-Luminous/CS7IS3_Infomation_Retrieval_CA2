The senator said his Radical Cause Party has come into possession of information regarding the plot and the involvement of several active and retired officers, generals, and admirals. Muller Rojas underscored that the coupists have held several meetings abroad, particularly in Aruba. "During a meeting with Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom, I gave him this information and told him it might be worth his while to examine the flight plans maintained at the control towers of La Carlota and other airports for information concerning active officers' trips to Aruba on private flights." Muller Rojas said that his disclosures are intended as a warning to Venezuelan society to reject the coup and especially to career officers, who should adopt measures to prevent another coup, which would be harmful to the Armed Forces and the country. Muller reiterated that the government should intensify its investigation and reveal the plot, which poses a serious threat to public peace considering the country's current situation. Muller Rojas said that approximately eight days ago he saw Vice Admiral Munoz Leon at the Tamanaco hotel, where the plotters had held a meeting. He said that although he has no proof, there is well-founded evidence that implicates the conspirators.
