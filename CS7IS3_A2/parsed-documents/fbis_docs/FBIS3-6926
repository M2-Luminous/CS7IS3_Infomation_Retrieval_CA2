Korean Workers' Struggle for Right to Existence Supported" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- The spring action of workers for a wage hike in South Korea is a just struggle for the elementary right to existence, says MINJU CHOSON in a commentary today. Noting that workers employed by comprador businesses in Seoul, Pusan and other areas are waging a struggle, shouting such slogans as "The Authorities' Wage-Curbing Policy Is a Policy Killing Workers" and "Increase Wages", the news analyst says: Their demand for a higher wage is a demand for a reward for their labour and for the right and conditions for a life befitting humanity. Nevertheless, the Kim Yong-sam clique is trying to pacify the workers in their just struggle to be paid for their labour, urging them to "share hardships" and "restrain their demand," while insulting their struggle as "collective egoism" and an "illegal act" and, furthermore, blackmailing them by invoking the fascist "emergency arbitration power", which had not been used even in the "Fifth and Sixth Republics", threatening "a tough countermeasure". But no suppression can block the workers' struggle. The South Korean workers have no more room to step backward from the present life of barest subsistence.
