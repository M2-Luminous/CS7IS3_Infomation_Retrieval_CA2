Speaking in Moscow, he said his decision came after the Council had pushed through new articles to the budget relating to government spending on the armed forces. Article 32 now provides for an extra budgetary fund of support to the army to be raised as part of government revenues from privatization. The resources are to be channelled to provide social security nets to the servicemen including housing construction and conversion of defense-related industries. One other article binds the government to bring down the cost of this year's defense spending by offering contracts to men and non-commissioned officers and hiring officers in reserve, reducing the number of military schools and disbanding understaffed contingents. The budget now provides for 40.6 trillion rubles of defense spending in 1994. However, the Council did not adopt any resolution on Shumeyko's report about FC's role and place in overcoming critical trends in the country. The question will be discussed as the Council meets again next month.
