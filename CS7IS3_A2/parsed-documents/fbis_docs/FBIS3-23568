It is noteworthy that about half here are young officers. And no matter how the fate of these troops unfolds, they are always waiting for young people here and counting on them. Our correspondent talks with Lieutenant-General Ilya Grigoryevich Panin about how to become an officer in the glorious Strategic Missile Troops. [Dolinin] Ilya Grigoryevich, have the conditions for acceptance into missile schools changed in 1994? [Panin] There are no big differences from past years. The schools are open to all Russians. Civilian young people are accepted between the ages of 17 and 21 (as of the year of admission), and for compulsory-service servicemen and those discharged into the reserve the age limit is 23 years. Documents are submitted through military commissariats, military units, or directly to the chief of the military educational institution [VUZ]. Entrance examinations for general education disciplines and psychological screening are conducted from the end of June. There are correspondence and classroom preparatory courses at each of the schools; it is not too late to apply for them now. Olympiads and "open houses" are held for applicants. At the Rostov Higher Military Command and Engineering School of the Missile Troops, for example, a state military-technical lyceum is run, most graduates of which are enrolled in this school. Every applicant is tested for physical training (7-11 pull-ups on a horizontal bar, a 100-meter run, a 3000-meter cross-country run, 100-meter swim). As experience shows, this poses no special difficulty for most applicants. Tests are taken on general education disciplines: Mathematics (written), physics, Russian language, and literature (dictation or exposition). [Dolinin] What is new in the system of training officer personnel? [Panin] New? A lot! First of all, the higher military school reform has begun to produce its first fruits. The list of officer training specialties and specializations has been updated. It has resulted in similar civilian lists adopted in the Russian Federation. In accordance with the Law on Military Obligation and Military Service, VUZ officer candidates have concluded contracts. This gave them a considerable monetary raise. Compare: Before signing a contract, 1st and 2nd year officer candidates receive up to 24,000 rubles [R] monthly, and upon reaching 18 years of age and concluding a contract, they receive more than R100,000! The appointment pay for lower-echelon commanders and those rated excellent in studies has been increased. But this is a concern about officer candidates from the material standpoint. It is also manifested in another way--the quality of their engineering and military training is increasing. Naturally, requirements are also increasing. Today we regard officer candidates as future professionals, on whom the defensive capability of Russia and its allies will largely depend. [Dolinin] Could you go into more detail about updating the list of specialties for which future officers are being trained? [Panin] Officer are trained for 73 specialties and specializations at RVSN higher military educational institutions. Many of them are one of a kind and are unique to Russia. For example, beginning this year, graduates will receive diplomas for the following specialties: State and regional administration; engineer protection of the environment; geophysical methods of search and surveying; laser systems; automated information processing and control systems; robots and robotics... What is especially important is that out of all the diversity of the specialties, there is not a single one which would not find application in various sectors of the economy, science, and production. All officer candidates are on familiar terms with computers. At our VUZes, officer candidates are given the opportunity to receive two or more specialties and defend two diplomas right away. One can master the program of instruction in 4 years instead of 5. The best graduates have an opportunity to go on to graduate work, which our educational institution has. It would be an aspiration. [Dolinin] Ilya Grigoryevich, future applicants are interested in finding out if there is a chance graduates might end up without a job given the objective reduction of the Missile Troops? [Panin] In accordance with the SOA-1 and SOA-2 [Strategic Offensive Arms] treaties, the strength of the grouping is indeed being reduced. But officers will always be needed in the troops, especially in primary positions. Last year's graduates have been fully placed and are conscientiously performing their military duty. The Missile Troops are the youngest branch of the armed forces, and all paths are open to young people here.
