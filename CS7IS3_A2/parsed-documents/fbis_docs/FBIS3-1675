Statistics from the customs department show that last year China's exports of electronics products reached 8.11 billion U.S. dollars, up 18.1 percent from the previous year; foreign-funded electronics enterprises gained an export income of 4.43 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 54.6 percent of the total export value of electronics products. In the past few years, the Chinese Government has been paying special attention to the electronics industry, and defined it as the state's pillar industry for key development. Early last year the State Council re-established the Ministry of the Electronics Industry to reinforce the administration and management of the industry. Statistics show that last year the national electronics industry finished a total output value of 175 billion yuan, constituting some 5.2 percent of the country's total industrial output value. Of the industry's 40 kinds of major products, 32 had big increases in output, which included ground stations for satellite communications, program-controlled switching, micro-computers, telephones and videorecorders. Experts from the electronics sphere said the country's electronics industry is now facing new development opportunities, for which the reasons are: The state is accelerating the construction of economic information systems to improve and reinforce macro-control means; various industries are showing great enthusiasm in using electronic information technology to remold traditional industries; the demand by national economy and social life for various electronic products has kept on increasing, which provides a broad market for the industry; many foreign companies have expressed interest in the Chinese market, and the industry has met with an unprecedented boom in foreign cooperation. To speed up the readjustment of industrial and product structure, the ministry has defined nearly 20 key construction and technological remolding projects, including integrated circuits, mobile telecommunications, facsimile equipment, new-type program-controlled phone exchanges, and the second-phase project of video recorder and video camera.
