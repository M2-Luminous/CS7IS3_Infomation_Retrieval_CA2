YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported that this year's Team Spirit exercise will be sharply reduced in its scope compared to last year, but that it will be faced with a more tense situation due to North Korea's nuclear issue. YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported that the ROK and the United States decided that 40,000 troops -- one-third of last year's 120,000 troops that were fully mobilized for the exercise -- will take part in this year's exercise. It also reported that the two countries are examining the possibility of not deploying combat forces from the U.S. continent, but holding the exercise with the U.S. troops stationed in the ROK and the ROK Armed Forces. However, THE WASHINGTON POST reported that the U.S. Defense Department is preparing for the possible order to deploy to the ROK approximately 1,000 U.S. soldiers on active duty and reserve forces by 22 February for the possible holding of the Team Spirit exercise. YOMIURI SHIMBUN added that the ROK and the United States decided that they will stop the exercise if North Korea expresses its will to accept nuclear inspections even if the Team Spirit exercise has begun.
