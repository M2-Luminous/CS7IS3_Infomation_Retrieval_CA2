More importantly, so does the reality of the relentless and tireless struggle of the Palestinian people to achieve the Palestinian interpretation of the Declaration of Principles agreement so as to open the road to a Palestinian state. It is out of the question for the negotiating teams to bargain away Palestinian rights. If anything, the negotiators are being firm and steadfast. This explains why the talks are proceeding by fits and starts and failing to reach workable solutions. This is because the Palestinian negotiating team is refusing to meet the Israeli negotiators' terms and sticking to its interpretation of the declaration of principles. Had the Palestinian negotiators been compromising and yielding to the terms and dictates of the Israeli negotiators, the knot would have long been untied and the talks would have proceeded smoothly, without experiencing these numerous interruptions. Had the Palestinian interlocutors been compromising, the negotiations would not have been so tough. It is then high time some people reconsidered their stands and thought long and hard about the supreme national interests of the Palestinian people and looked at the Palestinian negotiators' national struggle in perspective -- the struggle that aims at laying the first bricks in the structure of the Palestinian state. It is time some people reconsidered their position and viewed things from the perspective of Palestinian interests and objectives and their ambitions to lead a free, dignified, and independent existence. It is high time they reconsidered their position and understood that talking to the Israelis puts an end neither to the conflict nor to history. Talking is a form of the conflict that we must adopt and then take whatever responsibilities this option entails. At some point down the road, negotiations are the right course of action. Hopefully, some Palestinians will grasp this truth and adapt to changing times and the circumstances of the Palestinian national struggle. Hopefully, more Palestinians will come to grasp this truth and so contribute to a more cohesive Palestinian front. We will work to achieve that goal, since it is the only guarantee for our people to advance their objectives and their yearnings for the inevitable freedom and independence.
