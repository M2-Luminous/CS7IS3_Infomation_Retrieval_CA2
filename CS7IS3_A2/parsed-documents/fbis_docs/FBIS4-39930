"There are sufficient grounds for this success, because Russia and Cyprus are linked by good relations from time immemorial. We have a common culture and we worship the same religion. The peoples of our two countries are cooperating fruitfully in the economic sphere". "I wish to note especially my talks with Andrey Kozyrev, which were marked by an atmosphere of complete mutual understanding," the minister stressed. "The Russian side has displayed not only its understanding of the Cyprus problem, but also readiness to help resolve it in every possible way. It is also pertinent to note that Russia is behind two out of the five versions for settling the Cyprus problem, included in the report of the U.N. secretary- general. All this gives food for satisfaction and we hope that a correct way was found to settle the Cyprus problem." "Problems linked with the expansion of Russo-Cyprus economic relations were also thoroughly discussed in Moscow. For instance, we examined the possibility of implementing an inter-governmental agreement, which envisages the participation of Cyprus in the development of one of the Black Sea regions of Russia, mainly the Krasnodar territory. I have visited that region and it produced a very good impression on me. I think that our cooperation with the Krasnodar territory will be mutually profitable and successful." "To put it in a nutshell," Mikhailidhis noted, "new broad vistas for deepening multilateral cooperation are now opening up before our two nations."
