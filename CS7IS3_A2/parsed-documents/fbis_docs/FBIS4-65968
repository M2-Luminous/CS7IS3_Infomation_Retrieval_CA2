Cetin departed for Paris to attend the opening conference of the European Stability Pact. In a predeparture news conference at Ankara's Esenboga Airport, Cetin answered a question on the report by UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. He said: The report has not yet been published. Actually, publishing a report when talks are continuing may harm the negotiations. For this reason, the report should be published after the talks end. In answer to another question, Cetin reiterated that President Rauf Denktas will go to Turkey over the weekend and meet with President Suleyman Demirel.
