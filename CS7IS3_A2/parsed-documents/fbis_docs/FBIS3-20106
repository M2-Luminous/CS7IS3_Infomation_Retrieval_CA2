The officials, who spoke after Tapie's stunning victory Sunday in a local election with 67.88 percent of the vote, did not reveal the exact charges, but said examining magistrate Pierre Philippon discretely indicted Tapie on March 10. It was Tapie's third indictment. Officials at the public prosecutor's office said Philippon was probing alleged "forgery and embezzlement" in the club's accounts after then Justice Minister Michel Vauzelle in 1992 ordered an investigation into nine French clubs, including Marseille. Tapie, 50, was charged last month with bribery and interfering with witnesses involved in attempts to pay three Valenciennes players to throw a game against Marseille last May 20. On December 22, he was charged with embezzlement at Bethune, northern France, in a case involving the Testut weighing machine firm in his business empire. Tapie, urban affairs minister in the socialist government ousted last month, swept to victory in a former communist-held constituency over far-right National Front candidate Marie-Claude Rossignol. She received 32.13 percent of the vote. Tapie, who is also Marseille MP for the Radical Left, an ally of the Socialist Party, said after the first round of voting on March 20 that he was now aiming for the mayoralty of France's third largest city in municipal elections in 1995. He also plans to head the Radical Left list in the European elections in June. Earlier this month, Tapie reached an accord with the state-owned loss-making Credit Lyonnais bank to write off his debts and to sell off all his business interests in his empire, Bernard Tapie-France, with a mortgage on his personal fortune. The risk for the bank could be up to 500 million francs (84.8 million dollars). Right-wing MP Philippe de Villiers called for an inquiry into the debt write-off. Before the Valenciennes scandal, Marseille won the French championship for the fifth consecutive year and on May 26 its fortunes were at their zenith when Marseille beat A.C. Milan to win the European Cup, becoming the first French club to do so. On September 6, football's governing body in Europe, UEFA, barred Marseille from the European Cup.
