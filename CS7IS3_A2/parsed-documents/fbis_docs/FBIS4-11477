The crisis has emerged at a time when the CUT is negotiating with the government a 15 percent basic salary readjustment that would raise that salary to 52,000 pesos ($103 approximately), and could lead to a union division. CUT Vice President Antonio Martinez, a Socialist, reiterated today his accusations against the Communist union leaders, whom he accused of promoting an internal crisis. Martinez said that the Communists can leave the CUT if they don't feel loyalty and respect for the organization, which is the only central federation in the country with a membership of 500,000 workers -- that is, 10 percent of the work force. The Communist leaders, who represent about 90,000 militants, rejected in the special congress the incorporation of the CUT into the ICFTUO, which is of social democratic trend. Meanwhile, the environment for celebrating labor day on 1 May appears cloudy, and union leaders are not discarding the possibility of disturbances occurring during the main ceremony, which is held every year but this time will not be attended by President Eduardo Frei.
