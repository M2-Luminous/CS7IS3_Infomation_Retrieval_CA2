Although he has said farewell to arms, he affirmed that he was not surrendering. "We are beginning another revolution in the streets, joining the people. There was nothing left to do in the mountains," he explained. Accompanied by 100 men who have laid down their weapons and are now seeking power through peaceful means, Commander Ruperto noted that he was hopeful the people will support the Red Flag's political program. That organization tried to gauge its strength in the past presidential elections by endorsing the candidacy of Gabriel Puerta Aponte of the Popular Democratic Movement, but the group's participation did not win it any elected office. Ahead lies the arduous work of overcoming that defeat, winning the support of the people, and facing the big party machines in an area the group does not control and which it is entering without significant changes in its language, which remains orthodox. The guerrilla represents a superseded phase that kept activists apart from "the masses," Commander Ruperto acknowledged. The guerrilla chief does not deny that the leader of the Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro, financed the Venezuelan guerrillas, at least during its most active years. "We did receive economic assistance when we were MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left], but that has not been the case for many years. At any rate, we are deeply grateful for that aid. The Front took its name from Americo Silva, a guerrilla killed in Guayana in 1971 in a clash with the National Guard. Its operations center was in Anzoategui and Sucre States. Another member of the group is well-known Commander Gabriel Puerta Aponte, who has a long history of armed struggle. It is he who influenced the group's decision to demobilize the armed Red Flag groups and engage in political activities in the streets. Commander Ruperto said the decision to abandon the armed struggle was made in response to the different political conditions under the President Rafael Caldera administration. The guerrilla leader, who said he spent his life fighting, reading, and preaching a revolution during his 32 years in the mountains, notes that with President Caldera, the pioneer of the peace policy of the 1970's, there is a new political picture. As an example he mentioned President Caldera's dismissal of charges against the officers who participated in the two coup attempts. Commander Ruperto confessed that he did not experience any culture shock upon returning to the city because for the past few years he maintained occasional contact with it, even though he rigorously observed security precautions and took special care to conceal his true identity. The man, who claims to have experience in this type of thing, founded along with Americo Silva (1965) the first Red Flag guerrilla front in Maturin. He has five children, some of whom inherited his ideas but not his fighting style. He left his wife for the guerrillas but admits that a man and a woman need each other in more ways than one. It was for women that he occasionally abandoned his hideouts. He said he is a human being no different from the rest. "I left the mountains on many occasions because of the women, but I found my true passion in the mountains," says this peasant, who does not think he wasted his time by dedicating three decades to the armed struggle. Commander Ruperto readily admits that "the people no longer want guerrilla actions or military coups." The Red Flag leader now says that "the people are mobilizing themselves in the streets in defense of their rights and to confront the vast array of socioeconomic problems resulting from the crisis. The struggle is being waged in the cities, not in the mountains." The old guerrilla leader asks: How are we going to do it if we want the people to know about the political program we offer the country? He asks: Are we going to achieve that goal by continuing the armed struggle in the isolated mountains with no access to the people? We will now take to the streets. We are going to come into contact with the people and explain this program of change. Our goal is to convince the people to adopt our program. Ruben Gonzalez, another member of the Americo Silva Guerrilla Front, admits that their efforts never achieved a national character but said he is pleased with the work done by the peasants and workers of Anzoategui and Sucre States. "We are demobilizing because the people are demanding deep changes," he said. "Caldera came to power as an expression of a desire for change and thanks to the unity of the people who demanded change." Gonzalez claims that the "Caracazo" [violent looting and disturbances in February 1989 after President Carlos Andres Perez decreed stringent economic measures] and the two coup attempts in which Red Flag activists participated are the result of a desire for change in the country. "We came to make our contribution toward change," he said. "We could not have achieved that with our weapons in the mountains." The commander explained that "revolutionaries do not choose their system of struggle; it is determined by the country's political situation." The demobilized guerrilla commanders are talking about the need to convene a constituent assembly to implement the unpostponable reforms the people hope for. They favor a judicial branch that can effectively fight corruption. They condemn the successive frauds such as those at Recadi [Differential Exchange System] and Banco Latino. Even though they say that the armed struggle has not been entirely ruled out, they claim to have joined the project for peaceful change and ask President Rafael Caldera's administration to promote and convene a constituent assembly. These men, who were demobilized only three days ago in a ceremony attended by Sucre Governor Ramon Martinez, church authorities, and congressmen, demand that the government draft a policy of social justice, economic development, and democratization of society. The Red Flag leaders deny they have any responsibility for a plan to disrupt public order and claim that the student demonstrations shaking Caracas are an expression of the "people's just struggle." "They are typical expressions of the revolutionary movement in which we live, characterized by the impoverishment of the lower classes and by the impunity enjoyed by corrupt officials," they said. The demobilized guerrillas maintain that the organizations fighting for change in the country cannot remain isolated from one another. "Circumstances demand that we join the struggle spontaneously begun by the Venezuelan people," they said. Commanders Ruperto and Gonzalez made a call on other political forces (Third Path, Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement, and so on) to join the civic, peaceful, and democratic struggle. "No one wants violence any more," they said.
