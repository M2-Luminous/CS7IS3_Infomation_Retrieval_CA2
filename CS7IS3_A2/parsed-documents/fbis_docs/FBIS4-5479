Building the law-governed state of Vietnam that of the people, by the people, and for the people. What are the characteristics of the law-governed state of Vietnam? It is the state of the people, by the people, and for the people in which all aspects of social life are governed by the law. This will lead our country to progress in accordance with the socialist orientation. The law-governed state of Vietnam is established on the basis of strengthening and expanding the all-people's great unity bloc comprising workers, peasants, and the intellectuals under the party leadership. In format, the law-governed state upholds the law and respects the three branches of power namely legislative, executive, and administrative powers, which is similar to the bourgeoisie law-governed state. We also study and apply some rational aspects of the bourgeoisie law-governed state. However, the characteristics of our law-governed state are different from the bourgeoisie law-governed state. As far as the nature of class is concerned, our state is established on the basis of the working class as symbolized by the leadership of the party, the vanguard unit of the working class. The party formulates lines and policies, and leads political organizations to implement them. Because our law-governed state is established on this basis, it has unique characteristics of a state that is of people, by the people, and for the people, resting on the worker-peasant-intellectual alliance. The state serves the interest of the laboring people and the nation, while the bourgeoisie law- governed state naturally protects capitalism and serves the interests of the bourgeoisie class. It cannot represent the interests of the working class and the laboring people. Our state upholds the law and manages all social activities through the law. The characteristics of our laws are different from those of bourgeoisie laws. Our laws are aimed at developing our nation in accordance with the socialist orientation, while the laws of the bourgeoisie state are aimed at protecting capitalism.
