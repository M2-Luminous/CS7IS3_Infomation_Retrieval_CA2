Harut'yunyan''] [Excerpts] On 21 August a conference dealing with drug addiction and combating alcoholism was held at the offices of Vice President Gagik Harut'yunyan of the Republic of Armenia, attended by the following: Republic of Armenia Minister of State Armen Ghazaryan; Karapet Rhubinyan, head of the oversight agency under the President of the Republic of Armenia; Avet Grigoryan, member of the Supreme Council's Permanent Commission on Health and Social Issues; plus all ministry and agency representatives whose work deals with these fundamental issues. In his opening statements the vice president noted that much effort is being expended on this problem, which is of serious magnitude. Of great concern is the fact that at the present time drug abuse is spreading rapidly, particularly among students. According to a public-opinion survey, 83.7 percent of those polled consider this to be a very serious problem. Fifty-four percent responded in the affirmative to the question ``Are there any drug abusers among those people with whom you associate?'' ``This meeting should not be the last one to address this issue,'' said Mr. Harut'yunyan. ``It is essential to carry out fundamental and consistent work efforts.'' The participants in the conference presented their views on the subject. Republic of Armenia Minister of Health Ara Babloyan stated that last year his ministry had submitted to the government a number of proposals aimed at resolving these fundamental issues. Serious work continues to be carried out jointly with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Justice. The conviction was expressed that an individual agency working separately cannot achieve results. Mr. Babloyan stated, ``There is a need for a systematized plan, implementation of which calls for the creation of a special commission (taking international experience into account) under the president, vice president or prime minister. The ministries of health, justice, internal affairs, education, and social services, the public prosecutor's office, as well as public organizations and organizations dealing with the dissemination of information must be involved in these projects.'' The minister went on to state that as of 1 January 1993 there were 1,113 registered drug addicts, 796 of whom were enrolled in a medical help program. Drug addict figures break down as follows: 0.01 percent are 18 years of age or younger; 50 percent are between 19 and 30; 31 percent are from 31 to 40 years of age; 14.5 percent are between 41 and 50; and the remainder are over 50. Forty-seven percent of the total are blue-collar workers, 10 percent are white-collar workers, and 3 percent are students. At the present time there is a 150-bed drug addiction treatment center in Yerevan. There is a similar 50-bed facility in Gyumri, plus 47 offices in various rayons and cities in this republic. Much attention is being devoted to the question of drugs produced in this republic as well as drugs brought in from elsewhere. Mr. Baboyan noted that this issue was seriously addressed at a recent meeting held with Minister of State A. Ghazaryan. A decision was made to hold a special conference dealing with the issue of habit-forming drugs and narcotic substances. Sergey Aslanyan, chief of the of the Ministry of Internal Affairs directorate which deals with drug trafficking and combating drug abuse, discussed the work being done by his directorate and its results. He particularly stressed Operation Poppy-93, in the course of which a large quantity of narcotic substances was discovered and seized. He noted that the Ministry of Internal Affairs considers it essential to pass a new law, which should specify a number of important provisions: drug addiction must be differentiated from drug trafficking, and Article 44 of the Code of Administrative Violations must be revised. Mr. Aslanyan also stressed the importance of establishing a special coordinating commission. Artavazd Gevorgyan, chief public prosecutor of the Republic of Armenia, noted that certain groups are engaged in drug trafficking for purposes of financial gain. Judicial practice in the past has been quite severe in this regard. ``At the present time we must apply existing laws, and therefore we must first of all uncover these criminal enterprises,'' said Mr. Gevorgyan. In 1992, for example, 162 crimes were reported but, according to the prosecutor, ``who knows what percentage this represents of total crimes--probably a very small percentage.'' One hundred eighty four crimes have been reported during the first seven months of this year. Mr. Gevorgyan is convinced that these numbers will grow unless all of us concentrate our attention on this area of criminal activity. It was reported that all rayon and city prosecutors have received instructions to cooperate with and assist the 4th Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Hayk Harut'yunyan, chief of the State National Security Directorate of the 3rd Main Directorate, stated that his directorate works in the area of identifying and neutralizing groups involved in drug trafficking. They consider it essential to close down those routes by which narcotic substances are being brought into this republic. An extremely important element here is the problem of ``open borders.'' The State National Security Directorate considers it essential to draw up and enter into a bilateral agreement dealing with drug trafficking and, together with counterpart agencies in other interested countries, to establish a permanent body which would exercise oversight, as well as to establish a data bank. It is considered to be of utmost importance to provide weapons and equipment to agencies combating drug trafficking and drug addiction.... [Paragraph omitted] In conclusion, Republic of Armenia Vice-President Gagik Harut'yunyan noted that the campaign against drug addiction and drug trafficking in this republic will in fact assume new forms and new attributes. We shall find ourselves in a grave situation if we continue to proceed as before, if under conditions whereby changes have taken place around us we fail to have at our disposal a comprehensive system. Of serious concern is the fact that at the present time an organized campaign is not being developing and that we are short of equipment. Mr. Harut'yunyan commented that it is impossible to solve the problem through punishment alone and by merely taking administrative actions. He stressed the importance of national dignity, the factor of education of youth, and of effective publicity. ``There are at least two things which should not exist: begging and drug addiction,'' said the vice-president. ``Perhaps these two are not comparable to one another, but both are alien to our national character.'' It is absolutely essential to eradicate the causes of this evil. For this reason the establishment of a substantial, well-designed program is considered a prerequisite. It is very important that each and every citizen realize that he cannot stay outside this campaign. Widespread publicity is essential: the people must understand the enormous danger presented by drug addiction and drug trafficking. Mr. Harut'yunyan stated that 52 percent of those polled gave an affirmative reply to the following sociologically-oriented question: ``Are you concerned that a child or relative of yours is a drug user?'' Mr. Harut'yunyan noted that, unfortunately, drug abuse is widespread in the schools: not as regards level of drug addiction, but rather the fact that a large number of young people are trying drugs. The situation has become calamitous at higher educational institutions: a large number of students not only try drugs but develop a need for them. ``At the most highly-disciplined higher educational institutions, even drug abuse is of a widespread nature,'' said the vice-president. ``The fact is that we do not have working mechanisms within the educational system.'' A situation of inertia continues in the field of medicine, involving narrower and more costly means of combating drugs. At this point Mr. Harut'yunyan stressed the importance of differentiating drug addicts from those involved in drug trafficking, whereby the former, who are sick, must be given an opportunity to become cured, while the latter must be severely punished. ``We should not allow the problem of drug addiction and drug trafficking to develop into a full-blown drug mafia, for otherwise we shall not be able to root out this phenomenon,'' said the vice-president. Gagik Harut'yunyan then proposed that all submitted suggestions and questions formulated at the conference be reviewed and further developed. Within one week's time they should be submitted to the President's staff, in the process of which all suggestions and proposals should be systematized and computerized through the efforts of government and the president's staff; he proposed that Vice-President of the Republic of Armenia G. Harut'yunyan, Minister of State of the Republic of Armenia A. Ghazaryan, and K. Rhubinyan, head of the oversight agency under the president of the Republic of Armenia, be tasked with summarizing all suggestions and proposals and submitting them at the next meeting, which would take place in two weeks time....
