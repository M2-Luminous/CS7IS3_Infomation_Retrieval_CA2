The adjustments in long-term capital investment are basically a reaction to the excessive expansion during the Heisei boom. Japan needs to establish a forward looking investment strategy and not wallow in needless pessimism. 2. We are at the point where as a whole we can finally forecast a bottoming out in fiscal 1994 with capital investment in electrical equipment leading the way cyclically and with a partial spilling over into other investment categories. 3. It will be necessary to address structural reform in order to sustain a recovery. To that end, it would be effective to create new demand for products by restructuring capital and businesses, by converting import categories, and by innovation. The Extended Slump Is in Reaction to Rapid Expansion After private sector capital investment started downward in fiscal 1992, the decrease accelerated sharply in fiscal 1993 and is forecast to remain negative during fiscal 1994 as well. Should the decreases continue for three successive years, this would be the first time since the end of World War II. There are some who view this long-term slump in capital investment as a structural decrease caused by the bursting of the bubble and connect it to a still longer-term bottoming out; however, such a view is overly pessimistic. Capital investment depends on forecasting business results and expected earnings which affect the future of private sector companies. If such a future is unclear, the willingness to invest atrophies and economic vitality is lost. In order to avoid excessive decreases, it will be necessary to analyze the reasons for the current slump in capital investment, decide on a recovery scenario, and then examine the conditions necessary for a sustained recovery. The reason for the extended drop in capital spending is that basically there has been an unusually sharp response to the Heisei boom. During the Heisei boom there initially was a policy of low interest rates together with a growth in demand for all business categories: 1) the construction of office buildings which accompanied the centralization of finance in Tokyo; 2) an increase in consumer demand reflecting the advantages of the high yen and the efficacy of capital; 3) increased investment in housing accompanying the low interest rates; 4) deregulation (information, communications, finance, insurance, retailing, etc.); 5) technological innovations in microelectronics, new materials, and biotechnology; and 6) major construction projects. However, there is a point of fundamental difference between the Heisei boom and preceding periods of high growth. During preceding periods, while industrialization in heavy chemicals moved forward through technological leadership, population shifting from the agricultural to the urban sector promoted investment in the urban infrastructure and created a demand for durable consumer goods such as symbolized by the "three sacred appliances [television, refrigerator, and washmachine]." The growth in domestic demand on a large scale was, in a manner of speaking, structural. This kind of growth in structural domestic demand was not a significant element in the Heisei boom. Aside from the technological innovation and deregulation, such growth was transient. Moreover, with the focus for a time on demand growth in the form of full employee participation, companies confronted restrictions on supply and demand. In particular, in looking at the trends in supply and demand within the construction industry, we find these pressures continuing from about 1988 through 1990, exceeding those of the construction boom which started in the Japanese archipelago during the 1970's. This was absolutely unprecedented. As evident typically in office buildings, we find that because construction starts lagged, construction already started continued even when demand softened, with an enormous reaction. That the current slump which has dragged on this far is basically a reaction to the reckless expansion that took place during the Heisei boom. Or, to phrase it in different terms, it is unnecessary to be excessively pessimistic about the future. There Are Signs That Electrical Equipment Will Lead the Recovery According to a survey of major company capital investment done by the Japan Development Bank (February 1994), signs pointing to a recovery were already showing up in the second half of fiscal 1993. Investments which will generate fresh demand are being made in semiconductors, liquid crystals, new pharmaceuticals, laser disks, and medical equipment. Among these, the largest capital investments are being made in semiconductors. When we measure the differences in capital investment by business category over the past 10 years, one can point to electrical equipment, which includes semiconductors, as leading all other business categories in making changes. The category leads general machinery and chemicals by six months. The reasons appears to be the short three-to-four-year silicon cycle, the fierce domestic and foreign competition, and that the industry is able to make subtle changes in response to shifts in domestic demand. We can ascertain through statistical testing (the Granger Test) that there is a definite correlation between investment in electronics equipment and investment in chemicals, general machinery, and precision machinery. We see this in steppers and inspection equipment in the general and precision machinery categories as well as in the gases used during the diffusion process to manufacture semiconductors and the epoxies supplied by the chemical industry. Although we could hypothesize that the recent trend is like past patterns, this time we also have liquid crystal displays, which makes the electronic equipment lead all the more striking. In addition to these trends among major companies, a similar survey of leading companies done by the Japan Development Bank and a short-term economic survey of small and mid-sized companies throughout Japan done by the Bank of Japan, which looked at various correction patterns of the past, trends in land investments (a deductible category), and the movement of the leading indicators, estimate growth in GDP base capital investment fiscal year 1994. The surveys suggest that growth will remain negative this fiscal year but that bottom will be hit in the October-December quarter of calendar 1994 with an upturn coming in the January-March quarter of calendar 1995. Looking at this fiscal year cyclically, we see a bottoming out of capital investment centered in part on manufacturing. There is also an aspect to take note of. According to industry correlated tables from 1980 to 1992, electrical equipment had both high production superiority and high export competitiveness. As already discussed above, we can see the ripple effect of its lead on other industries, but the effect is not as great as it has been in the past with home electronics and appliances. Furthermore, in nonmanufacturing areas, which lagged about a year behind the manufacturing ones in reflecting negative earnings, there are areas that will need time to recover. Given this, with the expected recovery limping along, the potential is there for it to emerge as something small in scale. Consequently, whether or not the recovery becomes something sustained will have much to do with somehow creating fresh demand in a variety of areas. The recovery in semiconductors and liquid crystals has provided the United States an opportunity for a booming expansion by allowing it to take the lead in capital investment in machinery, including that revolving around Asia. With our domestic demand focused on multimedia, increasing development of innovations in information technology is definitely taking place. However, there is the concern that to the extent the recovery can provide the opportunity for exports, it will be tied to the high yen and the continued growth in the balance of payments. Therefore, even if new products are developed as in the past, it is clear in terms of economic scale that including the export market will be more effective than to restrict investment to the domestic market. In order to extricate ourselves from the current impasse, we must solve the dilemma of exports. The Investment Strategy Used in the Past Will Not Work If we analyze the balance between domestic savings and investment while paying heed to long-term shifts in the ratio of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to the balance of payments, we can see that the factor determining that shift is largely capital investment by private sector companies. On the other hand, if we look at this in terms imports versus exports, the shift in the balance is due to imports, not exports. Consequently, if it is important to reduce the surplus in the balance of payments, then the macroeconomic strategy necessary to maintain Japan's corporate vitality becomes something as follows. To wit, it will be important to shift the balance of payments downward by promoting aggressive overseas development, production, and importation in traditional areas where we have lost international competitiveness. We will need to create an environment in which we can fully realize those areas of research and development, capital investment, and export, where we are internationally competitive. Furthermore, capital investment over the mid-term will emerge through important and decisive resolution of corporate strategies. The business environment is transforming toward this. Until 1980's, networks among Japanese companies as well as internal company systems made possible extensive capital investment with minimal risk. On the other hand, with the macroeconomic prescription of a shift toward imports, the existence of this rigid system becomes an obstacle. Coming into the 1990's, U.S. companies that studied Japan's system have pushed forward with networking among companies in terms of the "design in" approach (cooperation among companies from the design stage) and innovative manufacturing processes which are bearing fruit in their recent capital investment boom. This indicates that Japanese companies have completely lost the relative superiority they held in the past. Given this situation, future corporate strategies in traditional areas will be something as follows: First, to effect innovations in organizational change in order to effect capital investment in intensive restructuring, more favorable distribution, and innovations of organization in order to deal with latent consumer and customer needs. Next, place emphasis on product development in order to create fresh demand, that is, to push forward with product innovation.
