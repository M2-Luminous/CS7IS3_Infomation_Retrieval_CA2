When we trace the problems which the new administration has to face, we realize the new administration's future is full of difficulties. Contradictions Have Erupted Simultaneously During the two-week period beginning 8 April, from when Prime Minister Hosokawa expressed his intention to resign to when Foreign Minister Hata was elected his successor, the coalition government opened itself to the public. Though we could imagine that the government was facing a complicated situation--as a result of confusion involving the national welfare tax and the movement to exclude Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura--we now realize the contradictions that were smoldering within the coalition government for the past eight months erupted simultaneously, ignited by the confusion created over the past two weeks as represented by the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] maneuver to bring former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Watanabe into their camp. The most serious contradiction is the ineradicable confrontation between Shinseito and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. As far as economic policy is concerned, the two parties are in complete disagreement about an increase in the consumption tax. To Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who advocates the consumption tax rate being raised to 10 percent, the SDPJ appears to be a snake in his bosom. At the beginning of April, the SDPJ's Research Commission on the Tax System announced its policy to allow an increase of the consumption tax. However, the leftwing group within the party and local organizations strongly opposed this policy, and as a result the move of the "compromising group" was weakened. With the start of the Hata administration close at hand, the coalition parties have agreed to express their policy "to aim at total tax reform centering on an increase in indirect taxes, including revision and abolition of the consumption tax." However, this agreement did not mean complete concession to Shinseito. There are still a number of ways to roll back Shinseito. For example, as it used to do in the past, the SDPJ may propose tax exemptions on foodstuffs and tax reductions on necessities. These proposals alone will be enough to bring about confusion in the discussions on tax reform. There are many disturbing factors contained in the coalition parties' discussions on tax reform. Needless to say, confusion will be created in discussing when and to what extent the consumption tax rate is to be increased. Besides, confusion will be created in discussing such matters as use of the increased portion of the consumption tax; introduction of consolidated taxation on acquired assets; introduction of a numbering system applicable to taxpayers; ways of dealing with the local consumption tax; and so on. Each of these disturbing factors cannot be removed, even if the coalition parties try to explain their consistency by using the words "policy agreement." On the other hand, the government has almost given its commitment to the United States that income tax reductions will be effected on a full scale, and that the basic plan for public investment in the amount of 430 trillion yen will be increased. Under the circumstances, it is necessary for the government to draw its conclusion in June, prior to the opening of the meeting of the heads of state and government of the G-7 major industrial nations. Since the days when the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] was in power, the consumption tax, administrative reform, and rationalization of finances have been regarded as inseparable problems. After failing to introduce general a consumption tax at the time of the Ohira cabinet, the government could introduce the consumption tax in 1989, supported by its policy "of realizing financial reconstruction without tax increases" and by the administrative reform carried out by the Nakasone cabinet. Of course, the coalition government is aware of this, and its recent policy agreement also refers to administrative reform and rationalization of finance. However, the new administration faces many difficulties. Administrative Reform Is Shopworn If Prime Minister Hosokawa had continued in power, he would have exerted himself in carrying out administrative reform. He himself assumed the post of head of the Administrative Reform Council's headquarters and framed the outline of administrative reforms aiming to remove 682 regulations and review 92 special corporations. The outline was about to be adopted at a cabinet meeting in the middle of February. Presently, the outline is lying on the shelf. The lack of a sense of crisis on the part of the bureaucracy is the best evidence that the outline is shopworn. The coalition parties have not yet definitely established their policy on how to deal with reform of the foodstuff control system which is considered the largest among the 682 items to be deregulated. With the "Heisei rice confusion" taking place, the argument that Japan should supply rice for itself is regaining influence among the people. Besides, with domestic rice being sold with imported rice, and with enforced pricing of imported rice which disregards the price differential between domestic and foreign rice, distrust of the foodstuff control system is spreading among the people. It is considered inevitable that a heated discussion involving both government and nongovernment parties will take place when the partial liberalization of rice is ratified at the national Diet. Rationalization of finances is also a difficult problem. The coalition government is considered a positive financial policy group in that it appeals more enthusiastically than any other government in the past to the "necessity of dealing with an aging society," and in that it is trying to improve both the social infrastructure and welfare. However, presently every cabinet member is considered to be merely trying to defend the interests of his ministry, and the coalition parties' Diet members are more conspicuously trying to induce interests to their constituencies than did the LDP's Diet members. Under such a situation, it is difficult to foresee to what extent the coalition government is going to thoroughly review the method of distribution of public projects. Budget Enactment Also a Difficult Problem We should not easily conclude that it is wrong to adopt a positive financial policy since the United States is requesting Japan expand its domestic demand, and since the Japanese economy, with the collapse of the bubble economy, has become more dependent on public expenditures. Enterprises are not likely to moderate their efforts for restructuring and for inventory cutbacks, even if their profit may be recovered to some extent. The shifting of production to foreign countries due to a strong yen is directly hitting local enterprises, thus making them more dependent on public projects. No evil influence has so far surfaced in the business condition due to the considerable delay in the budget debate. However, the budget debate should not be postponed for an unlimited period. It has already become difficult to carry out in advance the national projects for the first half of the current fiscal year; large projects also remain untouched. However, what is more important is to see the situation from a medium-range viewpoint. Formulating the budget bill for 1995 is to be started as soon as the 1994 budget is approved by the Diet. The basic figures in estimating the budget for the next fiscal year are not likely to be easily determined. If at the time of determining the basic figures, the pace of the business recovery is considered stable, then the government has to decide if it should follow the traditional pattern restricting government spending or if it should continue to increase its spending to avoid the shock that may be created by reduced expenditures. The government is required to make a severe choice. On one hand, the government should fear that enterprises might become physically weak, thus causing industries to leave the country. On the other hand, the government must face the problem of financial deficits and prevent the bubble economy from occurring again. Every determination is to be made by Prime Minister Hata. In any event, decisions should not be made by Ichiro Ozawa. The role of the prime minister is to make "decisions" and not coordinate or make preliminary consultations.
