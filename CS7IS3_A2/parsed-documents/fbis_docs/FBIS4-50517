According to statistics, 7 enterprises have newly experimented with the shareholding system, with the total number of experimental enterprises reaching 40, of which, 23 have experimented with the system of the limited liability stock company, 9 have experimented with the system of the limited liability corporation, and 8 have experimented with the system of the shareholding cooperative corporation. Meanwhile, a total of 813 enterprises have carried out the system of being owned by the state but operated by the people, a total of 25 enterprise groups have been organized, 305 corporations have been established as single entities, and 607 enterprises have been leased, sold, and merged to others or have gone bankrupt. According to a survey, the province's commercial reform has the following characteristics: First, the reform is diversified in forms. Various localities have suited their measures to local conditions rather than rigidly adhering to a certain form. Second, the reform has proceeded rapidly. In some localities, the number of enterprises carrying out the system of being owned by the state but operated by the people and the enterprises organized as corporations have approached or surpassed the targets approved by the province for the fiscal year. Third, the reform has yielded good results. Most of the enterprises carrying out the shareholding system have effected substantial increases in sales, profits, and tax payment. Most enterprises implementing the system of being owned by the state but operated by the people have effected a turn for the better in economic efficiency, and more than half of such enterprises have made their circulating assets withdrawn. At the same time, many good exemplary enterprises have come to the fore.
