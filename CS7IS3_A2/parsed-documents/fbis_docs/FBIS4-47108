Igonin: "We Are United by a Great Goal"] [Text] Our correspondent asked the heads of the communist party delegations two questions. FIRST: What are the primary objectives of the communists of your party? SECOND: What will it take to reestablish the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics? [R.G. Akhmedov (Azerbaijan)] 1. We are trying to build a strong organization under the conditions of a brutal dictatorship and to strengthen our influence in labor collectives, particularly among workers. In spite of G. Aliyev's declaration that he will not allow the resurgence of communist influence in Azerbaijan, we are gaining more prestige each day, and our organizations have been restored in almost all rayons, cities, neighborhoods, and enterprises. We are now publishing the GOLOS KOMMUNISTA news bulletin and have already submitted a registration application for the KOMMUNIST newspaper. 2. During the establishment of a new type of union, we must take the actual situation in each of the former republics of the USSR into account. After all, conditions in our republics differ widely, but there is also the main thing that unites us all: our desire for unity and for the restoration of Soviet rule and the socialist foundation. [S.G. Badalyan (Armenia)] 1. We want to remove the ruling elite from power (legally, I stress) and gradually emerge from the crisis. The Communist Party of Armenia is in favor of united action by the fraternal parties on an equitable basis, because we had already announced our autonomy as early as 1990, at the 29th Congress, and we have our own charter. This will not interfere, however, with our membership in the Union of Communist Parties. 2. We are in favor of the creation of a new single union of Soviet states, with a common economy, defense, transportation network, and energy supply and a coordinated foreign policy, but with the retention of sovereignty, although we know that we will have to give up part of it. In principle, we are in favor of the Leninist plan of confederation. There is another important consideration: The formation of the new union should be preceded by the retirement of Russia's present rulers. After all, Russia is the basis of the new union. [V.I. Novikov (Belorussia)] 1. Our main goal is to strengthen the party and enhance its prestige among the workers. To this end, we are gradually moving our organizational and propagandistic work directly into the labor collectives. The presidential election will be an important stage of our work. I am my party's candidate for this office. What are our chances? The polls indicate that they are not bad. In any case, we collected more than twice the necessary 1,000 votes for registration. We have a simple campaign slogan: We will return what the "reformers" took away from the people and reestablish the great nation of the Soviet Union. Local government elections and the reestablishment of the soviets will be the second stage of our work. This will be a serious test for the party. 2. All of the communist parties of the former union republics must surmount the discord in our ranks and unite their efforts in concrete action. This could include, for example, concerted effort by parliamentary factions. We can work with our supporters toward the denunciation of the Belovizh "accords" and arrange for referendums in our republics on the reestablishment of the USSR. According to various surveys, 86 percent of the population of Belorussia is in favor of a renewed Soviet Union. [I.G. Tsikhlauri (Georgia)] 1. We communists must inform the people of what is really going on in Georgia. Like the parties in other republics, our Communist Party was banned and we still have not reregistered. Our main goal today is the restoration of party structures: raykoms, gorkoms, and primary organizations, and we are succeeding in doing this. Another goal is successful participation in the upcoming elections, which will be fostered, we hope, by the recently revived KOMMUNIST newspaper. 2. We know, of course, that the reestablishment of the Soviet Union will be impossible without the communists of the former republics, but the ambitions of some leaders within the communist movement must be set aside and we must agree on united action. The reestablishment of the Soviet Union should be initiated, in my opinion, not by the center--not by Moscow or Russia--but by another former union republic. I think this will serve our cause better. [K.A. Azhibekova (Kirghizia)] 1. Our main short-term goals are the restoration of party structures and aggressive action to keep the "predatory privatizers" from robbing the people. Propagandists from the party are infiltrating enterprises (although this is not a simple matter) and explaining to the people there that only their active efforts can change things for the better. To tell the truth, however, the communists have won the strongest support in rural communities. Our raykoms there are operating more effectively. 2. The former union republics are still too divided. This means that we communists have to conduct painstaking work to sway public opinion in support of united effort to revitalize the USSR. [I.V. Lopatin (Latvia)] 1. We want to continue establishing the structures of the Union of Latvian Communists and hold the second republic conference of the ULC this summer. We want to expand the social base of our union, primarily by encouraging more workers to join. We want all residents of Latvia to join the struggle for the restoration of civil and political rights. We will continue our efforts to register the ULC with the Latvian Ministry of Justice. 2. In view of the present situation, Latvia's return to the future union could be accomplished gradually through economic alliances with other republics, participation in the union with the status of a confederate member, and membership in the federation. Obviously, the decision in all of these cases must be made by the residents (or citizens) of Latvia by means of a referendum. [Representative of Communist Party of Lithuania] 1. The ban on our Communist Party is recorded in the constitution. That is why we have to stay so far underground. What are we doing now? At this time we are restoring certain organizations, and their members are opening people's eyes to what is happening in Lithuania. This is producing results, although they are still not that impressive. In conversations (highly intimate ones between fewer than three individuals) people are increasingly likely to say: "They should give us back what we had in the USSR." 2. The unification of all of the communist parties of the former union republics in a single fist would give us strong leverage for the reestablishment of the USSR. After surmounting our differences, we must make every effort to unite in a single union of communist parties. [A.K. Negutsa (Moldavia)] 1. We hope to register before 1 August and then hold a congress of the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova in fall. Now we are reestablishing structures on the local level. 2. The rebirth of the union will necessarily require us to surmount the separation between the parties with communist aims. [G.A. Zyuganov (CPRF)] 1. We feel that our main present goal is concerted effort by leftist and patriotic forces and the coordination of our actions in the struggle against the anti-people regime. During this process, we must use legal parliamentary and extra-parliamentary methods. 2. The restoration of the USSR and the Soviet Government is the main purpose of CPRF activity and our highest priority. In the recently published policy-planning documents of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, we stated that "we are in favor of cooperation by communist parties active in the Russian Federation, on the condition of the acknowledgement of the need to reestablish the union state on a voluntary basis; the restoration of the soviet system of government...." [M.A. Rotko (Turkmenistan)] 1. We want to enhance the party's prestige among the workers, who have, we can report with pride, retained their respect for communists for the most part; preserve the Leninist creative legacy; lower the average age of party members and encourage VUZ instructors and students to join our ranks (which is already occurring); and acquire stronger influence at enterprises. 2. The reestablishment of the USSR should begin with the establishment of close economic ties between former union republics and the consolidation of friendship between our peoples. This will be followed by the political aspects of the process. [Sh.D. Shabdolov (Tajikistan)] 1. Our immediate objective is to attain power legally through parliamentary elections. Our chances are superb. Suffice it to say that we already have the largest faction in the present parliament--more than 40 percent of all the deputies. Our raykoms, gorkoms, and obkoms are active on the local level. The average age of our party members is around 40. We also have another goal: We want to win local elections. I think we will. 2. As for the reestablishment of the USSR, we have formed special councils on the rayon, municipal, oblast, and republic levels to unite the efforts of the workers for this purpose. People are attracted to us and are pinning their hopes on the communists. [A.I. Martynyuk (Ukraine)] 1. The presidential elections and the election campaigns for the Supreme Council in 112 districts will be held soon. We are getting ready for them. Another of the party's goals is to make the necessary preparations for elections to local councils, which will get rid of the president's "appointees" on the local level. This is where many decisions are being made now that the government in Kiev is almost paralyzed (and this is a fact!). 2. Unity is the only thing that will save us all, but this process must not be forced (although the communists should not "doze off" either), because the different conditions in the former union republics of the USSR must be taken into account. [Representative of the Communist Party of Estonia] 1. Our main immediate objective is the legalization of the activities of our Communist Party, which was banned when the bourgeois government took power. Another objective is the restoration of party structures on the local level. This is a difficult job, but it can be done. Another important part of the work of Estonia's communists entails efforts to secure dual citizenship for individuals of non-native nationalities and the approval of the Russian language as a language of interpersonal communication. 2. It is time for all of the communist parties of the former union republics to agree on a single stance on this matter. Obviously, the distinctive features of the current situation in different regions of the former USSR must be taken into account. Furthermore, the existence of so many communist parties in Russia can only hurt our common cause. It is time for the comrades who are wasting their strength and energy on self-assertion to realize this.
