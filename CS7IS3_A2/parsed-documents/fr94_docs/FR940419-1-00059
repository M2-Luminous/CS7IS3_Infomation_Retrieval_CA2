FR940419-1-00059 FR940419-1-00009 Other Matters Justification for Shortened Comment Period It is the general practice of the Department to provide a 60-day comment period on all proposed rules. However, the Department is shortening its usual 60-day comment period to 30 days because it would be contrary to the public interest to delay the benefits of the rule another 30 days and because it is unnecessary to have a longer comment period. The policies contained in this proposed rule are the result of collaborative efforts with various housing interest groups, i.e., public housing resident leaders, Public/Indian Housing Authorities, Public Housing Advocacy Groups. This should decrease the need for the usual time period for comment, since consultation took place while the policy was being developed. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this proposed rule before publication and by approving it certifies that this proposed rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed rule provides substantial revisions to the regulations concerning Tenant Participation and Management in Public Housing under which resident councils/resident management corporations receive funding on a competitive basis. HUD does not anticipate a significant economic impact on small entities since resident councils/resident management corporations will continue to obtain by contract technical assistance to carry out program activities. Environmental Impact A finding of no significant impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address. Executive Order 12866 This proposed rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. Any changes made to the proposed rule as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket file which is available for public inspection in the office of the Department's Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the proposed rule is not subject to review under the order. The revised proposed rule is consistent with federalism principles since it reduces unnecessary burdens on resident organizations. Since participation by resident organizations is discretionary, this proposed rule lacks the direct and substantial effects on resident organizations required for a policy with federalism implications under the Order. Executive Order 12606, The Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this proposed rule has a beneficial effect on the family, and thus, does not require further review. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this proposed rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. Regulatory Agenda This proposed rule was listed as Item No. 1636 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October 25, 1993, (58 FR 56402, 56448) in accordance with Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
