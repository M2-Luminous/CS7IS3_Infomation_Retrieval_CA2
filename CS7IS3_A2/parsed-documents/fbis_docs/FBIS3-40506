As the CFD technology has evolved, the relationship with the conventional design tool of wind tunnel testing has also changed accordingly. This paper reviews the relationship of the two major technologies in Mitsubishi Nagoya. The typical CFD application is briefly introduced during the discussion. 1. Introduction The utility of CFD technology in the aerodynamic design of aerospace equipment began to make rapid strides in the 1980s. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), at its Nagoya Aerospace Systems (NAS) facility, has also been working hard on CFD R&D and now considers it an important aerodynamic design tool alongside of wind tunnel testing. In this article we trace the development of CFD at Mitsubishi NAS, giving specific examples and focusing on how its relationship with wind tunnel testing has changed. We also discuss the significance of these two technologies to designers engaged in aerodynamic design work, and look ahead to the future of the technology. 2. Changes in CFD and Wind Tunnel Testing Advances in CFD applications in the aerospace field were tremendous in the 1980s, and CFD has now developed into an indispensable aerodynamic design tool that ranks alongside conventional wind tunnel testing. As CFD technology has developed, naturally its relationship to wind tunnel testing has changed (cf. Figure 1). Figure 1. Changes in Relationship Between CFD Technology In the early 1980s, when we began to see the possibilities for CFD applications, it was being said that CFD was a "substitute" for wind tunnel testing. At that point in time, that being focused on in CFD technology were the analytical functions, as was the case with wind tunnel tests, which put CFD in a competitive relationship with wind tunnel testing. Subsequently, with the unforeseen improvements in supercomputer speeds and CFD technological advances, it became possible to handle Navier-Stokes inverse solution computations, and after the mid-1980s it was the design functions of CFD which came into focus. These were absolutely new functions which are not available in conventional wind tunnel testing, and in that sense CFD technology transcended wind tunnel testing. Then in the late 1980s the quality of CFD technology began to be questioned, which led to careful comparative studies between CFD and wind tunnel tests. As a result, there is now emphasis on the complementary functions realized by organically combining the two technologies. Beginning in the next section, we introduce the reader to some typical examples of CFD applications at Mitsubishi NAS, and retrace the changes in the relationship between CFD and wind tunnel testing. 3. Competition (Analytical Functions) In terms of aerodynamic analytical functions for determining aerodynamic characteristics for a given shape, there is no essential difference between wind tunnel testing and CFD. However, in the field of aerodynamic design, these two technologies are clearly differentiated in their use. CFD is superior to wind tunnel testing in terms of its greater speed and its greater flexibility. Compared to the task of designing and fabricating models and then conducting wind tunnel tests, the time involved in generating CFD meshes is extremely short. For this reason, CFD has great merit in being able to immediately reflect the results of aerodynamic performance evaluations in shape designing. And unlike wind tunnel tests, where the test conditions are limited by the capabilities of ground-based equipment, CFD technology in principle poses no restrictions on the evaluation conditions, so that aerodynamic performance evaluations can be conducted in regions that cannot be simulated with a ground-based facility. In Figure 2 a pressure distribution is depicted for HOPE re-entry conditions. This kind of function is particularly appreciated in the development of such space shuttle vehicles.[.sup]1[/] In Figure 3 [not reproduced] is displayed a pressure distribution around the blades of an advanced turbopropeller (ATP). Obtaining this kind of detailed data for a turning object from wind tunnel tests is extremely difficult.[.sup]2[/] Figure 2. HOPE Pressure Distribution (M = 15, _a_ - In the area of "analytical functions," where it is essentially no different from wind tunnel testing, there are still many respects in which CFD takes a back seat to wind tunnel testing. Take the cost angle, for instance. For some shapes, where many data points are required, wind tunnel testing holds the advantage. And in the area of precision, beginning with turbulence models, some aspects of CFD are still unknown. And there is a tremendous difference in terms of track record. In the field of aerospace equipment development, for example, where very high reliability is demanded, nothing has ever flown yet with only CFD. 4. Superiority (Design Functions) CFD design functions perform processes which are exactly the reverse of the analytical functions, and here we can expect little help from wind tunnel testing. The ability to derive a geometrical shape given a pressure field, in what is called inverse solving, is extremely important to the aerodynamic designer. Recently it became possible to perform Navier-Stokes reverse solutions, and the field of applications has spread. To the aerodynamic designer who must design "flows," it is a tremendous advantage to have the "directness" of being able to designate not shapes, but pressure distributions. In Figure 4 is depicted a full-craft pressure distribution for a transonic civilian aircraft.[.sup]3[/] The high-Reynolds number main wing that is employed in the latest airframes represents the positive application of the Reynolds number effect -- which used to be difficult to estimate in many cases -- so as to achieve high drag-divergence Mach numbers. The technology for these new wings would not be possible without the high-precision reverse solution method of CFD technology. In Figure 5 is depicted an example of applying the Navier-Stokes reverse solution method.[.sup]4[/] The HOPE main wing has a complex flow field that is surrounded by the fuselage and chip fins, so its design required a tool for precisely estimating the positions and conditions of the shock wave and separation, particularly at transonic speed. By employing the Navier-Stokes reverse solution method, it became possible to make extremely high-precision designs in a short time. Figure 4. Full-Craft Pressure Distribution for Transonic Figure 5. HOPE Main Wing Reverse Solution Design (M = 5. Complementing (Organic Merging) It is impossible [sic] to verify the precision of CFD computations by doing careful correspondence studies with wind tunnel test data. Out of the process of carefully comparing the two kinds of simulation results, we derive "organic merging" with which it is possible to make aerodynamic performance evaluations at higher dimensions by mutually making up for each method's shortcomings. In Figure 6 we have a pressure distribution for a swept-forward wing. With a swept-forward wing, due to the structural divergence characteristics, the deformations that result from static aeroelasticity, even in a wind tunnel model, cannot be disregarded.[.sup]5[/] For this reason, we combine CFD and structural analysis to estimate the flexure in the model beforehand, and then actually fabricate the model in a deformed condition so that it forms the aerodynamic shape designed at the design points in the wind tunnel tests. This enables us to verify high-precision aerodynamic characteristics in a way that could not be done with either CFD or wind tunnel testing alone. In Figure 7 [not reproduced] are depicted the results of two-dimensional wind tunnel side-wall analysis.[.sup]6[/] In two-dimensional wind tunnels, particularly in developing transonic airfoils with high Reynolds numbers, it is not possible to use models with high aspect ratios due to limitations in model structural strength, so the side-wall effect becomes too large to be disregarded. For this reason, we employ CFD to analyze the side-wall effect in a two-dimensional wind tunnel, then apply corrections to the wind tunnel test results, and thus perform high-precision performance evaluations on transonic airfoils with high Reynolds numbers. Figure 6. Forward Swept Wing Pressure Distribution (M = Now that CFD technology and wind tunnel testing have reached the mutually complementary stage, from the aerodynamic designer's perspective the situation becomes as diagrammed in Figure 8. Wind tunnel tests provide CFD technology with a steady stream of verification data for enhanced precision, while CFD provides wind tunnel testing with images of flow-site phenomena inside the wind tunnel which is very difficult to see in a conventional wind tunnel test. The designer continually learns physics from the wind tunnel tests while learning how to narrow his focus on the points which should be looked at in terms of designing and testing. Figure 8. Two Design Tools 6. Summary Amazing progress is being made in CFD technology at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' Nagoya Aerospace Systems facility. In conjunction with these advances, the relationship between CFD and wind tunnel testing is changing. Aerodynamic designers should now be able to effectively use these two tools in a mutually complementary way to design higher-performance aerodynamic shapes. 7. References 1.
