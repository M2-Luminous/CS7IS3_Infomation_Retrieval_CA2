KDNP Party Chairman Laszlo Surjan assesses the result and the future. [Begin recording] [Surjan] [passage omitted] As we know, the transformation from a planned to a market economy and many other circumstances have brought very great disappointment because only very few people have attained a higher standard of living. In practice, the living standard of all citizens has declined. Until now we have had a role in a coalition, a role we played as a partner of that coalition with moderate strength. Now we would like to participate in Hungarian public life in a much more marked manner and with a much better defined character but independently of others, relying on our own strength and our own ideas. [Unidentified correspondent] Does it mean that the KDNP cannot accept fully its participation in the bloc of pro-national forces which the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] is trying to form? [Surjan] The significance of a bloc of pro-national forces is yet to be thought through. I myself am afraid of this term. Naturally, we must think together, just as we have undertaken this -- we have even created serious tensions within the party -- by trying to help each other in the second round through withdrawing in favor of each other. Unfortunately, without result. [passage omitted]
