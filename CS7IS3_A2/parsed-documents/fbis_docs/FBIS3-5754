FBIS3-5754 "dreas047_a_94025" FBIS-EAS-94-047 Document Type:Daily Report 10 Mar 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Daiwa Securities Head To Lead Brokerage Group OW0903032194 Tokyo KYODO in English 0257 GMT 9 Mar 94 OW0903032194 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Daiwa Securities Co. Chairman Sadakane Doi was unofficially appointed Wednesday [9 March] as the next chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers Association, association officials said. The appointment of Doi, 65, to the post will be officially determined on July 1 at a meeting of directors. Masaru Aratani, 69 , a former deputy president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, is currently chairman of the association. This is the first time since the revelation of the series of stock scandals in 1991 that an official from one of the "big four" brokerage houses will head the securities industry organization. Before the stock scandals involving loss compensation by major brokerages to big customers were revealed, the big four -- Nomura Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co., Yamaichi Securities Co. as well as Daiwa -- customarily took turns to supply the association's chief. The outcry against the malpractice forced the big four to take a back seat, but the prolonged securities business slump and intensifying competition led many smaller brokerages to call for leadership from the big players, according to the officials. The officials said the association will ask the Finance Ministry to end its restriction on the association personnel, set in the wake of the scandals. The ministry has advised the association that its head should not double in the post and as chief of his own company.
