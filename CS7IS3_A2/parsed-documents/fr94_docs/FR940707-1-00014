Such facts shall include the names and addresses of all affected persons (if reasonably ascertainable); a complete statement of the business or other reasons that justify the act or transaction; a description of the acts or transactions that would be affected by the requested action; and a full description of the pertinent provisions and relevant facts contained in any relevant documents.

In evaluating an application for modification or rescission, the OHA may convene a conference, on its own initiative, if, in its discretion, it considers that such conference will advance its evaluation of the application. (2) If the OHA determines that there is insufficient information upon which to base a decision and if upon request the necessary additional information is not submitted, the OHA may dismiss the application without prejudice. If the failure to supply additional information is repeated or willful, the OHA may dismiss the application with prejudice. If the applicant fails to provide the notice required by §1003.53, the OHA may dismiss the application without prejudice. (b)(1) An application for modification or rescission of an order shall be processed only if_ (i) The application demonstrates that it is based on significantly changed circumstances; and (ii) The period within which a person may file an appeal has lapsed or, if an appeal has been filed, a final order has been issued. (2) For purposes of this subpart, the term ``significantly changed circumstances'' shall mean_ (i) The discovery of material facts that were not known or could not have been known at the time of the proceeding and action upon which the application is based. (ii) The discovery of a law, regulation, interpretation, ruling, order or decision on appeal or exception that was in effect at the time of the proceeding upon which the application is based and which, if such had been made known to the OHA, would have been relevant to the proceeding and would have substantially altered the outcome; or (iii) There has been a substantial change in the facts or circumstances upon which an outstanding and continuing order of the OHA affecting the applicant was issued, which change has occurred during the interval between issuance of such order and the date of the application and was caused by forces or circumstances beyond the control of the applicant. §1003.56 Decision and order.

Subpart F_Conferences and Hearings §1003.60 Purpose and scope. This subpart establishes the procedures for requesting and conducting an OHA conference or hearing. Such proceedings shall be convened in the discretion of the OHA, consistent with OHA requirements. §1003.61 Conferences. (a) The OHA in its discretion may direct that a conference be convened, on its own initiative or upon request by a person, when it appears that such conference will materially advance the proceeding. The determination as to who may attend a conference convened under this subpart shall be in the discretion of the OHA, but a conference will usually not be open to the public. (b) A conference may be requested in connection with any proceeding of the OHA by any person who might be aggrieved by that proceeding. The request may be made in writing or verbally, but must include a specific showing as to why such conference will materially advance the proceeding. The request shall be addressed to the OHA, as provided in §1003.11. (c) A conference may only be convened after actual notice of the time, place and nature of the conference is provided to the person who requested the conference. (d) When a conference is convened in accordance with this section, each person may present views as to the issues involved. Documentary evidence may be presented at the conference, but will be treated as if submitted in the regular course of the proceeding. A transcript of the conference will not usually be prepared. However, the OHA in its discretion may have a verbatim transcript prepared. (e) Because a conference is solely for the exchange of views incident to a proceeding, there will be no formal reports or findings unless the OHA in its discretion determines that such would be advisable. §1003.62 Hearings. (a) The OHA in its discretion may direct that a hearing be convened on its own initiative or upon request by a person, when it appears that such hearing will materially advance the proceeding. The determination as to who may attend a hearing convened under this subpart shall be in the discretion of OHA, but a hearing will usually be open to the public. (b) A hearing may be requested by an applicant, appellant, or any other person who might be aggrieved by the OHA action sought. The request shall be in writing and shall include a specific showing as to why such hearing will materially advance the proceeding. The request shall be addressed to the OHA at the address provided in §1003.11. (c) The OHA will designate an agency official to conduct the hearing, and will specify the time and place for the hearing.
