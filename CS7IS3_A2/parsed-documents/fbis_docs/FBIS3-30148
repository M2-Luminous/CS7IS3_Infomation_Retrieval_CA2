On this date last year, our people established in this land the government of the people and by the people, to which they have ardently been aspiring. As president, I eradicated irregularities and corruption that had been prevailing in this land. I worked with all my heart for the recovery of the economy, which had fallen into a swamp of stagnation. I made every effort to establish the national discipline so that no one who used unjust means could have both power and honor. As president, I dedicated all my spirit and strength to push ahead with change and reform in this country. Today our society is changing. The people's awareness of wealth and honor is also changing. Their awareness of a worthwhile human existence is expanding, and they are freeing themselves from the way of life of pursuing only material abundance. The Chongwadae presidential offices have become closer to the people. The economy is recovering. The nation's position is being enhanced. Clean and healthy energy is springing from the lowest stratum of society. We now have hope and confidence for the future. However, our reality is still far from the goal we have to achieve. You all know that the deep-rooted evils accumulated for over 30 years cannot be cleaned up in one day. Corruption accumulated for over 30 years is being exposed in various incidents and accidents. We have a long way to go and many things to change. The past constitution and practice are holding us up. However, I will continue with change and reform bearing the historic burden entrusted to me. National competitiveness, which we set as the goal of this year's national administration, can only be achieved externally through opening and competition and internally through change and reform. Dear fellow countrymen, I have already talked about the new year national administration policy in the New Year's news conference and I will only talk about a few points today. First, it is deplorable that national understanding and consensus of internationalization is still not sufficiently achieved. A hundred years ago, we could not become internationalized by self-determination but were forced to open the country by external control. Therefore, we fell behind and were turned into a colony. In order for us not to repeat the mistake we made a hundred years ago in the first opening process, we have to spontaneously carry out the second opening through internationalization. We have to learn from history. We should not deplore the door opening but should open the door ourselves and advance to the wide-open world. We have no reason to feel defeatism or persecution about the outside. I sincerely felt it last year through the Asia Pacific Economic Council summit meeting and my visit to the United States. We have the vitality of a cultural nation that has lived on for 5,000 years. We have the potential to create miracles on the ruins of colonization and war. We are becoming more dominant in the world through the establishment of a civilian government and reform. Let us all be confident. There is nothing for us to envy. No one can block our nation's advance. Second, we have to renew the officialdom. Some of our public officials who should lead the change and reform of our community are refraining from actions being preoccupied by an easy-going attitude and opportunism. Change and reform of officialdom society has become a task that cannot be delayed any more. Overweight organizations and functions should be boldly reduced. Useless administrative regulations should be resolutely abolished. We should turn administration from reigning over the people into providing service. The administration field should also introduce the management concept of business, namely management with high efficiency at the least expense. Third, the government will more powerfully push ahead to strengthen international competitiveness through economic revitalization. This does not mean ignorance of economic justice or balanced development. Prompted by the settlement of the Uruguay Round negotiations, the government has directed profound attention and energy to farmers and fishermen. We will provide intense financial and systematic support in order to build rich farms and fishing villages. A new, creative farming movement to cope with the challenge of opening up started in the rural communities across the country. I consider this a very encouraging phenomenon. I would like to make another appeal for management-labor harmony in order to realize an economic upsurge. Management should make all sincere efforts to make labor--a field of technological development and quality promotion--a working site full of vigor and excitement. Enterprises that cannot satisfy their employees, can neither produce goods that satisfy its customers, nor be successful. Workers should set the target of their labor movement on upgrading productivity and the standard of technology. The issue of wage increases cannot be the only goal of the labor movement. The labor movement should be consistent with national competitiveness. The government will exert utmost efforts to stabilize price, to improve income distribution, and to expand social security. Only when the workers, the management and the government form a sound trinity, can our international competitiveness be upgraded drastically. Fourth, today's civilian government is not yesterday's authoritarian government. It is a government with morality and legitimacy. The channels and methods for the people to present their political opinion have been sufficiently guaranteed. The time when illegal struggle was regarded as just has passed. I want to make clear that under a civilian government chosen by the people, lawlessness and violence will not be accepted under any pretext. It is the essential responsibility of the government to protect the people from violence and lawlessness. Fifth, I will humbly accept constructive criticism and advice pertaining to the president and the government. Our government and I hope that the opposition party becomes a genuine partner in reform, by getting rid of the ruling-opposition party relations of discord and confrontation as seen in the past. We are looking forward to creative relations between the ruling and opposition parties which sincerely strive for and discuss the interests, justice, and the future of all of our communities. Those who cry for justice should be considered just persons by others. When talking about reforms, the person who has set examples in reform is persuasive. What we want is the true reform partner and advice on reform from the true heart. What we urgently need is reform in the field of politics. As long as politics remain in the marsh of underdevelopment and nonefficiency, thereby hindering the development of other fields, we cannot maximize the strength of the country. We cannot advance forward. We cannot win the fierce international competition. I hope that clean and productive politics in its true sense will be restored in this land as soon as possible. I hope, with the people, that systematic reform for it will be made as soon as possible. My dear fellow countrymen: Assuming office as president, I promised the people that I would devote all my powers to national reconciliation and reunification, fulfilling the mission entrusted to me by history and the nation. I have never for a moment forgotten this promise. In particular, I have been doing my best with patience for the peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue. In this connection, I think it a very fortunate development that North Korea agreed to permit nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The North Korean nuclear issue is not only a problem connected with the survival of the 70-million-strong nation but a stumbling block that could stand in the way of reunification for good. Therefore, the government has undergone again and again the conflicting anguish that we should maintain a resolute attitude but should avoid a situation of extremity [kukhan sanghwang]. I clearly declare here that if North Korea renounces nuclear development and selects the road of genuine dialogue between the North and the South I am ready to accelerate North-South joint economic development for North-South coexistence and coprosperity in the manufacturing, agricultural, construction, and energy fields. My dear fellow countrymen: I thank you the people for your support and encouragement so that I may carry out my duty as president with flawlessly clean morality in view of history, the people, and my own conscience. In the future as well, I will devote myself to the country and the nation without selfishness, devoting all my wisdom and passion for it. What has sustained me over my 30 years of struggle for democratization has been my trust in you, our great people. The people, together with me, were able to establish a government of civilian democracy in this land, so I, with the people, will solidify the foundation of a new Korea. This is my hope and my dream. A new Korea is my dream and a dream for all of us. The dream of the 70 million people will certainly be realized by the strength of the 70 million people. A great history can only be made by the sweat, tears, and passion of the great people. I will work with perspiration to pioneer the glorious future of the fatherland, sharing joy and sorrow with the people, toward the new Korea and toward the world. The energy of spring is rising up from deep in the earth in this land. On this day last year, we started anew with new resolutions. Today, we must open a new spring of pioneering national destiny. Spring is for the person who sets off in search of it. Let us all pioneer a new spring of national history. Thank you.
