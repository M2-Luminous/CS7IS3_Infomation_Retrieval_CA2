This was stated in a communique issued by the UGS [Association of City Trade Unions] "Independence". "We thought that this was only interference in the editorial policy of other papers, but thanks to the aforementioned statement, it is now becoming clear that this move has far reaching consequences in the internal political arena. The pogrom of foreign journalists is only warming up, a prelude to the final showdown with those who do not share the same views at home. By throwing foreigners out, Serbia is only making sure that there will be no easing or lifting of the sanctions so that, in the total darkness and without witnesses, it can finish off the independent media and independent journalists devoted to their profession, "Independence" claims.
