Assistant Foreign Minister for Economic Affairs Son Chun-yong, Seoul's top representative at the South Korea-U.S. Dialogue for Economic Cooperation (DEC), talked with Daniel Tarullo, assistant secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs, over the phone Friday evening and agreed to the extension, the ministry said. Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Bill Clinton launched the DEC at a summit in July 1993. Seoul hoped to keep the DEC functioning for one more year, but strained trade relations with Washington blurred the prospects until Thursday's final decision, ministry officials said. The 12th South Korea-U.S. economic consultation opens between the two nations' vice foreign ministers in Washington on June 22, with a final report by the DEC to be adopted.
