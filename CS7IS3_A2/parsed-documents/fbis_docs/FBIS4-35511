The Israeli prime minister called the PLO leader a "big talker." For his part, the Israeli minister of police announced that 'Arafat would not be authorized to go to Jerusalem during his visit to Gaza and Jericho from 12 to 14 June. The fundamentalist group Hamas said that it was rejecting 'Arafat's offer to participate in the Palestinian National Authority, of which 19 out of 24 members have recently been appointed. Lastly, the Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for yesterday's attack in Rafah which killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded one. The Jihad said it wanted to punish the Israeli army, which captured Shi'ite leader Mustapha Dirani on Saturday [21 May] in Lebanon. Today we will finish publishing the extracts of the preliminary draft of the Constitution of Palestine that Yasir 'Arafat recently submitted to lawyer Jean-Marc Varaut. This document, which aims to define what will be the basic law of Gaza and Jericho during the transitional period agreed with the government in Jerusalem, will soon be submitted to the Palestinian National Council. As we said in our edition of 26 May, this text is still subject to amendment, especially since the Israelis have a veto right.
