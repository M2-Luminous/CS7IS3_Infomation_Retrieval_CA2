Two Russian parliamentary delegations are traveling around Serbia, taking stock of the situation and making promises. The larger 15-member delegation is visiting officials without much pomp, keeping company with the communists, and, at least publicly, does not seem to have any major ambitions. The other five-member delegation has been visiting all the Serbian lands in the company of local non-parliamentary right-wing parties with considerable media attention, promising everything that could please the Serbian ear. To make matters more confusing, the smaller delegation actually represents the forces that won the majority at the last elections but not the power. It consists of two vice presidents of Aleksandr [as published] Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, one communist (an astronaut), and two independent deputies, one of which is a veteran from Afghanistan. The malicious people would also add that they only lack a fire eater and a trapeze artist. Those who are more cautious know that the party representatives that won the majority of the several millions of votes in Russia should not be compared to a circus, regardless of the reception held for them and their preferred style of appearance. However, the treatment that this small group from a large country is receiving in Serbia is truly worldly. The media follow them carefully, halls packed with people greet them with ovations, they have comfortable cars, and allegedly an airplane as well. If only the official authorities would have paid a little more attention to them.... They are much more prepared for public appearances than their colleagues who, equally well received, have visited "the brotherly Serbian land" in previous years. Now they know precisely what we need and what would be good to promise. The most active member of this group, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy (the first man after Zhirinovskiy), is a decent stand in for his chief. "You are the first line of our defense," he said in Pirot. "Russia is a great market for your products," he announced in Bijelo Polje. "We will stop the supply of gas to Europe and bring it to you," he promised in Zemun. To the ecstatic Serbs in Pristina, he explained that Kosovo is "an old Serbian land and that a plan for its defense and protection is being prepared in Russia together with four brigades of soldiers." Besides all the nice promises, there are also some other ambitions: "Our visit is a sign that Russia is returning to the Balkans and that we will never leave it again," was stated in Belgrade. Beside the four brigades for Kosovo, naval support from Boka has also been proposed, while the aforementioned gas would arrive at the Serbian borders in tanks, it was said. As opposed to the larger delegation, this smaller one is pronouncedly anti-Yeltsin in its orientation; perhaps here lies the reason why the official authorities, at least at first glance, do not ascribe much importance to it. However, knowing that the host of the five-member group is the Serbian National Renewal party (which has been accused for years of having close relations with the police) and that (unconfirmed) Braca Karic (which also helped the Serbian Radical Party until Seselj's break with Milosevic) is financing their visit, things look a little different. The chronologists of political events, prone to fantasy, have a simple explanation: The Serbian authorities need support, even if only verbal. However, it is not appropriate to officially host the most fervent of Yeltsin's opponents at the same time. On the other hand, Zhirinovskiy needs money for the realization of his visions outlined in the Last Jump to the South (a book promoted in Zemun during the visit) in order to carry out the actions of matching the executive power to the electoral results. Belgrade, in this sense, represents a crossroad on the way to the Indian Ocean, and a crossroad without stalls is not much of an attraction. [Box, p 10] We Only Need Love As opposed to Zhirinovskiy's visit, when Liberal Democratic Party of Russia President Mirko Jovic and Zeljko Raznjatovic Arkan arrived at the reception with Patriarch Pavle unannounced and with the help of their elbows, the visit to the Serbian church head the day before yesterday passed much more peacefully. Witnesses emphasize that the patriarch was much more balanced than the hosts of the Russian delegation and that to the announcement of all-encompassing brotherly aid, he diplomatically replied that the biggest assistance that could be given to Serbia is -- love. However, incidents were not in short supply. At the news conference, Vengerovskiy said to a correspondent of the Russian NOVOSTI that upon his return to the country, he will check his report and that "perhaps there will be no need for him to return from Yugoslavia at all."
