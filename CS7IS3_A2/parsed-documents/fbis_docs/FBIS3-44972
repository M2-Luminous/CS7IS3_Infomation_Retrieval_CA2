Former state president Yang Shangkun arrived in Shenzhen from Beijing by plane for a visit and inspection. The last time Yang Shangkun came he was with Deng on an inspection tour of the south, and he arrived in Shenzhen at the beginning of 1992. After a year, Yang Shangkun, seeing more and greater changes in Shenzhen, was happy beyond description. During his stay in Shenzhen, Yang Shangkun met Li Youwei, secretary of the Shenzhen CPC Committee and mayor of the city; Yuan Geng, former executive vice chairman of the board of directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Limited; Wang Ju, member of the Shenzhen CPC Committee Standing Committee; and Xi Zhongxun, who is resting in Shenzhen. On the day of his arrival, Yang Shangkun inspected the Shekou Industrial Zone. While walking with Yuan Geng, he said that in the past decade or so Shekou had advanced by leaps and bounds and tremendous changes had taken place. It was no longer the small fishing village of 10 years or more before, but an urban district of a modern city. The reform and opening up policy advocated by Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of reform and opening up, was also proved in every way in Shekou to be entirely correct! Yuan Geng said that its past appearance had gone for ever! However, Yuan Geng also said that several dilapidated houses from those days had been preserved and suggested seeing them on another day. Yang Shangkun said they were historical evidence! On Sunday, 9 January, the Sihai Park in Shekou was full of people. Yang Shangkun and his party came to the park. They saw whole families of residents visiting the park. Some were pushing their babies in buggies and children were playing happily everywhere. Yang Shangkun was greatly interested in the place and walked around for more than half an hour. He praised Shekou once more saying that it was like a park and was full of life.
