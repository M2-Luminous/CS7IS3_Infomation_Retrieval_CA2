The ROK Foreign, Finance, Defense, and Culture and Sports Ministries reached this decision at a joint meeting on 28 January. They also decided to hold consultations with the United States on this matter sooner or later. A ROK Government official said: "The government made such a decision because the period of prescription for rents stipulated in the Government Budget Account Law is five years." He also said: "The government decided to ask the United States to pay rent without fail if it continues to use the building." The government made such a decision because the Board of Audit and Inspection last July pointed out that the "U.S. Government had not paid rent for the past 13 years with no justifiable reason." The ROK and the United States agreed in 1960 that the United States would use the 6,615 square-meter eight-story building free of charge as long as the U.S. Operations Mission or its successor organization stays in the ROK." However, the United States insists: The Economic Department of the U.S. Embassy inherited the role of the U.S. Agency for International Development to Korea, which was inaugurated as a result of the restructuring of the U.S. Operations Mission in 1968 and which was abolished in 1980. Therefore, the U.S. Embassy has no reason to pay rent. Also, the 1962 agreement on the use of the building stipulates that the United States can use it free of charge as long as the ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty exists. So, the United States has the right to continue to use the building free of charge.
