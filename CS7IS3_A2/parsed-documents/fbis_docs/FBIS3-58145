"France is following attentively the delicate moment of transition and change Italy is passing through," Napolitano told ANSA after the meeting, which was also attended by his counterpart at the French National Assembly, Philippe Seguin. "Balladur voiced confidence that, once this moment is behind us and a new parliament has been elected, Italy can fully resume its role in European and international politics," said Napolitano, also stressing that Italy's European commitment and the broad consensus of Italians around it would certainly remain as constants of Italian foreign policy in the future. In a TV interview later, Napolitano reported that Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's consultations in the last couple of days had "undoubtedly" provided him with clarifications of the positions of the various political parties and the no-confidence motion presented by many MPs in the majority. The debate on the motion is scheduled on January 12 and, according to Napolitano, successive developments will depend on the climate in the debate and the assessments of President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro -- "assessments," Napolitano pointed out, "that have already been delineated well before this initiative of the no-confidence motion." But Napolitano said Scalfaro's decision on whether and when to dissolve parliament does not depend solely on what the parties think, but will also take account of the need to "respond to a popular vote such as the one in the referendunm (in April) and the need to promote an indispensable political and institutional renewal." In his remarks to ANSA, Napolitano said other points on the agenda with Balladur, apart from his briefing on the Italian political situation and European issues, included unemployment and the need for economic growth throughout Europe in order to combat it.
