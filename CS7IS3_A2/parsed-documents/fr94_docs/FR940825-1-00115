FR940825-1-00115 FR940825-1-00009 However, EPA is proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for those provisions that mandate the imposition of Federal sanctions for failure to adequately implement or enforce an approved Clean Air Act program. E.g. , CAA sections 179(a)(4) and 502(i)(2). This includes EPA's authority to withhold all or part of air pollution control grants awarded under section 105. EPA is proposing to treat Tribes in the same fashion as States for the purposes of mandatory sanctions for nonimplementation of an approved Tribal program because once a Tribe has sufficient legal authority and capability to have a program approved, it should be treated as a similarly situated State. Thus, EPA expects a Tribe to follow through on its implementation of an approved program in the same manner as a State. This will provide an incentive for Tribes to maintain the primary role in implementing a previously approved air program and to administer effective programs. In addition, EPA will also treat Tribes in the same fashion as States with respect to EPA's discretionary authority to impose sanctions. E.g. , sections 110(m), 502(d)(2), and 502(i)(1). The approach EPA is proposing today regarding Clean Air Act deadlines and Federal sanctions is consistent with the approach outlined under Parts II.B. and II.C. of this notice. EPA's principal goal is to have Tribes develop and administer their own CAA programs. As indicated, EPA intends to issue guidance subsequent to this rule that sets out in some detail the Federal efforts and timetables for providing broader air quality protection for reservation air resources in those instances when Tribes choose not to develop their own programs. EPA intends to provide direct Federal Clean Air Act protection on reservations if, after some reasonable time, its efforts to assist Tribes in developing Tribal programs under the Act do not in fact lead to Tribal program adoption and approval. a. National Ambient Air Quality Standards applicable implementation plan submittal deadlines and related sanctions. Consistent with the general discussion above, EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for the general implementation plan submittal deadlines specified in section 110(a)(1) of the Act. Further, Tribes will not be subject to the plan submittal deadlines for nonattainment areas set out in sections 172(a)(2), 182, 187, 189, and 191. EPA also is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for the deadlines set out in section 124, associated with the review and revision of implementation plans related to major fuel burning sources. However, EPA is proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States with respect to the statutory requirements that will apply in evaluating a Tribal program once a Tribe has decided to make a submittal. Further, as indicated previously, EPA intends to issue guidance specifying timeframes by which it will provide Federal protection for Tribes that have air quality worse than the NAAQS but are unable to develop their own CAA programs. The timing of Federal protection will be informed by the applicable Clean Air Act NAAQS attainment deadlines. Also consistent with the general discussion above, EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for the imposition of certain mandatory sanctions by EPA under section 179 because a Tribe has failed to submit a Tribal Implementation Plan (TIP) or other requirement, has made an incomplete submittal, or has made a submittal that is in part or in whole not approvable. See CAA section 179(a)(1)&hyph;(3); see also discussion under Part III.C.1. of this preamble, concerning EPA's ``modular'' approach to Tribal Air Programs (TAPs). However, EPA is proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for those provisions of section 179 mandating the imposition of sanctions when EPA determines that a requirement of an approved plan is not being implemented. See CAA section 179(a)(4). In addition, EPA is proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States with respect to EPA's discretionary authority to impose sanctions. See CAA section 110(m). EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for the provisions of section 110(c)(1) that direct EPA to issue a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) within two years after EPA finds that a State has failed to submit a required plan or has submitted an incomplete plan or within two years after EPA has disapproved a plan in whole or in part. This exception would apply only for that provision of section 110(c)(1) that sets a specified date by which EPA must issue a FIP. Treating Tribes in a similar manner as States under that provision would be inappropriate since Tribes are not in the first instance, like States, required to make submittals by a date certain, and in light of the very recent initiation of Tribal air quality planning efforts. EPA is proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for all other provisions of section 110(c)(1). Thus, EPA would continue to be subject to the basic requirement to issue a FIP for affected areas within some reasonable time. EPA would give substantial weight to Tribal air quality needs in determining what is reasonable in particular instances. Further, as discussed in Part II.B., EPA intends to spell out in subsequent guidance the specific programs that EPA will implement to provide CAA protection within reservations and on other lands subject to Tribal jurisdiction. However, EPA is proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as it treats States for the State Implementation Plan/Tribal Implementation Plan (SIP/TIP) call provisions under sections 110 (a)(2)(H)(ii) and (k)(5) of the Act. These provisions authorize EPA to require a State to revise a plan that is inadequate to assure attainment and maintenance of the relevant NAAQS or is otherwise inadequate to ensure compliance with applicable Clean Air Act requirements. Thus, once a Tribal Implementation Plan has been approved in whole or in part as meeting an applicable CAA requirement, Tribes will be similarly subject to these SIP/TIP call provisions.
