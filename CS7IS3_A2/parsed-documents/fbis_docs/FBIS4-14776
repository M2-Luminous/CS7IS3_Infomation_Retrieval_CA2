Can one suppose that the Russian initiative has become the dominant one in settling the situation in Karabakh? In reply to this question, Ambassador V. Kazimirov said that there should be no rivalry between the peacekeeping initiatives. What has been done is much more important than who did what. The diplomat said that "the agreement plan proposed by Russia provides first of all, for a cease-fire and for a halt to combat actions, a mechanism guaranteeing that the possibility of them resuming is reduced to a minimum. This is to be followed by the transition to the next phase -- the elimination of the main consequences of the armed conflict. That is the withdrawal of forces from the territories captured during battles, the resumption of the operation of transport and energy communications in the conflict region, and the return of refugees to rayons and populated areas that they have left, and also the continuation of the talks' process." The Russian diplomat explained further the mechanism of the settlement initiative. "First of all," he said, "it is reinforcing the end of combat actions -- the separation of troops by a large distance, especially of heavy armaments, beyond the reach of fire." The ambassador noted that disengagement forces may be in the region but this requires the agreement of all the warring sides and most importantly, the readiness of states to allocate forces for disengaging the opposing sides. There are no such states yet. Russia is ready to take part in such a multilateral operation provided that it is acceptable for all the warring sides without exception.
