On the other hand, the social reason behind the conflict should be tackled with a new effort. In Algiers, FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU journalist Hans-Helmut Kohl conducted the following interview with Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi, who has been in office since 11 April. [Kohl] People in Europe are following the developments in Algeria with great concern -- also as far as safety is concerned. Foreigners are being killed, threatened, and are leaving the country. What do you want to do and what can you do about this? [Sifi] This government is observing two guidelines. First, we have to eliminate violence. These acts of violence must stop, and we are making great efforts for this. I think that the population and objective observers have already noticed a significant improvement. The struggle to eliminate violence will continue. On the other hand, there are political, economic, and social reasons for this evil in our society. The intensive struggle against violence goes hand in hand with a policy that consists of addressing all parties and all sections and groups of the population. Not everything that the population feels is expressed by the parties. There are social groups such as the trade unions, employers, and cultural associations that are of significance by themselves. All these people have been invited to a dialogue so that we can find out together how we can return to stability. As far as the economy is concerned, we have revised a program for improving the infrastructure, even though this is only a small part of what is necessary. [Kohl] Let us stay with politics. You have invited everybody to participate in the dialogue. What will you do if your invitation is not accepted and how far are you ready to take this dialogue? Does it also include the FIS, the Islamic Salvation Front? [Sifi] We should understand one thing: The FIS has been dissolved by a Supreme Court ruling in accordance with the laws of this country. Now there are movements that support the social model that was also pursued by the FIS. They think that their idea is the best. These people may come, but all others who renounce violence may come, too. [Kohl] Are there any contacts between the government or the state president and the arrested FIS leaders Madani and Benhadj? [Sifi] The state president has made mediating efforts. Everything has taken place on the basis of the platform that was worked out in the High State Council with the participation of many people. There were others who were not included. The conference emphasized that the path was open for everybody else, too. It laid down the framework and the objective. The framework includes all those who renounce violence and respect the Constitution. Our objective is to achieve economic and political stability as a precondition for elections. We want to achieve this as quickly as possible. The platform agreed on a period of three years. Should stability be achieved before that, nothing will prevent us from holding the elections earlier. [Kohl] Will these elections then no longer be held under the majority voting system but under the proportional representation system, because the majority voting system benefited the FIS? [Sifi] That is the problem. The direction that we are going will depend on the dialogue. The electoral law is part of it. [Kohl] Are you going to give a precise date for the elections? [Sifi] Perhaps not everybody is content. We will see who will not come. The train will go on. We have to give those who have not yet boarded the train time to reflect. For this purpose we have established the National Transition Council (CNT), which will constitute itself soon. Recently we instituted the National Economic and Social Council (CNES). All the issues can be discussed in the CNES and the CNT. [Kohl] Are you playing to stay in power for awhile? [Sifi] I will go even further. What other solution can you offer, what alternative, what is to be done? If you know something better, why not, even though in my opinion there is nothing better way than to assemble the people so that we do not lose even more time. [Kohl] Still, there are groups who will not participate. [Sifi] Then things will be done without them. These organizations are important, but people are more important. The people want peace. [Kohl] You have offered dialogue with a time limit? [Sifi] Of course there are limits. [Kohl] The accusation has been voiced in Algeria, for example in the newspapers, that Germany was supporting fundamentalists, who were not only granted asylum but are even allowed to demand murders. How do you see the position of the German authorities? [Sifi] Germany is a sovereign country. It has the right to do whatever it wants. People in Germany are worried about what is going on in Algeria. We would like to give the German authorities and the German public the possibility to have direct access to our country so that they do not have to rely on information provided by international media or all kinds of experts on Algeria. I think that we can trust that the Germans will finally find out the truth about our country. Germany and Algeria have shared interests. Personally, I am convinced that the Germans will change their opinion not only when they become more open toward the Algerian Government but when they come here to see for themselves. Still, I have the impression that German public opinion does not yet have a true assessment of the situation here. I can feel that in your questions, too. Dialogue, particularly in the way it is understood in Germany, is not dialogue between the government, on the one hand, and a party, on the other. [Kohl] Yet, this is what it is seen as -- as dialogue between the government and the FIS. [Sifi] No. The government does not back one party or turn against another. We do not have any preferences. [Kohl] In your view do political statements in Germany disturb this process? [Sifi] Exactly. They have prevented Algeria overcoming the crisis. [Kohl] So do you think that Germany should behave differently? [Sifi] Yes, absolutely. If the German public were better informed of the true intentions of the Algerian Government, they would be convinced of our path and would be more accommodating. [Kohl] Let us now turn to the economy: Does your government accept the crucial term privatization? What industries will be privatized, when and under what conditions? [Sifi] Here, as in politics, your approach seems to biased. You never see the whole but only one aspect, which can be a conclusion but sometimes also the driving force for a certain development. [sentence as published] Privatization as a simple term, a slogan, is of no value for us. What we are interested in is the efficiency of our economy. If the state has to withdraw from one sphere or another -- I prefer this formulation -- why not? In Germany there are also public employers. Why do you not privatize these? [Kohl] We are just about to privatize our airline. [Sifi] Very well. Ask the British, and they will tell you that the Germans are not privatizing enough, and they will add that the French are lagging even further behind. Everything is relative. I am not telling the Germans, French, and British anything. They all have their national economies, and everybody is trying to be as efficient as possible. When we became independent we had nothing -- nothing in the private or public sector. So, something had to be done, and since there was no private economy, the state had to take things into its hands. This was necessary. It turned out that the state was unable to handle everything. So autonomy has to be created in ever more sectors. We have started, and we will continue. [Kohl] Give me an example. [Sifi] Well, take the tourist industry. The state is not going to invest in any new developments. We are not doing anything at all in this sector any more. And what we must and will do is to open up to private national and foreign capital. Where we need technological partnership we are ready to open up. I am thinking of cement plants, which need foreign partners. [Kohl] What about the petrochemical industry? [Sifi] Do not rush us. We have not analyzed it in detail. It is not enough to proclaim the slogan and let nothing follow. We must be able to evaluate all the possibilities. We must not begin with the simplest things but with what is possible. Time will come. Now we are not thinking of privatizing the petrochemical industry, which does not mean that we will not do so in 10, 15, or 100 years from now -- I do not know. What I do know is that we are anxious to optimize our economic activities. [Kohl] To attract foreign capital you have to guarantee profits. [Sifi] That is obvious. We can attract foreign capital in all the sectors if there are shared interests. Yet, without assessing the possibilities I cannot say that I will simply do it in one or the other industry. That is not the appropriate thing for a head of government to do. There have to be vital Algerian interests for any opening up. [Kohl] Your recent agreement with the IMF will make the problems even worse. Do you think that you will be able to explain this policy to your population? And do you have enough time for it? [Sifi] So far, the people have lost confidence in the government because they were promised a lot. We have explained the consequences of the agreement, both the negative and the positive. We have drawn up a program to prevent the shock therapy that we can witness elsewhere. We will improve the social network and make sure that the distribution of and access to goods will improve. At the moment, there is a huge gap between the real and the official prices. If we increase the official prices by 50 percent and, at the same time, improve the distribution of and access to the goods, then we would still remain beneath the current real prices. [Kohl] How will you solve the housing shortage? [Sifi] At the moment we are short of 1.2 million apartments, based on the statistical assumption of seven people per apartment. If we wanted five people to share each apartment, we would need 2 million apartments. This is where we did a bad job in the past. Now we are trying hard to complete 600,000 unfinished apartments. This will change the concrete living conditions, which will become noticeable in all the cities. Moreover, we will permit all Algerians to buy a piece of land, which was impossible in the past. And the administrative bodies must change their way of working. They used to take decisions but there was nobody there to implement them. [Kohl] As a result of the attacks is it difficult for you to keep people who work for the state because they are the targets of such attacks? [Sifi] Quite a few have left, but most of them have stayed on. One thing is certain, namely that we can do a much better job with the same means. [Kohl] Do you not interpret it as criticism that people describe you as a technocrat? [Sifi] On the contrary, I am proud of it. I say it is better to be a good technocrat than a bad politician.
