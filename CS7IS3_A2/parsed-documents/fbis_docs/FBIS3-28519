Why then does the U.S. Government embrace the puppet of the Vietnamese communists named Sin Song, great murderer and criminal, and let him go to the United States? It has been reported that the U.S. State Department has issued a visa to Vietnamese communist puppet Sin Song to travel to the United States. This report, picked up from Western foreign news agencies, says that Sin Song is a murderer. He killed over 400 members of various political parties and arrested over 3,000 others during the May 1993 pre-election period. The Cambodian nation and people still clearly remember that before the May 1993 elections, puppet Sin Sing was the security chief of Vietnam's puppets. He has mistreated, arrested, and executed hundreds of people and members of various political parties. Furthermore, in July 1993 puppet Sin Song led the movement of seven eastern provinces to secede from Cambodia and opposed the national reconciliation plan offered by the prince father [Sihanouk]. The Cambodian nation and people have condemned the Vietnamese communist puppet Sin Song as a great criminal and murderer, who kills the Cambodian nation and people, and as a traitor. The way the United States has embraced the puppet Sin Song has made people ask this question: The United States have set themselves up as defenders of human rights. Why then does the U.S. Government issue a visa to the Vietnamese communist puppet Sin Song, great criminal and murderer, to travel to the United States?
