Zhirinovsky arrived in France with a Russian parliamentary delegation to attend the spring session of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe. The leader of the largest one-party faction in the Russian lower house said NATO's air-strike had been aimed "against Russia, against Slavs." "If I were the president, we would bomb those bases in Italy... They bomb one town, we bomb another town," he told reporters. Zhirinovskiy said that he favoured the peaceful settlement of the Yugoslav crisis, adding that it was NATO who initiated the aggression. NATO's action "is against Russia. For the most part, it serves the interests of Germany in the Balkans. It is against Christians, against the Slav people," the leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party stressed.
