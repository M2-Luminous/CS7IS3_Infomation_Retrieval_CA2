Tsyb, Medical Radiology Research Center, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Obninsk, under the rubric ``Investigation of the Sequelae of the Chernobyl Disaster'' ; UDC 614.876:621.039.58] [Abstract]Immunological (modifications of passive agglutination of particles and enzyme immunoassay, agglutination of gelatin particles loaded with microsomal antigen, and radioimmunoassay of thyroid microsomal and antimicrosomal antibodies) and ultrasound screening (of the thyroid) methods were compared in a study of 6398 inhabitants of Korosten, Zhitomir Oblast, at the time of the Chernobyl disaster. Ultrasound screening revealed changes in the thyroid in 108 cases; serum samples were taken from these and 22 subjects without changes for demonstration of antibodies to the microsomal fraction of the thyroid using immunological methods. There was a high degree of coincidence of diagnoses made by ultrasound and immunoassays, which indicates that the latter can be used for the said population to supplement the ultrasound findings.
