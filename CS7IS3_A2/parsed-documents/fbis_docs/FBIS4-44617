With the product development phase now completed, this device (model HTI4) exhibits the following performance: operating temperature range is 20-30� C, rated power is 90[? (figure blurred)] mW, typical threshold current is 60 mA, maximum threshold current is 90 mA, typical operating current is 250 mA, maximum operating current is 350 mA, typical operating voltage drop is 1.5 V, maximum operating voltage drop is 2.5 V, minimum operating wavelength is 1.46 �m, maximum operating wavelength is 1.49 �m, parallel emission angle is 25�, and perpendicular emission angle is 30�. These values are comparable to current international standards. Qinghua University has incorporated the device in its EDFA certified in December 1993.
