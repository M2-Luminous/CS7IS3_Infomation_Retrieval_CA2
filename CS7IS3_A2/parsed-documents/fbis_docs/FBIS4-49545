Meanwhile, authorities announced yesterday a set of regulations designed to silence the vocal dissident community. In the runup to the fifth anniversary of the 4 June military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement police have stepped up close surveillance on dissidents. The ninth student leader on the wanted list for the 1989 protests, Zheng Xuguang, married recently in Xian and the couple had their honeymoon in Beijing earlier this week. Mr. Zheng had planned to hold a wedding banquet on Thursday night in the capital, however he and his wife were ordered to return to Xian on Thursday by his parents-in-law, who were believed to be under pressure by police authorities, sources said. At least 10 guests invited to the banquet were from the dissident community. Mr. Zheng was arrested in Beijing in January following his meeting with the pro-democracy Peace Charter campaigners. Due to close surveillance dissidents in Beijing said they found it difficult to move within the city. Apart from the 4 June anniversary, the tightened security is also meant to keep dissidents quiet and avoid detention which may cause complications to the Sino-United States row over human rights.
