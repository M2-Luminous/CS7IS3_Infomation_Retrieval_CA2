FR940705-2-00155 FR940705-2-00090 Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;b. The interior walls, floors, and ceilings shall be impervious to water and resistant to acids, alkalis, organic solvents, and moderate heat, to facilitate cleaning. Penetrations in these structures and surfaces (e.g., plumbing and utilities) shall be sealed. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;c. Windows in the animal facility shall be closed, sealed, and breakage resistant (e.g., double-pane tempered glass or equivalent). The need to maintain negative pressure should be considered when constructing or renovating the animal facility. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;d. An autoclave, incinerator, or other effective means to decontaminate animals and waste shall be available, preferably within the containment area. If feasible, a double-door autoclave is preferred and should be positioned to allow removal of material from the containment area. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;e. If arthropods are used in the experiment or the agent under study can be transmitted by an arthropod, the interior work area shall be appropriately screened (52 mesh). All perimeter joints and openings shall be sealed, and additional arthropod control mechanisms used to minimize arthropod entry and propagation, including appropriate screening, or the equivalent of access doors. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;f. Access doors to the containment area shall be self-closing. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;g. The animal area shall be separated from all other areas. Passage through two sets of doors shall be the basic requirement for entry into the animal area from access corridors or other contiguous areas. The animal containment area shall be physically separated from access corridors and other laboratories or areas by a double-door clothes change room, equipped with integral showers and airlock. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;h. Liquid effluent from containment equipment, sinks, biological safety cabinets, animal rooms, primary barriers, floor drains, and sterilizers shall be decontaminated by heat treatment before being released into the sanitary system. The procedure used for heat decontamination of liquid wastes shall be monitored with a recording thermometer. The effectiveness of the heat decontamination process system shall be revalidated every 30 days with an indicator organism. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;i. An exhaust air ventilation system shall be provided. This system shall create directional airflow that draws air into the animal room through the entry area. The building exhaust, or the exhaust from primary containment units, may be used for this purpose if the exhaust air is discharged to the outside and shall be dispersed away from occupied areas and air intakes. Personnel shall verify that the direction of the airflow (into the animal room) is proper. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;j. If the agent is transmitted by aerosol, then the exhaust air shall pass through a high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filter. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;k. Vacuum lines shall be protected with high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters and liquid disinfectant traps. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;l. In lieu of open housing in the special animal room, animals held in a BL3&hyph;N area may be housed in partial-containment caging systems (e.g., Horsfall units or gnotobiotic systems, or other special containment primary barriers). Prudent judgment must be exercised to implement this ventilation system (e.g., animal species) and its discharge location. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;m. Each animal area shall contain a foot, elbow, or automatically operated sink for hand washing. The sink shall be located near the exit door. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;n. Restraining devices for animals may be required to avoid damage to the integrity of the animal containment facility. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D.
