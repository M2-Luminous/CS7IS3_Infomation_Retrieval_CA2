FBIS3-5856 "dreas048__a94019" FBIS-EAS-94-048-A Document Type:Daily Report 11 March 1994 ANNEX Japan MOPT To Experiment With High-Speed Network OW1003122994 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 7 Mar 94 Morning Edition p 3 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1003122994 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] plans to start experimenting with a super-fast communications network which will link research institutions and handle massive amounts of data at 60 times the speed of existing networks. The ministry plans to connect its Communications Research Laboratory (CRL) (located in Koganei City, Tokyo) with the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT), Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co., Ltd. (KDD), and domestic computer makers via this network. The ministry also plans to invite overseas research institutions to participate in the project which will be promoted in response to a similar project underway in the United States, called the National Research and Education Network (NREN) project. The U.S. project links universities and research institutions throughout the nation. It has now become clear that as core projects which will serve as the basis for the multimedia age, both Japan and the United States plan to place emphasis on the construction of communications networks which link research institutions together. The planned network is to consist of a massive fiber optical network capable of transmitting a maximum 10 giga-bits of data per second, coupled with the latest ATM (asynchronous transmission mode) converters designed to handle such data. This is 66 times the maximum amount of data the NTT is capable of transmitting via its communications networks which are currently in service. These have a maximum transmitting capacity of 150 mega-bits per second. The network is to connect the MOPT's CRL with the NTT's Communications Network Research Laboratory (CNRL) (located in Musashino City, Tokyo), the KDD's KDD Laboratory (located in Kamifukuoka City, Saitama Prefecture), the Japan Broadcasting Corporation's (NHK) Broadcasting Technologies Laboratory (located in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo) and the International Telecommunications Basic Technologies Research Laboratory (ATR [expansion unknown], located in Seika-cho, Kyoto), a government-private corporation. It is expected the network will also link the CRL later on with research institutions managed by such computer makers as the NEC Corporation, Fujitsu Ltd., and IBM Japan. Calling its project the "Global Giga-Bit Network" (G-Net), the MOPT plans to broadens its scope to include participation by foreign research institutions via a super-fast overseas communications network for the use of which the NTT has signed an agreement with the American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T). In its project, the MOPT plans to emphasize the testing of technology for operating and maintaining communications networks and the development of new ways to use networks by utilizing supercomputers and databases managed by other facilities. The development of new uses is expected to cover a broad field extending from communications uses, such as video conferencing which features clear video images, and teletherapy, in which diagnosis is conducted by transmitting video images of medical information to remote places, to environmental research in which air pollution and meteorological phenomena are analyzed on a global scale. The MOPT plans to spend 488 million yen, as approved in the third supplementary budget for fiscal year 1993, to improve computer systems and communications facilities at the CRL. The NTT will provide large-capacity fiber optic cables free of charge, while research institutions will set up necessary facilities on their own. Participating institutions plan to set up a liaison body and hopefully complete the network by March 1995.
