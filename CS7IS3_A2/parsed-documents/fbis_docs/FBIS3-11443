The challenge of creating it on firm foundations demands that we move forward to build a "culture of consensus," because a true democracy can only be created through the civilized instruments of dialogue and political negotiation. Of course, in our tumultuous history there are unfortunately very few examples we can cite as valid precedents upholding the culture of consensus. Instead, the pages of our history are filled with the opposite phenomenon: the violent resolution of conflicts, the use of force, and a propensity toward one-man rule and dictatorships. Still, since it appears that democracy may finally have found a place in our history, it should be feasible to construct a democratic program that will enable us to prepare for the transition to the 21st century, based on a broad national consensus. Nicaragua's critical situation and the new conditions of the world and of Latin America demand of our political leaders a process of maturation that will lead to a new political style, capable of setting aside, like museum pieces, the habits and ideas that no longer make any sense in our new national and international situation. This is the challenge that the circumstances and patriotism impose on us, a challenge to which we must all respond if we do not want to remain prisoners of a political primitivism that is capable of placing us outside history and shutting the doors on any chance of progress. We face multiple challenges: we need to consolidate the fragile peace we have achieved; move ahead toward true democratization; strengthen production systems in order to expand our exports; combat unemployment; give priority attention to social policies; and stimulate our incipient scientific and technical development. Our goal should be a more just and human society, not only a more prosperous market. The new international and regional competitiveness will leave us sidelined on the road to development if we do not clearly perceive our current challenges and step out boldly to face them. In the Latin American debate on strengthening democracy, the need to promote social policies that are fully integrated in overall economic development strategies is taking on increasing importance. The new thinking, which overcomes the rigidity of neoliberal systems, grants a key role to social reform and the struggle against poverty as a way to strengthen democratic governability. The state cannot reduce its role to that of a simple "market watchdog." It must also shoulder its "compensating" responsibility on behalf of the most vulnerable, and those who bear the greatest brunt of structural adjustment plans. The challenge of building democracy in Nicaragua also requires the internal renewal and democratization of the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front], whose importance in our national political spectrum no one can deny. Until the FSLN is transformed into a modern, civilian, and participatory party that once and for all eradicates verticalism and the temptation of one-man rule, thereby creating an authentic democratic option for our people, the process of building democracy in Nicaragua will not have the firmness and amplitude we all want. The FSLN's renewal needs to be the product of an extensive debate in which mutual respect for persons and ideas will prevail. Nothing is more contrary to that purpose than resorting to insults and calumnies, even using the Sandinist media and manipulating those who regrettably allow themselves to be used for such blameworthy procedures. We hope the debate will proceed in another direction and take on the decency that respect for true Sandinist principles demands.
