The new board is: Lionello Adler, Giancarlo Cerutti, Giacomo D'Ali' Staiti, Diego Della Valle, Michel Francois Poncet, Albert Frere, Gianfranco Gutty, Giuseppe Lucchini, Klaus Peschek, Axel Von Rudorffer, Vincenzo Sozzani, Giuseppe Stefanel, Enrico Beneduce, and Fausti. The board is expected to meet on Tuesday [26 April] to appoint executives and confer powers. Only two of the directors are re-appointments: Fausti and Poncet, the representative of the big Milan-based bank's historic and now major stockholder, Paribas. Beneduce, proposed by Fausti and Siglienti, was promoted from central director. Fausti said the predominance of new entries on the board, representing some of the cream of European banking, was due to the fact that "we will have to knock on their doors for the money needed to make the bank grow" in a capital increase that had already been aired by Siglienti. The appointment of Albert Frere, chairman and CEO of the Groupe Bruxelles-Lambert, was a surprise to some. Those of Poncet, Peschek (from Austria's Creditanstalt) and Von Rudorffer (Commerzbank of Germany) were less so. Most observers had also expected the entry of D'Ali' Staiti, a Comit partner in the Bank of Sicily. Hardly surprising, also, was the naming of a representative of one of Comit's other historical partners, Trieste-based insurance giant Generali, in its managing director Gutty. Then there are the industrial partners: Adler for Cartiere Burgo, the paper-maker that raked together almost 11 percent of Comit shares; Cerutti for engineering group Le Officine Meccaniche Giancarlo Cerutti; Della Valle for the footwear group of the same name; Giuseppe Lucchini, son of "steel king" Luigi; Sozzani for the Pirelli tire and cable group, taking the place of Leopoldo Pirelli; and Stefanel of the clothing group. The 15 biggest shareholders present at the meeting (in brackets, the ordinary shares held, also as a percentage of total capital) were: Paribas Europe (30.9 million, 2.97 percent), Commerzbank AG (26.99 million, 2.59 percent), Frere-Bourgeois SA (20 million, 1.92 percent), Assicurazioni Generali (19.21 million, 1.84 percent), Creditanstalt (18.11 million, 1.74), Cartiere Burgo (10.7 million, 1.029), Ema Srl (10.56 million, 1.01), Gemina Investments (10.39 million, 1), Gefina (10.3 million, 0.99), Muenchener Rueckversicherung (10 million, 0.96), Lucchini (9.9 million, 0.95), Fondigest Fondo Delta (6.39 million, 0.61), Sibad International (6.15 million, 0.59), and Cofilp Sim (5.93 million, 0.57). Gefina is a company in the Generali group; Ema is rumoured to be controlled by Diego Della valle; Cofilp is a merchant bank of the Banca Popolare Novara group. The referents of Frere-Bourgeois, Muenchener and Sibad are unknown. [passage omitted]
