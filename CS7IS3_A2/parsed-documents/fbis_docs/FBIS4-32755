According to the section of the Coalition Agreement dealing with the economy, the continuing dramatic deterioration of the country's balance of payment makes it of vital importance that the new government avert a general economic collapse, at the same time ensuring that Hungary does not fall behind. The Coalition Agreement was approved by congresses of both the Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] at the weekend. The section on economic policy concludes that Hungary faces a deep crisis, characterized by declining domestic production and declining foreign trade, unemployment, a budget deficit, a slowing of investment, and a deterioration in competitiveness. Although domestic supply is better than in the past, it is still insufficient, it says. The fact that the previous government undertook many more domestic and foreign obligations than would have been justified by the budget situation gives the new government even less room for maneuver than originally thought, while the precise extent of the obligations is still to be fully established. The first priority will be to publicize a thorough general economic inventory, in order that both the government and the public may clearly see the situation and realize that there is no chance of quick economic growth. A significant amount of purchasing power has appeared in the market as a result of campaign-related economic measures, the inflationary effect of which can already be felt, the document says. The main purpose of the new government's economic policy is to establish a market economy dominated by private ownership, which would pave the way for economic growth, while at the same time bringing down unemployment. This can only be achieved by reducing the budget deficit and controlling inflation. The economic policy document gives a detailed discription of measures to be taken in order to reorganize the state budget, to develop the institutions of market economy, to consolidate and privatise banks and state-owned companies, to improve the employment situation and industrial performance, to establish a general economic foreign strategy, to improve infrastructure and enviromental protection, and to prepare for the 1996 EXPO.
