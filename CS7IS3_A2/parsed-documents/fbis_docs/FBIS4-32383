Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus said that, even if the bill is approved by parliament, "not all the financial means spent on the election campaign could be registered." Filkus told CTK that the law should enable control over political parties' expenditures in the course of the election campaign and after it. According to the law, publishers of the periodical press as well as organisers of radio and television broadcasts and advertising companies' management would be obliged to provide the Finance Ministry and the Supreme Inspection Office with information about the amount of financial means individual political parties and coalition spent on the election campaign, Filkus said, adding that value added tax was included in the sum of 12 million crowns. According to this year's financial management reports of individual political parties, the post-communist Democratic Left Party (SDL) with the 61.5 million crowns (some $2 million) worth of property is the richest political party in Slovakia followed by ex-premier Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) with almost 21 million crowns and the Slovak National Party (SNS) with 8 million crowns.
