The circular notes that grain is a special commodity with strategic significance, and that the stability of the grain market has an important bearing on the overall situation. It says that strengthened administration of the grain market is an important content of and a necessary measure for the state's macro control of grain. In order to maintain regular order in the circulation of grain and keep the prices of grain and edible oils basically stable, the circular says, the General Office of the State Council has demanded that governments at all levels pay close attention to the following six aspects: First, they should attach great importance to the purchase of grain. State-owned grain enterprises should take an active part in purchasing grain according to their purchasing quotas and the relevant policies. Except for those given approval to purchase grain and engage in the wholesale of grain, no other units or individuals are allowed to purchase grain directly from the countryside. Second, when the enterprises engaging in grain wholesale and grain-consuming units in grain-purchasing areas go to buy grain in grain-production areas, they are only allowed to buy grain on the wholesale grain markets above the county level. Transactions outside the grain market are banned. Third, enterprises engaging in grain wholesale should be re-organized and re-registered. Those engaging in grain business without licenses and those hoarding or speculating in grain will be strictly punished. Fourth, it is necessary to make appropriate arrangements for the transport of grain from the grain production areas to the purchasing areas. Fifth, it is imperative to raise enough funds for the purchase and transportation of grain. Sixth, efforts should be made to set up and perfect wholesale grain markets in both supplying and purchasing areas. Measures should be taken to gradually standardize, legalize and modernize the grain and oil wholesale markets. Supervision and control of the prices in and transactions in grain and oil in the wholesale and free-trade markets should be strengthened.
