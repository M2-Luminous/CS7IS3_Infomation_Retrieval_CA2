The meeting, which continued for nearly two hours, was held in the Turkish Embassy in Nicosia. Ulucevik said after the meeting that he and Lamb were in Cyprus at the same time by coincidence. He also said that he exchanged views with Lamb, with whom he has been constantly in touch. Ulucevik stated the following: [Begin Ulucevik recording] I have found an opportunity to bring to Ambassador Lamb's attention the significant changes that have been made between the original package of confidence-building measures and the package that is on the negotiating table at the present time. As far as I am concerned, our talks have been useful. Yes, that is how we have benefited from the courtesy meeting we had. [end recording] A correspondent asked Ulucevik the following question: [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Claims have been made to the effect that the bargaining talks on Maras [Varosha] will be used on matters related to the economic crisis in Turkey. Can you comment on that matter? [Ulucevik] I do not even wish to regard what you have said as a question. I cannot accept that as a concept. Turkey is well aware of its historic responsibilities and obligations toward our brethren and kinsmen in Cyprus. That awareness is strengthening every day. As I have already said, that cannot be accepted as a concept. Nor can any question that is related to what you have said be regarded as a proper question. [end recording]
