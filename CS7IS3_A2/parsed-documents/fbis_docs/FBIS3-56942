We just seemed to have begun to crawl away from the precipice of hyperinflation, we just seemed to have grasped the anchor of a stable ruble rate and told manufacturing enterprises: Sort out production or lower prices.... But there is no holding us. We decided on the union of the Belarusian and Russian monetary systems. So that we can fall into the abyss together -- falling is not so boring. Over the past six months Belarus has suffered the total collapse of its economic policy. The national currency, the zaychik [little hare -- Belarusian currency carries symbol of a hare], has been devalued at a rate comparable only to that of the karbovanets. It is not surprising: Ukraine and Belarus both did nothing to reform the economy, traditionally counting on getting themselves out of a fix at Russia's expense. Whereas previously the standard of living in these republics was higher than in Russia, once Moscow introduced its own national currency and once the credit-money umbilical cord was severed, the situation changed before our eyes. The hunt was on for rubles at a time when everything but the economy was prospering in the fraternal republics. I have a friend, a so-called black marketeer at the Minsk Refrigerator Plant; he described how the trade in these very popular refrigerators is being "privatized" there: The ministry takes a fair amount of the plant's output and then sells it for a song (but for rubles!) to my "black marketeer," the latter smuggles the goods into Russia and has a good life. Everyone has a good life apart from the Belarusians themselves, who don't have refrigerators or rubles, and now their zaytsy [hares -- national currency] have fallen in value. Why? What is the underlying reason for monetary union and, what is more, on such preferential terms for Belarus? After all, the plan is to exchange rubles for zaytsy at a rate of 1:1, although only a complete idiot would get less than 5 zaytsy per ruble on the market. As far as Russia is concerned, this means an instant rise in all prices of at least 10 percent. For what will we be paying? The Central Bank of Russia led by Mr. V. Gerashchenko is behind the great idea of union. Having temporarily piped down over the past few turbulent months, Mr. Gerashchenko has once again made a brilliant display of his political skill. He prepared documents on the quiet and contrived to get them past Gaydar and Fedorov, past everyone concerned about the future of reform. And they, according to the plan, were to have made fools of themselves, whipping boys responsible for the upsurge in inflation which is absolutely inevitable in this situation. Naturally the fathers of Russian reform refused to don the dunce's cap. No, let the person accustomed to acting behind people's backs and dealing calculated blows on the quiet -- Mr. Gerashchenko -- try the cap on for size. There are no sensible arguments in favor of union. There has been some talk there [in Belarus] about aid -- but who will aid us? Politicians have gone quite crazy if they are sacrificing the economy and the prosperity of their fellow citizens for the sake of a free handout to people who have no very great need thereof. Does Belarus have no money? Does it have no means of paying for energy resources? Does it have property? Well then, hand over blocks of shares in enterprises to settle its debts. Russian enterprises undoubtedly need the Belarusian market. But why pay for this with hyperinflation? Russian reformers were performing a single task in disengaging the monetary systems, that of putting a stop to the endless provision of subsidies for the former union republics. That was achieved in the middle of last year. Is it all starting up afresh now? Why then the need for the absurd exchange of cash that caused the whole country to wait in line outside branches of the savings bank? Many politicians' rosy dreams will have obviously been realized with leading economic reformers' departure from the government. The national leaders of the former union republics are happy to shift the burden of responsibility for economic mistakes onto Russia, while however retaining all the other attributes of a sovereign power.
