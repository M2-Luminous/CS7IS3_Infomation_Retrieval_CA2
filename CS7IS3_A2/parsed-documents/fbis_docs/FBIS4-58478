According to our correspondent's report, the Scientific Research Council's energy committee today issued a report entitled "Perspectives of Energy Research in the Islamic Republic of Iran" at a seminar in which lecturers, researchers, and the country's executive officials in the energy sector were present. The report says: It is estimated that our country consumes more than one million barrels of oil each day. Even with the present low oil prices, the country is consuming around $5 billion worth of oil each year. That makes the need to rationalize our country's energy consumption, to develop consumption patterns, and to expand research into energy saving unavoidable . The secretary of the state Scientific Research Council's energy committee also said: If the country's present trend of energy consumption continues, we will need to build a new refinery each year and that would cost a yearly investment of more than $1.5 billion. He added: Savings of 5.5 percent in energy consumption is realistic and can reduce foreign currency expenditure equivalent to $1.5 billion for investment in refining oil.
