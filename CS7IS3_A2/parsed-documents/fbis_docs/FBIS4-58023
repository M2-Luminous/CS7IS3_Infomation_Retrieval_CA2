The JANA economic affairs editor commented on this, saying: The decision of the U.S. House of Representatives to seize Iraqi assets deposited in American banks was a clear and direct robbery which is punishable by the international law that organizes relations between states. It is also considered as an open violation and blatant aggression against all financial and banking organizations in which dealing between states is achieved and also under the protection and encouragement of which, many states that produce raw materials have deposited their funds in American and European banks. This measure gives a negative and even a very dangerous sign to Arab states that deposit funds and about the fate of the Arab people in the West's banks. Under the pretext of investing funds or protecting them from wastage and robbery, this measure confirms with irrefutable proof that the Arab funds in Western private and governmental banks are not immune, protected, or invested and there is no interest in their existence. The measure which must be taken immediately and without official endorsement [as heard] is to withdraw these funds and bonds, and redeposit and reuse them in the Arab region, which is in most need of these funds in order to achieve its development, civilizational change, and the prosperity of its sons who are the ones entitled to their wealth.
