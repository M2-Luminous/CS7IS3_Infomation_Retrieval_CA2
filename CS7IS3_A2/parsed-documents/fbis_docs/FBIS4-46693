And there are always lines in filling stations and, alas, there is always a justified expectation: Once the cost of fuel rises, prices of all the rest will also increase. The petroleum fever has unwound the flywheel of inflation, devaluing the ruble, the population's deposits, pensions, and wages. What is this--inevitability connected with the drying up of underground storerooms and with the excessive appetites of petroleum producers or businessmen trading in fuel? We have managed to reveal some secrets of "black gold." The editorial department has come across strictly confidential material, sensational in its own way, from the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, in which this sector's analysts present the most unexpected data, which make it possible to see the petroleum problem in a new light. For example, it turns out that in our country there is an abundance of petroleum. And what abundance! This is what the analytic survey "for internal use" states in connection with this: "... By the beginning of the second quarter more than 6.5 million tonnes of unsold crude petroleum accumulated in the system of main transport, which exceeded the permissible technological level. All free capacities of petroleum and gas producing enterprises and petroleum refining plants are filled with petroleum and finished products, the remainders of which, as compared with the end of last year, have increased one and half-fold. Owing to the lack of free capacities, petroleum producing enterprises were forced to shut down wells..." The Russian economy has always been unpredictable and paradoxical. Even from precious petroleum we have managed to make unsalable goods. Of course, both the nonpayment crisis--today consumer enterprises owe the Russian Federation fuel and energy complex about 20 trillion rubles--and shortcomings in the implementation of intergovernmental agreements on mutual settlements for petroleum have led to this. The wealth of "petroleum kings" is also no more than another myth. We quote the same document. "Various state taxes make up about 70 to 90 percent in the structure of the price of petroleum products. Tax policy leaves enterprises without funds minimally necessary for their functioning and development. High taxes and charges make even the export of petroleum products inefficient. Their price has almost reached the world level mainly owing to taxes, which has made deliveries to the foreign market unprofitable..." That is, in the very near future the "king" may prove to be naked. Of course, it is a matter of professional petroleum industry workers and producers, not of crafty middlemen, who manage to extract personal billions from state property. The entire sector may prove to be unemployed and bankrupt. These are not merely words. From 1992 until today our export to near abroad has been reduced to one-half! The reasons are known. The insolvency of the Commonwealth countries and the existing price formation system... Forget about them, someone will say, we will sell petroleum not to the CIS, but to the West for "pure bucks." It is not worth having illusions. In 1993 the volume of exported fuel and energy resources increased by 23 percent, but prices dropped by 19 percent. Commercial structures in the chase after quick "profits" sell strategic raw materials more cheaply. Momentary advantages are the chief things. Who benefits from this? As a result, world petroleum prices drop, while our "domestic" prices rise. With such a very wild trend, how to fight for sales markets? So much was said about Ukraine's strongest dependence on deliveries of Russian fuel: For the sake of gasoline Kiev will make any concessions to Moscow. But recently Ukraine has purchased 2 million tonnes of petroleum products in Rotterdam. It turns out that there they are cheaper than in our country. However, the laws of the economy are harsh: Having lost the market, later you will spend twice as much in order to get it back. True, the fuel and energy complex has done a great deal to solve problems. For example, last year it gave about one-half of the entire Russian export and, on the whole, ensured the state's positive foreign trade balance. It also gave about 40 percent of the revenue part of the federal budget. It did not permit serious disruptions in deliveries of energy carriers, which business managers feared so. Professionalism and experience were manifested in this. However, how to proceed further so that the failures, at which we have arrived today, do not occur? In the market world the calculation of the cost of any commodity--from a necktie to a car--begins from the determination of the cost of 1 tonne of grain and 1 tonne of petroleum. Later everything "starts" from these two base figures. And not otherwise. For now this correlation "walks" by itself, causing attacks of the disease in the entire economic organism. However, if price proportions are set for a long period, for example, for 5 years, other sectors could then operate in a stable and calm situation. What is happening today--a spasmodic rise in the cost of energy carriers--gives nothing except waves of inflation and an economic chaos. Of course, it is important for the state to subsidize this process at the initial stage and to help to unwind the market mechanism. Later it will begin to produce a harvest by itself. Right now, however, without waiting for global shifts, what has already been adjusted can and should be preserved; for example, trade ties with near abroad. We should continue to sell it petroleum, although for some time, on credit; of course, strictly indexing calculations. Otherwise, competitors will simply capture the market. Incidentally, property can be acquired in republics for debts. There are already examples of this. The Ministry of Fuel and Energy is now acquiring the controlling block of shares of the Lisichansk Petroleum Refining Combine, one of the three best production facilities of the former Union. A new construction of such a complex in Russia would cost billions... In brief, everything is not yet lost. However, to wait until everything is buried, until inflation drags the country to an abyss, is a folly. We must finally get rid of the constant price jitters and lack of confidence in tomorrow and begin to live under conditions of a civilized economy.
