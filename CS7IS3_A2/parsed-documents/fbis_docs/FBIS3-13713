The sources made these comments to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT after the expiry of Hamas' deadline to the Jewish settlers and occupation forces, after which it said it would deal painful retaliatory blows to them. It is believed, however, that the tightened measures and precautions have made it difficult to carry out such operations, particularly as the Israeli leadership has taken into consideration the possibility of such operations by the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Squads -- the military wing of Hamas -- to avenge the martyrs of al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron.
