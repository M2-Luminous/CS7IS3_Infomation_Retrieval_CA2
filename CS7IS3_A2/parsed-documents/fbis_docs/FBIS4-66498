A number of condolence messages and statements, denouncing the barbarous crime and the crusade of hatred, which the fundamentalists are waging against Algeria and its citizens, have been received by our editorial department. Most are from anonymous citizens, like the young people of Tizi-Ouzou (Said and Mouloud) who in their message of condolence call on democrats and republicans to form a "united front against fascist, fundamentalist barbarism..." Two women's associations, RAFD [Algerian Rally of Women for Democracy] and AFEPEC [Women's Association for Personal Growth and Exercise of Citizenship], also made their views known. The only political party to speak out, in a long statement from which we reprint extensive extracts below, was the Ettahaddi movement--faithful as ever to its antifundamentalist position and its struggle for republican values. A Citizen Reacts [Article by Farida Ramse] Abdelkader Alloula is gone. A man of culture, an Algerian of talent and integrity, is with us no more. Another name has been added to the grim roster of the victims of terrorism. Another chapter of Algeria's history is written in blood. But our politicians remain indifferent and do nothing to stop the terrorism. And what does it mean, the silence of the politicians, the absence of initiatives? Are the politicians completely powerless to change the situation? What exactly have they done? With every passing day, more men and women are shamefully assassinated by villainous outlaws; not even children are spared. The Algerian people are groaning in agony. Fear and terror reign in the streets, homes, and schools. No, no, no! Too much, it's too much! How can we tolerate the wholesale slaughter of innocents at the hands of blind fundamentalism? We have never really mourned our dead: We have mourned only our own weaknesses. But the majority of Algeria's citizens, myself included, have expressed firm resolve to put an end to these terrorists and to proclaim loud and forcefully, to their supposed protector, that a policy driven by terrorism is unacceptable. They have argued, time and again, that these terrorist tactics are a distortion of authentic Islam and have openly condemned the extremists, whose narrow economic and political interests are so thinly veiled. The Algerian people have suffered enough. They bear the scars of crimes perpetrated by those who were their adversary in the past and remain their enemy today. The people aspire for peace, in justice and freedom. To realize that hope, they are calling on all patriots to insist that the regime put an end to all efforts to destroy national unity, unmask the destabilizers trying to exploit civil turmoil, and put an end to the massacre of Algeria and Algerians. Ettahaddi Movement The slender thread of hope for the survival of our brother Abdelkader Alloula has been severed. One of the nation's irreplaceable cultural and artistic treasures has been shattered. This is what fundamentalism is really about, for nothing but violence and extremism can result from its totalitarian, obscurantist ideology. No so-called tactical concessions, no conciliatory gestures, no rhetoric of appeasement will change its fascist, dictatorial, and warlike character. Honorable, patriotic Algerians will not forget that at a time when assassinations are taking the lives of its writers and poets, of thinkers and scientists, of white-collar and blue-collar workers, of men and women who reject fundamentalist oppression and terror, almost the entire political class and certain coteries within the regime are behaving with ever-increasing cowardice and irresponsibility in their efforts to absolve and rehabilitate the Islamist parties and their criminal leaders. Algerian patriots will not forget the work and struggle of Abdelkader Alloula. They will honor his memory and that of those before him who gave their lives for the preservation of the state and the defense of democratic, republican, and progressive values. The Ettahaddi movement calls on the population of Oran and the surrounding region, indeed on all Algerian men and women who want their children to have a future of dignity and freedom, to make the funeral services for A. Alloula a great occasion of mobilization against fundamentalist terrorism, its instigators, and its protectors. It is still waiting for the authorities to quit shirking their responsibility. Algiers, 14 March 1994.
