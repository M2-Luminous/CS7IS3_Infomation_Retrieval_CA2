An official of the publication said that Ekpu and Mohamed were arrested in Lagos and northern city of Lokoja at the weekend. No official reason was given for their arrest by state security officials, which followed the arrest Thursday [7 April] of the magazine's editor-in-chief, Dan Agbese. The arrests are believed to be in connection with last week's NEWSWATCH interview with an official of the old administration of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida which ruled from 1985 to 1992. [passage omitted] Some media and human rights organisations, in separate statements after Agbese's arrest, condemned the action as a new wave of media clampdown in the West African country, which is acclaimed to have one of the freest press in Africa. The organisations include the Nigerian Union of Journalists and the Nigerian Magazine Publishers Association. "Events in the recent past have shown that unlawful harassments of media practitioners have never achieved any positive results for the government," the association said. Agbese, Mohamed and Ekpu, left the NATIONAL CONCORD publication of millionaire Moshood Abiola in 1983 to set up NEWSWATCH, whose founding editor-in-chief, Dele Giwa was killed in a parcel bomb delivered to his Lagos home in 1986. There has been no arrest or prosecution of Dele's killers, some eight years after his slaying.
