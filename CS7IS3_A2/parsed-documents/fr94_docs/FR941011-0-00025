FR941011-0-00025 FR941011-0-00009 Thresholds are continuously reviewed by DEA to determine if they are satisfactory to prevent diversion. Current evidence shows that the threshold for ephedrine of 1.0 kilogram is not adequate to prevent the diversion of ephedrine to clandestine laboratory operators in the United States. Clandestine laboratory operators are obtaining ephedrine in quantities much less than the current 1.0 kilogram threshold for use in the illicit production of methamphetamine and methcathinone. DEA had determined that in order to ensure the maximum effectiveness of the CSA in curtailing the diversion of ephedrine, there should be no threshold for ephedrine. Subsequently, all regulated transactions of ephedrine would be subject to reporting, recordkeeping and notification requirements of the CSA regardless of size. Comments Seven comments were received in response to the March 17, 1994, Notice of proposed rulemaking. Some comments pertained to provisions of the DCDCA which are not related to the ephedrine threshold. These comments will not be addressed in this Federal Register Notice, but DEA will consider them in preparing the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking pertaining to the DCDCA. A summary of relevant comments received is provided below: A comment submitted by the National Wholesale Druggist Association (NWDA) did not raise any objections to the elimination of the ephedrine threshold. NWDA, however, raised the issue that the March 17, 1994, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking does not change the definition of ``regulated transaction'' in Section 1310.01 (f) to be consistent with the DCDCA. This will be remedied when the DEA publishes proposed regulations which implement the DCDCA in the near future. A comment was also received from the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP). The NABP strongly supports the elimination of the ephedrine threshold. Furthermore, the NABP expresses its support for the more restrictive actions taken by certain state authorities whereby single entity ephedrine products have been placed in controlled substance schedules or placed on prescription-only status. The NABP also states that a nationwide Federal effort is needed to better monitor the distribution of single entity ephedrine products. A comment was submitted on behalf of BDI Pharmaceuticals and raised the following issues: BDI's comment states that the elimination of the threshold is prohibitory and will remove single entity ephedrine products from retail stores. However, the elimination of the threshold only imposes recordkeeping, reporting and notification requirements and will not remove products from the market. BDI states that the increased recordkeeping burden from the elimination of the threshold will decrease the number of retail stores willing to sell ephedrine products. BDI states that 21 CFR 1310.06(d) estimates that it will take approximately ten minutes to fulfill the recordkeeping requirements for each sale. BDI further states that this is an excessive burden which will be a major factor in a merchant's decision to drop the product. However, 21 CFR 1310.06(d) does not provide an estimate of the time required to keep sales records of each regulated chemical transaction and it is estimated that creating and storing a transaction record requires an average of only one minute per record. Conversely, 21 CFR 1310.06(d) pertains to the amount of time needed for the filing of reports of suspicious transactions, unusual losses or domestic regulated transactions in a tableting or encapsulating machine as outlined in 21 CFR 1310.05. These situations, whereby reports should be filed, occur infrequently. BDI's comment makes the point that asthma is a serious condition and elimination of the threshold for ephedrine will have an adverse impact upon asthma patients because the single entity product will become unavailable. DEA recognizes that asthma is a serious condition for which ephedrine has an approved treatment indication. DEA, in an effort to ensure that the elimination of the ephedrine threshold would not adversely effect the availability of medications for the treatment of patients suffering from this condition, has circulated the March 17, 1994, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Within FDA, this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was circulated to several offices for review and consideration. DEA has received an official response that FDA supports the proposed threshold elimination in order to address the misuse, diversion and trafficking associated with single entity ephedrine products. In addition, FDA's formal response also states that FDA believes that there may be other ephedrine products that may also need to be considered for regulation under the CSA as amended by the CDTA and DCDCA.
