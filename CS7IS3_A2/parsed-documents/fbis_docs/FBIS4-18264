In a press conference here, after the fundamentalist RP headed for a victory in Sunday's [27 March] local elections, Cindoruk said that the bans on youth organizations, foundations and similar organizations should be lifted so the political parties can have broader-based relations with the people. Stressing the superiority of the Consitutional Court, the republic's prosecutor and justice, Cindoruk said, "if a political party begins acting against the law, the justice and the laws and the Constitution will do whatever necessary." "No political party can enter an action which would spoil the basic structure and principles of the state," he said. Cindoruk, also gave some advice to the new mayors, in his address. "The municipality is not a place to worship, but a place to implement. In Turkey, there is a freedom of religion. Everyone is free to live the way he pleases. If these facts are not observed, then there will be a social resistance," he said. "My second piece of advice is to keep in mind that a local administration cannot bring a (new) social order, because it cannot impose taxes, make laws. Local administrations should not be used as if a new government came into power," he added. He also stressed that whoever implements backward methods when in office will not be reelected in the next elections.
