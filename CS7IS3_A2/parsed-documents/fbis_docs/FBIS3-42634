The majority of experts have pointed out that the Commonwealth has gained its "second wind" in the third year of its life. It is interesting that the same observers were inclined to express the opposite point of view just recently: It is a powerless entity, they said, and its days are numbered. They found comfort in the knowledge that without this entity, the dissolution of the colossal nuclear power would have taken the form of a nuclear meltdown, as they put it, instead of a civilized divorce.... Now they suddenly have realized that the CIS not only has a right to exist, but that neither Russia nor the former Soviet republics--Russia's neighbors and partners--can get along with it. The three Baltic states are no longer a consideration (they are "self-supporting"), but by the time of the last conference in Ashgabat, all of the other 12 "ex-es" had come together in the CIS. The last of them was Georgia, which had had its fill of the drawbacks of sovereignty in October 1993; Azerbaijan, which had also gone through many ordeals, had returned to the fold a short time earlier. But here is the question: Exactly what kind of entity is the CIS--an evolving system of cooperation and coordination or a means of communication during the transition period of the "divorce proceedings"? There are significant political forces adhering to both views in the republics; accordingly, they have different interpretations of the Commonwealth's purpose and functions, and this introduces discord into their work. Furthermore, as far as the general public is concerned, attitudes can quickly undergo a total reversal, and this is obvious to more than just the sociological community. During the initial period of the existence of the CIS, for example, illusions were fostered (and with some success) "on the local level" to suggest that the main causes of negative developments could be found at the center, outside the boundaries of the new sovereign republics. The hopes for successful economic separation from other parts of the ex-Union were unjustified, however, and these states did not acquire more favorable conditions for economic recovery when they were "on their own." Recession, impoverishment, social tension, and other such problems were present almost everywhere in the CIS instead of the anticipated prosperity. In this unfavorable atmosphere, the centripetal tendency slowly began to prevail over centrifugal forces. The belief that the establishment of different levels of consolidation within the Commonwealth of Independent States might be the best option in today's difficult circumstances gradually gained strength among political scientists and experts, and then among the members of the ruling elite in the post-Soviet republics. In the most general terms, the multileveled structure of the Commonwealth can be described as approximately the following: On the first level, the lowest, a system of multilateral and bilateral agreements on mutual preferences is taking shape, economic and social laws are being coordinated, and the infrastructure is being standardized. On the second level, the establishment of the Customs Union will create a duty-free and license-free zone, a common tax policy is being conducted, and commitments are being assumed with regard to the unimpeded movement of people, goods, and capital. The final and third level of cooperation will be achieved by countries with a common currency and a supra-governmental mechanism for decisions on the issuance of currency, crediting, and financial exchange. In this way, each state belonging to the CIS can choose to be a confederate or associate member: In each specific case, everything will depend on the prevailing tendency--centripetal or centrifugal. Obviously, the former will help a republic "find its own place" in the Commonwealth, and the second will have an alienating effect. What are the contributing and hindering factors? These are mainly economic factors on both sides. As a rule, grim necessity prevails over any kind of illusions. Economic conditions in the CIS countries range from difficult to catastrophic. As long as the economic zone is in a fragmented state, it will be difficult to expect improvement, and social indignation will be rampant because of the cold and hunger.... Only concerted effort can lift an economy out of the ruins. What do the advocates of the other, "centrifugal" point of view want? For them, the priorities of sovereignization have not lost their luster. They still have hopes for integration within the framework of a different structure--a more promising structure, in their opinion, than the CIS. These hopes are largely impractical and illusory, but they also reflect disillusionment with the CIS because of its ineffectiveness and its lack of a mechanism to implement decisions. The leaders who met at the last regular CIS summit conference approved around 20 documents pertaining to economic spheres of vital importance--taxes, export-import policy, finances, credit.... This is an indication that the CIS partners acknowledge these new realities, but as far as the implementation of these documents is concerned, we will have to wait and see....
