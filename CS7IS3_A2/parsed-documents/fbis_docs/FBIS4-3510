Five convenors of the Alliance Yu Sun Say, Ambrose Lau Hon Chuen, Fanny Lai Ip Po Ping, Carson Wen and Au Yeung Sing Shiu jointly made the announcement at a press conference here this afternoon. The organizing committee of the Alliance, comprising 52 Hong Kong businessmen and professionals, is ready to admit founding members and plans to take part in the 1994 and 1995 elections at all levels in the territory. Ambrose Lau Hon Chuen said after 1997, China will implement the policy of "one country, two systems" in the Hong Kong Special Adminstrative Region which will then be governed by the Hong Kong people with a high degree of autonomy. "The committee believes that those who wish to stay in Hong Kong and take part in the building of the territory's future should organize themselves to participate in political activities to ensure the effective implementation of the said-policies and a smooth transition, and to maintain the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong," Lau said. He noted that the Alliance advocates the importance of building a good relationship between Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland and to create a stable environment for businessmen to invest in Hong Kong. Lau stated that his organization promotes communication with the mainland, and intends to adopt an open and positive attitude in giving constructive views to the Chinese leaders on matters relating to Hong Kong. The alliance supports the development of a democratic government, but takes a pragmatic approach and gives due consideration to the historical situation, lau said, adding it believes that democratic development should follow the principles of even participation and orderly progress, so as not to unduly disrupt the harmony and stability of the society. In another development, two other organizations - the United Democrats of Hong Kong and meeting point - announced on Monday [18 April] that they would merge to form a single party - the Democratic Party in Hong Kong in October.
