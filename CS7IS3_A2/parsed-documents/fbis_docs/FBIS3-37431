Our correspondents report on the details from Washington. [Goryachev] [Video shows Nazarabayev walking with Clinton at press conference] President Clinton assessed relations with Kazakhstan as a long-term partnership of strategic importance. From now on Kazakhstan -- which is the ninth largest country in the world, and with its resources and its position at the meeting point of Europe and Asia -- will become an important player in the sphere of U.S. foreign policy, and not only policy. [video shows oil drilling] [Nugmanova] Presidents Nazarbayev and Clinton reached agreement on setting up in Almaty the headquarters of the Central Asian Business Fund, for the activities of which the United States is allocating $30 million. The amount will be increased as specific projects are implemented. This is advantageous to us. [Gerasev] What is advantageous for the United States is Kazakhstan's movement toward a market economy, which is considered here as being successful. But the main thing is the republic's nuclear disarmament. The official document on Kazakhstan's accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is a success for Clinton. A success for Nazarbayev is major U.S. financial aid which, it was stated, will be trebled and will exceed $300 million. The talks in Washington were bilateral, but Russia and its relations with Kazakhstan was an invisible participant in the talks. [Nazarbayev] [Video shows Nazarbayev speaking to camera] Another question which I put to the leadership of Russia was of concluding a treaty on military cooperation between Russia and Kazakhstan, whereby we would in effect become military-political allies. Then it would have been possible to say to America that it is our business where our armed forces and our missiles are located in the interests of the security of the two states. However, the Russian side did not agree to that. That is where the whole question lies. [Goryachev] Kazakhstan, Russia, and the other countries of the former USSR are increasingly acting individually in their relations with the United States. But perhaps understanding of the fact that there is strength in numbers is not too far away.
