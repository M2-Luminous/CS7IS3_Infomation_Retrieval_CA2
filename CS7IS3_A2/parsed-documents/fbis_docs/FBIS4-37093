In a statement published Tuesday by Saudi daily `UKAZ', Bensouda said Morocco did not attend any OAU meeting since the admission of the 'Polisario' and is still upholding its stands. The so-called Polisario is bustling to hamper the holding of the referendum in the Moroccan Sahara and wants a referendum that fits its interests, said Bensouda recalling that several members of the `Polisario' had joined Morocco, for they know that the Sahara is Moroccan. On Morocco's relations with Arab countries, Ahmed Bensouda said King Hassan II is endeavoring along with Arab heads of state to clear up the Arab atmosphere and preserve Arab resources and capacities.
