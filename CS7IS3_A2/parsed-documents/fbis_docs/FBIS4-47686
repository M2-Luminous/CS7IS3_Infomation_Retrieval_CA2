FBIS4-47686 "drafr084_cs94008" FBIS-AFR-94-084-S Daily Report 01 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Counting `Way Behind Schedule' at 4 Major Centers Counting `Way Behind Schedule' at 4 Major Centers MB0105210594 Johannesburg SAPA in English 2018 GMT 01 May 94 MB0105210594 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- Four major counting centres, controlling ballots which represent the largest slice of the election results, were running way behind schedule with counting by Sunday [1 May] evening. These facts emerged from internal Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) reports received on the status of the counting process country-wide at 8PM on Sunday. Umtata, Durban, Pretoria and Nasrec [National Exhibition Center] all reported massive backlogs while the North West, Western Cape and Northern Cape had almost completed their count. By 8PM the OFS [Orange Free State] reported that more than half the votes in the province had been counted. Information from some regions were sketchy on completed counts but most counting stations reported progress indicating that many tallies were ready to be verified and released by IEC HQ soon. Difficulties seem to focus on Durban's counting, where the 8PM report recorded that of its 60 stations 32 were not counting and at 28 there had been no reconciliation. A crisis team had been sent to deal with the problem. At Umtata only six of the 61 stations had completed counting, 50 were counting and two were still reconciling. In the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region the bottleneck, expected to take counting into late Monday or even Tuesday, has occured at Pretoria and at Johannesburg's Nasrec Centre. Pretoria has reported zero per cent completed, with the counting stage just reached and the releases of counted batches only just starting. At Nasrec the report recorded that counting officers were still unsure of procedure and monitors were assisting with the process. Randburg Bryanston, Sharonlea and Marlboror were all complete. Vereeniging reported nine per cent complete, the West Rand 52 per cent, East Rand 47 per cent and Johannesburg 15 per cent. All told, 24.6 per cent of the counting at the PWV's 141 stations had been completed. The following regional statistics were given: -- Western Cape: Cape Town 48 stations out of 58 completed counting with Vredendal and Beaufort West complete. -- Orange Free State: Welkom nine out of 17 completed, Kroonstad 11 of 12, Bloemfontein 19 out of 30, Bethlehem 10 out of 15. But they are also counting the additional QwaQwa station which was added on Sunday morning. -- North West: Rustenburg 18 out of 21 completed, Mafeking five out of 11, Klerksdorp all completed by 7PM, Vryburg eight out of 11. -- Eastern Transvaal -- Ermelo 20 out of 28 completed with four counting, Witbank 16 out of 19 completed. -- KwaZulu/Natal -- Durban nul out of 60 stations completed, Empangeni four out of 20, Newcastle five out of 19, Pietermaritzburg four out of eight, Port Shepstone two out of 18. -- Northern Cape -- 20 stations out of 32 completed, with De Aar and Upington expected to be finished shortly after reporting time. -- Northern Transvaal -- Ellisras both stations still counting, Nylstroom one station reconciling and two out of the four counting, Pietersburg 15 out of 21 counting and five reconciling, Phalaborwa six completed out of 20, Thohoyando two completed out of 14, with one still reconciling. -- Eastern Cape -- Port Elizabeth 12 out of 27 completed, East London ten out of 19, Queenstown completed, Umtata six out of 61 completed. Foreign voting at the DHL warehouse at Isando was reported as still proceeding very slowly.
