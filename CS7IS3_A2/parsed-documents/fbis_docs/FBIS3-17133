Vladlen Vasev, the Russian president's official representative, has come to Moldova with a package of proposals on this question: Russia will take part in the talks as a mediator. Although each delegation has its own documents prepared, they are in no hurry to make them public. All that is known is that the CSCE recommendations will be put at the basis of the talks to determine the political status of Moldavia's [Moldova's] Eastern regions. Kishinev, according to President Mirchi Snegur, is prepared to grant the Dniester Region "broad powers" but people there, at least at the level of official statements, still agree only to confederation. Vladlen Vasev, answering an IZVESTIYA correspondent's question about what specifically the Russian side had brought to the talks, noted that the content of the documents he had brought with him comes down to the idea of "broad autonomy" for the Dniester Region within the framework of a single state. In the CSCE recommendations one can discern the "Crimean option" for resolving the Dniester conflict. Kishinev rejects this option because it fears separatist movements and the region's withdrawal from the state. Promising to include in the future law on the status of the Dniester Region guarantees in the event of the republic's loss of its statehood, official Kishinev believes that is enough. Actually, the Dniester Region authorities are also manipulating the people's opinion, citing the results of a referendum in favor of their own statehood. Both sides hope to benefit from Russia's mediation. The Dniester Region is sure that Russia's participation in the talks is a guarantee that the region's interests will be protected. Moldavia is counting on using the Russian side's aid to push Tiraspol toward compromise.
