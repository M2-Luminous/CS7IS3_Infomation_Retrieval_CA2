During the session, Mr. Oide asked the Defense Agency official to present the Diet with materials on the ASDF Action Program, Part 11. In response, Mr. Murata said: "The ASDF has not been working on the study on the premise of amending the Self-Defense Forces Law, and I would like to refrain from presenting to the Diet any materials which reveal military operations." Mr. Oide refused to relent and demanded that the question be discussed at the council meeting of the Budget Committee. According to a Defense Agency official, the three services of the Self-Defense Forces have been working on studying military operations in anticipation of various emergency situations, but the substance of their study has not been made public.
