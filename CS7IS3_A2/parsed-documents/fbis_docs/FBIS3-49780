Ms. Albright briefed them on the U.S. Partnership for Peace Initiative, which has already been adopted by NATO. Ms. Albright expressed the U.S. expectation that Bulgaria will also be one of the East European states to join in this initiative. Ms. Albright voiced the U.S. Administration's willingness to continue to provide economic assistance to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. According to her, the financing of infrastructure projects, mainly in the transportation and communications fields, will be of particular importance for Bulgaria. Dr. Zhelev confirmed his insistent invitation to President Bill Clinton to visit Bulgaria. At both meetings, discussions were held on Yugoslav crisis issues and the sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro. President Zhelev expressed the view that certain indirect measures are already in hand to alleviate the losses that Bulgaria is suffering from observing the Yugoslav embargo, but we hope to obtain even better trade possibilities with the United States and to see an influx of new U.S. investments into Bulgaria.
