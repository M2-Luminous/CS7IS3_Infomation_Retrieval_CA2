Either there is no permission to search the entire convoy, or there are too many people or things, and our soldiers abide strictly to what they have on their lists. We might show a bit more flexibility toward UNPROFOR there. However, we do have to be somewhat cautious since the Muslims are doubtless getting weapons and ammunition, that is beyond any doubt. We would never accuse the UNPROFOR Command. We know that General Briquemont and all his officers are exceptionally professional and honorable soldiers, but individuals are probably smuggling arms for money. We have to be very cautious there as we do not want the war to be prolonged.
