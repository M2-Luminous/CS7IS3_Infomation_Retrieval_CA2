Construction of the project will start in January and trial operation is scheduled in August next year. By that time, the province will have an additional 33,000 inter-and intra-provincial communication lines. It has been reported that the project will run through three major regions--eastern, central south, and southwest China--and is an important component of the key fiber optic cable network to be built by the state during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period. The project starts from Hangzhou and Fuzhou in the east, passes through Jinhua, Quzhou, Shangrao, and Yingtan to reach Nanchang, and through Nanping and Fuzhou to reach Nanchang. The two lines merge into one in Nanchang and proceed to the destination of Chengdu via Changsha, Guiyang, and Chongqing. The overall length of the communication system is 4,354 km with a total of 107 stations set up along the lines. The length within the boundary of Zhejiang Province will be 433 km, and 10 stations will be set up in Hangzhou, Fuyang, Tonglu, Gantan, Jiande, Lanxi, Jinhua, Longyou, Quzhou, and Jiangshan.
