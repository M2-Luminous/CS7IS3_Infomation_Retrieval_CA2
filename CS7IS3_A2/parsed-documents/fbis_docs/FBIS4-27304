Yi Ki-pom, political functionary, visited Choe Hyong-nak, an officer who displayed an exemplary deed in carrying out his combat duty, every day when the latter was seriously injured from an unexpected accident and was receiving medical treatment in a hospital. Yi Ki-pom brought food and encouraged Choe Hyong-nak to receive medical treatment. When Choe Hyong-nak was evacuated to a hospital distant from his unit, Yi Ki-pom often visited and comforted him. Yi Ki-pom later visited Choe Hyong-nak who was residing in his home town, Samhwa-ri, Munchon, as a disabled veteran, and encouraged him, urging him to remain loyal to the party and the leader like a soldier although the guardpost was changed. At Choe Hyong-nak's wedding, Yi Ki-pom visited him with the commanding officer of the unit and congratulated him. On many occasions, he helped build Choe Hyong-nak's home, along with other soldiers of the unit. Together with him, Yi Ki-pom went to the Samhwa cooperative farm to encourage enthusiasm among the workers. Officers Yi Nam-son, Yi Pyong-man, Choe Su-hwan, and Pak Myong-son, who visited Choe Hyong-nak with Yi Ki-pom, collectively advanced into Samhwa cooperative farm where the comrade-in-arms was living when they were discharged last December, not returning home, thus blooming the great leader's grand rural area-building plan. Political functionary Hwang Tong-kyu, deeply impressed by the comradeship of the soldiers of the unit, including Yi Ki-pom, made his sister, who was working at a fabric plant, marry a disabled veteran, and made his sister Hwang Kum-suk, who was working at a cooperative farm, marry Choe Hyong-nak in August last year.
