Roadblocks were erected at the end of the Raul Aguilar Batres Road, in Zone 12 of the capital, where the demonstrators also burned many tires. It was reported that peasants, who are traveling to the capital from other regions to demand a daily minimum pay of 20 quetzals, are staging similar demonstrations. A witness reported that this morning's demonstration on the Raul Aguilar Batres Road nearly caused a fight between the demonstrators and residents of the El Mesquital neighborhood. Meanwhile, several terrorist devices planted near power pylons were defused the evening of 27 January. The police made this report: [Begin recording] [Unidentified police official] In the past few hours, based on people's calls and reports, and thanks to the citizens' cooperation, we were able to defuse a bomb planted near one of the pylons in Villanueva. We can see it from here. Bomb technicians defused this bomb at 0200 because of the possible damage it could have caused to nearby houses. This device contained aluminized [aluminizada] gunpowder, which is what has been used to damage the pylons. We found wire used for electrical installations. We found the power source: a nine-volt battery. We found part of a timing device. As you can see, this is a clock face. This was found at the downed pylon in Barcenas-Villanueva. We also found electrical wire and a timing device, which included this clock, at the pylon in Zone 18 in Las Ilusiones. This debris suggests a time bomb was involved. The debris was found at two places. Bomb technicians, honoring their motto to protect the citizens, have worked around the clock and have shown up wherever they were needed. Five explosive devices of this sort were defused at Los Antojitos Restaurant on Roosevelt Road at 0800 today. You can see them here. We urge citizens to continue to help us. We want them to call the telephone numbers that were announced. We do not want them to take any chances because we are ready to defuse such devices at any time. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] where were they found? [Police official] All the bombs shown here were among those defused in urban and rural areas. The work was done by explosive technicians. We are showing them to the citizens to ensure they can identify such devices. We want them to report any findings. We do not want them to take any risks. Above all, we want them to warn children, who have been the main victims so far. This was the case in the grenade explosions in Mazatenango. We want to prevent this. [end recording] Meanwhile, peasant organizations from the countryside and southern coast marched today toward Guatemala City to demand a wage of 22.4 quetzals for countryside workers. The peasant organizations want national and international human rights groups, especially the United Nations and International Labor Organization, to pay attention to their problems. Leaflets distributed during the demonstration carried messages like: We denounce the unjust and shameful starvation wages paid by farm owners in the rural areas of Coban, Alta Verapaz, Baja Verapaz, Peten, and Izabal. We demand that President Ramiro de Leon Carpio decree a 22.4 quetzal wage increase for peasants right away because his goal is to fight poverty, which is what he has repeatedly claimed in the media. We demand the freedom to organize, mobilize, demonstrate, and speak out in keeping with Articles 34 and 35 as well as other articles of the Constitution. We say no to [word indistinct] and forced recruitment. We say no to the popular referendum because it is another attempt to deceive the people and because the people are not allowed to participate. People: Do not allow the same people to deceive us. Join the struggle because it is the only path. Unican is here!
