The poll shows that even now, a month before he is expected to be elected, Mr Blair is rated well ahead of Mr Major in his ability to understand domestic and international problems and to handle the economy. If he became Labour leader, he would raise the party's already high rating. The Blair effect may be even larger than the latest figures suggest since there may already have been an anticipatory boost. Some of the rise in Labour support in the past two months, from 47 per cent in April to 52 per cent now, may reflect the favourable publicity about his likely election. If Mr Blair became leader, Labour's rating would rise a further three points to 55 per cent. This would be at the expense of the Tories (down one point to 23 per cent) and of the Liberal Democrats (down two points to 18 per cent). Some 14 per cent of Liberal Democrat supporters say they would switch to Labour, with only insignificant movements in the other direction. Mr Blair would attract support particularly from middle-aged, middle-class Liberal Democrat supporters in the South. The party's support in the South would decline from 28 to 24 per cent and from 24 to 20 per cent among the middle classes. On a two-month comparison, its support among the middle classes is down a quarter, and in the South it is down a fifth. The biggest positive impact on Labour support would be among 35- to 54-year-olds (up from 50 to 56 per cent), skilled workers (up from 57 to 62 per cent) and in the Midlands (up from 52 to 57 per cent). If he became leader, the party would enjoy a 44 to 31 per cent margin over the Tories among the middle classes. Mr Blair is seen as best of the three leaders by at least a two- to-one margin on understanding Britain's problems and in handling the economy. On world problems, he is ahead of Mr Major by 28 to 22 per cent, and by 35 to 20 per cent on representing Britain in Europe. Indeed, Mr Major is in third place, behind Mr Ashdown, on understanding world problems and understanding Britain's problems. The detailed figures show that public attitudes are not just affected by Mr Blair's general image, there are variations depending on the particular issue. While women take a more favourable view of his ability to understand world problems, the gender gap is reversed on understanding Britain's problems. Moreover, Mr Blair's rating on these measures is well ahead of Neil Kinnock's when he was Labour leader. In December 1990 and in July 1991, Mr Major was well ahead of Mr Kinnock by a margin of more than two-to-one on the international questions.
