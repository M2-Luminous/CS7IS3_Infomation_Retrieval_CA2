All Haitians who are lucky enough to still be alive today, who have not been shot down, and who have not been abducted by military or civilian police auxiliaries must know the fundamental reason our country is experiencing such a bad situation. What is now happening allows everyone to clearly see that the criminal 30 September 1991 coup d'etat was a master plot hatched by the imperialistic countries, especially the United States and the bourgeoisie under the command of the United States and its [word indistinct] Army, which is always there to make [words indistinct] execute to the letter all the orders of the United States. This is why nobody should be surprised at seeing the unscrupulous Army and numerous civilian police auxiliaries -- who are drug dealers, rapists, assassins, and thugs -- have fun pitilessly assassinating those who have decided for one reason or another to struggle against this criminal and repressive system. [passage omitted] The coup d'etat has taught the people a big lesson: Today, the people know who are their friends and who are enemies, as well as who the hypocrites are. If the people's enemies have put them in a situation from which they cannot defend their freedom, their rights, and their lives today, it is not because they have resigned themselves. On the contrary, the people already know -- just like all other people on earth who are struggling for their liberation -- that in all battles, there are good moments and bad moments. Nobody will tell us that we are now experiencing bad moments. We see how many people, who pretend to side with us, have used those bad moments to harm us even further, to make us suffer more. But we promise them one thing: We have a good memory; we will never forget. The time has come for us to think about the struggle for liberation, the battle for the true democracy we need.
