The press-conference was held following his meeting with Babken Ararktsyan, the Armenian Speaker of Parliament. Rasul Guliyev also said that a verbal agreement had been achieved and according to the agreement Armenian military units must withdraw from the occupied territories of Fizulinskiy, Dzhebrailskiy, Zangelanskiy, Kubatlinskiy and certain sections of Lachinskiy within twenty days after the signing of the agreement signed. It is expected that the agreement will require the Armenian forces to retreat inward from the Karabakh border by ten kilometres. At the same time Azeri forces are expected to move their forces by ten kilometres in the opposite direction, thereby creating a buffer zone where international observers will be stationed. Rasul Guliyev also noted that opposes the relocation of separate forces in the territory of Karabakh. [sentences as received] He also noted that the Lachin corridor would still be controlled by Karabakh Armenians for the purposes of communication. At the same time, Armenia will be required to end the blocade preventing communication between Nakhichevan and the rest of Azerbaijan. As soon as the agreement goes into effect, both sides will discuss the status of Upper Karabakh [Nagorno-Karabakh]. Rasul Guliyev didn't tell that whether the discussion would be conducted in the frame of the Minsk group of CSCE or not. Remarkably, Rasul Guliyev didn't mentioned the Kelbadzharskiy and Agdamskiy regions' setting free from Armenian forces. Though earlier the government leaders stated the freedom of all the occupied territories. As the observers in Baku note the conditions of the peaceful settlement which Rasul Guliyev notified in Gazakh was proposed by Moscow. Earlier, Baku opposed this plan and considered it "humiliating". However, Moscow has refused to amend the settlement plan and Azerbaijan was obliged to accept it. In light of this, Russia has taken the next successful step towards consolidating Transcaucasia. At the same time, CSCE appears to fulfill the role as on-looker in the region.
