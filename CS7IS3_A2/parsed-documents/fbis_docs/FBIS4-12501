FBIS4-12501 "drnes069dd_94005" FBIS-NES-94-069 Daily Report 9 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs 'Arafat Adviser on 'Afula, Denouncing `Terrorist Acts' 'Arafat Adviser on 'Afula, Denouncing `Terrorist Acts' TA0904092994 Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew 0700 GMT 9 Apr 94 TA0904092994 Tel Aviv IDF Radio Hebrew BFN [Interview with Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, Yasir 'Arafat's special adviser, by 'Adi Talmor in the studio on 9 April; from the "In the Current Situation" program --recorded] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Talmor] Mr. al-Tibi, you spoke with Yasir 'Arafat last night, and you have also met him in Cairo over the last few days. Is he still silent on the issue of terrorism? Has he explained to you why is he refraining from publicly denouncing these terrorist acts? [Al-Tibi] Look, I was with the chairman in Cairo before we received the news about the murder in 'Afula. At the time 'Arafat held a meeting with the Spanish foreign minister; there were a lot of Spanish, Egyptian, and other foreign journalists who wanted to speak to him about other issues, but he left the place. He did not want to speak to them. Later he refused to meet other journalists, some of them Israelis.... [Talmor, interrupting] Washington, however, is exerting great pressure on him. [Al-Tibi continues] After we received the report about the murderous attack on innocent civilians in 'Afula we held a closed meeting in which we formulated an unequivocal statement.... [Talmor, interrupting] Why has 'Arafat himself not denounced this attack, as Rabin publicly and firmly did after the Hebron massacre. [Al-Tibi] The chairman participated with us in formulating a statement, in which we expressed regret.... [Talmor, interrupting] I want to ask again, why is 'Arafat afraid to publicly denounce these terrorist acts? [Al-Tibi continues] ...and condolences for the bereaved families. This was done on behalf of the chairman, who said in the past that innocent people must not be harmed. This statement would not have been accepted without the chairman's involvement and approval. His position regarding such violence and terrorism is known; only a month ago he sharply denounced the murder of Mrs. Shoshan. I believe that the PLO statement was unequivocal. What the chairman told us on this issue is extremely clear and firm. [Talmor] Why, then, does Washington still insist that 'Arafat publicly denounce these acts? [Al-Tibi] The 'Afula attack is doubtlessly a most terrible murder of innocent people. A murder is a murder is a murder. I believe this attack must be denounced. [Talmor] I, however, still insist 'Arafat should publicly denounce the attack. Some people claim, for example, that he is afraid to publicly denounce the attack because of PLO rapprochement efforts with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. Some people even claim the PLO is coordinating with Hamas, and a public denunciation of Hamas terror acts could harm these efforts. [Al-Tibi] These claims are utter nonsense. The PLO's and 'Arafat's stand on violence and terrorism is known and is expressed whenever there are such grave incidents. This position was also expressed after the murder of Mrs. Shoshan. There is absolutely no coordination between the PLO and Hamas in this area, and whoever says so does not know what he is talking about. This issue does not deserve any further comment. [Talmor] Despite the recent acts of terrorism and the fact that it was the PLO that halted the negotiations following the Hebron massacre, the Israeli Government yesterday said it wants to facilitate the negotiations, while accusing you of delaying the talks. What is your reaction to this? [Al-Tibi] It was the Israeli side that suspended the talks several days ago, not the Palestinians. They did this due to Holocaust Memorial Day. But instead of halting the talks for one day only they did it for three days. The claim that the Palestinians halted the talks is baseless. It is in our interest to end the talks as soon as possible in order to immediately receive the authority and power in Gaza and Jericho. At this point there are still controversial issues, due to obstacles placed by the Israeli delegation on the way to achieving an agreement between the two sides -- mainly in relation to the deployment of the Palestinian police force; the timetable for such a deployment; legal responsibility, and other issues I do not want to broach. [Talmor] Do you believe you will be able to control the area when you receive the authority? [Al-Tibi] At this point the PLO is still not in control of the occupied territories. It is far away from them. The IDF is in charge there at the present time. I believe that in future the Palestinians will maintain full control of all areas under their authority.
