After several hours of negotiations, political leaders of the five parties that form the current government have finally managed to make a breakthrough towards the establishment of the remaining transitional institutions. A marathon meeting interrupted by a brief pause at 1830 discussed the problem of the functioning of the government led by Madame Agathe Uwilingiyimana, and the obstacles to the establishment of the national assembly and the transitional government extended to include the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]. Two meetings -- since there had to be two -- on 25 February and 27 February were led by President Juvenal Habyarimana in the presence of the two prime ministers, Agathe Uwilingiyimana and Faustin Twagiramungu. The meeting concluded with a communique whose contents are read to us by the principal secretary at the presidency of the Republic, Enoch Ruhigira. [Begin recording] President Juvenal Habyarimana chaired meetings on 25 and 27 February, which brought together the political parties which form the current transitional government, namely the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development, the Republican Democratic Movement [MDR], the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the Liberal Party [PL]. Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana and Prime Minister-Designate Faustin Twagiramungu participated in the two meetings, which studied the problem of the functioning of the current government led by Madame Agathe Uwilingiyimana as well as the obstacles hampering the establishment of the transitional institutions. Concerning the functioning of the current government, it was stated that so long as the transitional broad-based government has not been put in place, the current government must continue functioning through ministerial council meetings in order to tackle the challenges facing our country, particularly the problems relating to security and the problem of establishing transitional institutions. In regard to obstacles to the establishment of the transitional institutions, the 27 February meeting reached the following conclusions in order to help come up with a solution enabling the MDR and PL parties to participate in the institutions: Concerning the MDR, the list of deputies is that established on 5 January, with reservations concerning cases pending in court and the settlement that will ensue. Concerning the ministers, [words indistinct] on the MDR side, will be entitled to two ministers chosen from a list to be presented to the prime minister-designate, while Prime Minister-Designate Faustin Twagiramungu will be entitled to one ministerial portfolio. Concerning the PL party, the Mugenzi faction will nominate five deputies from its ranks, while the Ndasingwa faction will choose six. Concerning ministers, the Mugenzi faction will have two while the Ndasingwa faction will have one and will provide candidates for the post of transitional national assembly speaker. Landwald Ndasingwa expressed reservations about the (?proposal), notably on the distribution of ministries. Any faction not satisfied by the above compromise will draw lessons from the conclusions reached and will assume liability. [sentence as heard] The two PL factions will send the final lists of deputies to the president of the Republic and the prime minister by 1900 on 28 February at the latest. The prime minister-designate will present the list of ministerial candidates to the president of the Republic by 1200 on 1 March. The establishment of the transitional institutions will take place at a date to be jointly agreed upon with the RPF. Signed in Kigali on 27 February 1994. Thank you. [end recording]
