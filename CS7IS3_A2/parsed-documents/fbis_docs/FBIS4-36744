On arrival in Tehran, the Bosnian-Herzegovinan foreign minister said: We are seeking appropriate grounds to establish peace, but as the main causes of the war in Bosnia are still there, the achievement of peace seems difficult. On the Bosnian Government's views on the UN Security Council's disagreement with the dispatch of peace-keeping forces from Islamic countries to Bosnia he said: The Government of Bosnia continues its efforts to win the agreement of that organization [UN] for the dispatch of forces from Islamic countries, particularly from the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Bosnian foreign minister said that among the reasons for the Western countries' contradictory handling of the Bosnian problem are their national interests and strategic considerations.
