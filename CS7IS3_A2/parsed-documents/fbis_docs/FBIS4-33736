The Chilean foreign minister made this remark during a news conference at Government House after a one-hour meeting with President Carlos Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella. During the meeting, which he described as "cordial and very positive," Figueroa Serrano presented Menem with Chile's proposal to join Mercosur [Common Market of the South] as an "independent country." Mercosur is an integration process involving Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, and Paraguay. The visiting minister denied that during the meeting they reviewed aspects of a ruling the Rio de Janeiro Arbitration Court will have to issue within a few months on the Laguna del Desierto border conflict. Instead the Chilean foreign minister extensively discussed the Continental Glaciers treaty and said his country "is not reviewing" the possibility of resorting to international arbitration. Figueroa Serrano pointed out: "We have not discussed this issue, despite the fact that it is a formula that was included in the 1984 Peace and Friendship Treaty, because Chile's and Argentina's position is that here there is a proposed treaty that settles the Continental Glaciers border problem." Figueroa Serrano added that this solution "seems to be fair and compatible with the terms of the border treaties between Chile and Argentina and this is under discussion by the Congresses." Figueroa Serrano emphasized: "We do not want to consider any other alternative contemplated in the 1984 treaty while this issue is under discussion by the two Congresses." Figueroa added that during his meeting with Menem, "we reviewed the relationship between the two countries and were able to confirm the excellent level of our current relations." Figueroa Serrano immediately emphasized the "very close relationship" existing between President Carlos Menem and President Eduardo Frei, who will have a chance to meet again in mid-June during the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena [de Indias in Colombia] and, subsequently, on 25 and 26 August during a new working visit that the Argentine president will pay to Santiago.
