This was stated by Lee Lam Thye, vice president of Pemadam Kebangsaan [National Drug Prevention Program]. According to him, the rate of drug addiction, that is, the number of new drug abusers, has fallen by more than 50 percent, based on a study published by the Pasukan Petugas Anti-Dadah [PPAD--Anti-Drug Detachment] in the Office of the Prime Minister. In a New Year's statement issued on 2 January he said: "In 1983 the PPAD registered 14,624 new addicts, whereas in 1993 the total number declined, as 6,797 new addicts were registered." However, in the 1990's the drug addiction prevention effort using education needs to concentrate on the problem of repeat offenders. He said: "In 1993 10,637 repeat offenders were registered throughout the country, or 61 percent of all drug addicts recorded." Lee said that for this reason the drug rehabilitation effort needs to be supported by parents whose children are addicted to drugs. He said: "The community must also show a high level of commitment to welcoming drug addicts who have come to their senses." Beginning in 1994, the National Drug Prevention Program will increase its efforts to help the government in its war on drugs. He said: "This is in accordance with the objective adopted by nongovernment organizations (NGO) of helping the government resolve the social problems of the community." According to Lee, the National Drug Prevention Program will increase its preventive educational programs by establishing a rehabilitation service program for former drug addicts who have been released from treatment centers. He stated: "The National Drug Prevention Program hopes to be able to set up a larger number of rehabilitation service centers throughout the country to help former addicts return to the community." Lee said that the National Drug Prevention Program wants the people to participate in the war against drug addiction by carrying on preventive educational programs in the community. Furthermore, the people should support former addicts by giving them an opportunity to return to the community.
