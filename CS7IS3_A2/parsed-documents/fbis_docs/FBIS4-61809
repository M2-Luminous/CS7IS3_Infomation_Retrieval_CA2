Grachev told reporters in Moscow Friday that 2,500 Russian troops will remain in Estonia until the problem of Russian military retirees is solved. The minister also declared Russia may bring additional troops into the Baltic country to defend its military facilities there. In Malk's opinion, Grachev's statement clearly conflicts with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the United Nations documents about the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic states. "Grachev's statement is a direct challenge to the authority of international requirements. By threatening Estonia with stopping the troop pullout and bringing in more military, the Russian defense minister verified Moscow's strengthening attempts to force its will on other states and international organizations," Malk told BNS. Malk attached great importance to Grachev's timing of his remarks to coincide with the 19th round of Estonian-Russian troop withdrawal talks. "It can be regarded as an attempt on Russia's part to pressurize Estonia to make concessions. On the other hand, the statement of the Russian defense minister can be considered as giving up ironing out problems through negotiation," Malk said. The Foreign Ministry deputy chancellor expressed the opinion that the states, which observe without protest the growth of power policy tendencies in Russia, assume a "heavy responsibility."
