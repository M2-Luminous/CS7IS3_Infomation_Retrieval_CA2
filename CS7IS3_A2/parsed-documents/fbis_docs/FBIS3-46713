Hong, who is already under arrest in connection with the fraud, was paid off by Pak Tae-chin, a former Samsung board member. At the time, Hong was involved in the purchase of reserve engines for the Air Force's C-130 transport planes. The team may ask Pak to answer the suspicion that he bribed Hong in connection with his company's tender for the purchase contract. The investigation, including tracing the bank accounts of DLA Commander Yi Su-ik and his three predecessors (Chang Hong-yol, Yi Sang-ho and Yi Chun), will continue until Friday, two days longer than planned, according to sources. Plans to question Former Defense Security Commander Kim To-yun have been dropped, they said.
