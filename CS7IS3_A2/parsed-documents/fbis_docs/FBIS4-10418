Chief Edson Antonio de Oliveira, superintendent of the Federal Police in Rio, revealed that for the first time he has won a commitment from the Federal Revenue Secretariat to cooperate and facilitate registration of the weapons seized, or merely retained, at the airport. In six months, the revenue authorities have retained about 100 weapons, out of a total of almost a ton of equipment and ammunition. With the cooperation of the revenue authorities, the Federal Police will be able to add new information to a dossier that, in two years, has already listed more than 150 individuals involved with weapons smuggling in Rio. A good many of these are policemen, such as detective Luiz Eduardo Sato, who was arrested last month on Andarai Hill in possession of 22 kg of cocaine paste and ammunition for the AR-15, an American rifle that has become the weapon of choice for Rio bandits. Arrested along with informant Luiz Alexandre Etiene Ferreira, Sato was supplying ammunition to the enemies of his coworkers. He was assigned to the 37th precinct (Governor's Island). Proximity to the airport makes the neighborhood one of the main gateways for weapons entering Rio. Miami According to police findings, Sato was a trusted lieutenant of trafficker Romildo de Souza da Costa, aka Miltinho, of Dende Hill--also on Governor's Island--who became known as one of the biggest suppliers of weapons to Rio traffickers. Sato is thought to also have had connections to dollar-trader Oto Gomes de Miranda, who was arrested along with four other Brazilians in Miami in April 1991 and accused of smuggling weapons to Rio. The arrest of the Brazilians--who had used a Miami house to store 400 weapons for smuggling--led the superintendent of the Federal Police in Rio to begin, two years ago, an exchange with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), an agency of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. On that occasion, the Bureau estimated at more than 50 buyers the number of weapons smugglers working the Miami-Rio-Medellin route. They take advantage of Florida laws, which do not restrict the sale of firearms. Investigation After making contact with the ATF, Edson de Oliveira realized that only gradually, by patient investigatory work, could he deal a blow to the contraband in weapons in Rio. Not only were police and people with access to the air freight terminal involved--which hampered the investigation--but the business is extremely profitable and attracts people who are even willing to kill potential witnesses. For example, an AR-15 rifle costs about $700 in the United States, while in Brazil it can command the princely sum of $5,000. Just as the contraband is carried out in an "ant-like" procession, as Edson de Oliveira described it, the files on the illegal trade in weapons also require a meticulous search. The leading smugglers stroll through the airport baggage areas weekly, while they divert weapons through the Teca (Air Cargo Terminal) at Galeao. That is why Edson asked for help from the Federal Revenue Service, whose inspectors never bothered to notify the police when they seized weapons. They look at the problem as one of tax evasion. It seems simple. The revenue inspectors and technicians work with the federal police in the same space--the restricted section of the airport--but the communications links between them were never very strong. Revenue Inspector Sylvio Jose Barros de Sa Freire, assigned to the Rio international airport, admits that the inspectors took the initiative only to report criminal facts to the Office of Prosecutor of the Ministry of Finance, as the law requires. The inspectors claim the area is a "primary zone" in which only revenue officers can act. Therefore, the information on the individual carrying the weapon got lost in the desk drawers of the bureaucracy. Customs Has Few Inspectors Inspector Sa Freire admits that 200 inspectors are not enough to control the customs service at the airport. He says the number should be doubled, at least. With 30 years of service but only eight months in this section, Sa Freire reports that the Federal Revenue Secretariat has a plan to come to the aid of the customs officers, revenue watchmen who have police powers. Despite the shortage of personnel, the federal revenue inspectors at the airport have almost quintupled the sums collected at that post. In eight months, they have seized a total of $30 million in goods, including weapons. The latter usually rust away at Revenue Secretariat warehouses. Even so, Sa Freire admits that the service has been significantly dismantled in the past 10 years because of administrative policies leading to a relaxation in that sector. That is why he advocates stricter laws on the entry of weapons into Brazil. "Even the Army, which regulates weapons, ought to issue authorizations in advance," Sa Freire pointed out. Any weapon can be brought into Brazil without prior authorization, provided the Ministry of the Army [subsequently] authorizes its entry. When caught with concealed weapons, the smugglers almost always claim to be collectors. Even so, according to the Federal Police, the air cargo terminal is still one of the key points of entry for weapons that are then shipped elsewhere in boats that ply Guanabara Bay. Sa Freire also announced measures that have been put into effect since he took the assignment in July, with a view to plugging the holes in the "Swiss cheese." Using 36 cameras that operate 24 hours a day to transmit and record movements in strategic sectors, the airport revenue inspectors plan to achieve the following goals: eliminate the selection of baggage on flights considered high-risk (those from Miami, New York, and Latin countries where there is a high incidence of drug traffic), containerize the freight beginning right at the door of the airplane hold to sort of "suck out" the goods; and link computers with European and American airline systems in order to check the freight manifests.
