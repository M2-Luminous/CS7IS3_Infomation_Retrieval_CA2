On 9 November it was registered by the central election commission. Leaders of the Alliance made programmatic statements in the weekly TARA. Iurie Rosca, chairman of the Executive Committee of the KhDNF Council: "The power satellite parties are competing with still greater diligence in grovelling before the three pillars of the Chisinau administration--Snegur, Lucinschi, and Sangheli--hoping to retain their cushy positions in the future.... Unlike the rest of the political parties and entities, which represent mere groupings of transient interests and have emerged solely with the intention of getting into the future parliament at any price, the KhDNF does not consider the forthcoming elections to be an objective unto itself, or, even less, the final point of its activities. To be sure, we would certainly like to convince as many voters as possible of the need to support our platform. For us the struggle did not begin today, nor will it be completed on 27 February 1994. To us, freedom is not a preelection slogan but a current demand: freedom for the political prisoners of Tiraspol; national freedom; freedom to assert human rights and to endow peasants, whom the communist regime has reduced to poverty, with land and farm equipment; freedom to engage in economic activities unhampered by artificial barriers thrown up by the old Bolshevik guard which has usurped all power in the state; conditions for providing normal wages for the population and retirement benefits that would ensure a comfortable existence for old people." Sergiu Mocanu, another leader of the Alliance and chairman of the Presidium of the Council of the Volunteers Movement, analyzes those who fight against the statehood of Moldova. "Recently, the idea has been propagated increasingly often that sociopolitical entities that belong to the national-liberation movement are fighting against the Republic of Moldova's statehood. The absurdity of this assertion, which is being persistently propagated by the president of the state and the power satellite parties, is obvious from the very beginning. "We, participants in the combat for the integrity and independence of the Republic of Moldova, members of the Volunteers Movement, were not and cannot be against the state we have defended and for whose sake we paid a price in blood and the lives of our brethren who fell on the battlefield. We owe it to the blessed memory of their names to continue our struggle for the People and the Motherland. We are joining the election struggle because we are firmly convinced that only in this manner will we be able to rid ourselves and others of the need to fight for independence with weapons. In our actions we proceed from the principle that `the state constitutes the foundation for the exercise of the right of all peoples to decide their own destinies.' In other words, it is a means to an end, and not an end unto itself. We, those who come out for the unity of the People and the Motherland, are not the ones fighting against the state, but rather it is those who have turned the state into an instrument for exploiting our dignity for personal and clan interests." Valeriu Babara, the third activist in the preelection bloc, general secretary of the executive bureau of the OKhDM [Organization of Christian-Democratic Youth], is a figure who is little known in politics. He outlined the tasks of the OKhDM in the newspaper TARA: "Young people, who are referred to in official speeches with nauseating frequency but have almost always been ignored and abandoned, are the social group which has retained its purity and unity of ranks. In essence, they are the hope of the nation. Young people have earned indisputable credit in the national-liberation movement, in the defense of its accomplishments, in the anticommunist struggle. After the more than five years since the beginning of the national-liberation struggle, young people are coming to the conclusion that a serious threat to their future is looming, along with the future of the entire nation. Young people regard with anxiety the phenomena of a split within our society, and note the inability of our current leaders to find and use the only correct scenario for the quickest possible solution to the most serious problems we are facing. "The structure I represent wants to bring youth into the political life of the Republic of Moldova, which is frequently smothered by egoistic caprices and interests. Only young people are free from the spiritual fetters of the obsolete communist system. Members of the nomenklatura who cling to power for dear life and claim to have some kind of `political experience' forget to specify that the experience they gained in the years of the old regime is unsuitable for the new reality. All of us experienced this `Red experiment' firsthand for more than 50 years." The time has come when Bolsheviks will be forced to step aside. It is not ruled out that by Bolsheviks, Valeriu Barbara means parties of a centrist and left-wing orientation which are also striving to win the elections. The weekly RESPUBLICA has published a report on a press conference given by the leaders of the Social Democrats. Oazu Nantoi, Victor Josu, and Sergiu Bernevec answered questions put by journalists. Victor Josu: "We have decided not to make any projections on the results of the forthcoming elections. Naturally, for this reason we will not venture to assert with certainty, a priori, that we will receive more than one-half of the votes. The issue is being raised in a different manner--the Social-Democratic Party has set for itself the task of gaining no less than 50 percent of the votes of the electorate, plus one, in the elections. According to our observations, the political apathy which has prevailed in recent years has begun to abate sharply. The people are becoming interested in the party, in its program, and in its proposals. People from literally all rayons of Moldova come every day to our headquarters at 11 Cogelnicianu Street, invite us to meetings, enroll in our party, and offer us their assistance." Oazu Nantoi: "We are the first political party of a parliamentary type in Moldova. As early as three and a half years ago we perceived that our society needed a genuine multiparty system. We remain the only party which has its own doctrine--the doctrine of contemporary European Social Democrats. "From the very beginning, even under pressure, our party has advocated the idea of statehood for the Republic of Moldova. As early as 1990 we maintained that Moldova is a citizens' state. We proposed the idea of popular privatization for certificates, whereas the government proposed privatization for money. In our opinion, this would have brought about the dangerous social stratification of our society into very rich and very poor. Undoubtedly, the voters have come to know us during these three years. "We maintain that we have a rich land and a hard-working people. However, given the high density of the population and the European market, which is closed to competitors, Moldova will only survive if it complements efficient agriculture with equally efficient industry. As a mere agrarian republic we can only be an appendage of some other country. It is known that highly efficient agriculture employs a few percent of the population. We have a terrible imbalance here. Thoughtless implementation of high technology in rural areas creates the risk of making hundreds of thousands of people unemployed. "We are facing two problems--to switch to a market mode what remains of socialist industry, and to create a genuine national economy. No major research of any consequence has yet been carried out in this area. If we have no high technology or electronic industry, our state will have no future. Unfortunately, things are bad now; enterprises are closing down. Despite all the hopes of the socialists, our working class is silently dying." Experts of the ADPM [Agrarian-Democratic Party of Moldova] are also paying serious attention to economic issues. On the pages of the newspaper ZEMLYA I LYUDI, Aleksandr Muravskiy writes: "As it evaluates the progress of reform in the agrarian sector, the ADPM supports the fundamental line of transformations aimed at developing a multisectoral agriculture. "The ADPM believes that agrarian reform does not come down merely to the universal redistribution of land and the establishment of exclusively owner-operated farms, and that an economic system which combines in a rational manner small, medium-size, and large farms with various specialties and of various types and forms of ownership should be the main result of reforms. Transformations that will result in unprepared people being left alone to tackle their problems should not be implemented, like, for example, what has already happened to the Vatic sovkhoz in Orkheyskiy Rayon. The transformation of kolkhozes and sovkhozes should be accompanied by the appropriate development of a market infrastructure, including a system of credit associations, land banks, and cooperative and joint-stock enterprises which provide material and technical support to farmers and sell their products. We must not lose sight of the fact that accelerated privatization will bring about the release of a large number of employees from the sphere of agriculture, as, for example, happened in the former GDR, where in two years of reforms the number of agricultural employees has fallen by a factor of more than three. However, there it has been accompanied by tremendous financial infusions from West Germany in order to create new jobs. "Aware of the fact that radical reforms that affect the fundamental basis of a society (ownership arrangements, social, moral, and ideological priorities, the place and role of a country in the international division of labor, and so on) are unavoidably accompanied by painful phenomena, the ADPM considers it necessary to make a number of proposals aimed at invigorating social policy. Measures aimed at stabilizing and subsequently increasing the level of employment of the population are the foremost in this package of proposals, because it is virtually impossible to ensure economic and social stability in the republic in an environment of growing unemployment. To this end it is necessary: "--to invigorate, as much as possible, the activities of all state structures aimed at the development of small and medium-size businesses; "--to provide incentives, by way of tax relief and credit preferences, to industrial enterprises establishing their branches, subsidiaries, and other structural subdivisions in rural areas; "--to develop a streamlined system for using citizens who are temporarily out of work for public works to upgrade roads and localities and build facilities of social infrastructure; "--to develop and adopt a special program for the export of labor; "--to put in order the system for cadre retraining, taking into account structural changes underway in the economy of the republic." The leadership of the Socialist Party takes an ostentatiously antiunionist position in its press organ, DREPTATE: "The idea of a national renaissance of the Moldovan and other peoples residing on the territory of the republic has been stolen, distorted, and financed [as published] by the destructive forces of unionist frontism, as have been the most radiant hopes for building a sovereign, independent, and democratic Moldovan state. Our noble thoughts and expectations were defiled by the maniacal ambitions of patriot-radicals (actually, the new-fangled national-communists of Ceausescu's ilk) who fancied themselves martyrs and heroes of the indigenous nation, the infallible messiahs of its deliverance. They, the ones afflicted with the virus of national superiority and pathological xenophobia, have destroyed numerous economic links between Moldova and other republics of the former Soviet Union, thus ushering in chaos in the economy, pushing it toward catastrophe, and opening up boundless opportunities for speculation, corruption, thievery, utilitarian attitudes, and the mafia to bloom. "At present, these `chosen representatives' of the nation are trying again (yet again!) to undergo an ideological metamorphosis by creating all kinds of congresses and Christian-Labor-Democratic parties, forswearing odious frontism verbally but actually carrying on secret intrigues aimed at selling out the Moldovan people and their sovereign republic. "Let us be vigilant! Let us guard ourselves--this time, in a manly and secure manner--against the demagogic froth of slogans steeped, just as before, in anticommunism, pseudodemocracy, nationalism, and inhumanity. They should not pass now! Let us not be misled by their moaning about, you see, `dark pro-imperial forces' which have gotten out of the trenches and allegedly pinned on them--who have `given back' to us the language, the alphabet, the tricolored flag, and the `Romanian, awaken!' anthem--the blame for inconceivable poverty, spiritual decay, and the incredible suffering of the people. They say that the `fifth red-and-brownshirt column,' a figment of their sick imagination, is to blame. "The people have been silent too long! However, they have not slept a lethargic sleep. They have mustered their will and pondered their decisive word. We will hear this word--wise, unprejudiced, every kind [as published] of word--during the forthcoming early elections to the parliament and local organs of power." A commentary is probably unnecessary. The reader will himself find the party and slogans that are to his liking.
