In a statement after the ANAP Chairmanship Council meeting, Yilmaz said that Turkey has needed a stability program since the end of 1991, but that a very important period of time was wasted. He pointed out that the necessity was felt more strongly at the end of 1992. He stressed that this issue was not considered even in the 1994 budget. Yilmaz maintained that the economic stability program was delayed as a result of coalition negotiations. [Begin Yilmaz recording] Before everything else, a stability program needs a consensus that a program is necessary. There is a consensus in our public today that these measures are indeed necessary. However, we are concerned that an incomplete stability program might destroy this consensus. [end recording] [passage omitted]
