It is the responsibility of all political forces to choose that alternative, Marcos points out. "If the political parties take the wrong stand on the convention, they will eventually take the wrong stand on the war, which will blow up in their faces again sooner or later," he insists. He continues to say that the convention, for the time being, "offers the only opportunity to unite a scattered civilian movement with an isolated but localized military movement," thus forcing "a peaceful transition or at least making the military phaseout less bloody." "Why should someone who demands freedom, justice, and democracy be labeled a dreamer," he wonders. He says that the convention, "this crossroads, this point of convergence with civilian society, organized or disorganized, is the first item on the EZLN agenda." In this third installment of an interview held in the Lacandona Jungle, Marcos reaffirms the need for the union of "civilian and military revolutionaries." Asked if he still has hopes, Marcos answers: "Under the circumstances, that is the only thing that can keep us on our feet and alive. The problem now is to find out whether this hope has a trigger or a ballot." [Ibarra] Any hope of holding the convention? [Marcos] It would be premature to say. For the time being, we feel the convention offers the only opportunity to unite a scattered civilian movement with an isolated or localized military movement. We believe that the convention, inasmuch as it represents the convergence of military and civilian efforts toward the same purpose, can still bring about a peaceful transition or at least make the military phaseout less violent. [Ibarra] There is an electoral process under way. Political forces are challenging each other. For instance, why can the PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] not say: I am betting on the convention, not the elections, or the PAN [National Action Party]? What would happen if those organized political forces did not cooperate? [Marcos] The political parties must start from reality. The media have pointed out that none of the parties has succeeded in achieving a consensus among those who abstain. That is to say, the parties are facing a very high degree of abstentionism and will share the votes. According to the official list, there are between 45 and 50 million registered voters, but everyone is taking it for granted that at least half of them will not vote. In other words, the parties will have to share between 22 and 25 million votes. According to the most optimistic estimates, the winning candidate will receive between 9 and 12 million votes. The winner will have to govern in an ungovernable climate. In other words, the winner will receive between 15 and 20 percent of the vote at most. Whether he likes it or not, his government will be a minority. If I were the winning candidate, I would be seriously concerned about that 50 percent, the more than 20 million people who will not vote because they are not interested in politics or elections or because they believe in violence. I would not say they would necessarily take up arms, but they would look favorably on an armed movement, one that could break up the electoral system. The political parties are aiming in the wrong direction, at those who are determined to vote and will vote. We aim at those who will not. If the political parties take the wrong stand regarding the convention, they will eventually take the wrong stand on the war, which will blow up in their faces again sooner or later. That 50 percent of registered voters who will not vote represents the potential for war. That is how we see it. [Ibarra] Does this have the potential for passivity and conformism? [Marcos] Our analysis is based on this group. Passivity and conformism are a force that will go in one way or another. It could be the balance will tilt in one direction and things will remain the same, but the balance could also tilt toward war if the group, in one way or another, decides: "Well, let there be a war. We will not do anything to stop it." Isolated groups or, as they are called, groups of lunatics could start mobilizing and encouraging the other millions of Mexicans in that 50 percent to move to a more radical and permanent option. [Ibarra] Mexico had a convention in the past, the Aguascalientes Convention. Are you urging a convention as part of a revolutionary tradition, or do you believe you can carry out a task similar to the one undertaken at the Aguascalientes Convention in the past? [Marcos] We believe we can keep the task that was not accomplished at the Aguascalientes Convention. Of course, it is also part of the EZLN's historic right to call to this convention. I want to tell you, I really want to insist to the country that we are not resorting to foreign models to make our demands or to further our political and military course. The 1914 Aguascalientes Convention was an effort to unite the military and civilian movements of those times. The Zapatists understood it in this manner, but they were defeated on this issue at this convention. The 1914 Convention was an agreement, or, rather, was an attempt to reach an agreement to get the military forces to become civilian-oriented. The Zapatists of those times insisted that it had to be an agreement between the military forces and the civilians to further this transition, but the revolutionary civilians and military forces did not reach an agreement for several reasons. The objective of the 1994 Convention, to which we are calling, is to try to associate or to hold a meeting between revolutionary civilians and revolutionary military forces to initiate this passage to democracy in Mexico. [Ibarra] Other attempts are being made. The peace commissioner himself was working hard to further an initiative for a government of transition or a wide front for democracy. What do you think of those efforts? [Marcos] We view those efforts with skepticism because other people's logic will say what is to be done, as they are the ones who will make the summons a success. The government always says it is successful in the measure that it appears in media headlines. Political parties and other forces believe they are advancing based on the amount of intellectuals in their groups or the space the media gives them. This is how they appraise the situation, but, later on, reality shows them they were wrong. We are calling those who do not have space in the newspapers, those who do not want to give conferences or write in newspapers, those who are voiceless and faceless, as we have said previously. We are calling them to this convention or to reach this agreement between civilians and military forces. "We do not reject this type of initiatives or fronts, but, in one way or another, if they are perceptive and honest, they will have to converge and agree with the convention for which we are calling or at least to reach an agreement regarding it." [Ibarra] It is frequently said the isolation, the jungle, the years of struggle here can inhibit you from having a coherent, cohesive vision of the future to design a project for the country that can be offered to all of Mexico. [Marcos] Regarding our historic blindness, I believe the events between January and July have shown that if we do not have much lucidity, there are others who are at least blinder than we are. This is the EZLN's modest, or, better said, we admit that the reality is: There is no project for the future of the country. We are saying: Let us sit down and talk with those who are going to have to carry out, to deal with, to confront or organize the country's future. We have to sit down and talk about it, and the place is at the convention. We have to reach an agreement, to discuss what it is we want, and, in that sense, the EZLN's voice will be one among the others. What worries us greatly is: Why do they say a person is a utopian if he asks for freedom, justice, and democracy? To what point have we gotten in this country that we say a person who is fighting for the most basic human rights is a utopian? To what point has skepticism contaminated, poisoned people already? [Ibarra] Are you referring to the skepticism? [Marcos] Look, how can an army take up arms for freedom, justice, and democracy and this be considered as utopian. We want a democratic, free, and just country, and this is utopian? What has happened to the people who think and write? What are they doing with their thoughts, their work, their life? In what way or up to what point has skepticism poisoned them? Is it to the point that they say nothing is possible? In what measure is this conformism or passivity? "What we are trying to do is open a space so that, perhaps, all the skepticism in the country will not necessarily become skepticism to the nth power and to have the possibility of realizing it is not a utopia but, rather, a right for which we have to fight. In the worst case, all the revolutions have been a utopia prior to being started, and all major changes in the history of mankind have been a utopia the day before they became a reality. [Ibarra] What is the first point on the EZLN program at this time? [Marcos] The convention. All our efforts will now be focused on establishing that bridge, that link of unity, that point of consensus with civilian society, organized or unorganized. The convention, if it materializes, is the only possibility for the EZLN and the country to make a peaceful journey to democracy, without violence. [Ibarra] Weapons today are a guarantee of this peaceful journey. Does the EZLN's existence change the outlook? [Marcos] Yes, there is another option now. The option before was: You either settle for what I offer or you will face my weapons, that is, their weapons. We are now saying: You either agree with the decision of a majority or settle for a very long war that would wear down both parties, and we are the only ones who have nothing to lose. We made no investments in the stock market, and we have nothing to lose in this regard. Those who have investments, prestige, and so on, need to be careful; we do not. They either accept this decision imposed through a peaceful means or accept that hell will last several years. [Ibarra] When we refer to hell and the possibility of the explosion of a conflict, many talk about 22 August as the day when this could happen. There could, however, also be some sort of propaganda to frighten the people. [Marcos] I think that January, well, actually the six months of war, or armed truce, or armed peace, as some call it, demonstrated once again the limits of the media, the limits of propaganda. What started in January or February, I mean the possibility of a new ethical code or a new way to handle the media, finally resumed its course. Efforts that certain media were making to democratize themselves to genuinely meet the expectations started to disappear. There was an attempt to be the protagonist; they were certain about their influence on public opinion until we proved them wrong on 10 June 1994, when we said no. "Throughout that period, everyone insisted in the media that the armed struggle was no option. I am glad that peace is on the way, that there was already a negotiation, that it is only a matter of time, and that there will be a spectacular signing. I insist that faceless and nameless armed forces, which respond to the EZLN, have grown throughout the country and in certain sectors. If they are betting on propaganda, they are betting to lose; if they are betting on television spots and newspaper headlines, by the way, they will lose, and so will the media." [Ibarra] Finally, you are talking to an atomized left wing. You told them: Let us reach a consensus on what we do not want, and later we will reach a consensus on what we want. Is this possible? What project are you proposing to the left wing, and what will be your stand toward the elections, which are just round the corner? What will the EZLN do with its political and moral strength? Who will receive it? Where will it channel it? [Marcos] We do not know; this is quite a problem. We think that historic time is going by faster than calendar time; the historic time between 1 January and 10 June, when we said no to the government proposals, that is, between the first and the second Lacandona Jungle declarations. In terms of historic time, it was very meaningful to this country. This means that it is possible to make historic time run faster than calendar time and that this process to achieve unity and agree on what we do not want -- that we no longer want a state party -- includes not only an atomized left wing, but that it could also lead the middle class and important wealthy sectors. "In one way or another, the clumsiness of the state party, as it promoted a neoliberal and arbitrary project at the political level, also affected the interests of the high classes. I think that the stand of saying no to the state party will find supporters in broad sectors of the population. The problem arises when we say: We want to be Maoists, Trotskyists, orthodox, social Christians, democrats, centrists, and so on; that is where problems start. When a person starts to say how things should be, he starts, even unwillingly and spontaneously, to divide and dissolve. "But if we try to reach a consensus on what we do not want, we believe we can participate. We may not be the leaders, but we can participate in a broader movement under the common cause of opposing the official party. We have had enough of the official party and everything it implies. This historic time is about to whom we should give our political support. We believe many forces will establish their positions in the coming days, even regarding the convention. Whom could we support, whom could be the man to receive our support, or does a transition to democracy have a name? I am telling you: We do not know any of this yet. We would have to know if a leader such as Francisco I. Madero will come forth in this historic time, given we are referring to the historic past that nourishes the EZLN. Finally, the EZLN is foreseeing that even if a leader is missing, at least there will be, at the social and civic levels, the need for a transition government and a new Constitution, which regulates the new political relations. It would be good to have a leader at the right time and the right moment. We cannot commit our political endorsement, our support to someone unless the historic moment indicates he is worthy of it. By historic time, we mean the mobilizations and the explicit commitment to assume the EZLN causes; otherwise, we could implicitly acknowledge that or we could, in a given moment, raise those causes. The EZLN believes a government must have a clear commitment to advance the causes for which we rose up in arms. Our causes are outlined in 11 points, which are mainly encompassed in democracy, freedom, and justice. [Ibarra] The EZLN would somehow be a force depending on historic forces. It would be a catalyst, a thermometer. [Marcos] We believe that does not mean there is a fever. The EZLN is conducting an internal evaluation and is obtaining a "negative" result. It is conducting an external evaluation at two levels through the tables set up for consultations and informal consultations, and the result is also "negative." We believe this is right, that the measure was the correct one, and that we must assess the situation again. We must again set the thermometer for August, that is, from now until to August -- what will happen between now until August -- and examine whether a peaceful transition is still possible. We are optimistic and believe a peaceful transition is still possible. What concerns us is whether a leader will come forth. [Ibarra] The responsibility is no longer in your hands but in the hands of people in the cities and towns, people outside the EZLN. [Marcos] Definitely, because I must clarify that even in military terms, we are not at a military disadvantage vis-a-vis our situation in January. In other words, we are not weaker militarily than in January, nor have we more to lose now than we did then. On the contrary, in military terms, we have more advantages: Our morale is higher now than in January; we have more people now than then, and we have nothing to lose by waiting and saying if you have another alternative try it. We cannot do any worse than we did. In any event, whatever happens will be better for us as an organization, as the EZLN. "Time flies for the civilian sector; historic time flies. I insist on that, because I always get answers based on a calendar. I tell the government that if they would have thought on 1 January of stopping the war in 12 days, they themselves would have said it was not enough days, but I believe that had they organized themselves, it would have been enough time. Now, there is much effervescence, which could generate results at the Convention." [Ibarra] Do you have any hope? [Marcos] Yes, definitely. Hope is the only thing that under the current circumstances can still keep us alive and on our feet. The problem now is determining whether that hope has a trigger or a ballot.
