This is the case, for example, at the former "Foton" production association in Simferopol, which used to provide services for the defense sector but which has now become a commercial science and production firm and is rapidly increasing its output of nontraditional goods. Those goods include microwave ovens, large-screen TV sets, 55-channel satellite TV receivers, and antennae. They are cheaper than their foreign equivalents and can be bought not for dollars but for Ukrainian coupons. Structural reorganization is a means of salvation for many other enterprises in conditions when there are no raw materials, demand for traditional goods has fallen, and the energy crisis has become extremely acute. The Crimean Supreme Soviet decree on an open economy regime in the peninsula offers good scope for this kind of reorganization. This decree will encourage the participation of foreign partners and investors in the development of a modern production industry.
