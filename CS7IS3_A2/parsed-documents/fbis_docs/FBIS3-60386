The Government's radioactive waste advisers have received urgent instructions to review alarming new estimates by Government and independent scientists of likely worldwide deaths from the Thorp plant at Sellafield in Cumbria. The move follows meetings between Environment and Health Ministers who fear the health risks from Thorp may scupper Government plans to approve the plant's operation within the next few weeks. A senior Government source said last week that the issue of public dose levels was now regarded as `very serious' and 'potentially fatal' to the plant's future. The effects of discharges from Thorp into the air and sea is causing increasing concern among both the British public and foreign governments. Last week, the Health and Safety Executive confirmed that childhood leukemia levels 10 times the national average found in the village of Seascale nearby could be partly caused by radiation from Sellafield. Environment Minister Tim Yeo last week instructed the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee to advise the Government on the validity of calculation methods for radiation doses and subsequent worldwide deaths. The move follows the forwarding to Ministers this month of an alarming new report by the Government's official radiation watchdog, the National Radiological Protection Board. The report estimates that radiation doses afflicting the global population from the nuclear complex will almost quadruple after Thorp begins operating. The new worldwide levels, which would cause around 200 deaths for every year of Thorp's operation, are also more than three times greater than the previous highest totals, reached in 1975. Ministers have repeatedly stated that public radiation doses will not be allowed to return to such levels. These official figures are much higher than recent estimates produced for Greenpeace by radiological expert Dr David Sumner of Glasgow University that provoked widespread public concern. He estimated that the first 10 years of Thorp's operation would sow the seeds of 600 cancer deaths worldwide from Sellafield. The protection board report partly blames the steep rise in worldwide doses on proposed Thorp emissions of two very long-lived cancer-causing radionuclides, iodine-129 and krypton-85, which `circulate globally and therefore irradiate large numbers of people.' However, the report claims less than a quarter of future total Sellafield doses will originate from Thorp. And it stresses that the accuracy of its dose estimates are `questionable' as they are based on radiation effects over 10,000 years, during which new technology may greatly reduce risks. Nevertheless, the protection board figures will boost opponents' demands for a wide-ranging public inquiry before Thorp is allowed to operate. `However small the doses may be, people will die as a result and it will be very hard to justify allowing the 1970s levels to be breached,' said Dr Sumner. Officials fear these new concerns over Thorp's health effects could unravel the Government's entire case for approving the plant. Under the Radioactive Substances Act 1960, every new radioactive discharge must be justified by demonstrating that economic gains will outweigh the damage to human health. But the original economic justifications for Thorp have now largely disappeared. Not only will the plutonium it will produce be largely redundant because the new generation of fast-breeder reactors it was meant to fuel have never been built, but foreign customers are now expressing doubts about the plant's viability.
