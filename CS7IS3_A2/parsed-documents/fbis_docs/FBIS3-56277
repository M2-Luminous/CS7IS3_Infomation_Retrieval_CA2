Bill Clinton Will Review Russian Political Forces -- for the Most Part Pro-Presidential"] [Text] U.S. President Clinton has arrived in Moscow. No matter how the current state of Russian-U.S. relations and especially the role of today's Russia in the world might be assessed, this is still a visit by the head of one superpower to the capital of another superpower (and not only in the nuclear sense): a demonstration, as it were, of mutual respect, recognition, and mutual acceptance of the sides' parity. If the Russian president arrives in Washington, then, under diplomatic protocol, the heads of all the power branches in the United States would be introduced to him. Unfortunately, there is a very long way to reciprocity here. President Clinton can hold equal-to-equal talks with President Yeltsin. But farther down the line, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin can do little more than demonstrate to the U.S. guest the proposed variants for the composition of his cabinet. Things are even worse with the parliament: Both chambers have no chairmen, but perhaps the occupant of the White House would be pleased to take a look at the symbolic pair of elders: Mr. Lukava (Liberal Democratic Party of Russia) and Mr. Chernichenko (Russia's Choice) -- a model of Russian political diversity, as it were. From the Constitutional Court (the third branch of power) it would be possible to present either acting chairman Vitruk, if he is still alive, or Luchin, who has called a hunger strike. Oh, these Russian bears! Oh, this mysterious Russian soul! It would also be good to show the leaders of the party that won the elections. But who would this be? Apparently Mr. Gaydar (but for some reason the winners are almost in the minority in the State Duma in relation to the losers). Or Mr. Zhirinovskiy? Or Mr. Zyuganov (after Boris Yeltsin announced the final abolition of communism in Russia this would be especially rich). Of course, Yegor Gaydar in not uninteresting to the U.S. President in his present (not his Duma) capacity, but how long will he continue there? What matters here is not only the will of the president but also the will of Gaydar himself. The latter does not like to stay too long in a dubious situation. Especially since he (unlike Yeltsin) has nowhere to hurry. No doubt, not everything is so sad in the ranks of the Moscow political nomenklatura. Yuriy Baturin's latest appointment as national security adviser -- if this is not a purely bureaucratic intrigue (on the part of the president) -- is a brilliant move which, I for one, did not expect from Yeltsin. In its long-term implications this is the sole accurate act in the last several months (since 20 September). The overall picture however is tragicomic (an optimist would say "transitional"). There are no other guards while the presidential guard is strongly divided: Some are knee-high to a grasshopper and some are taller than the David himself who broke the neck of the Goliath of communism. Let us be like the Chinese: Carefully look into the background of all major events in the course of the visit. How the master of ceremonies positions the figures there, so the latest (for the next few months) face of the Russian power establishment will be. A strong presidential flux is unmistakable but what interests us are the other features of the face drawn with its hands.
