But now, after six years of negotiations, a black cloud is hanging over the closure ceremony that will be held in Marrakech on 12 April for the most ambitious round of negotiations for the deregulation of world trade: the Uruguay Round of GATT talks. The United States does not want countries where workers are exploited to obtain easy access and trade advantages for their products in international trade. The United States demands that the World Trade Organization that will be officially created during the Marrakech meeting study the subject. But Brazil and all the poor countries that already are feeling like possible victims of trade retaliations refuse to discuss the problem. Brazilian Ambassador to GATT Felipe Lampreia protested the idea at the Uruguay Round Negotiating Committee. "Labor issues must not be discussed by a trade organization but by the International Labor Organization," said Graca Lima, one of the Brazilian negotiators. According to Lima, the U.S. proposal is premature and may open the door to a new form of trade barrier against products from developing countries.
