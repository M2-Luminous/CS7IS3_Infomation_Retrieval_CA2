When talking about the current economic work, Zhao Zhihao stressed: All levels of departments in the province should pay close attention to summer planting, harvesting, and field management in a timely manner to ensure bumper harvest and should be meticulous in organizing economic operation with focus on improving economic efficiency in order to resolve conspicuous problems and promote the sustained and sound development of the provincial economy. Zhao Zhihao said: From January to April, the general economic situation of the province was very good; various reforms, particularly the reforms of finance, tax, investment enterprises, and foreign exchange management, proceeded smoothly; old systems were giving way to the new steadily; and positive and remarkable results were achieved in economic development. However, some conspicuous contradictions and problems also existed in economic operation. In particular, deficits of enterprises increased, more enterprises faced difficulties, and the margin of price hikes was high. All levels of departments must pay high attention to these problems. Zhao Zhihao stressed: This year, wheat is doing well throughout the province, and the wheatfields promise a good harvest. All levels of departments should be prepared in ideology and work and seize the current good opportunity to quickly harvest and thresh wheat in order to reap a bumper harvest. At the same time, good preparations should be made for the sowing of summer cotton in order to sow as much cotton as possible. All levels of grain management departments should voluntarily and conscientiously make preparations for procuring summer grain. Zhao Zhihao stressed: We should successfully organize the operation of industrial economy by firmly persisting in the central task of improving economic efficiency. We should go all out to promote sales and increase the marketing rate of products. We should resolutely correct the erroneous tendency of blindly competing for high-speed development. We should exert great efforts in improving enterprise management and strictly controlling the quality of products, the cost of production, and the operation of funds with a view to improving economic efficiency, by focusing on straightening out and strengthening leading bodies of enterprises and on strengthening the basic work. We should go all out to help the enterprises facing difficulties find out the roots of their problems and study how to develop themselves in the future. Great efforts should also be made to help such enterprises resolve their problems concerning livelihood of workers. Zhao Zhihao stressed emphatically: All levels of governments and responsible departments should organize forces to go deep into enterprises to help them resolve their practical problems. They should seize the current opportunity and resolutely depend on reforms to resolve problems for the small and medium-sized enterprises that have long been operated at a lose.
