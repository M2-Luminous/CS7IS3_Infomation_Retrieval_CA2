This information was supplied yesterday to FOLHA by economist Jose Marcio Camargo, one of the designers of the party economic policy. The tax, which will be collected only in 1996, is one of the sources of money that the PT intends to use to create 8 million jobs during its government term. The party also intends to transfer 10 million workers from the informal to the formal sector of the economy. According to Camargo, the fund to be created with the tax on fortunes will feed on the profits of the investments that were made. Camargo added that another fund, which will be created in 1996, will serve the same purpose, but no decision has yet been made on the source from which the money for it will be obtained. Before creating this fund, the government will reportedly finance infrastructure projects for creating jobs with money from the budget and from social funds. PT economists were due to meet last night in Rio de Janeiro, under federal PT Deputy for Sao Paulo Aloizio Mercadante, to debate the program for jobs creation and the party macroeconomic program.
