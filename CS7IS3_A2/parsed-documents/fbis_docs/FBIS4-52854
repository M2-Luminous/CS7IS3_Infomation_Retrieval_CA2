The package is in line with economic stimulus measures announced last April and September. The government has vowed to come up with full-scale deregulatory measures by the end of June as part of efforts to spur domestic demand and hence the nation's appetite for imports. If enacted, 134 items of regulations will be abolished, 16 items will be relaxed and 27 items will be rationalized, the officials said. Among the laws to be revised by the bills is one to abolish obligations to report to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) the establishment of an export and import association. The officials said the government hopes the enactment of the bills will help revitalize activity in the private sector.
