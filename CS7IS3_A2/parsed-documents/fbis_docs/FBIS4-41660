FBIS4-41660 "drsov123cc_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-123 Daily Report 25 Jun 1994 INTERREGIONAL AFFAIRS ITAR-TASS Carries Press Review for 25 Jun ITAR-TASS Carries Press Review for 25 Jun LD2506064094 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 0512 GMT 25 Jun 94 LD2506064094 Moscow ITAR-TASS English BFN ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] [Text] Moscow June 25 TASS ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries a report about the concluding of Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to the U.S. Under the headline "Al Gore Enthusiastic, Chernomyrdin Reserved." The Russian prime minister attended in the U.S. a regular session of the intergovernmental Russian-American commission on economic and technological cooperation. U.S. Vice President Albert Gore described the results of that work as remarkable success. TRUD publishes in this connection an interview with Chernomyrdin, who assures the public that the money spent on the visit did not go to waste, including from the social point of view. "What are actually the contracts on space exploration that the delegation is bringing home?" the journalist asked Chernomyrdin. The prime minister said in reply that "in fact, they mean support for our industry, specifically, its branches connected with arms manufacturing, those where conversion is now going on, which are in a difficult situation today." He pointed out that Russian-American relations were assessed only in a positive way and rejected inventions of those 'prophets' by both sides of the Atlantic, who predict the worsening of those relations. "This is out of the question. Our relations are improving and will continue to improve," Chernomyrdin said. The newspaper carries contradictory comments of deputies to the State Duma about the recent decree of President Yeltsin "On urgent measures to protect the population from gangsterism and other manifestations of organised crime." For example, A. Ledzins from the December 12 group believes that if the decree is put into effect, this will get Russia back by more than 50 years, to the period when the dividing line between law and arbitrariness actually ceased to exist. However, N. Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, thinks that it is too late already to try and resolve the crime problem with the help of civilised methods. "Instead of arguing with the decree, it is necessary to adopt as quick as possible the laws that will permit to really start tackling it," he said. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA and other newspapers highlight President Yeltsin's statement at the Kerkira island, Greece, who said that the agreement on partnership and cooperation between the Russian Federation and the European Union, signed there, is a document of great historic importance, which made it possible to take a decisive step towards the restoration of unity in the european continent. In the opinion of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, one of major results of Yeltsin's trip is that the European Union and Russia will start looking for ways to create a free trade zone. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA publishes an interview with Aleksandr Tushinskiy, first deputy defence minister of Belarus, who is advocating the restoration of ties between the two countries, including between Russian and Belarusian arms-manufacturing enterprises. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA highlights the results of presidential elections in Belarus, where, according to the preliminary results, the lead was captured by Aleksandr Lukashenko, head of the parliamentary anti-mafia commission, who got 40-45 per cent of votes. In this connection the newspaper describes as "political amateurishness" appeals in the State Duma, specifically those of Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of its committee for ties with CIS member states, who urged at a special press conference to support Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich at the elections in Belarus, and ex-prime minister Leonid Kuchma -- at the elections in Ukraine. In the opinion of the newspaper, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk is "the only politician who is capable of keeping Ukraine away from sliding down from economic difficulties to political confrontation of individual regions and social groups." SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA writes that, by voting for Lukashenko, "Belarusians actually voted against Yeltsin," because the Russian president had a meeting with Kebich shortly before the elections. The newspaper describes Kebich's visit to Moscow as a "gross mistake". In its opinion, the trip eroded his prestige, because Yeltsin in not popular in Belarus. Ths same idea is expressed by PRAVDA in its article on this subject, which is entitled "Lukashenko Packing Suitcases of his Rivals." The newspaper highlights the words of Yuriy Belov, chairman of the central executive committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, who believes that "socialism has not disappeared, because the communist movement in Russia has not disappeared either." In his opinion, opponents of socialism "are especially afraid of its new image", which is in line with historic traditions of the great Russian nation. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article about prospects of settling the Russian-Chechen crisis. It writes that the relations between the two countries (on the level of authorities) "have entered a new stage of development." President Yeltsin's decision to start talks with the Chechen authorities, the recent trip of Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudaev to Sochi and the "pro-Yeltsin tone of official statements coming now from Groznyy" are proof to that, the newspaper points out. However, the initial stands of the two sides are diametrially opposed to each other, and this is why the talks are not going to be easy.
