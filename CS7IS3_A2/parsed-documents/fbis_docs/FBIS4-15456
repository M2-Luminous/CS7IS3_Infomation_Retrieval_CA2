Diplomats Believe Boris Yeltsin Was Given the Wrong Document To Sign"] [Text] "All talk of turning our radar station at Skrunde into a military base is unfounded," I was told by Yelena Agapova, assistant to the Russian defense minister for relations with the public and the press. A few days previously, the Defense Ministry Information and Press Directorate had refuted an ITAR-TASS report on this matter. Chief of General Staff Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov did not and could not have told the agency's correspondent about the transformation of the radar station into a military base. Russia had and has no such plans. Nonetheless, statements by Russian Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev have repeatedly mentioned plans for the creation of 28 military bases outside the country's borders. Where is it proposed to put them? The locations of some of them are already known, according to the minister's statements at press conferences: In Georgia, where under an interstate agreement -- which alone can serve as the legal foundation for such bases -- Russian military bases are to be located in Akhalkalaki, Batumi, where there are Russian divisions, Tbilisi (the headquarters of the Transcaucasus Group of Forces is there), and Poti, where Russian Navy ships can be stationed in the port zone. The total number of our troops will not exceed 25,000. There are also troops of ours in Armenia, in the garrison of Gyumri (formerly Leninakan). They are also there under an interstate agreement between Yerevan and Moscow. The locations of the other military bases are not yet known, since there are no interstate treaties concerning them. Without such treaties all talk of such bases, the military department believes, can only act as a basis for political speculation by various forces in certain states, as is happening in the case of the Skrunde radar station.
