Situated more than 40 kilometers from Shenzhen and over 50 kilometers from Hong Kong, the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant has two generating units each with a capacity of 900,000 kilowatts. After seven years' construction, the No. 1 reactor unit went into commercial operation on February 1 and the No. 2 unit started trial operation today after it completed its "critical state" test in January. It is expected to go into commercial operation in the first half of this year. The Chinese and foreign experts who are working at the plant said that the type of reactors, their installation and try-outs, and waste materials to be discharged are safe and reliable. They noted that it poses no threats to nearby regions. The reactors at the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant are of the pressurized water type, which has a high safety coefficiency. During their installation, Chinese and foreign engineers and workers adopted a series of quality control measures to ensure safe operation. Zan Yunlong, general manager of the Guangdong Nuclear Power Joint Venture Co. Ltd., said that in constructing the nuclear power plant, his company has strictly followed the principle of "quality first and safety first". Zan, who has worked in the nuclear power industry for many years, said that the project was completed in line with the laws and regulations on nuclear safety issued in China and it passed several examinations and appraisal by the International Atomic Energy Agency. R. Vella, operations manager from France, said that the operational system of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is like that of the nuclear power plants in France. He said that the operators of the plant received training in France and they have made remarkable progress with the help of 20 French technological advisers. He said that he was confident of the ability of the Chinese technological personnel to operate the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant. He noted that it is totally groundless to say that the nuclear power plant threatens the safety of Hong Kong and nearby regions. Experts said that the waste gas of the plant will be processed before it is discharged into the air. The radiation index of the processed gas is at a much lower level than that by radiation of the universe. The waste liquids will be recycled for re-use. The waste materials will be sealed up in uniquely designed containers for ten years before they are buried deep underground and they will cause no safety problems.
