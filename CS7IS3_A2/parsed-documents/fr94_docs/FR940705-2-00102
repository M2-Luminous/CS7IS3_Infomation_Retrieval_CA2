EA 93&hyph;236, IA 94&hyph;003; ASLBP Nos. 94&hyph;692&hyph;05&hyph;EA, 94&hyph;691&hyph;04&hyph;EA] Nuclear Support Services, Inc., EA 93&hyph;236: Order Requiring the Removal of an Individual From NRC Licensed or Regulated Activities and Order Directing Review of Personnel Security Files (Effective Immediately) and Robert C. Dailey IA 94&hyph;003: Order Prohibiting Involvement in Certain NRC&hyph;Licensed or Regulated Activities (Effective Immediately); Hearing and Prehearing Conference This Licensing Board has been established to preside over the hearing requested on April 29, 1994 by Nuclear Support Services, Inc. (NSSI) and Mr. Robert C. Dailey, challenging two enforcement actions issued by the NRC Staff on March 22, 1994. The enforcement actions were published at 59 FR 14429 (March 28, 1994) (NSSI) and 59 FR 14688 (March 29, 1994) (Dailey). The first of these actions would order NSSI to remove an individual from NRC-licensed or regulated activities for five years; the second would prohibit that same individual from participating in NRC-licensed or regulated activities for the same period. In each case, the issue for hearing, as specified in the respective enforcement actions, is whether the particular order should be sustained. By Memorandum and Order (Consolidating Proceedings and Granting Extension of Time), dated May 4, 1994 (unpublished), the Licensing Board granted the hearing requests and consolidated the two proceedings. Notice is hereby given that the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will conduct a prehearing conference in this consolidated proceeding on Tuesday, July 12, 1994, beginning at 2:00 p.m. The conference will be held in the new Commission hearing room, 3rd floor, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, North Bethesda, Maryland. Members of the public are invited to attend but may not participate in the course of the conference. Among matters to be discussed will be the precise issues for the hearing, discovery, and scheduling. Parties are invited to submit proposed agenda for the conference, to be in the hands of Board members by close of business Thursday, July 7, 1994. As permitted by 10 CFR 2.715(a), persons who are not parties to the proceeding are invited to submit limited appearance statements. Such statements do not constitute testimony or evidence but, to the extent pertinent to issues in these proceedings, may assist the Board and/or parties in their deliberations as to scope of the issues to be considered.

For the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board. Charles Bechhoefer, Chairman, Administrative Judge. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16197 Filed 7&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M
