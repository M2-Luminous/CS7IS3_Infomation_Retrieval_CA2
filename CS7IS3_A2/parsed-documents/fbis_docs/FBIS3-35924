Although most political parties are to one extent or another pinning definite hopes on settling relations with their northern neighbor, Georgia's most radical political forces continue to back confrontation with Russia. These include Boris Kakubava, leader of the Abkhazia Liberation Organization, who has called on the public -- primarily on Abkhaz refugees living in Tbilisi (there are currently around 60,000 of them in the capital) -- to stage protests during the visit over "Russia's interference in Georgia's internal affairs in the course of the Abkhaz conflict" and to pin responsibility on Russia for defeat in the war. A similar statement was issued by Irakliy Tsereteli, leader of the Georgian National Independence Party. He believes that President Yeltsin should know that there are forces in the republic which are by no means delighted about Russia's policy on Georgia. Admittedly, the supporters of street protest demonstrations are not particularly popular at the moment. The dominant opinion in society and among most political parties is that political pragmatism should prevail. People in Tbilisi are confident that many of Georgia's political and economic problems will be settled during the talks. "However different the opinions in our political circles over Russia's policy with regard to Georgia, it remains a fact that Georgia cannot leave Russia's sphere of influence overnight and move to the West's sphere of influence. Things need to be looked at realistically. On this basis, we hope that aspects of our future relations with Russia," Temur Zhorzholiani, chairman of the Georgian Conservative Monarchist Party, said in an interview with this PRAVDA correspondent.
