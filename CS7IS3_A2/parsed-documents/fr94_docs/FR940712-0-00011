FR940712-0-00011 FR940712-0-00006 The published NPRM clearly discussed the proposed applicability of part 195 to inter-facility lines and delivery lines. The NPRM gave all interested persons, including non-pipeline companies, an adequate opportunity to comment on the proposed extension of part 195 to cover these low-stress pipelines. In addition, some non-pipeline companies were aware of the NPRM, because representatives of refineries submitted comments. Other non-pipeline companies should have been aware that RSPA was considering the need to regulate low-stress pipelines. As stated above, RSPA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on low-stress pipelines. Also, we specifically invited representatives of the chemical, refining, and terminal industries to attend a meeting on low-stress pipelines (56 FR 23538; May 22, 1991). At that meeting, RSPA staff described all low-stress pipelines excluded from part 195. E. Economically Marginal Gathering Lines The NPRM requested comment on whether economically marginal gathering lines (i.e., lines which have little profit) in populated areas should receive separate treatment under the final rules. One operator wanted to exclude from regulation petroleum gathering lines that operate at less than 5 percent of SMYS and transport mostly sediment and water. The operator said these lines present little or no risk, but the cost of regulation would be high because of the large number of lines. API and an operator said many low-stress pipelines in populated areas are associated with mature wells of diminishing production. These commenters argued regulation would accelerate the marginal economic status of the lines. They also suggested that more truck transportation would follow, with greater risk to the public. The operator particularly asked RSPA not to regulate low-stress pipelines transporting crude oil that has a high flash point. These lines, the commenter said, do not present a high enough risk to public safety to make regulation cost/effective. API commented that RSPA should apply just a few regulations to pipelines made economically marginal by depleted oil fields and low oil prices. It suggested that regulations applicable to leak detection would be enough. The remaining regulations could be waived, API said, based on evidence of negative economic impact and low risk to the area. An operator also suggested RSPA consider granting waivers for marginal systems based on evidence of a satisfactory safety program. NTSB said regulation of a class of pipelines should be based solely on the threat to public safety and the environment. An operator of economically marginal lines said that if safety is the goal of regulation, then profitable and marginal lines should be treated alike. To resolve the issue of economically marginal gathering lines, we looked at the number of lines involved, the burden of the final rule, and alternative transportation. The record shows that gathering lines in populated areas comprise less than 10 percent of low-stress pipelines subject to the final rule. Based on the comments, we believe only a small fraction of this number is economically marginal, transporting small volumes of oil from older, declining wells. These pipelines would be subject to the part 195 regulations, which, on the whole, parallel the industry standards in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers' B31.4 code, Liquid Transportation Systems for Hydrocarbons, Liquid Petroleum Gas, Anhydrous Ammonia, and Alcohols. The compliance burden, therefore, would be similar to the burden of meeting the minimum standards the pipeline industry has set for itself. Alternative rail or truck transportation, although perhaps more expensive, is generally available to replace any gathering line transportation that might be shut down. Thus, we do not believe regulation of economically marginal low-stress gathering lines will cause a significant hardship to much of the industry. Also, the potential safety and environmental risks of economically marginal gathering lines is probably higher than that of more profitable lines because of the increased incentive to save costs. Consequently, we decided not to include special provisions in part 195 for economically marginal low-stress gathering lines.
