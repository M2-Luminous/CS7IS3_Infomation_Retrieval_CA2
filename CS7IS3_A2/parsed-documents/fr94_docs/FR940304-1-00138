FR940304-1-00138 FR940304-1-00014 C. Energy savings. As indicated above, standards will result in significant savings of energy consumption for water heaters. D. Lessening of utility or performance of products. As indicated above, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that the standards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performance of water heaters. E. Impact of lessening of competition. The determination of this factor must be made by the Attorney General. F. Need of the nation to save energy. Water heaters use electricity, gas, and oil directly. In 1987, 18.4 percent of residential sector source electricity (or 1.94 quads) and 30.7 percent of residential sector natural gas consumption (or 1.59 quads) were accounted for on a national basis by water heaters. In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards will decrease air pollution. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D of Volume A 38 . Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed in equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO 2 ). For all classes of water heaters at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated SO 2 reduction would be 17,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of SO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.01 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;8, the reductions are 145,000 tons; 5,381,000 tons; 5,885,000 tons; 5,890,000 tons; 7,796,000 tons; 7,823,000 tons; and 7,124,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 3.58 percent. 38 See, footnote 37. Standards will also result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated NO 2 reduction would be 14,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of NO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.01 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;8 the reductions are 118,000 tons; 4,890,000 tons; 5,338,000 tons; 5,336,000 tons; 6,995,000 tons; 7,086,000 tons; and 7,109,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 3.57 percent. Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO 2 reduction would be 7 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of CO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.02 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;8 the reductions are 59 million tons; 2,607 million tons; 2,837 million tons; 2,845 million tons; 3,662 million tons; 3,747 million tons; and 4,113 million tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 4.14 percent. Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 1.6 million over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2&hyph;8, the reductions in oil imports are estimated to be 24.12, 605.97, 654.55, 677.03, 835.53, 842.83 and 786.97 million barrels, respectively. 5. Conclusion. Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard level 8 for amended water heater standards. Of the standard levels analyzed, level 8 will save the most energy (54.45 quads between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the Department assumes that all electric water heaters will incorporate improved thermal characteristics and an integral heat pump, and all gas water heaters will incorporate improved thermal characteristics and condense the flue gases. However, the payback at this standard level of 18.9 years for gas water heaters exceeds the 14-year life of the product and causes life-cycle cost increases of $437 for gas water heaters, and up to $1,108 for other classes. This level also quadruples the first cost of electric and gas water heaters and drives the short-run manufacturer return on equity from 0.4 percent to negative 32.1 percent.
