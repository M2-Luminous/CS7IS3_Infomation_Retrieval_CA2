Sa'id Kamal, the PLO's ambassador in Cairo, confirmed what Peres said to the effect that the understandings reached in Cairo were not just Israel's position, as the Palestinian side -- particularly Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh -- tried to argue. Nevertheless, the PLO stressed, these were not understandings between the two leaderships. Whatever the case may be, there is a crisis in the talks with the PLO and everything would seem to have been reopened. Yasir 'Arafat, a tough negotiator, now rejects the understandings reached in Cairo and demands much more. [passage omitted] Over the weekend, Yitzhaq Rabin went to great lengths not to overturn the tables, and emphasized that he is patient. He and Shim'on Peres must now make up their minds either to go back to the Taba talks or to illustrate their disappointment with 'Arafat by initiating a delay in the resumption of the talks. A few minutes ago the foreign minister told us that the decision would be made tomorrow and that he is in favor, in spite of everything, of resuming the talks. [Begin recording] [Peres] The crisis is over who has more time. We presented proposals. Everything that is written in the declaration of principles is acceptable to us. We have not changed anything or retreated from it, and we will not change or retreat from it. If the PLO has time, that is all right; we also have time. [Sukenik] Could you speculate as to what goes on in 'Arafat's mind when he rejects all the understandings his men reached with you only a few days ago? [Peres] He does not reject all of them, but he adds demands which were not discussed either in the first or second set of Oslo talks, in Cairo, or Versailles. We announced the understandings, and they were rejected. 'Arafat should know that Israel will not retreat from three issues: the Declaration of Principles, our security needs, and our announcement in the Knesset; we will fully honor what the prime minister and I stated in the Knesset. In this context, we tried to be as considerate as possible of Palestinian feelings. We do not want to humiliate them, but we will stick to our principles. We will implement everything we promised, but we will not agree to anything that harms our security. [end recording]
