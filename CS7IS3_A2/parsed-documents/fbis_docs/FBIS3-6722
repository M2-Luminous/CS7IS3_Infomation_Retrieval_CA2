They have made use of the public disorder in the old imperial city of Hue to arouse hostile forces in foreign countries to act against the Vietnamese state. Under the label of protecting human rights, they have claimed that the Vietnamese state does not respect the freedom of belief, suppressing religions, and intervening in the internal affairs of Buddhism. They have sent petitions to and [word indistinct] talks to the World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna, Austria; sent petitions to governments of some countries during the visits to these countries by Vietnamese state leaders to protest and cause political pressure. They have distributed many documents and literature with reactionary contents, slandering reality. Culprits of the public disorder occurred on 25 April 1993 in Hue city were put to public trial on 15 November 1993 in Thua Thien-Hue Province, meeting the people's requirements. The results of the trial were supported by people. Many Buddhist superiors, bonzes and nuns, and Catholic priests have maintained that the Hue public disorder not only caused economic losses, but also caused bad impression in and outside the country. However, the Vietnamese state has given them leniency. The culprits themselves also saw their guiltiness. Meanwhile, those people living in exile have distorted and made a ballyhoo that the Vietnamese state accused the innocent people. Of these people, Nguyen Xuan Chau, head of the Van Hanh Monastery in Australia, is the most madly (?violent). So what kind of people Nguyen Xuan Chau is?

In 1976 he was [words indistinct] the reactionary plot, making use of Buddhism in the Vietnam Buddhist Church, formerly Vietnamese Unified Buddhism, to contact and transfer reactionary documents and literature from the Vietnam Buddhist Church to Nghia Binh [Now Binh Dinh] Province. By disseminating these documents and literature, they aroused opposition and non-cooperation with the revolutionary administration, slandering the state policy and the political system, gathering a number of young men who dodged military service to Phu Bon area in the central highland Province of Gia Lai-Kontum to carry out illegal activities. In 1983, he fled the country to Malaysia, then to Australia. Now he is in Van Hanh Monastery in Australia. What is his (?opinion) concerning the above mentioned accusation? What are his current acts of sabotage in foreign countries? And what are the purposes of these acts? We will deal with these issues next Friday during our "Talk of the Week."
