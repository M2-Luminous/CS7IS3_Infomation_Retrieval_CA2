In this context, we asked him for an interview. [passage omitted] [Hluchanova] What attitude will you adopt, on behalf of Slovakia, toward the stability pact, and how will you justify it? [Moravcik] I have been informed about the results of expert talks on this issue that were held in Athens on 10-11 May 1994. At these talks, we succeeded in pushing through our standpoint, which has opened the path for Slovakia's active participation [in the conference on the stability pact to be held in Paris in late May]. The only question that remains open is that of the modalities of this participation. Regarding the voices that the stability pact may lead to a new Munich or a new Vienna Arbitrage [in November 1938, by which southern Slovakia was ceded to Hungary], I would like to stress that this is completely out of the question because one of the conditions I have laid down is that the principle of the inviolability and unchangeability of borders be fully respected and included in the document. This implies an advantageous starting point for further negotiations on our part. [passage omitted]
