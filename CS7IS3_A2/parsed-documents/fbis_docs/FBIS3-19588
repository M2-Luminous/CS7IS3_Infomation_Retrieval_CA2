[Mock] Absolutely. The agreement is a very positive beginning. It ensures the credibility of international involvement. And if it is now possible to expand the security zones -- which has always been our main concern -- the killing of the civilian population in Bosnia will stop. However, one cannot yet speak of an overall solution. Just the question of cantons in the Muslim- Croatian federation alone is a sensitive issue -- not to speak of a global solution for Yugoslavia's successor states. However, at least it's a start. [KURIER] Is this primarily at the instigation of the United States? [Mock] The United States is so deeply involved that it will no longer be as easy as it was in the past for the warring parties to turn away. The United States has accepted a clear responsibility. And if cooperation with the European Union troika and with France, which is particularly active in Bosnia, is now intensified, I finally see light at the end of a long tunnel. [KURIER] Will the Serbs make compromises? [Mock] If they reject the Muslim-Croat union, this is their business. But one must ask them. [KURIER] Do you see the involvement of Russia and the United States as a staking out of their spheres of influence in the Balkans? [Mock] If the former parade themselves as the protectors of one side and the latter as protectors of the other side, I do not think much of that. This would be like the antiquated great-power policy of the 19th century. But in the case of Sarajevo the Russians have been very constructive. [KURIER] Do you think that economic cooperation of the warring parties in ex-Yugoslavia will be possible at some time in the future? [Mock] The trend toward integration will gain ground in Central Europe and also in the Balkans. But that will take a long time.
