However, departments concerned have estimated the actual number of HIV carriers is between 5,000 and 10,000. There is a tendency toward a gradual spreading of AIDS in China. According to Ministry of Public Health officials, shortage of funds and insufficient publicity and education are two major difficulties in the prevention and treatment of AIDS at present. Sun Xinhua, a Ministry of Public Health official, said during an interview with this reporter by long-distance telephone yesterday: Although governments at various levels allocated 10 million yuan for the prevention and treatment of AIDS last year, the amount was far from enough and there was difficulty in meeting the needs. Therefore, in some places where increased investment has been made, special test centers and hospitals have been set up. However, most patients have to receive treatment at ordinary hospitals. Some patients stay at home and are visited by local doctors once a month or once every two months. At present, China still has not formulated laws or regulations on the prevention and treatment of AIDS, said Sun Xinhua. In 1988, the Ministry of Public Health promulgated a policy document--the "Law on the Prevention and Cure of Contagious Diseases," which has been in force until now. The authorities are thinking of taking further measures to strengthen management of the prevention and treatment of AIDS but nothing has yet been put on the legislation agenda. China is an area in which the spreading of AIDS is not serious but there is a tendency toward a gradual spreading of the disease. HIV carriers are concentrated in Yunnan, Fujian, Guangdong, Shanghai, and Beijing, said Sun Xinhua, and those in Yunnan account for 80 percent of the total. The main reason why there are more HIV carriers in Yunnan is that many people inject drugs. Sexual contact is another way of spreading the disease. A considerable number of HIV carriers in other cities have been infected abroad. Some are foreign staff members and workers. Others have become HIV carriers after working as laborers or after visiting their relatives abroad. In view of the actual situation in China, said Sun Xinhua, the authorities have followed two main principles in the prevention and treatment of AIDS. One is to take measures to slow down the speed of the spreading of the disease. The other is to make great efforts to carry out publicity and education work by means of the press and to pay special attention to monitoring the "high-risk groups." In response to being asked whether or not HIV carriers are discriminated against in China, Sun Xinhua said: In many places in the world, HIV carriers are being discriminated against but the public health administrative departments in China have demanded that various localities should not discriminate against HIV carriers and the identities of HIV carriers must be kept secret. However, in the eyes of the people, these HIV carriers are beneath pity. The people think that undesirable habits are the main cause of contracting the virus.
