He does not think that an application for a ban to the Federal Constitutional Court would have a chance. The material that the constitutional protection officers have collected on the party so far is not sufficient for a ban, Kanther said. Instead, he recommended struggling against the Repulikaner with political means and ostracizing them in society.
