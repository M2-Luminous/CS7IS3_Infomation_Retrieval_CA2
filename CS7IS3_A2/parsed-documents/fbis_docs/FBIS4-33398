This measure will be implemented progressively to prevent adverse effects on the collective transportation system. According to budget estimates for 1995, this increase will reach an average of 12 bolivares. [Begin recording] [Reporter] This statement was made by Finance Minister Sosa Rodriguez during the forum: "How to Have Confidence in Venezuela." Sosa Rodriguez confirmed that on several occasions, the need to increase the prices of hydrocarbons had been discussed. However, this increase will have to be implemented after a register of vehicles used for collective transportation is drafted so that any possible problems are averted. He added that revenues earned from such an increase have not been calculated yet. [Sosa Rodriguez] I have said it about three or four times. We need to make a register of all vehicles used for collective transportation. I have said that eventually, the collective transportation sector must receive a subsidy so that whenever the increase is implemented--probably by the end of this year--this sector, which is widely used by the population, will not be adversely affected. [Reporter] Sosa Rodriguez also indicated the fiscal deficit has been reduced since 12 February from 650 billion bolivares to a current 120 billion bolivares. This signifies an 80-percent reduction or the equivalent of 12 percent of the GDP. He added that after May and June, additional price increases will not be justifiable. He reiterated that estimates predict inflation figures of 50 percent for the end of 1994 and 25 percent for 1995. As for the exchange rate, he said the true rate varies between 140 and 145 bolivares. [Reporter] Nevertheless, the country's leading labor organization hopes to learn more about the government plans in this regard since past experience shows that increases in gasoline prices are accompanied by discontent and inflation. [Jose Beltran Vallejo, president of the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers] We have some documents and problems we will be submitting to the government very soon. We have told them that people cannot continue paying for the crisis. [passage omitted] [end recording] [Announcer] Edgar Valle Valle, chairman of the Senate Energy and Mines committee, expressed his agreement with the increase in gasoline prices. [Begin recording] [Reporter] Valle Valle believes this increase is fundamental because the oil sector cannot continue registering low profit margins. [Valle Valle] Gasoline profit margins are negative, which means costs are greater than revenues. This situation cannot continue in an organization such as Petroven and its subsidiaries. Petroven is a business and no business exists to generate losses. In addition, Petroven has the responsibility of generating greater benefits than other companies in order to fulfill the needs of the productive and social sectors of the country.
