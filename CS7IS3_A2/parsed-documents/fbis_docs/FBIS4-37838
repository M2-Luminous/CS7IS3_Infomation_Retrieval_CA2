He then deplored the worsening of the conflict between the two sides which led to the destructive war going on in Yemen now. He stressed that the fundamental view of the GCC states now was to insist on a cease-fire. In reply to a question on the nature of measures which the GCC states could take if the fighting continued between the two sides, Ambassador Bu'ali said he hoped that fighting would end between the two sides, otherwise other steps would have to be taken either by the GCC states or the Security Council. He added that the goal which the GCC states were pursuing was to stop the bloodshed and the destruction. He further said: What matters to us now is to stop the fighting and prevent the flames of war from spreading here and there, and as for the rest -- everything will be examined accordingly and we will deal with the developments in the future. In reply to a question on the GCC center for commercial arbitration, he indicated that the center was set up to arbitrate disputes which might arise between a trader and companies or between other traders involved in similar commercial activities with the GCC states abroad [as received].
