The official position with respect to this issue was expressed by Abel Prieto, president of the National Cuban Writers and Artists Union [UNEAC], in a special address during The Nation and the Emigrants Conference that began yesterday with the participation of more than 200 Cuban guests living overseas, mainly in the United States. He indicated that only the establishment of fluid links in the cultural arena will allow us to overcome schematic perceptions, biases, and stereotypes that have risen on both sides during the past 30 years. Prieto, together with Vice President Carlos Lage and Foreign Minister Robert Robaina, is one the youngest members of the Cuban Communist Party [PPC] Political Bureau elected during the Fourth PCC Congress that took place in October 1991. He emphasized that only serious and strong cultural association based on exchange and mutual respect, as well as the conscious adoption of Cuban awareness, will open the doors allowing the substitution of stereotypes for higher qualitative communication. The Cuban official only excluded contacts with those emigrants who advocate the island's annexation to the United States and present the country's national culture as something inferior and geopolitically dependent on the U.S. empire. Prieto included in this group writer Guillermo Cabrera Infante who, in his quest to subordinate the Cuban nation and culture to Washington, has even attempted to drown the patriotic thoughts of national apostle Jose Marti. The UNEAC president stated that while Cabrera Infante places the island in a subordinate and colonial situation because of its proximity to the U.S. coast, Marti described it as "faithful to the Americas," reason for which it must continue as a free nation, as well as a bastion of independence and sovereignty. Prieto stressed that, despite efforts by the United States and advocates of annexation to wipe out the values of Cuban culture, "a genuine innovation continues to grow among Cuban emigrants, completely divorced from any score-settling and anticommunist obsession, an innovation that continues the debate on the conflicts of its divided identity and seeks to draw closer to its nation and its roots." In the arts, literature, social sciences, and thought, we find valuable contributions to an understanding of the Cuban national being and its everyday happenings, he added. He indicated that there is an effort in some artists, who are considered "Cuban Americans," to draw closer to the mythical island, to reconstruct this hazy world, seen in dreams, that their parents abandoned, where they find something clean and genuine. In another part of his address, Prieto indicated that the Cuban Revolution came about to interrupt the growing process of denationalization the island was being subject to and replace it with Marti's unfinished ideals and those of the founding fathers of the Revolution. January 1959 represented the opportunity to complete the national project and even safeguard Cuban identity and culture, Prieto stressed. The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, which is scheduled to conclude tomorrow, is aimed at normalizing ties between Cuba and the emigrants, whose relations have been marked by historical U.S. hostilities toward this small island.
