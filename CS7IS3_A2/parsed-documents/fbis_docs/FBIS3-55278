But What of the New Russian Parliament?"] [Text] Four days remain until the Russian Federation Federal Assembly starts its work. It seems that this uncommon event in the country's life will be marked by the last-minute rush which is traditional for projects due for completion. In the new parliament's press center we were told that the venue for the first session is still unclear: either the Kremlin or the building which until the well-known events belonged to mayor's office. There is also total obscurity in respect of the standing orders. There is no question of agreed candidacies for the speaker and his deputies -- which, however, is not a drama in itself. We have been told by the Central Electoral Commission that four days before the State Duma begins its work the lists of deputies from parties and associations are still being sorted out. Objectively speaking, the procedure for finishing such an important "project due for completion" has been messed up by the holidays, and there is also the effect of the "unraveling government" -- part of it has gone to apartments at the White House, and part has resigned in connection with the reform of government structures. The telephones -- not to mention continuity -- have been cut off.
