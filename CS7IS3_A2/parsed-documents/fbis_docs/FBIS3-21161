Using both machines we can bore microholes up to 5�m in diameter with highly precise positioning resolution of 0.1�m. The boring machine is mainly for high precision boring of microholes, but it also has 3-axis NC functions and can be used as a milling machine to form three-dimensional microshapes. The shaft processing machine was developed for the purpose of automatically forming the tool electrodes for the boring machine. It uses wire electro-discharge grinding (WEDG), and can form microshafts as small as 5�m thanks to its high precision positioning mechanism and highly stable microwire feed control. In addition to its high precision micro-EDM capability, the MG-ED71 can easily penetrate sheet thicknesses up to ten times greater than the hole diameter, although an aspect ratio of more than five times greater than the hole diameter has been very difficult to bore in the past. In addition, boring of holes 0.1-0.3mm in diameter, which has been quite time-consuming in the past, can easily be accomplished with high precision in a relatively short period of time. Surely, the applications of micro-EDM will grow in the field of micromachining. 1. Introduction Electronic equipment such as AV equipment and computer peripheral devices are becoming smaller and smaller. This equipment is not only becoming more compact, but users are demanding high-quality performance such as greater accuracy and density at the same time. The micronization of mechanical parts, which has lagged behind the micronization of electronic parts, and the development of high-precision technology to manufacture these mechanical parts have become urgent needs. Machining dies at an aspect ratio of 5-10 times has become necessary to provide both micronization and strength. Moreover, although drills were used before, micro-EDM has become increasingly popular for boring of holes 0.1-0.3mm in diameter because of its high quality since it does not produce burrs, and because it is very accurate in terms of roundness and proper degree of taper. Moreover, the development of micromachines has begun in earnest in recent years as a dream technology for the future. Most attempts at manufacturing micromachines have relied on applications of LSI technology, but micro-EDM has shown great promise because of its greater capability to form three-dimensional shapes. To respond to the needs for this kind of microprocessing, we have developed ultramicro-EDM machines that provide greater precision and micronization than the micro-EDM technology previously developed by the Matsushita Research Institute in Tokyo. In this article I will explain the features, specifications, and precision obtained by this ultramicro-EDM equipment, and discuss in detail ultramicro-processing, deep hole boring at high aspect ratio, and micromachining of three-dimensional shapes. 2. Characteristics of Micro-EDM The characteristics of micro-EDM can be summarized as follows: (1) Any conductive material can be processed--especially, hard materials such as quench-hardened steel and sintered hard alloys can be easily processed. Furthermore, it is possible to machine silicon, which may crack under conventional electro-discharge machining.[.sup]1[/] (2) High precision machining of curved surfaces, slanting surfaces, and thin materials is possible because processing takes place without applying mechanical force to the workpiece. (3) Machining of shapes with high aspect ratios is possible, and in the case of hole boring, depths as great as five times the hole diameter are easily obtained. (4) Because the processing units are very small, this method provides an excellent surface smoothness of up to 0.1�m Rmax.[.sup]2[/] 3. Structure of Ultramicro-EDM Machine The shaft processing machine (MG-ED51) and the boring machine (MG-ED71), which is shown in Figure 1, are required for ultramicro-EDM. Table 1 shows the main specifications for each machine, and Figure 2 shows the basic structures common to the ultramicro-EDM machines. The basic structures can be roughly divided into a machining head member, a positioning mechanism member, and a micro-ED circuit and NC control member. Fig. 1 Photo of Micro-EDM Boring Machine MG-ED71 3.1 Machining Head Member and Z-Axis Mechanism The machining head member has a mandrel attached to it that incorporates the tool electrode. It consists of a V-bearing made of ceramic material to provide rotary support and a DC motor that provides rotary drive for the mandrel.[.sup]2[/] In previous models the mandrel slid vertically in this V-bearing when it was positioned on the Z-axis, but there were disadvantages such as a stroke distance of only 3mm. Therefore, we modified the design so that the whole machining head would move on the Z-axis. The Z-axis has a range of 70mm and is moved in 0.05�m increments by a stepping motor and a ball screw. A machining range of 10mm is shown in Table 1 because the range is dependent on the depth of the processing tank. The machining depth also depends on the shape to be machined, so not all microholes can be bored to a depth of 10mm (See 4.2 below). The outside of the mandrel is in contact with the V-bearing via a belt, and its upper end is attached to a steel ball. It is supported so that it receives thrust at the contact point on its top. It is connected to the discharge circuit via the contact point. This bearing system features high rotary precision, there is almost no centering misalignment when the mandrel is attached or removed, and it is easy to handle. Because both the boring machine and shaft processing machine use exactly the same bearing system, it is possible to measure and check the dimensions of the tool electrodes made by the shaft processing machine under a microscope and then install them directly in the boring machine, which facilitates machining quality control. 3.2 Discharge Circuit and Discharge Control The shaft processing machine is a machine designed to automate electrode forming, and to do so the discharge energy conditions from rough processing to finishing must be set automatically. To achieve micromachining on the order of 0.1mm or less, it is necessary to reduce the single pulse discharge energy to the range of 10[.sup]-7[/] J, so an R-C circuit was chosen as the discharge circuit. Moreover, a layout was selected to keep the floating capacitance in the circuit and the tool electrode at a minimum.[.sup]2[/] The discharge energy can be set by adjusting the voltage of the R-C circuit and capacitor capacitance. The voltage can be selected with high precision in 1V units with a D/A converter, but setting the capacitance of the capacitor is very complex. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 2., we chose a format in which four types of capacitors can be switched by relays. By moving the capacitor switching circuit and the position of the resistor as close as possible to the tool electrode, we can suppress the floating capacitance. Control of the discharge is accomplished by a simple system that uses a charging current detector on the R-C circuit to determine whether it is discharging or there is a short, and if there is a short, it opens the gap. 3.3 Structure of Shaft Processing Machine The shaft processing machine is a device for automatically forming the tool electrodes used on the boring machine, and it uses the wire electro-discharge grinding (WEDG) method proposed by professor Takahisa Masuzawa, Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo.[.sup]3[/] Figure 3 shows the principle of WEDG. The wire that forms the tool electrode is fed continuously over the wire guide, and at a place where it is supported by the wire guide, a processing micro-ED is generated between the wire and the shaft being processed. Fig. 3 Principle of WEDG The wire guide is on the X-axis, and it is positioned in 0.1�m units. The wire material bobbin, takeup bobbin and the wire drive mechanism are all on the X-axis, and variations in wire tension are eliminated as positioning takes place on the X-axis. The wire drive uses a constant-rate takeup, and the wire is given uniform tension by constant-current control of a DC motor connected to the wire material bobbin on the other end.[.sup]4[/] Because the range of movement is only 0.5mm or less, we use an open control system with a stepping motor and ball screw for positioning on the X-axis. Errors due to backlash are controlled by making the positioning movements constantly in the forward direction. Because it is not equipped with a function for calculating mandrel rotation, rotational symmetry is the basis for shapes that can be processed on the shaft processing machine. As shown in Figure 4, it can process microshafts with tapers, shapes with a spherical radius, and various combinations of these. Because 100�m diameter brass wire was used, a radius of 50�m is left at the step. Fig. 4 Shapes Machined by Micro-EDM MG-ED51 As shown in Table 1, the boring machine has five operation modes. The machining modes include the AUTO mode, in which equally spaced holes are machined continuously in a row, and REMOTE mode, which operates on commands from an external computer. In AUTO mode automatic processing can be achieved merely by inputting machining conditions and hole position data with very simple programming on the NC controller. However, machining shapes are limited to holes or slits made from combinations of holes. With REMOTE mode it is possible to easily machine large shapes with more complex data. An RS-232C port is used for command communications, so any computer can be used. REMOTE mode has a function to detect all the settings for conditions relevant to machining; that is, discharge voltage, choice of capacitor, feed rate setting, movement designations, machining movement designations, and machine status (coordinate values, processing status). It is possible to machine shapes at will by combining these various parameters. The X and Y tables each have a glass scale origin. By using the mode that automatically returns them to their origins (RETURN), it is possible to take them back to their original positions with high precision after interrupting an operation in progress. As far as the shape of the tool electrode is concerned, reversed-polarity discharge can be performed on the boring machine using block electrodes, etc., independent of the shaft processing machine. Some methods other than WEDG are better for forming relatively long tool electrodes. Figure 6 compares the WEDG and the block methods. Because WEDG uses a single point for machining, it is not efficient in terms of time for forming long electrodes. Moreover, with the tungsten that is normally used for tool electrodes, there is a problem because if the cut made on a single pass is too deep, the material tends to bend after machining due to internal strain. Block forming, on the other hand, is efficient because the length to be machined can be cut with a single discharge, and the electrode does not bend easily, most likely because the material is removed uniformly and slowly over its whole length. In the past block forming was done manually and required considerable skill, but this task has now become rather easy if the movements are programmed into a computer. Fig. 6 Comparison of WEDG and Block Methods Fig. 8. Example of 5�m Diameter Bored Holes Fig. 10. Method for Forming Tool Electrode for Microslot 4.2 Deep Hole Machining With micro-EDM it is possible to machine a hole to a depth up to five times the diameter of the hole, and for boring deeper holes with a higher aspect ratio methods such as using a tool electrode shaped like a half moon have been devised. Wear is extensive, however, when using a half-moon shaped tool electrode, so longer electrodes are necessary. This causes a problem because long electrodes tend to bend after they are formed and vibrate during machining, which makes boring accuracy difficult to control. It is difficult to bore holes more than five times deeper than their diameter because the insulating oil does not easily reach the tip of the electrode and it is difficult to remove machining dust. Moving the workpiece relative to the tool electrode is one way used to bore deep holes without using a special tool electrode. On this boring machine we have installed a brand new machining mode so we can set the vibrational amplitude in 0.1�m units for either the X- or Y-axis and feed the tool electrode as it vibrates at several Hertz. This machining mode forms an oblong hole, so we use it for rough machining. We then finish the workpiece to obtain a straight, deep hole. Amplitude is an important parameter in this mode since the tool electrode vibrates as it processes. I will explain this more specifically using the experimental results of machining at an aspect ratio of 10 as shown in Table 2. The tool electrode diameter and amplitude were set so that the hole would be 2.5�m long and 1.0�m wide when ready for finishing. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2 Machining Conditions for Experiment | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Hole Diameter |100�m |20�m | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Workpiece |Hardened Alloy t=1mm |Stainless Steel t=0.2mm | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tool Electrode Diameter |90�m & +/-2.5�m |14�m & +/-2.5�m | |& Vibration | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |85�m & +/-5�m|9�m & +/-5�m | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |80�m & +/-7.5&mg-| | | |r;m | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |75�m & +/-10�| | | |m | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |70�m & +/-12.5&m-| | | |gr;m | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Set Voltage |110 V |100 V | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Capacitor Capacitance |3300 pF |100 pF | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Figure 11 shows experimental results of wear length when the vibration is in the horizontal direction and machining is in the vertical direction. In the experiment at 20�m it was not possible to form a straight electrode of the required length less than 10�m in diameter. In both trials, the electrode did not penetrate when the amplitude was 2.5�m, so those values are not accurate. Fig. 11 Wear Length and Vibration Amplitude with Vibration As the data shows, penetration is possible with an amplitude of 5�m or more, and we can easily bore deep holes. As the amplitude increases, the wear length also increases uniformly in proportion to the volume removed. It appears that the limit of deep holes bored with this method depends on the workpiece material and how long a tool electrode we can form. This method is not only used for deep hole boring, but it is also effective for rapidly boring holes greater than 0.1�m in diameter with high precision. 4.3 Making Microparts With the features I have noted, micro-EDM offers a method other than a semiconductor manufacturing process for realizing micromachines. Below I will show some examples of machining potential microparts for use in micromachines. Figure 12 is an SEM photo and a schematic diagram showing the mechanism and dimensions of a microspring formed on a silicon wafer. This process penetrates the silicon wafer to form a parallel spring mechanism as shown by the two thin sheets 20�m thick. Micro-EDM can easily create high aspect ratio microshapes on a wafer that cannot be penetrated by photolithography. Fig. 12. Silicon Microspring Mechanism Thus, the ultramicro-EDM machines can machine miniature shapes on miniature parts with great precision. Figure 14 shows a metal die for molding a 0.033 modular involute gear with a pitch diameter of 0.3mm. The material is 100�m thick stainless steel. In this case the involute form was created using a 20�m diameter tool electrode after a combination of holes was bored for rough machining.[.sup]4[/] Figure 5. Conclusion In this article I have explained the technical features of the ultramicro-EDM machines. It is now possible to do machining that was difficult in the past such as ultramicromachining of holes to 5�m in diameter, boring deep holes with an aspect ratio of ten, etc. I believe these machines can be used to make a variety of microparts for micromachines. I believe that ultramicro-EDM will be important in the future as a manufacturing technology where more micronization and greater precision are required. In closing I deeply thank professor Takahisa Masuzawa, Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo for his valuable leadership in developing this technology. References 1. T.
