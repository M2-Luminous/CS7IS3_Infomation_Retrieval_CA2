The report from the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) said the drop in production slowed down in most Eastern European nations and signs of recovery appeared even in a few countries of the region last year. But considering the gravity of the recession, certain countries need a few more years to restore production to the pre-1989 level, the report added. Production in Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States dropped by 13 percent in 1993 compared with 20 percent in 1992, according to the report. The ECE predicted that there is a very slim possibility of an end to the economic sliding in these countries this year. The report also said the sharp rise of unemployment in Eastern European nations since 1991 has brought about serious social and economic problems in these countries. About 7.6 million people had become jobless by the end of 1993, it added. The commission stressed that the international aid to these countries at present cannot help solve the difficulties facing them. Eastern Europeans have become ever more disappointed over the huge gap between what has been promised and what has actually been given, it added.
