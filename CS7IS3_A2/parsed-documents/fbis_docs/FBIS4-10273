"I speak as President of the Republic Alberto Fujimori, not as a candidate," the president said in an interview in Sunday's "Counterpoint" political program aired on Channel Two. "The electoral atmosphere is premature and many things are said that deep down are demagogic," Fujimori replied when asked why the opposition was so distrustful of fraud. Fujimori stressed that during his tenure three elections have been held (legislative, municipal, and the referendum on the new Constitution). "These elections have been open, unquestionable, and approved by international observers and we will continue down this line," Fujimori assured. The president said that "there must be guarantees that here in Peru free elections will be held, with the presence of international observers" and added that "the people are the only ones who should decide." According to Fujimori, Javier Perez de Cuellar is "an outstanding citizen who has given Peru a good name with his work" as UN secretary general. Several conservative opposition sectors have said that their possible candidate, capable of defeating Fujimori, is the former UN general secretary. Even though Perez de Cuellar has not confirmed his candidacy for the 1995 elections, the Peruvian president "welcomed the virtual candidate." Fujimori stressed that elections can be held in Peru because "now there is democracy and security" and he refused the adjective "authoritarian" to describe his regime. A national poll released today confirmed that there are significant differences regarding the approval of Fujimori's term and citizens' choice in the next election. According to a poll by Imasen, in Lima and the provinces 57.7 percent of the population back the president's term, with 31.8 percent disapproving. If the elections were held tomorrow and the candidates were Fujimori and Perez de Cuellar, the president would get 35.1 percent of the votes and Perez de Cuellar 32.9 percent. The study disclosed that the distance between the president and the former UN secretary general is lessening and in the provinces the president leads by a much smaller margin. In a runoff election, Perez de Cuellar would win in Lima with 45.7 percent of support, and Fujimori receiving 44.1 percent. In the country's interior, the former diplomat would win in 10 of the 11 cities polled. Fujimori said "that human rights in Peru are guaranteed" and added that the subversive elements are tried effectively, in accordance with his government's anti-terrorist legislation. The Peruvian president said that the Maoist Shining Path group is "totally weakened" and that the desertion of its members who are still in the country is "massive." The fight against terrorism will continue with the same force, without neglecting the fight against drug trafficking. "Without the national pacification, democracy could not have been built as we are doing," Fujimori stressed.
