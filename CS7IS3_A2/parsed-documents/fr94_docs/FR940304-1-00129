FR940304-1-00129 FR940304-1-00014 Rather than presenting the results for all classes of room air conditioners in today's notice, the Department selected a class of room air conditioners as being representative, or typical, of the product, and is presenting the results only for that class. The results for the other classes can be found in the Technical Support Document in the same sections as those referenced for the representative class. The representative class for room air conditioners is room air conditioners with side louvers, less than 6,000 BTU's per hour, which is one of the most prevalent classes of room air conditioners. For this representative class, trial standard levels 1 and 2 accomplish the above efficiency improvements from the baseline by enhanced evaporator and condenser fins and the use of a permanent split-capacitor fan motor; level 3 adds a subcooler and grooved tubes to both the evaporator and condenser coils; level 4 increases the compressor energy efficiency ratio to 11.0; level 5 increases the compressor energy efficiency ratio further to 11.5; level 6 increases the evaporator and condenser coil area; and level 7 adds a variable-speed compressor and brushless DC fan motor. Similar design options are used to achieve the above efficiencies for the other classes and are found tabulated in Section 1.4 of the Technical Support Document. 2. Payback Period Table 4&hyph;2 presents the payback periods for the efficiency levels analyzed for the representative class of the product. For this representative class, standard levels 1 through 4 satisfy the rebuttable presumption test, i.e., the additional price of purchasing a product will be less than three times the value of the energy savings that the consumer will receive during the first year. Payback for all classes of room air conditioners may be found in Tables 4.13 to 4.24 of the Technical Support Document.

Significance of Energy Savings To estimate the energy savings by the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new room air conditioners under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of those sold under the candidate standard levels. For the candidate energy conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy Model projects that over the period 1996&hyph;2030, the following energy savings would result for all classes of the product: Level 1_0.28 Quad Level 2_0.62 Quad Level 3_1.24 Quads Level 4_1.42 Quads Level 5_2.22 Quads Level 6_3.06 Quads Level 7_5.22 Quads
