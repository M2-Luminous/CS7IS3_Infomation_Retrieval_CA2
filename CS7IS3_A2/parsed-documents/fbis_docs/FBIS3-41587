At a press conference held later by both ministers, Zlocha explained that the memorandum legalized and extended the existing cooperation. Rauch-Kallat pointed to joint projects already underway, such as air and water quality protection, protection of the Morava river region which forms the border between the two countries, and a study of the effective use of energy sources. As well as increasing the exchange of data, the memorandum is also intended to promote cooperation in establishing the legal norms and economic tools to be used in the monitoring and protection of the environment. Rauch-Kallat said that Austria would provide 105 million Austrian schillings in support of Slovakia's environment protection efforts. The sum was destined for a waste water treatment project for the river Morava and the monitoring of emissions from the Duslo Sala chemical factory among other things, she said. On the question of the waste dump in Berg which could pollute Bratislava's drinking water, Rauch-Kallat reported that the project had not yet been approved by parliament. If it did have a negative influence on the local environment, she would oppose it, she told journalists. Rauch-Kallat said Austria was interested in supporting Slovakia's withdrawal from nuclear power production. There is one nuclear power plant in operation in Slovakia, at Jaslovske Bohunice, and a second under construction at Mochovce, western Slovakia. She said there was an agreement on the exchange of information from the Slovak nuclear industry.
