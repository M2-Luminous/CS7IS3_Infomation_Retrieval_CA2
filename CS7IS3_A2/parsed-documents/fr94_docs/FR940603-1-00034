FR940603-1-00034 FR940603-1-00008 50 CFR Chapter II [Docket No. 940558&hyph;4158; I.D. 052394B] West Coast Salmon Fisheries; Disaster Relief AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking; request for comments. SUMMARY: The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) has declared that a natural fishery resource disaster exists in the ocean salmon fisheries off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California, due to extremely low stock abundances of chinook and coho salmon. To alleviate economic hardship, NMFS intends to make grants available to eligible industry participants. NMFS is requesting written comments, in particular from the fishing industry, Indian tribes, and state fisheries agencies, regarding appropriate limitations, terms, and conditions it should use in providing the proposed assistance to persons engaged in commercial fisheries for uninsured losses resulting from the salmon fisheries resource disaster. DATES: Comments must be received by August 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to Bruce Morehead, Office of Trade and Industry Services, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bruce Morehead, 301/713&hyph;2358. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Although West Coast salmon stocks experience annual fluctuations in abundance, stock abundances in the last few years have been exceptionally low. The ocean salmon fisheries off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California are dependent almost entirely on chinook and coho salmon. For chinook salmon, ocean catches fell from a high of 2,121,999 fish in 1988 to a record low of 444,000 in 1992, an almost 80 percent decline in abundance in only 4 years. The 1993 ocean catch of 532,999 chinook was also very low relative to historical averages. For coho, the decline has been even more dramatic, with an ocean catch of 5,334,255 fish in 1976 falling to a record low catch of only 292,000 in 1993_a 95 percent decline. In 1994, the abundances of many coho stocks are expected to be the lowest on record, and are not expected to meet spawning escapement goals, even without any ocean salmon fishing. Most chinook stock abundances also are predicted to be at very low, even record low, levels of abundance. Salmon fisheries in the ocean waters off Washington and northern Oregon are closed in 1994. Remaining salmon fisheries in the ocean waters off central and southern Oregon and California are at reduced levels and are closed to fishing for coho. It is predicted that 1994 ocean salmon landings will amount to only 289,000 chinook and zero coho. Although fishing seasons for inside (non-ocean) fisheries have not been completely finalized, they are expected to be the most restrictive ever imposed in many areas. Despite increasingly stringent management measures enacted in recent years to protect these salmon stocks, they have reached a critical stage of depletion, due in part to environmental conditions unfavorable to salmon survival that include: (1) An extended drought in California; (2) less than normal snowpack throughout the western United States; (3) drought followed by extensive flooding in the State of Washington; (4) and an extreme El Ni√±o ocean warming event during 1992&hyph;1993, which is believed to have been responsible for extremely poor salmon survival. Impacts on the Industry The Pacific Fishery Management Council estimated that, as late as 1988, there were about 5,300 commercial salmon troll vessels fishing off the West Coast, compared to about 2,300 vessels in 1992_a decline of 57 percent over that period. NMFS' Northwest Region conducted an analysis of economic models that suggest that the 1992 West Coast salmon industry involved 8,400 full-time work years. However, much of the employment is part time, so that the total number of individuals impacted by this resource disaster is much greater. Commercial salmon fishermen earned $33.8 million, while marine recreational anglers spent $79.5 million fishing for West Coast salmon in 1992. In 1992, 140 West Coast processing plants processed 72 million pounds (32.7 million kg) of finished salmon products, worth approximately $170 million. These plants employ over 2,000 people for the processing of salmon and other West Coast fish.
