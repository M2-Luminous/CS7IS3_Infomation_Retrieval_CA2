FBIS4-5788 "dreas072_d_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-072 Daily Report 10 Mar 1994 South Korea * Work To Develop CDMA System Accelerates * Work To Develop CDMA System Accelerates 942C0099A Seoul HANGUK KYONGJE SINMUN in Korean 10 Mar 94 p 13 942C0099A Seoul HANGUK KYONGJE SINMUN Korean CSO [Article by reporter Kim Hyong-kun] [Text] The domestic development and commercialization of the CDMA (code division multiple access) digital mobile communication system is expected to move into high gear as Pohang Iron and Steel Company [Posco] (the leading stockholder of the second mobile communication service) and Korea Mobile Telecom (the existing first mobile communication service) are both planning to actively participate in the development of the CDMA system which will be used by the operator of the second mobile service. According to the Ministry of Communications and business sources, on 9 March, with the selection process for the operator of the second mobile telephone service nearing the completion stage, Sinsegi Mobile Telecom, Posco's subsidiary, is planning to participate in the domestic development of the CDMA system through the transfer of technical know-how from the American firm Qualcomm, with which it has a technical cooperation agreement and which is the advocate of the CDMA system. Korea Mobile Telecom, which has been taken over by Sunkyong, also has a plan to gradually introduce the CDMA system and has decided to participate in the development process from the stage of on-site testing of CDMA trial products, scheduled to begin this June, to the stage of commercialization. All this will accelerate an early acquisition of the technical expertise necessary for the domestic development and commercialization of the CDMA system. In particular, the Electronics Telecommunications Research Institute [ETRI], the main promoter of the CDMA system development, recently signed a $5 million-dollar contract with Qualcomm for the three-stage joint development of low-level detailed designs of the CDMA system. Pak Hang-ku, head of the mobile communication technology research group, has said: "The three-stage contract calls for designing and developing equipment used in cell sites and the base system, developing mobile terminal equipment, and on-site testing of trial products by this November. These stages constitute the core of the CDMA system development." During this period, he added, companies to build the network equipment will be chosen. Concerning the CDMA system development plan, Sin Yong-sop, chief of the radio wave technology section of the Communications Ministry, said: "As soon as the operator of the second mobile communication service is selected, it will be made to participate in the CDMA development plan so that it may secure CDMA operating technology and promote procurement of the home-made CDMA system and thus achieve the commercialization of the system as scheduled." He added that the second carrier will, as Korea Mobile Telecom did, share the CDMA system research and development cost and participate in the system development process from the stage of on-site testing of trial products to that of their commercialization. The development program for the CDMA system, which will have a decisive impact on the second carrier's schedule to open its service and its business success, was launched in 1989. But it has been marred by some hitches, such as those in the trial production of equipment to be used in base and control stations, caused by a delay in signing technology-related contracts between Qualcomm and the ROK participants in the joint development program. Despite the success in the theory on the CDMA system, no country in the world has ever applied it to commercial use. For this reason, it is undeniable that there has been skepticism about attempting to commercialize this frontier technology in our country. The Ministry of Communications adopted the CDMA mode as the domestic standard last June ahead of any other country in the world. Prompted by this decision, our major communication equipment makers, such as Samsung, Goldstar, and Hyundai, led by ETRI, embarked upon the development of the CDMA system and its terminal equipment under a technology contract with Qualcomm. However, in their opinion it would be difficult to achieve the commercialization of the system by the end of 1995 because no testing of a trial product has been conducted yet. A concerned source said that judging from the pace of development in the past, the commercialization of the CDMA system by the use of domestically available technology is not likely to be realized until 1997. He fears that the second carrier will have to either delay the opening of the service or spend hundreds of billions of yen to buy the whole system and terminal equipment from abroad. The Ministry of Communications, however, says that with the development project proceeding smoothly, there will be no trouble in commercializing the technology used in the CDMA system, which has a capacity 10 to 20 times greater than the analog system, the only problem being the level of the service that will be offered. The Ministry of Communications is optimistic about the tempo of the CDMA system development program, which the government and business are pushing with a total investment of 81.1 billion won. According to the ministry, the development of trial commercial products and their test runs will be completed by this September as scheduled; and beginning next March the production of the commercial system will begin, and the commercial service will open in the fourth quarter after going through an on-site testing procedure in the third and fourth quarter. Judging from the development process until now, overall the local development and commercialization of the CDMA system has no problem, except that there are delays in some particular parts of the development program.
