Deputy for intelligence to the attorney general Sukarno was commenting to newsmen about public suggestions that Gusmao should be held in a more isolated place after he recently succeeded in sending a letter overseas protesting his sentencing by an Indonesian court of justice. "If all conditions for such a transfer are met, we can move Xanana to Nusakambangan Island," Sukarno said after attending a ceremony marking the installation of a number of new officials at the Attorney General's Office. Sukarno, however, did not clarify what the conditions were. Gusmao is currently serving a 20-year sentence in Jakarta's Cipinang penitentiary. He was tried and sentenced to a life-long jail term by a court of justice in Dili, East Timor's provincial capital, for acts of armed rebellion committed since 1976. President Suharto, however, later used his power of pardon to reduce the sentence to 20 years. Sukarno said even if Gusmao was actually moved to Nusakambangan, he would continue to be allowed to send letters abroad. Nusakambangan, an island off the coast of Cilacap on the southern coast of Central Java Province, is the location of a maximum security prison usually reserved for convicts serving long sentences. Sukarno also categorically denied rumours alleging that Gusmao would eventually be freed before completing his jail term. "Don't believe this hearsay. We have no plan at all to set him free," he said. East Timor is the youngest Indonesian province. It was colonized by Portugal for 450 years before it integrated with Indonesia in 1976.
