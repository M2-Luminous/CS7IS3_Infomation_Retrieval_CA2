FBIS4-12945 "drnes073dd_94012" FBIS-NES-94-073 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Activist Blames Israeli Practices for Attack Activist Blames Israeli Practices for Attack TA1304163694 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English 1500 GMT 13 Apr 94 TA1304163694 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el English BFN [Text] For a local Palestinian reaction to the Hadera attack, reporter Mark Weiss spoke with Ghassan al-Khatib from the Palestinian People's Party: [Begin al-Khatib recording] Well, first of all I feel that this is an expected and unfortunate natural reaction to the kind of policies and practices the Israeli settlers and Army has been practicing against the Palestinian people almost on daily basis. Of course, I feel sorry for the killing of any human being, including the persons that were killed in Hadera. But we have to go beyond just expressing feelings and see exactly why has this been happening and what is the way to overcome it. I think that it is happening because of the frustration people are feeling as a result of the occupation practices and as a result of the lack of progress in the peace process. The only way to get out of this circle of blood is simply to advance the peace process on a fair basis, and second, that Israel should modify its practices and policies in the occupied territories in order to reduce the tension and the frustration among the Palestinian people.
