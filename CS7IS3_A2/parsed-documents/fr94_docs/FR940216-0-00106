FR940216-0-00106 FR940216-0-00010 These and other components of EPA's enforcement program for reformulated gasoline are not able on their own to address the main focus of the independent sampling and testing program_the accuracy of the individual batch determinations made by refiners and importers. These determinations must be accurate to achieve compliance with either the per-gallon or averaging standards. Given the fungible mixing of reformulated gasoline both within a refinery or import facility and in the gasoline distribution system, EPA is not able to check the accuracy of these individual batch determinations. Compliance with the reformulated gasoline requirements also involves accurately analyzing many more gasoline components than is required under any of EPA's prior motor vehicle fuel regulations. This additional complexity both increases the need for refiner or importer accuracy, and makes it that much harder for EPA to check compliance after gasoline has been fungibly mixed. EPA believes the independent sampling and testing program is a reasonable response to these circumstances, and draws a reasonable balance between EPA's enforcement needs and the desirability of maintaining a highly fungible gasoline distribution system. Other commenters stated that independent sampling and testing was unnecessary because the fungible gasoline distribution system, and contractual commitments, will guarantee product compliance. EPA believes that product specifications will be set by pipelines or gasoline sales contracts for reformulated gasoline, however these specifications are expected to address only the minimum and maximum requirements and time and place of use restrictions. EPA does not believe these specifications will focus on whether a particular batch of reformulated gasoline was produced on average or per-gallon, or on the specific parameter values of the batch, provided the values are within the maximum and minimum requirements. As a result, gasoline specifications do not obviate the need for independent sampling and testing. Several commenters cited cost as a basis for excluding independent sampling and testing from the final rule. One industry group commented that the costs of independent sampling and testing will be $30 to $40 million per year. EPA believes the costs of independent sampling and testing will be significantly smaller than this commenter suggested. EPA has estimated that the annual costs of this program element will be between $1.9 and $7.8 million per year. A copy of a memorandum describing EPA derivation of this estimate has been placed in the docket for this rulemaking. EPA believes that the principal difference between the industry and EPA cost estimates is that the industry assumes it will be necessary for each refinery to have an independent sampler in place 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. As a result of this assumption, industry assigns an annual cost of $32 million for sample collection only. This assumption is not justified. While some high-volume refineries producing a large percentage of reformulated gasoline may require the presence of an independent sampler much of the time, most refineries will produce a batch of reformulated gasoline less frequently than every day. 49 49 Industry has estimated that, nationwide, 175 batches of gasoline are produced per day. Only a portion of these will be of reformulated gasoline, and of these, a portion will be produced through in-line blending and not require independent sampling and testing. The number of batches per day that will require independent sampling and testing is between 22 and 71. There are about 200 refineries operating in the United States; EPA believes that between 100 and 120 of these will produce reformulated gasoline (excluding refineries in California that will be exempt from the independent sampling and testing requirements). As a result, EPA estimates that on average refineries will produce one batch of reformulated gasoline that requires independent sampling and testing every 1.4 to 5.5 days. Several commenters stated that the costs of independent sampling and testing will be disproportionately high for small refiners, because their batch sizes are small in comparison to batch sizes for larger refiners, and because independent labs may not be conveniently located relative to small refineries, requiring sample shipping. It is true that the per-gallon costs of independent sampling and testing will be larger for a refinery producing reformulated gasoline in small batches in comparison to the per-gallon costs for a refiner producing larger batches. Nevertheless, EPA believes this cost difference is insignificant. For a 20,000 barrel batch, a small-sized batch, the per-gallon cost of independent sampling and testing would be $0.0003; for a 50,000 barrel batch, the per-gallon cost would be $0.0001. 50 EPA anticipates that samples collected at refineries located distant from any reliable independent laboratory will be shipped to the laboratory, but does not believe such sample shipping is problematic or costly. These conclusions are based on EPA's experience in conducting gasoline quality inspections throughout the country over at least the past dozen years, when its inspectors have shipped several thousand samples per year to EPA's laboratory for analysis. 50 EPA estimates the cost to collect and store a sample will be $230, and the analysis costs will be $42 (based on an analysis cost of $415 and analysis of 10% of the samples collected at a refinery), or $272. Commenters stated that the independent sampling and testing requirements will result in delays in the movement of finished reformulated gasoline due to the time required to resolve test result discrepancies between refiner/importer laboratories and independent laboratories, or that gasoline found to violate standards through independent sampling and testing may not be correctable because the gasoline in question will be in the fungible distribution system at the time the violation is determined. EPA does not believe these concerns create a basis for excluding the independent sampling and testing requirements. EPA does not construe the independent sampling and testing provisions to require refiners or importers to hold gasoline at the refinery or import facility until the independent testing is completed. In the event of a discrepancy between the refinery/importer test result for a gasoline batch and the independent laboratory test result for that batch, EPA anticipates the refiner/importer will correct the batch values it claims: if the standard for the parameter in question is being met on average, the value for that parameter used in calculating compliance would be changed (if the correct parameter value is within the per-gallon maximum).
