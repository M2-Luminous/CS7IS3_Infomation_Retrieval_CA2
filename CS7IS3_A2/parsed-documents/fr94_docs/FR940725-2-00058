The potential of the project to continue on a self-sustaining basis after the project period. Funding Factors Statutory Program Specific Preference: Preference will be given to any qualified applicant that agrees to expend the award to plan, develop, and operate new programs or to significantly expand existing programs. Statutory General Preference: As provided in section 860(e)(1) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_ (A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or (B) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile of proposals recommended for approval by the peer review group. Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate:'' ``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 30 percent of graduates in academic year 1992&hyph;93 or academic year 1993&hyph;94, whichever is greater, who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in the specified settings. Graduates who are providing care in a medically underserved community as a part of a fellowship or other educational experience can be counted. ``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94, the rate of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent of graduates from the most recent year are working in these settings. Statutory Special Considerations: Special consideration will be given to qualified applicants that agree to expend the award to train individuals as nurse practitioners and nurse-midwives who will practice in health professional shortage areas designated under section 332. Established Funding Priority: The following funding priority was established in FY 1993 after public comment (58 FR 5009, dated 1/19/93) and the Administration is extending this funding priority in FY 1995. Funding priority will be given to applicant institutions which demonstrate either substantial progress over the last three years or a significant experience of ten or more years in enrolling and graduating trainees from those minority or low-income populations identified as at risk of poor health outcomes. Nursing Education Opportunities for Individuals From Disadvantaged Backgrounds Purpose: Section 827 of the Public Health Service Act authorizes grants to increase opportunities for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to pursue a nursing education. Students who may have an associate degree in nursing would be eligible to receive funding under this section if they are financially, educationally or culturally disadvantaged. For purposes of Grants for Nursing Education Opportunities for Individuals from Disadvantaged Backgrounds, ``an individual from a disadvantaged background'' is one who: (1) comes from an environment that has inhibited the individual from obtaining the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to enroll in and graduate from a school of nursing; or (2) comes from a family with an annual income below a level based on low-income thresholds according to family size published by the U.S. Bureau of Census, adjusted annually for changes in the Consumer Price Index, and multiplied by a factor to be determined by the Secretary for adaptation to this program (42 CFR 57.2904). The following income figures determine what constitutes a low income family for purposes of Grants for Nursing Education Opportunities for Individuals from Disadvantaged Backgrounds for FY 1995.
