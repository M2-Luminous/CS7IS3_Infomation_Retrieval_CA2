FR941220-0-00049 FR941220-0-00010 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AC01 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Determination of Threatened Status for the Cherokee Darter and Endangered Status for the Etowah Darter AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines threatened status for the Cherokee darter ( Etheostoma ( Ulocentra ) sp.) and endangered status for the Etowah darter ( Etheostoma etowahae ) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. The Cherokee darter and Etowah darter are recently discovered species of fish that are endemic to the Etowah River system in north Georgia. The Cherokee darter is now known from approximately 20 small tributary systems of the Etowah River, but healthy populations are known from only a few sites. The Etowah darter is known from the upper Etowah River mainstem and two tributary systems. Impoundments and deteriorating water and benthic habitat quality resulting from siltation, agricultural runoff, other pollutants, poor land use practices, increased urbanization, and waste discharges have resulted in the restriction and fragmentation of these species' current ranges. These factors continue to impact the species and their habitat. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 19, 1995. ADDRESSES: The complete file for this rule is available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 6620 Southpoint Drive South, Suite 310, Jacksonville, Florida 32216.
