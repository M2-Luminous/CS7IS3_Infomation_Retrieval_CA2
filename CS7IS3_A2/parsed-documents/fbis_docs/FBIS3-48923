A great number of new companies emerged. No legislation on stock market transactions and securities was passed, but a related bill will be drafted and tabled for consideration and adoption by the National Assembly. The number of stock exchanges grew from two early last year (First Bulgarian Stock Exchange-Sofia and Sofia Stock Exchange) to thirteen at the end of the year, while stock-market turnover totalled 131 million leva. Shares traded in 1992 at the cash market were double the 1992 level, but trade was not monitored and no exact figures can be published. Leks Ltd. is the undisputed leader among companies. It distributed 89 percent in dividends among its share holders which increased the demand for the said securities on the capital market. The average stock-exchange share price was 169 leva with a 100 leva par. 1994-projected dividends were officially put at 131 percent by the company's management. The company's financial position is stable: Metal and oil re-export deals with Russia are among the most lucrative transactions as are production investments in the assembly of wrangler jeeps. First Private Bank, instituted in 1990, was ranked second in market share. The bank's 1992 dividends were 50.4 percent for bearer shares and 46 percent for registered shares. The 1993 dividend will be several points higher. First Private Bank will be among a handful of profiting banks in 1993 which heightened the interest in its shares. Last month the extraordinary general assembly of share holders decided on a capital increase to reach 1,000 million leva, its registered capital being 10 million leva, which is a significant market portion. The Board of Directors has been authorized to negotiate with South Korea's Daewoo industrial giant which is interested in the purchase of 49 percent of the registered shares. First Private Bank will cover a World Bank loan for private sector and export funding. Credit Bank, an international multigroup holding bank instituted in 1991 with a 50 million leva registered capital, was surprisingly ranked third in market traded shares worth nearly 14.5 million leva which is due to big sales in May, June and September. Another private bank, the Agricultural Credit Bank, with 30 percent of its capital owned by Austria's Raiffeisenbank distributed 50 percent in dividends in 1993, while its share prices did not drop below the 2,000 leva mark, the par being 1,000 leva. The shares of major state-run banks did not sell well in 1993 due to huge bad credits and financial performance throughout the year. Newly emerged companies opted for real property and construction investment: Long-term material assets not affected by high inflation. The East-West International Holding, which guaranteed a 105-percent dividend in 1993, and TBS Hotels constructing the Ambassador-Sofia Hotel with a 150-per cent projected dividend, are some of them. Trakiya Commerce, working in the field of bakery products, Maxcom Hold, Black Sea Investment Fund, Aktiv, and Bulgarian Autotransport Co. have elicited investor's interest because of their anticipated progress. Investment funds are a novelty. They aim to collect the disposable money assets of banks and other potential investors and invest them in lucrative projects. The Razvitie (development) Investment Fund was ranked top on the stock market. The bulk of its transactions relate to immoveables and it is also engaged in the construction of a financial centre in Sofia. The shares of Suedinenie (unity) Investment Fund, dealing with financial investments, also elicited interest.
