The officials have not disclosed the amount of compensation Tehran has asked for to be able to hold talks on the matter. It has been reported that Tehran has asked Ankara to pay separate remunerations for more than 10 people, who were wounded, and nine others, who were killed. Tehran has also asked for compensation for the damage that was caused by the attack. Turkey will respond to Iran's request after the officials in Ankara consider the amount of compensation that has been asked for by Tehran. Tehran's request probably will be discussed between the two countries.
