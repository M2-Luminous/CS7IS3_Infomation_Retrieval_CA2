According to a study conducted by the Secretariat of Central American Economic Integration [SIECA], the economies of Guatemala and the rest of the countries in the region would be severely harmed by their disadvantage with Mexico with regard to exports to the U.S. market. Taking this into consideration, President Clinton sent to the Congress a bill detailing a "provisional trade proposal for the Caribbean Basin," until the countries of the region are completely integrated into NAFTA. SIECA pointed out that investments are already being diverted to Mexico because of the country's preference within NAFTA. If this trend continues, the region's development would be set back, considering the fact that the United States is the main destination of exports in the area. The proposal for the Caribbean Basin countries to attain parity with NAFTA was sent to Congress for approval, together with other bills related to foreign trade. For a country to participate in the provisional trade program, it must be free of charges of violations of labor and intellectual property rights laws. In addition, the country must not be included in the provisions of line 301 on restrictions on exports to the United States. At present, Guatemala faces charges by labor unions and other U.S. organizations that the country violates labor rights, particularly regarding assembly plants, agriculture, and copyrights.
