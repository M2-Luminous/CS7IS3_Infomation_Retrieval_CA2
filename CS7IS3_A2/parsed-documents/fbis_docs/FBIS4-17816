This declaration was made today by the new chairman of Georgian Committee on human rights defence and ethnic relations Sandro Kavsadze in an interview to SNARK. In his words, such mechanism could be the CIS collective security forces. "We cannot wait. Otherwise, the situation in Abkhazia may become ungovernable, and the conflict will acquire a large-scale character," stressed Kavsadze. Besides, he noted that official Tbilisi raises the question of expanding the mandate of the UN observers dislocated in the conflict zone, and increasing their number.
