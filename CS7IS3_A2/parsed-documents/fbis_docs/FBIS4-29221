The ministry said it will take applications from those who want to speak at the hearing until June 24. With U.S. quarantine measures to prevent apple disease having already cleared Japanese requirements, Japan plans to lift its ban on imports of U.S. apples this fall. Japan has kept its market closed to U.S. apples, citing worms and disease which it had said could contaminate Japanese crops. Ministry sources said that at a similar hearing in April last year on imports of New Zealand apples, domestic apple growers clamored for the continued ban on foreign apples.
