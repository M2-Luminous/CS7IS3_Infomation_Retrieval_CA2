The year 1994 is very important and crucial for our country's efforts to deepen reform. The introduction of successive major reform measures, such as those designed to establish a market system and a macroeconomic regulatory and control system, will lead to some new contradictions and problems. How do we guard against danger while living in peace and take precautions to maintain a stable public order? At the beginning of the new year, this reporter interviewed Shu Huaide, secretary general of the Central Commission on Politics and Law and director of the Office of the Central Committee for the Comprehensive Management of Public Security [CCCMPS]. [Zhao Haibo] Public order is currently one of the topics of great concern to the people. The central authorities have always considered this issue important and have tried to solve it by every possible means. Would you please discuss the situation in this respect? [Shu Huaide] Generally speaking, our country enjoys a stable public order. This is primarily determined by nationwide political stability and economic development. However, it cannot be separated from the attention devoted to the comprehensive management of public security by the party Central Committee, the State Council, and party committees and governments at all levels. As pointed out by a leading central comrade last July, "public order problems could have been more serious had we not made relentless efforts to manage public security comprehensively." To be sure, we cannot be optimistic about the current state of public order. Public order in some areas is indeed very bad. For instance, robberies are on the increase, highway and railway bandits are running wild, hooligans and evil forces in some villages and small towns are running rampant in their neighborhoods and are riding roughshod over the people, illegal criminal activities such as plundering and stealing state assets are increasing in oil fields, in mining areas, and along traffic routes; and social ills such as prostitution, patronizing prostitutes, drug abuse, and gambling persist despite repeated efforts to ban them. In light of these salient public order problems, the CCCMPS successively arranged four special struggles against "theft," "highway and railway bandits," "prostitution and patronizing prostitutes," and the "abduction and sale of women and children." These struggles have yielded results for the time being thanks to the vigorous support of leaders of party committees and governments at all levels and the broad masses of the people. Specifically, the struggle against highway and railway bandits launched nationwide since last March has produced remarkable results, thereby winning favorable comment from all sectors of society and from the people. [Zhao] It has become a common public understanding that public security should be managed comprehensively. Nevertheless, people in some areas often do not assume responsibility although they want a piece of the cake. How should we change this situation? [Shu] The key lies in instituting a type of mechanism consisting of incentives and restraints by which the responsibility for maintaining political stability and public order will be genuinely devolved to all departments, units, and individuals. Last November, the CCCMPS, in conjunction with the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the CPC Central Committee's Organization Department, the Ministry of Personnel, and the Ministry of Supervision, formulated "Several Provisions Regarding the Implementation of a Leadership Responsibility System for the Comprehensive Management of Public Security," which established, as one of the goals for leading party and government cadres at all levels during their tenures, the comprehensive management of public security to ensure safety in all quarters, and which specified this as a criterion for evaluating job performance and for deciding on promotions, rewards, and disciplinary actions. The CCCMPS recently jointly issued a document with the relevant central departments specifying that individuals named as advanced persons in the national drive for the comprehensive management of public security may enjoy treatment comparable to that of provincial- or ministerial-level model workers. As its next step, the CCCMPS plans to study and formulate laws and regulations governing the comprehensive management of public security in an attempt to define in legal form the responsibility of units and citizens for maintaining public order. [Zhao] What are the key tasks in comprehensive management of public security in 1994? [Shu] The gradual establishment of a socialist market economic system and the deepening of reform in the new year will lead to more complex conditions and heavier burdens in the arena of public order. We must further strengthen comprehensive management without slackening our efforts in the least. While we have a great deal of work to do in 1994, we should focus on the following six tasks: 1) We should firmly implement the leadership responsibility system for comprehensive management of public security, further heighten the sense of political responsibility for "ensuring safety in all quarters" among party and government leaders at all levels as well as among all relevant departments, and strengthen the concept of duty among cadres and people which says "maintaining public order is the duty of everybody." 2) We should continue our focused management approach. We should take account of reality, pay full heed to popular demands, and focus on improving outstanding public order problems and on areas where public order is bad. For instance, in the cities we should first improve chaotic public order in places where the public mingles haphazardly -- such as train stations, wharves, cultural and recreational facilities, and large country fairs. We should focus on battling illegal criminal activities which disrupt public order -- such as theft, robbery, prostitution, patronage of prostitutes, the dissemination of obscene articles, and market manipulation. 3) We should work hard to solve public order problems in rural areas, relentlessly fight against various hooligans and evil forces, further strengthen primary party and government organizations, and solidify mass prevention and management teams. 4) We should strengthen education of the legal system among young people, especially among middle-school students. 5) We should resettle, assist, and educate people who are released upon completing their prison terms or who are discharged from education through labor programs. We should marshal resources in all sectors of society to create broad avenues of employment, and should implement responsibility systems and measures for providing assistance and education. 6) We should intensify efforts to publicize the need for comprehensive management of public security, and should galvanize more cadres, workers, staff members, and people into conscientiously participating in comprehensive management. Comprehensive management of public security is the fundamental solution to our country's public order problems, and it will play an increasingly important role in maintaining political stability and public order. I am confident it is entirely possible to foster long-term social stability in our country if we firmly implement various measures of comprehensively managing public security and if we maintain the current favorable state of political and social stability under the guidance of the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the direct leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core.
