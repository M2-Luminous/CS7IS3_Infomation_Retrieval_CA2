Apart from presenting an analysis and forecast, the "Green Paper" calls for more financial support for agriculture. This second economic "Green Paper" presented by the rural economy annual analysis project group jointly run by the Institute of Rural Development of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the Statistical Department of Rural Economy of the State Statistical Bureau provides descriptions, analyses, and relevant comparisons, rendered in the most objective manner possible, of all aspects of the Chinese rural economy last year, and a brief forecast of this year's development. The report holds that the year 1993 saw quite rapid growth in the general level of agricultural production, and the agricultural output composition experienced another remarkable adjustment. The growth rate of nonagricultural sectors in rural areas reached unprecedented heights. Over the past year, industry and tertiary industry's share of the output value and labor force of rural areas continued to increase. The major regions of East, Central, and West China generally matched each other in terms of the high growth rate of township and town enterprises, whereas the gap between different regions continued to widen in the per-capita income of the peasants. The consumer goods sales volume on the rural market grew at a relatively low and stable rate, while commodity prices soared rapidly, input in agriculture dropped, rural areas were faced with a shortage of funds, and the macroeconomic regulation and control of agriculture was less effective... The "Green Paper" discloses that the state's financial outlay on agriculture was more than 43 billion yuan last year, an increase of more than 7 percent over the previous year. Of this outlay, about 13 billion yuan was spent on agricultural capital construction, an increase of 16.4 percent over the previous year, but this turned out to be a negative growth with the inflation factor taken into account. Therefore, increasing financial support for agriculture has now been placed on the important agenda. A stronger appeal was made by some high-ranking officials and experts present at today's "Green Paper" symposium, co-sponsored by the Institute of Rural Development of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the YAO BAO [6008 1032; IMPORTANT NEWS] editorial department, and the Statistical Department of Rural Economy of the State Statistical Bureau. Forecasting this year's gross agricultural output value, the "Green Paper" says the growth rate of the gross agricultural output value will range from 3.5 to 6.5 percent, depending on how good the harvest is this year. The gross output value contributed by township and town enterprises and the gross output value of rural areas will range from 25 to 30 percent and from 15 to 20 percent respectively, varying from place to place and depending on local macroeconomic development conditions. The real growth in the per-capita income of peasants is expected to be 3 to 4 percent. Referring to this year's rural economic development, the "Green Paper" says grain production may experience fluctuation, the growth in the peasants' income will still be quite low, and the output-employment flexibility [chan chu jiu ye tan xing 3934 0427 1432 2814 1734 1840] for nonagricultural sectors will still be very low. The "Green Paper" maintains that apart from giving more financial support to agriculture, it is also necessary to maintain a stable farming technique promotion team; minimize the impact of inflation on the peasants' income; expedite the comprehensive development of tertiary industry and small towns in rural areas; and stabilize agricultural production. The "Green Paper" holds that, in the next 10 years or more, only by making efforts in four aspects--developing good-quality high- return agriculture, speeding up the urbanization process, expediting the development of tertiary industry in rural areas, and building up regional composite networks for production, processing, and marketing of good-quality high-return agricultural products--will China be able to gradually solve the two problems of low relative profitability of agriculture and low relative fluidity of the agricultural labor force, and thus begin, in the second decade of the next century, the process of a substantial and continuous decrease in the agricultural population.
