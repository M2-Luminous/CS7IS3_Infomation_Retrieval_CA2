Answering a question from the ITAR-TASS correspondent, the head of Kyrgyzstan's parliament stated that the Interparliamentary peacemaking group is now engaged in preparing for a meeting of Azerbaijani, Armenian, and Nagornyy Karabakh parliamentarians in Bishkek. He expressed the hope that success will be achieved in organizing a frank exchange of opinions between the heads of the parliaments of these states. According to M. Sherimkulov he will tomorrow be flying to Baku and Yerevan and afterwards will visit Stepanakert, where specific dates will be agreed for the meeting. "I should like to hope that the end result of our activities will be peace. People are tired of war and of the fact that the number of refugees is growing. Not one state gains from this," M. Sherimkulov emphasized. "If we managed to give help and support in bringing the positions of the warring sides closer, we should consider our mission useful," he said. As a high-ranking Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman noted in a conversation with journalists, the Russian foreign policy department fully supports the intention and desire of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly peacemaking group to take what part it can in the process of settling the conflict in Nagornyy Karabakh. According to him the Russian Foreign Ministry "is working in close contact and is ready to provide expert assistance in the work that this group is performing." The Russian Foreign Ministry considers that this group "can play a special role, since parliamentarians can promote the establishment of an appropriate atmosphere in which it would be possible to adopt the agreement on which the executive structures are now working." According to the high-ranking Russian diplomat the main aim now is "to bring the sides together and to create an appropriate atmosphere for the adoption of an agreement on halting the conflict in Nagornyy Karabakh." This agreement has been worked out in principle. Each side involved in the conflict has its own approaches and probably much more effort will have to be made for it to be signed, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed.
