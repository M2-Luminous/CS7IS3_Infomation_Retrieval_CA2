FR941206-0-00039 FR941206-0-00007 Subpart C_Tax Refund Offset §2609.31 Purpose and scope. (a) Purpose. This subpart prescribes procedures for debt collection by tax refund offset, as authorized by section 3720A of subchapter II, chapter 37 of title 31 of the United States Code (31 U.S.C. 3720A) and in accordance with applicable IRS regulations (26 CFR 301&hyph;6402.6), including a related procedure for disclosure to a consumer reporting agency. (b) Scope. The procedures in this subpart apply to determinations that a debt of at least $25 is past-due and legally enforceable, to referrals by the PBGC of past-due, legally enforceable debts to the IRS for offset, and to any subsequent corrections of information contained in such referrals. §2609.32 Eligibility of debt for tax refund offset. The PBGC will determine whether a debt is eligible for tax refund offset in accordance with IRS regulations (26 CFR 301.6402&hyph;6 (c) and (d)). The PBGC may refer a past-due, legally enforceable debt to the IRS for offset if: (a) The debt is a judgment debt, or the PBGC's right of action accrued not more than 10 years earlier (unless the debt is specifically exempt from this requirement); (b) The PBGC cannot currently collect the debt by salary offset (pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1)); (c) The debt is ineligible for administrative offset (by reason of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2)), or the PBGC cannot currently collect the debt by administrative offset (under 31 U.S.C. 3716 and subpart B of this part) against amounts payable by the debtor to the PBGC; (d) The PBGC has notified, or attempted to notify, the debtor of its intent to refer the debt, given the debtor an opportunity to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable, considered any evidence presented by the debtor in accordance with §2609.33 of this part, and determined that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable; (e) If the debt is a consumer debt and exceeds $100, the PBGC has disclosed the debt to a consumer reporting agency (as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(f) and provided in §2609.33 of this part), unless a consumer reporting agency would be prohibited from reporting information concerning the debt (by reason of 15 U.S.C. 1681c); and (f) The debt is at least $25. §2609.33 Tax refund offset procedures. (a) General. Before referring a debt for tax refund offset, the PBGC will complete the procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section and, if applicable, paragraph (c) of this section. The PBGC may satisfy these requirements in conjunction with any other procedures that apply to the same debt, such as those prescribed in §2609.23 of this part or part 2606 of this subchapter. (b) Notice, opportunity to present evidence, and determination of indebtedness. (1) The PBGC will notify, or make a reasonable attempt to notify, a person owing a debt (a ``debtor'') that a debt is past-due and if not repaid within 60 days, the PBGC will refer the debt to the IRS for offset against any overpayment of tax. For this purpose, compliance with IRS procedures (26 CFR 301.6402&hyph;6(d)(1)) constitutes a reasonable attempt to notify a debtor. (2) A debtor will have at least 60 days to present evidence, for consideration by the PBGC, that all or part of a debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable. (3) If evidence that all or part of a debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable is considered by an agent or person other than a PBGC employee acting on behalf of the PBGC, a debtor will have at least 30 days from the date of the determination on the debt to request review by the Director of the Financial Operations Department (or a department official designated by the Director).
