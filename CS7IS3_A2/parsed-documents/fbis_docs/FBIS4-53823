"I have never stated that the talks would be stopped. What causes a delay is the search for a suitable time for all sides," he said. The planned talks between the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Philippine Government involving Indonesia as the facilitator which has been scheduled on May 17 have been postponed indefinitely. Analysts said this must have to do with the planned holding of a conference on "Asia Pacific Conference on East Timor" in the Philippines on May 31-June 3. "We are still seeking the right time. Besides preparations at technical level also have not yet finished. That's why it is postponed," he said. Alatas however assured that the talks would be held this year. Alatas would not give much comment regarding a Muhammadiyah leader's idea to conduct a seminar on Moro similar to that of the planned East Timor conference in the Philippines. "That was Lukman Harun's idea," he said. Alatas stated that it was not necessary for Indonesia to send people to the East Timor conference adding that no officials of the Indonesian embassy in Manila were invited. He appreciated President Ramos' decision to ban foreign participants and speakers to take part in the conference. "Now the conference is internal in nature, attended only by the Philippine people. Now this is their own business and we have no right to give our own judgement," he said. Alatas reiterated that the conference was not merely a conference in the Philippines, held with the Philippines but a conference fully planned and engineered by Ramon Horta and his associates. "I have the evidence," he added. He said this conference would not talk in general about human rights but would be political, aimed at tarnishing the Indonesian name leading to disrupting Indonesia's territorial integrity. Asked about a report, carried by Portugal daily LNSA, that Indonesia plans to deport Fretilin leader Xanana Gusmao abroad. Alatas said that "This is a clear disinformation to lead us into a [word indistinct]." "Our enemy is getting wilder, they see there have been the Indonesia-Portugal Friendship Association, the Europe-Indonesia Parliamentary Association. Room for maneuver for Ramon Horta and his fellows is getting narrower and so they are getting wilder," Alatas said.
