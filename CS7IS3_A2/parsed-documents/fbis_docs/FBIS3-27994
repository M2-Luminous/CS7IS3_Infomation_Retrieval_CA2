FBIS3-27994 "dreas022_a_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-022 Document Type:Daily Report 2 Feb 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Ministry: Balance of Payments Figures Delayed OW0202040294 Tokyo KYODO in English 0338 GMT 2 Feb 94 OW0202040294 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry said Wednesday [2 February] it will postpone the release of December balance of payments data until Monday, instead of Friday as scheduled. The ministry said in a statement that the postponement is due to a delay in compiling related statistics because the ministry has to announce data on both December and calendar 1993. Balance of payments data includes the closely watched current account and balance of trade statistics. The postponement of the release date comes as U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor is visiting Japan on a trade mission aimed at breaking an impasse in bilateral market-opening trade talks. In the framework trade talks, Washington has been demanding that Japan set numerical targets for imports to help assess progress in reducing Japan's massive surplus in bilateral trade. Kantor, accompanied by Bowman Cutter, deputy director of the National Economic Council and chief negotiator in the talks, is to meet Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai on Wednesday. He is also slated to meet Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Thursday. The delay in release of December balance of payments data involves a similar postponement of the release of data on Japanese equity investments abroad and foreign equity investments in Japan until Monday, instead of Friday.
