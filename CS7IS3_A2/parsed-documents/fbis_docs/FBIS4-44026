The minister of finance previewed for the assembly the contents of the tax reform bill. Chianciano--Sergio Cofferati will be the new general secretary of the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor]. The applause he received at the end of his long speech, at eight o'clock in the evening, was worth more than a simple investiture to the man who, at the end of the month, will now clearly take Bruno Trentin's place. It was a spontaneous election that reduces to a pure formality the official election that, within approximately one week, will involve the 200 members of the CGIL leadership. Defeated at the very outset, therefore, although without dishonor, was Alfiero Grandi, who represents the more leftward-leaning wing of the Confederation. The brief and rather cold clapping of hands he received from the thousand-plus leaders and delegates of the CGIL conveyed not even a passing grade to Grandi and to his speech of yesterday, laced as it was with belligerence. There can be no doubt that the CGIL assembly prefers to be represented by Cofferati, a prudent and pragmatic negotiator with a reputation as a moderate, rather than by the more impetuous and inflexible Grandi. Thus, by the end of its second day, the major Italian labor confederation's platform conference had changed into certainties the vague suppositions that had been floating in the air. All that remain for today are Bruno Trentin's concluding remarks--a true-to-form farewell waltz after six years spent as the CGIL's leader--to bring to a close a chapter of union history. First Steps Toward Employment If the conference's evening session was enlivened by the Grandi-Cofferati "tournament" (with the reporters furious at the organizers' sadism), the morning meeting was energized by the presence of Giulio Tremonti, the Berlusconi government's finance minister, who was the sole representative of the government to accept Trentin's invitation. Labor Minister Mastella preferred to decline. Although the applause that followed Tremonti's remarks was barely within the bounds of politeness, there were no hisses. Incidentally, while Tremonti patiently awaited his turn, Claudio Sabatini, leader of the metalworkers union, thundered against Berlusconi, referring to him as a "ham actor." Despite even Tremonti's explicit assurances that he intended to structure the tax reform bill with the participation and cooperation of the opposition and the unions, the hostility of the CGIL rank and file toward the government as its "enemy" did not abate. The minister provided no advance information on the mechanisms that will be used to bring about "a new system that is simpler and less unfair than the present one" in Italy. He touched briefly on the possibility that the next Council of Ministers will launch the first measures designed to favor businesses that increase the number of employees, then gave a lecture on the philosophy that will inspire the reform. "It will be a constitutional change," said the minister, "one that will involve parliament, and that therefore cannot but involve the opposition and the social partners." After all, in tax matters, many elements that are "identical in substance" can be found in the platforms of the various parties. In brief, as in all the Western democracies, the Berlusconi government is determined to not proceed, in tax matters, on the basis of forcing the will of the majority upon the minority. The cornerstones of the reform are those for which Tremonti has long been pressing: a gradual shifting of taxation from the central government to the regions, from direct to indirect taxes, from the complex to the simple. "There is no hope of restructuring the system--he stressed--if the circuitousness of itemized taxation is not broken. The issue is finding a balance between benefits and sacrifices. Meanwhile, the national taxation system will have to remain in place to enable the state to continue functioning." The issues of the CGIL leadership succession and of its relations with the new government turned out to be tightly interwoven. One after the other, Grandi and Cofferati outlined diametrically opposed approaches with respect to the new team at Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime minister]. Not by happenstance did Grandi advocate a profound future distrust of any agreement modeled on the 23 July 1993 accord signed with the Ciampi administration. Grandi expressed the hope that this agreement, the fruit of a compromise dictated by emergency, "should it collapse, will collapse to the left and not to the right." Cofferati, on the other hand, pressed the view that the famous entente of a year ago is vital to labor: "It is a guarantee of our right to negotiate." The two contenders argued on different wavelengths. Alfiero Grandi defined the present government as a "videocracy" with which labor cannot but clash: "Let us gird for battle. Without a shift in policy we will not make it"; and "Any thought of fair play is unrealistic." And to those who might argue that his is a prejudicial attitude, he would reply that "The first measures instituted by Berlusconi immediately dashed what frankly had been unfounded hopes to begin with"; and that "it is impossible not to be concerned when the budget minister is the likes of Pagliarini." Without directly challenging Grandi by name at any time, Sergio Cofferati rebutted his antagonist's speech point by point. And as his own speech progressed, the audience--or at least the majority of the listeners--seemed increasingly relieved at the grit their favorite candidate was displaying. This time there was no self-consciousness on his part, but a pressing delivery with clear proposals, even at the risk of arousing a measure of unpopularity. "We can envision a clash with the government, but not on abstract demands. It must be on the issue of a policy consistent with the need to restore public finances on a sound footing." In Cofferati's opinion austerity must not be abandoned, even with respect to the reduction in working hours. Cofferati deemed the policy on working hours to be crucial, but he very decidedly opposed a demand that "would presume to dump the entire cost of this operation on the state." "We would not be credible," he repeated. Labor Unity Relaunched In his view, the model to be followed is that of the Volkswagen union agreement, "based on a pact that, in a moment of crisis, management makes with labor organizations." In order to avoid thousands of layoffs, the labor unions had the courage to accept a reduction in wages. Similarly, in Italy, according to Cofferati, to avoid a break in the pact between generations, future productivity dividends must not be converted in their entirety into wage increases--the maintaining of real wages is sufficient--but rather channeled into the creation of new jobs. Appreciable differences between the two participants in this duel were noted with respect to another important issue, namely, labor unity. A debate on "when" is reductive; it is better by far, according to Cofferati, to begin immediately the process of unifying the CGIL with the CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions], and the UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions] because "no single confederation, alone, can succeed in attaining the objectives set forth by Bruno Trentin." Concluding his remarks, Cofferati turned to Trentin with an appeal, that he continue making his "irreplaceable contribution" to the CGIL in whatever manner he thinks best. And of his internal opponents he asked that they not allow their right of dissent to compromise "the transparency, the respect, and the solidarity of the leadership group."
