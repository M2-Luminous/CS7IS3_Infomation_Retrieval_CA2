FR941005-2-00121 FR941005-2-00084 Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards; Procedures for Meetings Background Procedures to be followed with respect to meetings conducted pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC's) Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) are described in this notice. These procedures are set forth in order that they may be incorporated by reference in future individual meeting notices. The ACRS is a statutory group established by Congress to review and report on applications for the licensing of nuclear power reactor facilities and on certain other nuclear safety matters. The Committee's reports become a part of the public record. The ACRS meetings are normally open to the public and provide opportunities for oral or written statements from members of the public to be considered as part of the Committee's information gathering procedures. The meetings are not adjudicatory hearings such as those conducted by the NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel as part of the Commission's licensing process. ACRS full Committee meetings are conducted in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act. General Rules Regarding ACRS Meetings An agenda is published in the Federal Register for each full Committee meeting. Practical considerations may dictate some changes to the agenda. The Chairman of the Committee is empowered to conduct the meeting in a manner that, in his judgment, will facilitate the orderly conduct of business, including making provisions of continue discussions of matters not completed on the scheduled day to the next day. The following requirements shall apply to public participation in ACRS meetings: (a) Persons wishing to submit written statements regarding the agenda items may do so by providing a readily reproducible copy at the beginning of the meeting. Comments should be limited to matters under consideration by the Committee. Persons desiring to mail written comments may do so by sending a readily reproducible copy addressed to the Designated Federal Official specified in the Federal Register notice for the individual meeting in care of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Comments should be in the possession of the Designated Federal Official no later than five days prior to a meeting to allow time for reproduction, distribution and consideration at the meeting. (b) Persons desiring to make oral statements at the meeting should make a request to do so to the Designated Federal Official prior to the beginning of the meeting and summarize the content of the oral statements for the Designated Federal Official. If possible, the request should be made five days before the meeting, identifying the topics to be discussed and the amount of time needed for presentation, so that appropriate arrangements can be made. The committee will hear oral statements on topics being reviewed at an appropriate time during the meeting scheduled by the Chairman. (c) Further information regarding topics to be discussed, whether a meeting has been cancelled or rescheduled, and the Chairman's ruling on requests for the opportunity to present oral statements and the time allotted therefore can be obtained by contacting, on the working day prior to the meeting, the Office of the Executive Director of the ACRS (telephone: 301/415&hyph;7360, ATTN: the Designated Federal Official specified in the Federal Register notice for the meeting) between 7:30 a.m. and 4:15 p.m., Eastern time. (d) During the ACRS meeting presentations and discussions, questions may be asked by ACRS members, Committee consultants, and the NRC and ACRS staff. (e) The use of still, motion picture, and television cameras will be permitted both before and after the meeting and during any recess, subject to the condition that the physical installation and presence of such equipment will not interfere with the conduct of the meeting. Approval from the Designated Federal Official will have to be obtained prior to the installation or use of such equipment. The use of such equipment will be allowed while the meeting is in session at the discretion of the Chairman to a degree that it is not disruptive. When use of such equipment is permitted, appropriate measures will be taken to protect proprietary or privileged information that may be in documents, folders, etc., being used during the meeting. Electronic recording will be permitted only during those portions of the meeting that are open to the public. (f) A transcript is kept for certain open portions of the meeting and will be available in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW, Washington, DC 20555, for use within one week following the meeting. A copy of the certified minutes of the meeting will be available at the same location on or before three months following the meeting. Copies may be obtained at the Public Document Room upon payment of appropriate charges. (g) When ACRS meetings are held at locations other than at NRC facilities, reproduction facilities may not be available at reasonable cost. Accordingly, 25 additional copies of the materials to be used during the meeting should be provided for distribution at such meetings. Special Provisions When Proprietary Sessions are to be Held If it is necessary to hold closed sessions for the purpose of discussing matters involving proprietary information, persons with agreements permitting access to such information may attend those portions of the ACRS meetings where this material is being discussed upon confirmation that such agreements are effective and related to the material being discussed. The Designated Federal Official should be informed of such an agreement at least five working days prior to the meeting so that it can be confirmed, and a determination can be made regarding the applicability of the agreement to the material that will be discussed during the meeting. The minimum information provided should include information regarding the date of the agreement, the scope of material included in the agreement, the project or projects involved, and the names and titles of the persons signing the agreement. Additional information may be requested to identify the specific agreement involved. A copy of the executed agreement should be provided to the Designated Federal Official prior to the beginning of the meeting for admittance to the closed session. Dated September 29, 1994 Andrew L. Bates, Advisory Committee Management Officer. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24594 Filed 10&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M
