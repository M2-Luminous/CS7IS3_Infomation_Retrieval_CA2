Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-04FEB94-VIETNAM-U.S. Hanoi Welcomes Embargo End, Reaffirms MIA Cooperation While predictably welcoming President Bill Clinton's 3 February decision to lift the U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam, Hanoi has also sought to reassure U.S. critics of the decision by issuing a highly authoritative Foreign Ministry statement reaffirming Vietnam's continued willingness to cooperate in resolving the question of Americans missing in action (MIA) from the Indochina war. The 4 February statement, while claiming that the decision had "opened a new page" in U.S.-Vietnamese relations, made it clear that Hanoi will continue to "cooperate fully" with Washington in resolving "pending" bilateral issues (Hanoi radio, 4 February). The authoritative statement then went on to underscore Hanoi's longstanding position that the MIA issue is a "humanitarian concern not linked with political issues" and reaffirmed the willingness of the "Vietnamese Government and people" to continue to "cooperate in a constructive spirit" with the U.S. Government and American people in resolving the MIA question to the "fullest extent possible." Hanoi's decision to use a highly authoritative Foreign Ministry statement to deliver its message on the MIA question is particularly notable, since such authoritative statements are rare. For example, last year Hanoi issued only two such statements--one in March to protest the killing of Vietnamese residing in Cambodia (Hanoi radio, 12 March 1993) and the other in June to comment on the Cambodian elections (Hanoi radio, 3 June 1993). Hanoi last employed a Foreign Ministry statement to comment on the United States in May 1992 when it issued one to protest an agreement between Chinese and American oil companies to exploit oil and gas resources on Vietnam's continental shelf (Hanoi radio, 17 May 1992).
