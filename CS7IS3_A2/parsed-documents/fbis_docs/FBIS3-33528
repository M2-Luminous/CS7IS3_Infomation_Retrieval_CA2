Andre Santini, chairman of the Production and Exchange Commission of the French National Assembly, spoke on behalf of the mission representing various French legislative groups and commented on the his pleasant interview with Cuban President Fidel Castro. It was interesting for us to meet with one of the most important figures in contemporary history, and we will always cherish this moment, said Santini, who is also a former minister. He described as pleasant and very cordial the conversation he held with the president who, he explained, was very interested in the French legislature and in exchanging viewpoints on the most important current world events. During their stay in Cuba, the legislators also met with Vice President Carlos Lage, Ricardo Alarcon, president of the People's Government National Assembly, and the ministers of foreign relations, education, and public health, among other officials. Santini said they have seen a country that resists in spite of the prevailing difficult conditions and that is ready to accept change without giving up its political ideology. He noted that the delegation will present a report to the National Assembly and the French prime minister calling for an increase in the current line of credit of $120 million that Paris has available to Cuba, recognizing that there are good possibilities for foreign investments in Cuba. Some international media say Cuba will fail and that the people here are starving to death, but we have not seen anything like that during our visit, Santini emphasized. The French parliamentary delegation will return to its country tomorrow, Saturday, after completing its final activities in Cuba.
