FR940711-0-00064 FR940711-0-00019 By letter dated August 2, 1993 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;851), Utah submitted to OSM a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1201&hyph;1328, and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Chapter VII (the Federal regulations). Utah submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. Utah proposed revisions to the Utah Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Board of Oil, Gas and Mining (Board) at Utah Administrative Rules (Utah Admin. R.) 641&hyph;112&hyph;100, scope of rulemaking, and 641&hyph;112&hyph;200, promulgation of rules. Utah also proposed revisions to the Utah Coal Mining Rules at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;500, petitions to initiate rulemaking; 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, hearing requirement for designating areas unsuitable for coal mining and reclamation operations; 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, confidentiality of coal exploration information; 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661, permit application blasting level chart; 645&hyph;301&hyph;731.760, permit application cross sections and maps showing hydrologic information; and 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110 and 645&hyph;302&hyph;323.310, special areas of mining, specifically prime farmland and alluvial valley floors. Utah proposed to delete the scope of rulemaking provision at Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112&hyph;100 that requires the Board to promulgate such procedural and substantive rules it deems useful or necessary to implement statutory duties, fulfill its statutory obligations, or interpret the statutory authority under which it operates. At Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112&hyph;200, Utah proposed to revise the procedures for promulgation of rules to provide that the Board will promulgate rules under the authority provided at Utah Code Annotated (UCA) Sections 40&hyph;6&hyph;5, 40&hyph;9&hyph;3.5(2), and 40&hyph;10&hyph;6(1). At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;500, Utah proposed that persons other than the Division of Oil, Gas and Mining (Division) or the Board may petition to initiate rulemaking pursuant to Utah Admin. R. 641 and the Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act, UCA 63&hyph;46&hyph;8. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, Utah proposed that within 10 months after receipt of a complete petition to designate an area unsuitable for coal mining, the Board shall hold a public hearing in the locality of the area covered by the petition ``unless the petitioners and intervenors agree.'' At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, Utah proposed to revise its coal exploration confidentiality provision to require that the Division will not make information available for public inspection, if the person submitting it requests in writing, at the time of submission, that it not be disclosed and the information is classified as being protected, private, or controlled under the Utah Government Records Access and Management Act (GRAMA) or confidential under other applicable State or Federal laws, rules, or regulations. At Utah Admin. R 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661, Utah proposed to delete the reference to UCA 63&hyph;46a&hyph;3(7)(a) and reference only Figure 1 in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.67, which shows the maximum allowable ground particle velocity for blasting operations. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;731.760, Utah proposed to add to its hydrology permit application requirements that the Division may, depending on the structures and facilities located in the permit area, require other relevant cross sections and maps, in addition to those cross sections and maps already specifically required by the State's existing rules. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, Utah proposed to revise its prime farmland permit application content requirements to indicate that U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soils Handbooks 436 (Soil Taxonomy) and 18 (Soil Survey Manual) are incorporated on the effective date, rather than the date of adoption, of Utah Admin. R. 645. Also, at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, Utah proposed to delete the statement that notices of changes made to the USDA handbooks will be periodically published in the Federal Register . At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;323.310, Utah proposed to revise its alluvial valley floor water quality requirement by adding language that incorporates by reference the specific publication by Maas and Hoffman, ``Crop Salt Tolerance_Current Assessment,'' Table 1, ``Salt Tolerance of Agricultural Crops.'' OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the August 27, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 45305, administrative record No. UT&hyph;865), and in the same document, opened the public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the substantive adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period closed on September 27, 1993. The public hearing, scheduled for September 21, 1993, was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify. During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns for (1) Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112, regarding the incorrect reference to its rulemaking authority at UCA 40&hyph;9&hyph;3.5(2), which was repealed by Utah in 1993; (2) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, regarding the need for agreement between the petitioners and intervenors to change the location of a public hearing on a petition to designate lands unsuitable for mining; (3) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, regarding the proposed deletion of the phrase ``and the information is confidential,'' which would impart a change in the criteria for determining coal exploration information that is or is not allowed to be held confidential under the Utah program, and the proposed reference to Utah's GRAMA in that certain aspects of GRAMA were previously found to be less effective than the Federal regulations with regard to the restrictions Utah's GRAMA imposes on the availability of coal exploration information; and (4) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, regarding the need to use the prime farmland soil survey standards in USDA Handbook 436, as it existed on October 5, 1982, and USDA Handbook 18, as it existed on November 16, 1982. OSM notified Utah of these concerns by letter dated December 9, 1993 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;878). By letter dated January 7, 1994, Utah responded to OSM's concerns by submitting revisions to its proposed program amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;881). Utah proposed the following revisions to its existing rules. At Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112, Utah proposed to reference UCA 40&hyph;8&hyph;6(1), which applies to rulemaking authority under the Utah Mined Land Reclamation Act. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, Utah proposed that (1) unless the petitioners and intervenors agree otherwise, the Board shall hold a public hearing within 10 months after receipt of a complete petition to designate lands unsuitable for mining; (2) if all petitioners and intervenors agree that a public hearing is not needed, the hearing need not be held; and (3) all hearings held under Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441 will be held in the locality of the area covered by the petition. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, Utah proposed to require that the Division will not make coal information available for public inspection if the person submitting it requests in writing, at the time of submission, that it not be disclosed and the information is confidential under the standards of the Federal Act (SMCRA). At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, Utah proposed to require that USDA Soils Handbooks 436 and 18 are incorporated by reference as they respectively existed on October 5, 1982, and November 16, 1982. OSM announced receipt of the revised amendment in the January 24, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 3530, administrative record No. UT&hyph;887) and in the same document, reopened and extended the public comment period. The comment period closed February 8, 1994. III. Director's Findings As discussed below, the Director, in accordance with SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, finds, with an additional requirement, that the proposed program amendment as submitted by Utah on August 2, 1993, and as revised on January 7, 1994, is no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations. 1. Nonsubstantive Revisions to Utah's Rules Utah proposed revisions to the following previously-approved rules that are nonsubstantive in nature and consist of minor editorial and punctuation changes (corresponding Federal regulations are listed in parentheses):
