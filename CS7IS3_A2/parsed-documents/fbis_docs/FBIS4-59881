'Arafat said he is committed to the Declaration of Principles [DOP] signed with Israel and opposes violence and terrorism. The PLO chairman admitted that he had called on Muslims to launch a jihad for the liberation of Jerusalem but noted that he had been referring to a peaceful struggle. 'Arafat alleged that his remarks had been misconstrued. Our correspondent Yo'av Tocker reports on the meeting between 'Arafat and Peres in Oslo: [Begin recording] [Tocker] In this video footage we can see the exposed tip of the nervous, political-psychological iceberg that was evident here over the past few hours. Mr. Peres arrives at a ceremony held by the Carter Foundation for Human Rights. He approaches the audience and pointedly avoids Yasir 'Arafat, on his right, who, with a knowing smile, is about to take his seat. Several moments earlier, following Peres' demand, and in the wake of U.S. mediation efforts, 'Arafat explained that his call for a jihad was really a call for peace. ['Arafat, in English] I will continue my jihad to achieve peace. We can say it in an Islamic, religious way. I will continue my jihad to do my work very well. I will continue my jihad until I will be able to.... [pauses] Christians and Muslims to pray together; and Jews to pray together in Jerusalem. This is a Terra Santa for Jews, for Christians, for Muslims. [Tocker] 'Arafat's clarifications, issued with a great deal of embarrassment, were prompted by Peres' ultimatum that 'Arafat must publicly state his commitment to the peace process, which the PLO chairman indeed did, thus apparently satisfying the foreign minister. Nevertheless, when I asked him on behalf of Israel Television what he meant by jihad, 'Arafat refused to clarify his remarks directly to the Israeli people. [Peres] This is the minimum I expected him to say. [Tocker] What do you mean by the minimum? [Peres] In other words, this is what was necessary. The situation was not a simple one, but had he not issued this statement I would not have come. [Tocker] What do you intend to discuss in your meeting with 'Arafat later this evening? Will you demand that he express even more detailed reservations? [Peres] He has already expressed whatever reservations were necessary. He made a mistake and subsequently tried to rectify it. However, I hope that all of us, and especially 'Arafat, will honor the DOP. [Tocker] Beyond what you describe as the minimum, do you accept this interpretation of jihad as semantics, a religious term bereft of any political or military significance? [Peres] I am not a philologist. I insisted on three other things: his total commitment to the DOP, the total negation of terrorism and violence, and that future developments must be achieved entirely through negotiations. [Tocker] I noticed that you refrained from talking to 'Arafat or shaking his hand during the ceremony, even after his public clarification. [Peres] That was not especially called for.
