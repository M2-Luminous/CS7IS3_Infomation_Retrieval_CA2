According to him, controlling the deficit is an essential factor for boosting and consolidating the new economic cycle, which "has undoubtedly now begun." The minister issued two messages during an important lecture on "economic policy and the new situation" delivered at the 21st Century Club yesterday evening. In the first place, the government's priority and pressing task is to contain public expenditure and deregulate the telecommunications sector, "which is taking shape as the driving force of the next cycle of growth." Second, Pedro Solbes stated that the government's economic policy will be based on encouraging investment and exports. The minister was emphatic in asserting that the mistake will not be made of artificially stimulating consumption by lowering taxes, as the People's Party demands, or increasing wages, as the United Left and the trade unions demand. The minister emphasized that there is no longer any doubt that economic recovery has begun. "It now seems generally accepted by the experts that there are clear and sufficient signs to say that we have begun the change of economic cycle." The economy performed favorably in the fourth quarter of the year, breaking the downward trend. The rate of industrial output is beginning to show positive figures. Car sales are beginning to recover, and the number of new enterprises is growing. To ensure that this trend can be consolidated over the next few months, the government deems it essential to reduce the public deficit and improve enterprises' competitiveness. According to him, the forecast state deficit for this year exceeds 3 trillion pesetas, which represents just over 5 percent of GDP. Hence the public deficit does not yet exceed the interest which the state is paying on the public debt in circulation, which this year will stand at 4.5 trillion pesetas. Solbes was emphatic in asserting that it is essential to stop at this point. "The danger of a self-sustaining deficit process could come about very quickly unless we act extremely firmly. If we do not do so, traumatic solutions would be required, as has happened in other countries." In order to achieve this, there is a need for "an agreement among everybody in order to limit our demands on the state. Together with this, it is clearly necessary to wage a more effective struggle against every kind of fraud -- not just tax fraud -- and improve administration." Pedro Solbes reflected on the nature of the public deficit, pointing out that "it undoubtedly occurs because the state is spending more than it raises, but the state spends on those policies which the public demand of it -- whether it be on health, education, unemployment, or roads -- and raises what the country's wealth permits and what people are socially prepared to tolerate as a tax burden. The state's expenditure on its own functioning as an administration barely exceeds 3.5 percent of total expenditure." The minister pointed out that the state will owe 60 percent of GDP at the end of the year -- that is, over 36 trillion pesetas. This debt attracts interest which now represents 16 percent of total expenditure. Hence it has become the item on which we spend most after paying pensions. He stated that "the public deficit occurs because the public demand more of the state than they themselves are prepared to contribute. Hence a supportive austerity effort is necessary for the next three years." According to him, the economic recovery will not be enough to rebalance public accounts. The second element of the new economic policy -- "those who continue to demand a change in economic policy are unable to recognize that this change has already occurred" -- is improving enterprises' competitiveness. In his opinion, the devaluation of the peseta and the reform of the labor market were two key elements for achieving this, "but we must continue to work in two other directions -- continuing with the structural reforms and promoting stable and lasting restraint in earned and unearned incomes." With respect to the deregulation of the telecommunications sector, he stated that over the next few months the necessary decisions must be taken in order to prevent Spain's being left out of that process which is now mobilizing very considerable resources in the United States and Europe. "An early decision on this matter will have very positive effects on investment and employment, and will make it possible to reduce inflation."
