The embargo introduced by the United Nations Security Council. [sentence as received] In the opinion of the committee members, such unilateral measures may hamper successful implementation of the Russian-U.S.-European policy on Bosnia. The committee calls against the delivery of any arms to the conflicting sides and believes that suspension and further lift of sanctions against Yugoslavia as a result of Serb implementation of the peace plan would help the achievement of lasting peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The committee stands for comprehensive development and consolidation of the Russian-U.S. relations proceeding from the fact that Russia and the United States carry special responsibility for peace and stability in international relations and could act as guarantors in settlement of the Bosnian conflict. The soonest termination of combat operations in long-suffering Bosnia and Herzegovina corresponds to the interests of the international community, thinks the committee. Arms deliveries to the conflict zone will entail the deepening and expansion of the conflict. The committee is ready for consultations and coordinated actions with the U.S. Senate in solution of the Bosnian problem, says the statement.
