Box 206, Bruceton Mills, West Virginia 26525, has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.380(d)(3) and (4) (escapeways; bituminous and lignite mines) to its Mine No. 1 (I.D. No. 46&hyph;01822) located in Preston County, West Virginia. The petitioner proposes to leave the affected area undisturbed, stating that the area has been used for ten years without a problem and that compliance with the standard would result in a diminution of safety. Petitioner asserts that the miners are guaranteed no less than the same measure of protection as would be provided by the mandatory standard. 3. Peabody Coal Company [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;03&hyph;C] Peabody Coal Company, 1951 Barrett Court, P.O. Box 1990, Henderson, Kentucky 42420&hyph;1990, has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(4) (weekly examination) to its Camp No. 1 Mine (I.D. No. 15&hyph;02709) located in Union County, Kentucky. Due to hazardous roof conditions, certain areas of the mine cannot be traveled safely.

[Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;05&hyph;C) Trent Coal, Inc., 600 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219, has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.380(f) (escapeways; bituminous and lignite mines) to its Rice No. 2 Mine (I.D. No. 36&hyph;03636) located in Cambria County, Pennsylvania. Due to the size of the electric golf carts used in the primary escapeway and the relative size of fire suppression systems, these golf carts would not be able to operate satisfactorily with such a system. The petitioner proposes to construct the golf carts of fire-resistant material, protect the battery/motor circuit by a fuse, perform all battery charging on the surface, and provide all golf carts with a multipurpose dry chemical fire extinguisher. Petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 6. Eldorado Chemical Co.
