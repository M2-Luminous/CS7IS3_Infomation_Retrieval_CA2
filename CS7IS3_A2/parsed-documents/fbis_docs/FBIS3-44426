The deficit in 1993 grew by 12 percent to U.S.$14.4 billion, the officials said. They estimated that Taiwan exports to Japan this year will grow 2 percent to U.S.$9.1 billion, but that imports from Japan will increase 7 percent to U.S.$25 billion. The officials said export growth generating from the improved Japanese economy will be buffered by the depreciating value of the yen. Last year's economic slowdown in Japan and high demand in Taiwan, in part due to the ongoing six-year national development plan, were reasons behind the snowballing trade deficit, the officials said. Electronic and electric products accounted for 45 percent of imports from Japan, chemical products 10 percent, steel products 8 percent, and auto parts 7 percent. Agricultural products still made up the lion's share of Taiwan exports to Japan, but newly-emerged industrial products, including chemicals, computers, machinery, and steel, have replaced traditional industrial exports to Japan.
