The province has since 1978 spent some five billion yuan (about 574.7 million U.S. dollars) constructing ports, according to Chen Xueqin, director of the provincial office of the customs department. There were 196 land, sea and air ports in Guangdong Province by the end of 1993, mostly in the special economic zones, coastal open cities and other economically developed areas. The ports handled 83.6 million incoming and outgoing passengers and 111.5 million tons of import and export goods in 1993, 21.3 times and 9.3 times more than in 1978. The province has simplified customs procedures and cut unnecessary inspections and checks to make entry and exit easier. The land port in Shenzhen introduced the practice of concentrated check of freight vehicles, unified collection of fees and unified customs declaration in order to reduce the number of stops for inspection. The practice has been introduced to all ports in the province starting from March 1. In handling passengers, the border checking posts introduced computer visa checks and random checks. Harbor supervision departments have also changed the method of issuing certificates to incoming and outgoing ships and prolonged the validity period of visas. Transit passengers at the Shenzhen airport are free from going through customs and border check procedures. The province has also removed the way checking station at Dachan Island for small ships of less than 500 tons shuttling in the area of Hong Kong and Macao and they are required to go through outgoing procedures at the starting ports.
