Available information indicates that Lebanese, Palestinians, and four other people in one of the largest southern cities in Lebanon, who graduated from Russian universities, have managed to transport the red mercury substance and sell it in Lebanon. This substance is one of the most dangerous kinds used in the production of nuclear bombs. Western scientists say only Russia has this substance and knows how to manufacture it in various sizes. Its size could equal that of a hand grenade or a little smaller. U.S. security men, internationally specialized in tracking down this substance, have arrived in Lebanon to keep under close surveillance several members of the group that smuggled the substance. A quantity of three kg of red mercury has been seized. As a result of expanding trade, a senior Russian Army officer has offered to market three kg of red mercury for $30,000. Thus, this substance was exported to one of the ports of the large southern Lebanese cities as part of trade commodities in a truck. Information indicates there have been many attempts to market and sell this substance on the Lebanese market, and even in the Middle East. However, the dearth of information about this substance and the lack of ideas about its importance and how to use it prevented its marketing and trading. Search is now under way in more than one Arab and foreign capital, as reported by Russian security agencies, especially a high-level official who arrived in the Middle East and revealed the smuggling of the red mercury from Russia to Lebanon. The search is aimed at finding out whether this quantity is the only amount that leaked from Russia through this officer to Lebanese and Palestinian people and whether there are other people in other countries who have acquired this substance and what happened to the substance. The nature and shape of the substance do not particularly attract the attention of scientists and laboratory owners, since it is a white substance that looks like fine sugar and its importance and effectiveness have so far not been publicized.
