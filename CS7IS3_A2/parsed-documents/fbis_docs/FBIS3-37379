He also held foreign postings as director of the Moscow Narodny Bank's branches in London, Lebanon, West Germany and Singapore. The CBR has come under increased attacks for its inflationary policies by the finance ministry, leading economists and newspapers alike. In an interview with Interfax, Gerashenko was trying to rebuff those accusations. IF [Interfax]: What sort of a relationship will there be between the Central Bank and the finance ministry following Boris Fedorov's resignation? GERASHENKO: To begin with, relations between the State Bank, the Central Bank and Finance Ministry have always been business-like at all levels. I do not think there was anything unusual in my relations with the former finance minister as far as cooperation between the two departments is concerned. The Bank of Russia has never tried to put a spoke in anyone's wheel. On the contrary, we met with senior Finance Ministry officials at the end of last year to stabilize money supply. As for the differences we had, this must be seen as a normal thing in any country with a compounded economic, social and political situation. The fact that this should have been leaked to the press or become the subject of formal and informal conversations is not our own fault. As for Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin, he is a newcomer in the ministry but I have known him as deputy chairman of the state committee for CIS economic cooperation. I know him as pragmatist who has always looked for optimal solutions to any deadlock relating to the country's economic situation and the need to use austerity measures in budgetary or crediting policies. We have never had any major differences. I met Dubinin more often than the minister himself, so I can see no problems ahead. IF: What are the main parameters of the budget for the first quarter of this year? GERASHENKO: There are none so far. The finance ministry has been working hard in the past three weeks to try to cut spending and find new sources of revenues. Its task is to try to bring in whatever resources there are in the country but economic methods must be used to do so. The ministry also faces the task of resorting as less as possible to the CBR's emissions mechanism which may cover any outstanding expenditure but step up inflationary processes. IF: During a recent visit to Orel (Central Russia) together with the Prime Minister, you mentioned about Rbl 4 Tn worth of "free money" accumulated by the commercial banks. Will the government try to bring it into play, do you think? GERASHENKO: This can be done only on a voluntary basis. In fact, commercial banks are in need of incentives to invest into the vital sectors if the economy is to survive as a whole. These include tax benefits or interest rate subsidies. With the interest rate such as it is now, there can be no question of investments. What is needed is full confidence that the government economic policy approved by parliament will ensure support to key sectors such as energy, transport and housing construction. That is, investments by the commercial banks must to an extent be guaranteed by the country's economic policy itself. A clear signal must be sent to the private sector that the government has serious plans of developing a securities market, especially government bonds. Similar bonds can be issued by first rate companies involved in key sectors designed to ensure the country's survival. A commercial bank must be assured that government or company securities can help it survive in the event of liquidity with the help from the Central Bank. The CBR must, as it were, promise to play the role of a secondary market. But this is something unknown in this country, so the details will have to be worked out together with IMF experts. IF: What do make of media allegations saying the key reformists were dropped out of the cabinet following last month's government reshuffle? GERASHENKO: I do not hold with such assertions at all because the need for government reforms arose back in the mid- 1970s when most of its members must have been post graduates. Unfortunately, the then government was not ready for such reforms which were delayed for 12 years at least. In fact, the policy of reforms started in 1987 and the main dispute is about methods and timing rather than strategic goals. I cannot say the government has been reformed. The cabinet was trimmed down, especially in the number of Vice-Premiers, on a proposal from Boris Fedorov himself. Generally speaking, I think Gaydar and Fedorov resigned for entirely different reasons though using a similar smokescreen. IF: In his speech at Orel, Chernomyrdin made it clear the Rbl 4 Tn debt to the defence and farming sectors would have to be repaid. In what way is this likely to affect the budget? GERASHENKO: This is something that Russia's freedom loving press is reluctant to write about. The huge debt owed to the defence and farming sectors is left over by the finance ministry last year. This also includes salaries to the non-industrial sector comprising teachers, physicians, the army, the police and so on. Such things must be taken very seriously. I think that as a good professional, Boris Fyodorov is well aware of the difficulties facing the country in the first quarter of this year and throughout 1994 as a whole. I think Fedorov is partly trying to pull off a face-saving exercise. IF: But the Rbl 4 Tn debt will have to be repaid after all. GERASHENKO: The question is how to extend the schedule of repayment. Some of the debt will have to be repaid now to help to break the chain of mass defaults and raise some revenues. But the rest of it will have to be suspended to avert excessive money supply in the first quarter of the year. This is a formidable task. The CBR is in search of new ways to break the deadlock including the issue of securities or orientating the resources of all sorts of funds. Regrettably, the existing legislation does not provide for such eventualities apart from distributing credits among commercial structures. In the meantime, their resources are at risk because of a certain threat of bankruptcy.
