FBIS4-56238 "drlat084_j_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-084 Daily Report 30 Apr 1994 Panama Civilist Group Endorses Candidate Carles Civilist Group Endorses Candidate Carles PA0105015294 Panama City EL SIGLO in Spanish 30 Apr 94 p 2 PA0105015294 Panama City EL SIGLO Spanish BFN [From the "Forum" column] [Text] Following a careful and thorough analysis of government plans, the resources and the methodology to carry them out, each of the presidential candidates, and the parties that have nominated them, the Pro-Fatherland Civilist Network [Red Civilista Pro Patria] decided, on Thursday, 28 April, to support the candidacies of and to recommend that all Civilists vote for Professor Ruben Dario Carles as president, Guillermo Quijano as first vice president, and Tomas Herrera as second vice president. Without any alliance commitments to the dictatorial regime and full of patriotic desire to reconstruct our country following the economic, social, institutional, and ethical traumas it has endured, the members of the Pro-Fatherland Civilist Network emerge in the current political picture as a new, young, encouraging force worthy of credit after traveling a long road among negative factors that are so contagious. The members of the group have not demonstrated any tendency to fall into the traps set by corruption to catch those who do not have sufficient moral values to avoid any threat of contamination due to vocation, fear, or bribery. The recognition that the Pro-Fatherland Civilist Network gives Professor Carles and his running mates is a valuable decoration, like those given by the people to those who deserve it. It is not the result of an intense propaganda campaign, but a logical result of an entire productive and honest life. It is not a matter of political alliances, it is a vibrant invitation for Panamanian people to listen before making the correct decision at a time when so many people have their doubts. They will now be able to clearly see the road leading to a better Panama, alongside the Change '94 candidates, headed by Prof. Ruben Dario Carles.
