The proposed measures are to safeguard Germany as a business location and increase its attractiveness. Essential parts have already been approved by the Bonn government coalition and have been presented to parliament. Central points of the principles are: the promotion of investments; the privatization of tasks that have so far been carried out by the sate; the reduction of wages in job-creation measures to 80 percent of collectively agreed wages; and the restructuring of social benefits wanted by the CDU. In the paper, drawn up under the leadership of Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer and Christa Thoben, North Rhine-Westphalian economic politician, employers and employees are encouraged to show their own initiative and independence. Toepfer spoke of a cohesive concept that is to abolish "barriers to independence."
