A Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement that DPRK had honestly fulfilled its obligations by receiving the inspection group of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and providing all conditions for their inspections. The DPRK has also held several rounds of working contacts with South Korea on an early exchange of envoys. However, the statement said, the United State has fulfilled none of its obligations specified in the New York agreement reached on February 25. The United States has threatened to resume the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises with South Korea in 1994 if the DPRK refuses more nuclear inspections and envoy exchange. In addition, the U.S. will not attend the Geneva talks and will present the nuclear issue to the United Nations Security Council. The statement accused the United States of trying to isolate and stifle the DPRK through the Geneva talks. The statement added that under such circumstances, the DPRK will neither regard it as its obligation to ensure the continuity of nuclear safety nor send a delegation to the Geneva talks. The statement said if the United States continues to exercise power politics and exert pressure on DPRK, DPRK will have no alternative but finally withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).
