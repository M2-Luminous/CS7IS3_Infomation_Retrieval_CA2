At a news conference on Friday, PAC Regional Executive Committee members said the movement's lawyers would also assist relatives of Siphiwo Sam to lay a murder charge against police following an autopsy on the dead boy. The organisation on Friday sought a meeting with Deputy Regional Police Commissioner Maj-Gen Nick Snyman to discuss the police raid. Although it has not lodged a complaint with the Transitional Executive Council, the PAC called on the Independent Electoral Commission and other transitional structures to "prove that they have teeth" and act firmly against the security forces. Siphiwo, a standard six pupil at Langa comprehensive school, was killed when violence erupted outside the Luyolo community centre in Gugulethu after police raided a PAC meeting to arrest suspects allegedly linked to last week's Heidelberg Tavern attack. Police claim they fired rubber bullets and bird shot after a crowd stoned them and tried to free nine young men from a police vehicle. However, PAC officials described the police version as "a brutal lie" and said police had set dogs on PAC members and opened fire without warning when angry supporters protested against the arrests. The police action was strongly condemned on Friday by Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who said police appeared to have exceeded the bounds of a normal criminal investigation in order to harass the PAC. PAC National Executive Committee member Patricia de Lille told journalists on Friday PAC leaders had appealed to police to postpone the arrests "until things calmed down". However, a police team led by violent crime unit head Col Leonard Knipe had insisted on identifying the alleged suspects and removing them for questioning. "The meeting agreed that they could look around. We allowed them to carry out their duty, but we did not give them permission to remove anyone." Mrs de Lille and other regional officials later accompanied the police to Bellville, where murder and robbery squad detectives released the men after questioning, fingerprinting and photographing them. She said the fact that all nine were subsequently released indicated that police had acted on false information supplied by informers. "The PAC has always said the police are racist and brutal when dealing with black people. We wish they could show more efficiency to find the killers of more than 10,000 (black) african people who have died in South Africa in the past three years." PAC Regional Secretary Bathembu Lugulwana said three men and a woman were still being treated for gunshot wounds in local hospitals. He confirmed that a third member of the PAC in the western Cape, Richard Dala, was detained by police on Thursday. Two other regional officials, Theo Mabusela and Michael Siyolo, are being held under Section 29 of the Internal Security Act. Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel also announced on Thursday that two "confirmed" members of the PAC's armed wing, the Azanian Peoples Liberation Army [APLA], had been arrested near Elliot in the north-eastern Cape. Mr Lugulwana said police had refused to supply the names of the two men detained in Elliot to the PAC. "They could have picked up anyone and now they claim they are APLA," he said.
