Foodstuffs, industrial goods, and essential raw materials, the document stresses, are being taken out of the country in various ways. The existing transparent borders, the lack of respect for laws, and the desire of some enterprises, commercial organizations, and individual citizens to get rich in this way are to a certain extent helping to make the situation significantly more acute. A criminal group that was trying to take 30 metric tons of nickel into Poland worth a total of $113,000 dollars was recently discovered by employees of interior affairs bodies. Over the last two years, more than 40,000 attempts to smuggle out of Ukraine goods worth 1 trillion karbovantsi have been foiled by the military. More than 5,000 metric tons of grain, almost 12,000 metric tons of sugar, more than 1,000 metric tons of vegetable oil, and 3,000 metric tons of non-ferrous and rare earth metals have been returned to the state. In connection with this, the Supreme Council and government have recently adopted several legislative acts for stabilizing the economic situation in the republic and defending its consumer market. The interior affairs bodies are relying on the understanding and support of the population for implementing these measures. Ukraine's Interior Ministry, the appeal stresses, along with the security bodies, border guards, and customs officials will do all they can in the future to make sure the border is firmly closed and to protect the consumer market in a reliable fashion.
