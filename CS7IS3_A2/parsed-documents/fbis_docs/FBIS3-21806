This exchange is allegedly being negotiated by Rio de Janeiro drug traffickers and African guerrilla elements who, since the 1970's, have received weapons manufactured in the former USSR. This week the Rio de Janeiro PF (Federal Police) started to investigate the relationship between Brazilian drug traffickers and African guerrilla elements. Rio de Janeiro PF Superintendent Edson Antonio de Oliveira, 42, said the suspicion regarding the exchange of drugs for weapons surfaced with the confiscation in Rio de Janeiro shantytowns of ammunition made in the former USSR member countries. The occupation of the Mangueira shantytown (in northern Rio de Janeiro) by agents of the Civil and Military Police early this week interrupted the "war" between drug rings that has already resulted in 14 deaths, and the seizing of Russian-made AK-47 Kalashnikov rifle shells. This rifle can fire up to 800 shots per minute. Oliveira said that foreign weapons acquired by the Rio de Janeiro drug traffickers usually come via Miami (United States) and Paraguay. The superintendent asserted: "Russian weapons do not come through these two routes because this type of weapon or ammunition do not exist in Miami or Paraguay." The PF investigations have shown that the Russian weapons may be coming from Africa through the Middle East and Asian countries such as Afghanistan, that have overcome difficult phases of regional wars and battles. Oliveira commented: "Russian weapons are cheaper because there are great quantities of them in African countries in conflict and in Lebanon. We are greatly concerned. As soon as these conflicts are over, the excess weapons are put up for sale." The contacts between Rio de Janeiro underground organizations and terrorists of countries such as Angola, Namibia, and Zaire may be being made by Africans who enter Brazil as tourists. A new route for the international trafficking of weapons may be being established the same way as Africans acted as middlemen for the shipment of cocaine from Brazil to Europe -- the Nigerian connection. Since the 1980's Rio de Janeiro represents a sort of supermarket for the population of poor African countries. Thousands of Angolans, Nigerians, Zairians, and Ghanaians come to Rio de Janeiro every year as tourists and return loaded with all sorts of merchandise (from sandals to electrical appliances). The PF is investigating whether these tourists are not representatives of guerrilla organizations, in charge of maintaining contact with Rio de Janeiro criminal organizations such as the CV (Red Command) and the TC (Third Command). Groups of policemen specialize in supplying drugs and foreign weapons to drug traffickers linked to the CV and TC. Parallel investigations carried out by the Civil and Federal Police came to the same conclusion. The DRE (Drug Control Precinct) of the Civil Police has identified groups of suppliers made up of civil, military, and federal agents. These groups sell sophisticated weapons that usually arrive in Rio de Janeiro through the International airport (northern zone), on their way to the drug traffickers. One of the groups of suppliers is allegedly headed by Civil Police Detective Cesar Pereira da Silva. DRE Director Walter Alves de Oliveira, 54, said the group sold weapons and drugs to Orlando da Conceicao, or Orlando Jogador, who is regarded by the police as one of the biggest drug traffickers in Rio de Janeiro. Jogador has cocaine and marijuana "sale spots" in the Bonsucesso, Penha, and Ramos shantytowns in northern Rio de Janeiro. Pereira da Silva was arrested last December.
