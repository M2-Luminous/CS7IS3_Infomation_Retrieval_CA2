The IFP president was commenting on amendments to Section 126 of the interim constitution adopted by the Multiparty Negotiation Council on Monday which were described by the African National Congress [ANC] as a major concession to the federalistic demands of the FA. "Once again the press has failed to exercise its duty of critique, analysis and investigation and has reported the propagandistic untruth of the ANC/SA Communist Party alliance and the National Party/South African Government at face value," Mr Buthelezi said. "Upon analysis it appears clear and incontrovertible that describing the amendments to Section 126 as a concession to the Freedom Alliance and the IFP is an insult to my intelligence, is an insult to the intelligence of my party and is an insult to the intelligence to all South Africans. "All they did was to delete the word 'concurrent' and add language which unequivocally ensures that powers of the provinces can only be concurrent rather than exclusive. The normative value of Section 126 before the amendment is exactly the same as after the amendment." Mr Buthelezi said it was stated in the amendment that provincial legislatures would have competence to make laws as in the limited list of powers set out in Schedule 6, and that parliament would be competent to make the same laws with regard to the same matters on which provinces had jurisdiction. Parliament therefore had concurrent legislative powers over the same matters. In case the two legislative powers cannot co-exist without creating a conflict with one another, the act of Parliament would prevail over the provincial legislation "in substantially the same cases and situations". "In fact the national government is entitled to prevail with its legislation over provincial legislation on the basis of about 15 broadly worded over-rides," Mr Buthelezi said. "This means that in a province there will be national schools, hospital and housing programmes co-existing with provincial schools, hospitals and housing programmes." He said the national government would have the power to extend the rules set out for national schools, hospitals and housing programmes and every time it could argue that it did so on the basis of one of the broadly worded 15 over-rides. "Needless to say, the national schools, hospital and housing programmes will be backed by respective national health, educational and housing policies, which will make any effort in such fields by the provinces politically and socially irrelevant. "I am saying this because unless our press accepts the duty of going into this type of detail, there will not be correct information on the truth of the constitutional negotiations which took place in this country," Mr Buthelezi said.
