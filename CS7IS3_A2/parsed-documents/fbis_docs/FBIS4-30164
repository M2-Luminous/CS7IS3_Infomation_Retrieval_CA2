This attracts people's attention. Taking advantage of the inaugural ceremony of the Second National Federation of General Student Councils [Hanchongnyon], the South Korean fascist elements babbled [ununhamyo] this organization is beneficial to the enemy and frantically tried to arrest leading members of this organization by wielding the notorious National Security Law. On 18 June they dispatched the puppet police to five universities, including Hongik University of Seoul, and kicked up commotions for searches and arrests. Also, on 20 June, they committed fascist violence by arresting approximately 270 university students and peasants who attended meetings and staged demonstrations at Yoido Plaza and near the Yongdungpo Station to oppose the National Assembly's ratification of the Uruguay Round agreement. In reporting on this, even South Korean broadcasting stations pointed out that this was the first time since the civilian regime was inaugurated that many people were detained en masses in a single day. The South Korean fascist elements responded to the South Korean workers' struggle for the right to existence with a wholesale suppression. As reported, when the South Korean railroad workers demanded the basic right of existence, which includes wage hikes and the improvement of their working conditions, the South Korean fascist elements ran amok while convening a meeting of ministers in charge of public order and labor or releasing statements. They threatened to detain all workers if they go on strike. People cannot but be appalled by such a bestial fascist suppression offensive never before seen, not even during the military dictatorships of the Fifth and Sixth Republics. We cannot but say this is a grave development of the situation. An insidious political goal is no doubt hidden behind this reckless suppression offensive by the South Korean fascist elements. As everyone knows, Hanchongnyon, with which the South Korean rulers take issue, is the successor of the National Council of University Student Representatives and an independent and patriotic student organization that carries out only righteous activities for independence, democracy, and reunification and that enjoys enormous prestige among the South Korean people. An attempt to consider this progressive student organization to be hostile and suppress and obliterate it is an unjustifiable antidemocratic and antinational crime. Also, the struggle by the South Korean peasants and youth and students to prevent the National Assembly from ratifying the Uruguay Round agreement is a very just patriotic struggle that determines if they can protect the rice market, to which the destiny of the 6 million peasants is linked. Needless to say, the workers' struggle for the right of existence should not be suppressed. Nevertheless, the present South Korean rulers who call themselves civilian suppressed the struggle by the youth and students, workers, and peasants on a large scale. Why did they do so? This was because the South Korean rulers have a very insidious political ambition and vicious endeavor. In short, their suppression offensive is none other than a reactionary offensive only seen on the eve of a war. As everybody knows, the South Korean rulers are recently running amok while talking about an international cooperation system or sanctions under the pretext of the suspicion of our nonexistent nuclear development. They are also frantically kicking up confrontation and war maneuvers to crush their fellow countrymen with outside force. They are almost daily and frantically conducting the Rimpac exercise, an air, land, and sea joint military exercise, a civil defense exercise, and many other war exercises against us. They are also recklessly making bellicose remarks as military countermeasures and surprise strikes. A man called executive chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party, while prowling about [ssadanimyo] frontline areas, made the very inciting remarks that he would fight on battlefields even as a private second class if a war breaks out. The South Korean fascist elements are so bestially suppressing the righteous popular struggle by the youth and students, workers, and people. This is no doubt an all-out reactionary offensive to achieve internal stability in preparations against war. However, any suppressive offensive by the South Korean rulers will not be able to stifle the South Korean people's struggle spirits. Rather, the further they will strengthen their suppression, the more vigorously the workers, peasants, and youth and students will wage their righteous struggle. The South Korean rulers must clearly know that their fascist suppressive offensive will only hasten their destruction and act with discretion.
