[Tapia] It is no secret that the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] has been defeated and those who are left of its militants are engaged in abduction and looting. The truth is that they were defeated late in 1991, when columns headed by Serpa Cartolini and Sistero Garcia clashed in San Martin. This confrontation reflected the rapid decay of this subversive movement. [Ponce] Are there no more MRTA columns or grassroots groups in the interior? [Tapia] The MRTA has been completely annihilated. Most of the recently repented terrorists belong to this group. [Ponce] What about the Shining Path [SL]? [Tapia] The SL has an active column in Huancabamba which is linked to the Jaen Province in Cajamarca; the column in Mariscal Luzuriaga Province, Ancash, operates in Huanuco; and there is another active column in Chalhuanca, Apurimac. [Ponce] How about Huallaga? [Tapia] In that zone there must be approximately 500 men of what they call their main force and their local force. These individuals are fulling engaged in drug trafficking. The Huallaga SL regional committee broke away from the SL leadership in February 1990, when [Abimael] Guzman was still free. Imagine now that their leader is behind bars. It is more than likely that the remaining SL members throughout the country receive no economic aid from this zone. [Ponce] How about Lima? [Tapia] The SL has four very important armed detachments deployed in various parts of the city. One of them recently held up a bank branch in El Agustino. [Ponce] Now that Guzman is in prison and they do not have the economic support from the Alto Huallaga drug trafficking, has the SL managed to organize another political-military unit? [Tapia] The most difficult time for the SL seems to have been between September and December 1992, after Guzman was arrested. The SL Central Committee held its first meeting in February 1993 and managed to get reorganized in May. [Ponce] Was this under the leadership of Oscar Ramirez Durand (Feliciano)? [Tapia] Yes, it is unlikely that their hierarchy has varied, more so because Feliciano has been the third or fourth most important member since 1980. Oscar Ramirez Durand participated in the Chuschi School, in the 1988 Congress, and was elected to the Central Committee. [Ponce] Are there any signs of a reaction by the SL to Guzman's request for a peace agreement? [Tapia] Fujimori read the letter before the United Nations on 1 October, an important day for the SL because it is the anniversary of the Chinese revolution. On 7 October, the SL Central Committee issued a communique reporting a government trick. Following these developments important changes took place at the SL grassroots level, although they were not consistent -- one must bear in mind the hold up in El Agustino. The best evidence of these changes is the pronouncement of the Canto Grande inmates in favor of the agreement. These sectors accept a single leader and talk about a change of times for the SL. The SL representatives abroad also reveal a change of stance... [Ponce] But Arce Borja and Olaechea have emphatically reported this trick... [Tapia] Their pronouncement is unimportant. It should be recalled that neither of them belonged to the SL Central Committee. The most authorized voices abroad are the relatives of Augusta La Torre, Guzman's late wife. These relatives, who are in Stockholm or Switzerland, have stated that one SL period has ended and a new period has started. But it should be noted that there is a sector that has still not clearly stated its position. [Ponce] Why do you maintain that negotiations between the government and Guzman continue? [Tapia] The negotiations started last February and are about to end. What other explanation is there for transferring Martha Huatay from Yanamayo or for summoning Osman Morote. Negotiations cannot be based on Guzman's imprisonment terms because this is handled by the International Red Cross... [Ponce] What other things do you think are being negotiated. What is Guzman's plan? [Tapia] What do they mean when they say that a new phase is beginning in the party? I always remember him saying: "We were never defeated by the police, why should we be defeated in war." And, precisely, before starting its war, the SL was a political organization that controlled all sorts of social sectors in Ayacucho, including universities, neighborhood associations, peasants federations, and the Chamber of Commerce. An alternative with this background, that engaged in war, may emerge to... [Ponce] To become an electoral alternative? [Tapia] I do not think that is feasible because the SL continues to be a totalitarian alternative. If SL militants give up war, they will not do so out of political conviction, but rather because of their submission to the leadership of "their president." If they were to decide to become an electoral alternative, that would mean Guzman would cease to be their leader. Yet it is quite likely he will continue to lead his party from prison. Nobody can imagine Abimael speaking over television and trying to convince electors. He has always done politics as he is doing now in his cell: Imprisoned, watching television, with a communication channel carrying his message to the militants. [Ponce] Are you telling me the SL will become a striking force [fuerza de choque] within labor unions and social groups... [Tapia] That is so. [Ponce] But what evidence is there that the SL's new phase is heading in that direction? [Tapia] The SL's new language in the neighborhoods is against actions to obtain electoral gains, against traditional political parties, in favor of the peoples' claims, and is antirevisionist (against the legal leftist sector in the neighborhoods)... [Ponce] Does this new language follows Guzman's orders from prison? [Tapia] Obviously. We will, therefore, face a striking force within the peoples' movements. Another thing to remember is that a force of this kind may establish alliances with the most obscure sectors of the country.
