But the study by the al-Shariqah chamber of commerce and industry in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said the Arab League's 22 members must first integrate their economies before joining Israel and other countries in a single market. Although Israel has built a relatively large export-oriented industrial base, its exports are equivalent to less than 10 percent of total Arab imports, said the study, published in the UAE daily Al-Khalij. Israel's exports of consumer goods stood at between 11 and 12 billion dollars in 1992 while Arab imports of such products exceeded 40 billion dollars and their total imports have remained above 100 billion dollars. Israel's exports of transport equipment stood at 900 million dollars in 1990 and those of electrical appliances at 1.6 billion dollars while Arab imports of such products stood at around 42.6 billion dollars, the study said. "Trade is a key component of Israel's Gross Domestic Product, accounting for nearly 46 percent in 1991," it said. "But the figures on Israeli exports show that they will have little impact on the imports of Arab countries." In Paris, Israel and the PLO signed a landmark economic agreement on Friday, as part of an overall accord to launch Palestinian self- rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. Finance Minister Avraham Shohat, who signed for Israel, urged Arab countries to "remove the walls of economic boycott" and lift the embargo in force since the Jewish state was created in 1948. "None of us can afford economic boycotts," he warned, referring to stiff competition from other regions. The al-Shariqah chamber of commerce study saw benefits for both Arabs and Israel from a common market although the latter would reap more gains given its superior industries. A free trade zone in the region would give Israel access to new markets and enable it to ensure its needs in oil and other raw materials, according to the study. In return, Arab states would find a new market for their oil and gas, but their exports of other goods would not rise greatly as the Israeli market is small. The United States and other countries have proposed a regional common market encompassing Israel, the Arabs, Turkey and Iran, saying this would bring about prosperity and boost confidence in peace. But several Arab officials and businessmen have warned such a project would allow Israel to dominate Arab economies. Gulf Arab states are playing a key role in the multilateral track of the Middle East peace process. Oman hosted talks on water resources last week and Qatar will be the venue for a working session on arms control next week. In an interview with AFP in Oman, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin said a common market would benefit all parties but stressed the project needed long discussion. "We believe that the realistic option for Arab states to brace for the Middle East market is to set up a free trade zone," the UAE study said. "Another point is that Israel has a governmental, institutional, legal and administrative structure that is far superior to that in all Arab countries," it added. "This should prompt our governments to consolidate democracy in their political and economic systems and revise their policies on education, training, planning and exploitation of resources." Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, in an interview published Friday in the Qatari newspaper Al-Sharq, criticized Arab states, saying they were "not up to the European standards of democracy."
