The president made this statement this evening at the presidential palace before his departure for South Africa to attend the inauguration of Nelson Mandela, the first democratically elected president and the first multiracial government of that country. Correspondent Dhimitrios Andreou has the following report. [Begin recording] [Andreou] President Kliridhis described the elections in South Africa and the abolition of racial discrimination as a historic event. We should all, he stressed, honor Nelson Mandela for his struggles. President Kliridhis however, will go to South Africa.... [Kliridhis] I will also go for another reason, because in this country there is a large Cypriot immigrant community and of course a Greek immigrant community. In the last two days I am there, I will be with the immigrants because they have asked for it, they have prepared an agenda.... [Andreou] President Kliridhis was asked about the Cyprus issue, what he expects from the secretary general and his report to the Security Council, the alternative ways that the Security Council should adopt in order to promote a solution of the Cyprus issue. Every time a phase concludes, irrespective of its result, and before the secretary general submits his report to the Security Council, the Americans and British mobilize to alter the contents of this report. What information do you have regarding the current period and how is the government reacting? [Kliridhis] The information we have is that Robert Lamb, the U.S. Government's coordinator on the Cyprus issue, will meet Mr. Ulucevic [Turkish state minister on Cyprus] in Vienna. The third country reportedly involved is not London but Vienna. We have information that Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's representative, will also be there. Supposedly, the reason for their trip, is to convince Mr. Ulucevic to convince [Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf] Denktas to accept the document that has been submitted. The evaluations I hear from various sides are that there are no possibilities for a change in the Turkish position. My estimate is that it is a waste of time, but since Mr. Lamb thinks there are still possibilities, perhaps it would be a mistake for this meeting not to take place. What the Cyprus Government insists on, and which appears to be accepted, is that without any delay, the UN secretary general's report should be submitted right after 15 May, and that this report should call a spade a spade. I believe that there is another aspect which is gaining substantial ground, and this is Europe's understanding that the Turkish side does not have goodwill to promote a solution to the Cyprus issue, either on the substance or the confidence-building measures, and that Denktas' basic aim is to gain time in hopes that he will achieve recognition of the Turkish Cypriot pseudostate. I also want to stress that those who promote the position that the confidence-building measures should be abandoned and that we should return to the substance of the Cyprus issue are helping the Turkish side. The correct position is that there can be progress neither on the substance nor on the confidence-building measures. Progress can only be achieved when the Security Council does what it said in its resolutions, that is, study and suggest alternative ways for implementation of the resolutions. [end recording]
