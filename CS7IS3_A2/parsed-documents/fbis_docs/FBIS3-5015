Honasan said the government does not know the real strength and manpower of the movement. "No matter how the information machinery and the AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] tries to dig on us, they still don't know who we are, how many we are, and where we are." [passage omitted] Honasan said the RAM will surrender its firearms only when the ongoing peace talks end in a "comprehensive political settlement." He said RAM leaders have given the peace talks another year before declaring them a failure.
