"In my view, the Duma deputies have made a reasonable decision by not obliging anyone to cover the legislators' activity in a directive-like tone. That would violate the Law on the Mass Media. The Duma has agreed to adopt the `Ostankino' Russian State Television and Radio Company and the Russia channel's offer to cover the deputies' work within the programs that already exist. Total coverage time will be at least two hours a week. This procedure will stay in place until the federal law `On the Procedure for Covering the Activity of Russian Federation Organs of State Power in State Mass Media' is adopted. Note carefully that in the future the law will deal with the regulation of coverage of all branches of power, including the undeservedly forgotten judiciary. "The Duma will have its own press service and press center and will actively operate the `RTV-Parliament' studio and equipment complex. "As of 28 February, our committee has been scheduled to conduct parliamentary hearings on the extremely topical issue of `The Economic Position of the Mass Media in Russia.' It is hoped that we will jointly be able to find ways to ensure the mass media's survival."
