[Begin recording] [Rutskoy] I want to do this. [Gerasimov] What organizational form could this take? [Rutskoy] It could be a public political movement, not a party; not now, because people have had enough. It could be a public political movement that would express the interests of society, the interests of the state, and the interests of the individual. An organization of this kind can be set up. It can, and it must. This is the first task that has to be dealt with--to set up a civilized opposition, to draw up clear and easily understood programs, and to publicize them. I have no doubts that people will follow this public political movement, which would stand for the national interests of the state and its people. They will follow because I just cannot see who they can follow at present. I cannot. I cannot see it, looking objectively at any party, at any public political movement now in existence. I can give way to anyone as soon as I see that there is a person capable of leading, capable of setting up a civilized opposition, capable of explaining the situation clearly to the people and of telling and showing them how and by what means a way out of this situation can be found. [end recording] [Gerasimov] The former vice-president intends to start forming the opposition movement as soon as the public accord treaty is signed. Rutskoy said: I will see who signs, who volunteers to don a muzzle, and I will try to unite those without a muzzle.
