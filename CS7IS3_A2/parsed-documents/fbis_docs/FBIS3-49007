Among other things, the letter says, quote, we express our sorrow, disillusion, and great concern caused by the fact that, over the short period of time that elapsed since your talks with the representatives of the PD-FSN, a dangerous record was achieved in the violation of the rules any democratic regime ought to follow through the elimination of some of the essential offices in parliament as well as by the intensification of the unspeakable attacks against the opposition, in a new campaign launched by the representatives of the current state power, beginning with the head of the executive and ending with the leaders of the extremist parties belonging to the ruling majority. We are certain that you are well aware of all these facts, but we would still like to remind you of an extremely grave act that totally despises parliamentary norms, namely the way in which the draft bill empowering the government to rule by ordinances was discussed and passed in parliament. That regrettable moment is an embarrassing world premiere in this domain: A normative act was passed while parliament lacked the constitutionally established quorum. Unfortunately, that is not a solitary case, as a large number of representatives of the current state power, both in the government and in parliament, are systematically trying to put the opposition in a situation that is inconceivable in truly law-governed states, obviously intending to make it capitulate unconditionally under the pressure of abuse and discriminating and discretionary acts that also include menaces with penal sanctions, unquote. After emphasizing the need for the accomplishment of a national pact, the letter outlines the key ideas and principles of the pact that the PD-FSN has repeatedly proposed. It then defines the concepts of a national pact, national interest, the structure of the pact, the economic pact, the social pact, and the political pact.
