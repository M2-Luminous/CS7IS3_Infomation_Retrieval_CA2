In a two-and-a-half-hour talk, Joerg Haider swore into the "Third Republic" and "our kind of freedom" over 5,000 party members from all over Austria. Following a short introduction by Klagenfurt's Deputy Mayor Reinhart Gaugg, Haider made the situation clear to the euphoric audience within the first five minutes: "The time of cheerful election campaigns is over, this is a time of historic decisions." Apart from discussing Austria's role in Europe, "the awkward mental position that our country is in has to be stopped." A crossroads has been reached: "Either we develop into a society where everybody has to be a member of either of two parties, where everybody, starting from school headmaster to lipizzaner has to have a party membership card, or we go toward a Third Republic, toward democracy, where the citizens have the say, and not the parties." The Austrian People's Party [OeVP] -- "it is giving up and it even likes it" -- is conceded a key role by Haider, though: "It must have the power to say we are no longer prepared to continue in the present way into a socialist future." He said that he, himself, had a slight attack of political weakness; but with the help of his "faithful family, good friends, and strong assistants" he has again found pleasure in his job: "I will not be forced down by their hatred, I will not keep quiet when confronted with their lies, I will not tolerate the fact that the opinion of the people is increasingly being ignored -- this is my challenge." This challenge also means Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, the head of the Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe]: The coming years will be characterized by a "major confrontation" between Vranitzky and himself, Haider. "The glitter of a yuppy society is not one of our visions," Haider said. Haider also emphasized the "enormous difference" between nationalism and national socialism, and almost warningly he said: "There is absolutely no point in trying to flirt with the brown [Nazi] left-overs." Haider went on: "We have to clean up this country politically." In 1998, at the latest, the "blue [FPOe] flag of freedom will be flying from the red-and-black [SPOe-OeVP] strongholds." He was also quite generous in criticizing the investigations into the letter-bomb attacks: The special unit established by Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak is on a "dead track." Haider accused the government of conducting the investigations in a manner "hostile to the state," because it creates the impression abroad that Austria is a country of neo-Nazis.
