At the same time it is emphasized that the lack of confidence in the government policy that was expressed is unconstitutional--according to the country's Basic Law, the Cabinet of Ministers is answerable to the president of the republic. In the government it was hoped that the statement from the Supreme Council would be a contribution to a constructive dialogue between the representative and executive organs of power. But, unfortunately, one can see in it signs of slogans whose sources lie in the emotions and passions of the recent election campaign. With the current socioeconomic situation a painful transition period is inevitable but the objective preconditions for overcoming it are in place, thinks the Cabinet of Ministers. The government has acted in compliance with the anticrisis program approved by the Supreme Council. Structural transformations in the economy are continuing, defense industry enterprises are being converted, the nonstate sector is developing, and under the conditions of the most severe nonpayment crisis a mutual offsetting has been conducted within the republic. Spring field work is being completed--under the most difficult of conditions the agricultural workers as of today have planted about 15 million hectares in grain crops and the planting of potatoes and vegetables and other crops was conducted at the optimal times. At the present time the government has submitted about 60 draft laws to the Supreme Council regarding urgent issues of economic reform and strengthening the state, legality, and law and order in the country. The adoption of these and other documents would make it possible to improve the legal base of the reforms and make social protection of the population more targeted. It says in the statement of the press service that the government is inviting the Supreme Soviet to exercise its constitutional authority to adopt laws and also to engage in a constructive dialogue for the sake of preserving political stability and interethnic harmony, and strengthening Kazakhstan's prestige in the international arena.
