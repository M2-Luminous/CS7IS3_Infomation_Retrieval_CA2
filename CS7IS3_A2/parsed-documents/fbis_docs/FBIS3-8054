Slota, Slovaks Must Struggle To Ensure That `No Minority Hinders the State-Forming Nation'"] [Text] Bratislava--According to Slovak National Party [SNS] Chairman Jan Slota, it would be best for Slovakia if early parliamentary elections were held in June. He also said that the "Bolsheviks" from the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] are trying to push back the date of the elections as far as possible so that "they can reveal how they will come again in the role of apostles and redeem this country." He commented that "they redeemed it like this once before, in 1948, and now they are preparing to do so again." J. Slota is of the opinion that the communists and Bolsheviks, as he calls the SDL members, are responsible for Slovakia's current economic situation. The SNS chairman unreservedly supports the drive for a petition and holding a referendum on all three questions. The SNS does not see priority in its activity being given to the economic sphere because its aims are national ones. J. Slota emphasized that there is also a social subtext in this "national" aspect, and he added that "we Slovaks must struggle to ensure that we all get on well and that this state-forming nation is not endangered by any minority." The SNS would like the state's defense to be oriented toward maintaining its territorial integrity and the inviolability of its borders. The SNS is in favor of the Slovak Army achieving combat readiness "so that we can be sure that we have something to defend ourselves with," he said. Another SNS priority is culture. "Here we would like to take a look at the funds given to the Hungarian press and culture, while, at the same time, our Slovaks in South Slovakia are disregarded," said Slota. According to him, the Hungarian minority in the Slovak Republic has above-average rights. He said that they are constantly bringing relations [between the communities] to a head. He pointed out that "the Hungarians and the smallest ethnic minority (the Jews) have a strong lobby here and that they are against Slovakia. Perhaps, they have different aims for Slovakia, aims at variance with those of the SNS," he added. Jan Slota would not refuse the post of defense minister if it were offered to him. However, he does not want this fact to be associated with his attacks on Defense Minister Andrejcak. He added that Andrejcak is only supported in his post by the former political instructors and members of the Communist Party of Slovakia Central Committee and Communist Party of Czechoslovakia Central Committee whom he has left in the Army.
