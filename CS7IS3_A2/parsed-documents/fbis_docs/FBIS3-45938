Ever since Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forward the general plan for housing reform in the early 1980's -- a plan basing on selling public housing, readjusting rents, and encouraging people to buy and build houses -- China's urban housing reform has been moving forward in an exploratory manner. Since the beginning of the 1990's, the nation has made substantial progress in housing reform. Although the time for establishing a new housing system is ripe, as the people's psychological and economic capacity for housing reform has become noticeably stronger, housing reform, like all other reforms, has not been smooth sailing. According to an analysis made by an authority of the State Council Leading Group for Housing Reform, the main problems which housing reform has faced over the past two years have been difficulties in raising rents and selling housing, and these problems have stalled housing reform. First of all, according to the original goal set for housing reform, rents collected at the end of the eighth five-year plan period should be enough to cover housing maintenance, management, and depreciation. However, in areas in which housing reform has been launched, the average amount of rent collected for each square meter of floor space has been only 0.3 yuan, far below the 0.75 yuan required to cover maintenance alone. The main reason why rents could not be raised was that government, enterprises, and workers were unable to cope with the increase either economically or psychologically. According to estimates, the nation has now 2.7 billion square meters of public housing, if the rents for this housing are raised to the target set for the end of the eighth five-year plan period, enormous subsidies will be needed. This was why the second-step rent increase, which is part of the housing reform program in some cities and regions, became "stranded." Secondly, because there was neither any applicable mechanism nor supporting policy for housing sales, sizable housing reform was exceedingly difficult. What should be done to tackle these problems? As we cannot stop or scrap the housing reform project, we must increase the intensity of reform. Only by so doing can we break the deadlock and create a new situation. Housing reform is a link in the chain of reform. If housing reform fails to move forward in various sectors with great intensity, the failure will seriously obstruct China's reform process. Two sets of figures show the urgent need in China for housing reform: 1) So that rent collected in 1987 could foot the bill for maintenance, management, depreciation, interest on investment, and property tax, subsidies amounting to only 27 billion yuan were paid by various authorities, this became 41.6 billion yuan by 1990, and jumped sharply to 67 billion in 1992, increasing by 8 billion yuan annually on the average. 2) The nation now has 27 billion square meters of public housing. Based on the need to spend 350 yuan to build of one square meter of housing, annual depreciation of 2 percent amounts to 18.9 billion yuan. For the maintenance and management of this housing, the state and enterprises have to spend 7 to 8 billion yuan each year. This is to say that the state and enterprises will lose between 25.9 and 26.9 billion yuan per year. This shows that if housing reform stops, public housing will become a heavy "burden" on the state and enterprises, and not an asset. If housing reform is delayed, the direct consequence will be increasingly higher housing subsidies to be paid by the state and enterprises, as well as an increasingly higher cost of reform. We should also be aware that if we fail to speed up housing reform and establish a new housing system, we can hardly speed up housing construction or improve housing conditions for urban residents. While this will seriously affect our efforts to achieve the goal that all city dwellers have comparatively comfortable living quarters by the year 2000, it will also prevent enterprises from replacing their operating mechanisms and obstruct the work of building a socialist market economic system. As we are confronted with a formidable task in achieving noticeable results in improving housing conditions for Chinese city dwellers by the end of this century, and meeting the demand to build a socialist market economic system, we must take more powerful and practical measures to break the deadlock of housing reform and blaze a new path with Chinese characteristics. To this end, state authorities have come up with a new idea for housing reform: While the emphasis will be on selling public housing, efforts will also be made to rent out public housing units and build new housing units, and to reform the rent system, encourage all units to establish public funds for housing construction, speed up construction of economic and affordable housing units, and draw up supporting policies for the development of the housing market so that more commodity housing units can be built by the public. The essence of the new idea is to replace the old system, under which the investment needed for housing construction had to be found by the state and enterprises, with a new system under which investment needed for housing construction is rationally shared by the state, units concerned, and individuals. Moreover, if we put the emphasis on selling public housing units, the move will activate the housing inventory, speed up the recovery of capital, speed up housing construction, and turn public housing from being a "burden" into real cash. Estimates show that if only 10 percent of public housing units are sold, nearly 100 billion yuan will be recovered. Naturally, housing units can only be sold when the state has drawn up the necessary supporting policies and measures so that buyers can afford short-term, medium-term, or long-term payments; otherwise, the expression selling housing units becomes an empty phrase. After many years of exploratory reform, fundamental changes have started to take place in China's decades-old public housing system. This year, as China embarks on "expediting reform as a whole and making breakthroughs in key points," big and firm strides will certainly be made in housing reform.
