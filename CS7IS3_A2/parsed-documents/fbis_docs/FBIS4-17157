At first glance the agenda appeared more trivial than sensational and intriguing: "On Instances of the Blatant Violation of Tax and Labor Legislation by Officials of St. Petersburg and Russia." On a superficial examination you might have seen a banal case of the sort that used to be heard in the USSR People's Control Committee. Okay, you would have thought, the chief of a tax inspectorate was fired, got himself reinstated via the courts, and was again fired. What does this labor dispute have to do with the Security Committee? In fact, that was the sort of question a group of committee members "kicked off" with: Should we be getting involved? Wouldn't it be better to send the papers to judicial organs? And why did some of us receive the documents rather late? Wouldn't it be better to set up a commission and recheck everything again? Committee head V. Ilyukhin, who chaired the hearings, swept aside the unjustified reproaches and called for constructive work. Both we journalists and the committee members were handed a very thick bundle of documents from which the criminal background to the question was perfectly clear. Incidentally, PRAVDA wrote about it in its report headlined "Why Does Filippov Enjoy Authority?" 14 December last year. New details have emerged today. Dmitriy Nikolayevich Filippov is one of those leaders to whom the so-called "democrats" applied what is in their view an offensive description -- "party nomenklatura." Suffice it to say that he headed the Baykal-Amur Railroad headquarters on authorization from the All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League Central Committee and before the smashing of the CPSU in August 1991 he worked as industry secretary of the Leningrad party oblast committee. During the "reform" years he created the tax inspectorate in Leningrad literally from scratch -- a totally new and unfamiliar job. And he repeatedly proclaimed the total depoliticization of this structure: All forms of ownership are the same to us, he said. The most important thing is to ensure that people observe the law and pay their taxes. The press wrote plenty about how those former "saviors of the economy," members of cooperatives, concealed income. They brought these same little tricks with them when they turned their shady concerns into small businesses, private businesses, and joint ventures. But how could they conceal dividends from Filippov and his people when they were perfectly well aware of the potential of every plant in the city, large and small? In the meantime he had also set up a tax police -- to investigate cases of the concealment of income -- and set about tackling the street "commercial stores," which in defiance of all edicts and decrees had not bothered to provide themselves with cash registers. Soon people were coming to see him from dozens of oblasts to hear his experience -- after all, it's a new venture! Even City Mayor A. Sobchak held him up as an example. Visiting the inspectorate collective one day, he said approximately the following: "The State Tax Inspectorate for St. Petersburg has rapidly found its feet, and it is to a considerable extent thanks to this that not only do we not have a budget deficit, but we can also do a great deal for people in the social sphere." He turned out to be a livestock raiser, former sovkhoz director, and later an official at City Hall. The voluble Deputy A. Nevzorov, addressing V. Gusev, asked: "You removed a first-class specialist, citing some sort of omissions. But he probably has no equal in the whole of mother Russia. And in his place you put someone with no experience of tax affairs or the fight against swindlers." The chief tax inspector, red-faced, did not know what to say to the hail of questions. Why did D. Filippov, whom he had earlier praised and held up as an example, overnight become "no good"? Who made the call from the Council of Ministers that led to his dismissal? If he was held to be responsible for "omissions," why did the wording of his dismissal say "staff cuts"? In his address to State Duma Chairman I. Rybkin the dismissed person explained the persecution as follows, in particular: "According to Yu.M. Ulyanov, deputy chief of the Russian State Tax Service, the reason was a letter from St. Petersburg Mayor A.A. Sobchak and pressure from First Vice Premier Ye.T. Gaydar...." I can also quote an extremely piquant bit of the information supplied to committee members and journalists. It says that A. Sobchak, A. Chubays, Ye. Gaydar, and former Finance Minister B. Fedorov are implicated in the "unexplained dismissal" of D. Filippov. See what levers of power the aggrieved ambassadors and consuls had to use to get rid of the overly intractable and incorruptible financial inspector! But neither Chubays, nor Gaydar, nor Fedorov, though they were invited, honored the committee session with their presence or were able to provide explanations "regarding the reasons for the dismissal." In their speeches representatives of the counterintelligence services, the Security Council, the tax police, the Russian Federation Prosecutor's Office, and Deputies S. Govorukhin, Yu. Vlasov, A. Nevzorov, N. Krivelskaya, and others spoke of colossal embezzlement of the country's natural resources and hard currency and the huge sums ending up in foreign banks. Just as you can tell the chemical composition of an ocean from a single drop of water, the rejoinders noted, so you can tell from this single case that Russia is being robbed. And the most terrible thing of all is that an incorruptible and professional specialist has fallen foul precisely of government officials. So whom do they serve? The conclusion is obvious: We are no longer masters in our own country if a principled civil servant acting in the interests of his own country can be simply dismissed at the whim of a foreign consul or ambassador. Summing up the debate, Committee Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin said the following: There is money in Russia. Enough for the miners, students, and teachers as well. But it is being artificially pumped into commercial structures. Statehood is being deliberately destroyed: Millions of people are suffering from mutual nonpayments, plants and factories are at a standstill. And the blame for this lies not least with the government, which, as we have seen, has very little interest in filling the state exchequer. The "great deal" consisted of bread subsidies, grants to people on low incomes, free lunches for schoolchildren, free travel for pensioners, and so forth. In fact, this was indeed the explanation: By putting the squeeze on wheeler-dealers who were concealing their income and tax-dodging, Filippov's service was doing a lot to boost the city and republic budgets. And, it transpires, he was serving not the regime but the teachers, medics, students, and staffers of scientific establishments who experience constant wage arrears thanks to the government, forcing them to go on strike. Filippov hired proven, competent people, even KGB officers, it is said. Of course, the checks, indictments running into many pages, and fines irritated the wheeler-dealers ensconced in many enterprises, commercial structures, and private stores. The city's chief financial inspector began to receive phone calls from City Hall advising him to "go easy." Here are just a few instances from his account to the committee: "When we touched on a kind of sacred cow -- the property fund -- we were simply staggered by the scale of the swindling. As a result of the inspections we discovered 6.623 billion rubles [R] that had not been distributed (in other words, concealed -- Editorial Office). Of course, they got a fine of R400 million, plus 10 percent of the sum that ought to have been paid into the budget. As I'm sure you realize, nobody would like that sort of thing. Furthermore, it transpired that 44,000 vouchers had mysteriously vanished in this privatization establishment, and Fishkov, deputy general director of the fund, was arrested over missing checks worth R134 million...." It also transpired that, in defiance of the law, the fund had privatized virtually entire neighborhoods and port installations. But nevertheless, it turned out that the real point lay elsewhere. The fund did not pay all revenue into a special account, but, as it were, "lent" it to commercial banks are a ridiculously low interest rate -- all of 2 percent! "We are not children," Dmitriy Nikolayevich said to the deputies, "and we must realize that businessmen are not given such incredible benefits merely because somebody likes the look of their face." The real storm erupted when D. Filippov set up a special group to inspect joint ventures. He even managed to get in here, where not every investigator would poke his nose. And, just think, the very first audit of the "Europa Hotel" uncovered a staggering picture of theft. This joint venture preferred to keep its dividends in Stockholm, naturally without paying a cent into our budget. The financial inspectors fined the Swedes $5 million, but, as Dmitriy Nikolayevich said, "it will take a lot more sweat to make them return the $25 million working for the Swedish economy." The inspectors also trod on the toes of the "Lenraumamebel" joint venture, so greatly admired by A. Sobchak. This respected establishment has used almost free raw materials and cheap energy and manpower to manufacture furniture and has sold almost 90 percent of it abroad for hard currency. And that is where the currency stayed, aiding the "revival of Finland." "When we made the Finns return the hard currency and pay taxes," D. Filippov continued, "a team of ambassadors and consuls was turned loose on me. They accused me of `sabotaging Yeltsin's policy.' My reply was: I am precisely supporting his policy by making you fulfill his edicts and our laws." It was noticeable how journalists sitting alongside each other exchanged glances when the speaker disclosed the following detail -- The ambassadors and consults hinted to him: Who has got to call you for you to leave our joint ventures in peace? Sobchak? A member of the Russian Government? The call soon came.... On 11 October, after the well known tragic events (as the assembled company immediately noted), V. Gusev, Russia's chief state tax inspector, fired D. Filippov without any explanation. Filippov was not intimidated and was reinstated via the Sverdlovskiy Rayon people's court in Moscow. But then there came an apparatus ploy familiar from the old days of reprisals against refractory people's control workers and other inspectors -- on 3 November a directive by V. Chernomyrdin himself appeared which seemingly abolished D. Filippov's post in St. Petersburg. His duties were entrusted to someone else, who was given the status of deputy leader of the Russian State Tax Service. What kind of a person was this?
