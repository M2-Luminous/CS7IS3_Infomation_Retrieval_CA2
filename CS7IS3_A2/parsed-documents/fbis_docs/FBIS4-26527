Guangzhou, Huizhou, Zhanjiang, Shantou, Zhaoqing, and Jieyang Cities have registered an increase of more than 50 percent. The exports of foreign-invested enterprises throughout the province have amounted to $1.9 billion. Foreign businessmen have actually invested almost $3.5 billion, or 80 percent of the foreign capital utilized by the province. During this period, more than 1,100 contracts have been signed with wholly owned foreign-invested enterprises, each contract comprising $2.48 million in foreign capital. According to statistics provided by the Guangdong Provincial Economic Commission, investment in tertiary industries has continued to rise, but investment in the real estate business has been slowing down. In the first quarter, 597 of the newly approved three type foreign-invested enterprises engaged in tertiary industrial production, and percentage went up from 1 to 2 percent as compared with the same period last year. The real estate business began to slow down following the rapid development of the last two years. From January to March, there were 159 newly approved projects throughout the province, a decrease of 28 percent compared with the same period last year. In the first quarter, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan investments accounted for 94 percent, a decrease of 1.5 percent compared with the same period last year. In the newly approved enterprises during the same quarter, there were 19 British enterprises, 62 U.S. enterprises, and three French enterprises, an increase of more than 50 percent over the same period last year. Regarding foreign capital actually utilized, Thai capital increased by almost 50 percent, Australian capital went up 85 times, and U.S. capital 15 times. The Guangdong Provincial Government has proposed a basic idea on the utilization of foreign capital in the future. First, aiming at the basic realization of modernization in 20 years and utilizing foreign capital in a multidirectional manner, Guangdong will strive to utilize foreign capital of $190 billion in the coming 20 years. Primary, secondary, and tertiary industries will be opened to foreign capital, except some special undertakings prescribed by the state. With the exception of basic industries and monopolized undertakings with state controlled stocks, foreign investors are welcome to wholly operate other undertakings and projects or to control the larger parts of their stocks. Second, Guangdong will use the industrial policy to guide investment orientation, so as to change the previous practice of orientating policies to certain regions. By implementing a preferential industrial policy, it will gradually switch the foreign investment focus from processing industries to infrastructure construction, basic industries, tertiary industries, and hi-tech industries. Third, the province will improve the results of foreign capital utilization by strengthening management. Under the conditions of a socialist market economy, it will establish a mechanism by which the government can exercise macromanagement over all enterprises, including foreign-invested firms. Guangdong will formulate the relevant laws and regulations to deal with the increasing disputes in three type foreign-invested enterprises and to protect the legitimate rights and interests of both management and labor. Apart from this, as renminbi is currently in relatively short supply, foreign investors will be allowed to control large portions of stock through direct investments. In addition, Guangdong will fully use the internationally practiced BOT [build-operate-transfer] method, investments by international financial firms, and investments by loan foundations. Viewing the new developments in foreign capital utilization, Guangdong will integrate the use of foreign capital with pillar industries. It will focus its efforts on developing energy, transportation, and telecommunications facilities as well as ethylene, automobile, electronics, textile, clothing, and pharmaceutical industries. Moreover, it will encourage the use of foreign capital in hi-tech industrial development, the high- supplementary-value export processing industry, and foreign- exchange-creating agriculture. Foreign capital will be introduced in banking and retail businesses on a trial basis for gradual popularization. In real estate, foreign capital will be primarily used for industrial land development, the renovation of old houses, and the construction of ordinary apartments. In mountainous or slowly developing regions, foreign capital may be transferred in an echelon formation; for the present, foreign capital can still be used for labor-intensive industrial development.
