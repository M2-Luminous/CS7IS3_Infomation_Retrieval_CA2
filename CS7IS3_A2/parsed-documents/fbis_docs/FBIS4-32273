Industrial giants and government ministries have relied on environmental consultants to gather information that will answer vexing questions on the state of the Czech environment. Some of these companies appear on THE PRAGUE POST list of largest environmental consulting firms. "The government is still debating the laws it passed in 1992," said Roman Vyhnanek, director of Czech Environment Management Center. "The problem is they don't want to talk to industries." The Ministry of Environment is in the process of defining and creating new environmental laws, but companies complain that current requirements are stiff and impose a financial burden they cannot afford if they are to remain competitive. One step in the privatization process for companies is to outline methods of waste management that are in compliance with the Environment Ministry's standards. Current pollution reduction in Czech cities is directly related to these recently privatized companies, according to Minister Frantisek Benda. Industry watchers, however, said that the slowdown in industrial production in the last several years is the primary cause of the slightly cleaner air. Consultants and government officials agree that air pollution in the cities is the most dangerous short-term environmental hazard the country faces. And the brown coal mined in northwest Bohemia is one of the most serious pollutants. "The greatest problem is that almost every large power plant in the Czech Republic burns tons and tons of coal," said Jiri Herstus, director of Aplikovana geotechnika a ekologie (AGE). "With the use of desulfurization stations, pollution wouldn't be nearly as bad." AGE, like many environmental consulting firms, works primarily in the mining industry, assessing the impact of coal mining on groundwater, air and soil. Herstus said CEZ, the national energy company, is looking for alternatives to mining, but meanwhile much land is being spoiled. Even though the problem is well-defined, solutions remain elusive. The current Czech government must reach deep into its coffers to find the cash to pay for four decades of neglect. In its 1994 budget, the government allocated 1.2 billion Kc ($41.4 million), about 3 percent of the overall budget, for environmental projects. Cleaning up the Czech environment will cost much more than that. "There are still big holes in the environmental solution," said Herstus. Communists chose factory locations for their accessibility to raw materials, without regard to effects on local environments. Industrial waste contaminated rivers and groundwater, polluted the air and fouled the land. Environmental laws existed under the former regime, but fines were minimal and violations were often overlooked. Consultants on this week's list work primarily with giant industrial companies, such as CEZ and the automaker Skoda, or with departments within the government. These large organizations have the funds to implement cleaner operations; and, in many cases, the larger firms are the worst environmental offenders. Much consulting work is in the form of surveys and fact-finding efforts, since there is little reliable information on the Czech environment. Once a body of research has been built up, the government will be able to assess better the magnitude of the problem. Municipalities and factories hire companies to explain the current environmental laws and suggest ways to remain within governmental standards while maximizing output. Consultants must stay atop all environmental legislation because clients' concerns run the gamut--waste management, groundwater contamination, soil contamination, air pollution and overall environmental impact. Environmental laws today differ from their communist predecessors "because before there were laws but no governmental agency to enforce them," said Denisa Kratochvilova, a consultant with KZT. "Now we have the Czech Environmental Inspection Agency." Kratochvilova added that it is natural for companies to change only when threatened with substantial fines from the government. The trick is to sway companies to comply with the environmental laws without breaking their backs.
