More than 20 international corporations, including China Resources (Holdings) Co. Ltd of Hong Kong, C. Ito and Co.

The province has so far approved more than 3,380 foreign-funded programs with a total investment of 2.38 billion U.S. dollars, according to Cong Dacai, chief of the provincial foreign investment administrative bureau. Last year the province attracted one billion U.S. dollars in foreign investment for 1,720 projects, nearly twice the previous year's figure. So far, companies from more than 40 countries and regions, including the Republic of Korea, the United States, Japan, Singapore, Canada, Germany, Italy, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, have investments in the province. More than 80 newly approved projects have a foreign investment of at least five million U.S. dollars each. The Harbin Sanxin Hydropower Corporation Ltd involves a total investment of 210 million U.S. dollars, some 52.17 million of which is from the New Era Land and Securities Investment Co. Ltd of Hong Kong. Over 70 percent of the foreign investment goes to the processing industries such as textiles, garments, chemicals, electronics, mechanical products and building materials. Foreign investors are also interested in high-tech production and the service industries, including real estate. Foreign investment is helping state-run enterprises upgrade their products as well. So far, a total of 360 million U.S. dollars has been put into major state-run enterprises in the province. Half of the province's total overseas investment last year was from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
