The Committee, a consultative forum which meets every 18 months and involves essentially economic experts from the Union and ASEAN, spent much of its latest meeting hammering out ways of improving trade, industrial cooperation and the possibilities of direct European investment, technology transfer and financing. The meeting agreed that market access should be widened in areas such as intellectual property and services, a point on which EU officials had voiced particular concern, as they did over the lack of progress made by the members of ASEAN in reducing their nontariff barriers despite the commitment the latter made to do so during the Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations. The Europeans are also keen to see a more concerted ASEAN approach on tariff reductions, which vary widely from one country to another. On the ASEAN side, much was made of the difficulties of access to the European market for products such as tinned tuna. "These concerns could be lessened by regular consultations designed to clarify specific problems, coupled with assurances from the EU that its market would remain open to ASEAN products," declared the ASEAN spokeswoman, Delia Albert. Things may not prove as straightforward as ASEAN would like, as one of the main obstacles to market access for ASEAN products is EU quality requirements, according to the European Commission's Director-General for North-South Relations, Juan Prat. The EU, which is ASEAN's third largest trade partner after Japan and the United States (bilateral trade amounted to 54 billion dollars in 1993), nonetheless remains committed to supporting the 15-year free trade programme just launched by the six members of the Association (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand).
