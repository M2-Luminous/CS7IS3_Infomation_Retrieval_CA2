Security Council. The agreement came during a meeting between South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at the State Department on Friday afternoon. At the hour-long meeting, Han and Christopher shared the opinion that Pyongyang and the International Atomic Energy Agency could still make progress in negotiations on IAEA inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities, according to Chang Chae-yong, director-general of the Foreign Ministry's American affairs Bureau. In addition, Han and Christopher agreed that even if the North Korean issue was referred to the Security Council, U.N. action against Pyongyang should be taken in stages rather than through immediate sanctions. They reportedly decided to introduce mild measures at first, such as passing a resolution urging North Korea to accept IAEA inspections, before gradually turning up the heat, Foreign Ministry sources said. Han also handed Christopher a personal letter from President Kim Yong-sam to U.S. President Bill Clinton. In the letter, President Kim reaffirmed the agreements he and Clinton reached at their summit in Washington last November and in a telephone conversation on Dec. 7, in which they vowed to pursue "thorough and wide-ranging" measures to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem. Earlier Friday morning, Han met with new U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and agreed to study plans to hold the joint military exercise "Team Spirit," tentatively scheduled for March 10, if North Korea refuses to allow inspection of its nuclear facilities. Han told Perry that South Korea was positively considering the proposed deployment by U.S. forces in Korea of Patriot missiles, but he urged the United States to be careful about the timing, sources said. The two officials further agreed that the current situation on the Korean peninsula could not be termed a crisis. Nevertheless, Seoul and Washington would make thorough preparations to preserve South Korea's security against any military provocation by North Korea. Prior to meeting with Christopher, Han held wide-ranging discussions with senior officials of the U.S. State Department including Robert Gallucci, assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs, and Tom Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of state. The two sides agreed that they will not abandon their efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue before Feb. 21, when the IAEA Board of Governors is scheduled to meet. In addition, they decided to study the possibility of holding a working-level contact in New York between the United States and North Korea in the belief that Pyongyang must be told of "the hard- line atmosphere" in the international community on the nuclear issue.
