FBIS4-231 "drafr066_c_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-066 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA IFP Official: Elections Should Be Postponed IFP Official: Elections Should Be Postponed MB0604095194 Johannesburg SAPA in English 0854 GMT 6 Apr 94 MB0604095194 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Johannesburg April 6 SAPA -- The elections should be postponed -- not only in kwaZulu but in the whole of South Africa, the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] said on Wednesday. IFP Transvaal political Director Themba Khoza said parties like the Pan Africanist supported the postponement of the elections. "It is impressive that the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] has finally realised the going is too tough to hold elections," Mr Khoza said. He was responding to the conclusion reached on Tuesday by a joint working committee of the IEC and the South African and kwaZulu governments that elections could not be held in the current political climate in kwaZulu. "But the Transvaal IFP can never support an election postponed only in Natal and not the rest of the country," Mr Khoza said. There were two major obstacles hindering the conduct of elections -- violence and the constitutional impasse over regional powers. "The IEC has finally realised that there is violence. But it is not only in Natal, it is gripping the whole country. There are no-go areas everywhere and therefore there can be no free and fair election throughout South Africa. "We will need to go flat out to finally defuse the tension and this cannot be achieved in a short time," Mr Khoza said. He said unless the dispute over regional powers was addressed and the IFP demands for provincial powers were met, there would always be conflict between political organisations. "It is important that these two obstacles be addressed before we all go to the polls." IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler said in reaction to the joint report that the political climate in kwaZulu should be changed and not the election date. He said two inspectors would determine the effects of the state of emergency in kwaZulu and would report back to the IEC by Friday. He said that a decision on further action would be taken on Saturday.
