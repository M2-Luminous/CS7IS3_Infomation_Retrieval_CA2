In the course of a more than two-hour discussion, Anatoliy Vasylovych related some of the results in building the armed forces and the problems and difficulties of this difficult matter, and answered a host of questions. NARODNA ARMIYA has already introduced Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata to its readers, and there is probably no need to present his biography again. We will nonetheless emphasize once again that Anatoliy Vasylovych linked his life with the army some thirty five years ago. After completing general military school, he served as commander of a platoon, company and battalion, chief of staff, regimental commander, deputy division commander, commander of a division, a corps and first deputy commander of a group of forces. He has completed two military academies--imeni M.V. Frunze and the General Staff. It was not easy for Anatoliy Vasylovych to make the time for the meeting with journalists on this day. He nevertheless found an hour or two for the conversation with us. Thanking us for the attention that the employees of the press, radio and television have devoted to the armed forces and their problems, he stated that the main result of the two years of building the army is the fact that independent Ukraine has its own army. That is first. Second, we have the opportunity to look back today and analyze what has been done and what has not, and on that basis to define more concrete ways of realizing the program of military organizational development. The level of leadership of the armed forces today, and first of all the activity of the General Staff in this area, has become much higher. And it is there that I see the consequences of the work of my subordinates. Third, we have finally clarified the status of the armed forces staff. Today it has the name of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And that is no small feat. Fourth, we are building our army today on a quite solid legal foundation. I have in mind here the laws "The Defense of Ukraine," "The Armed Forces of Ukraine," and the Military Doctrine, which was recently adopted by our parliament, along with other legislation. I would also like to say something about this. Our cadres today--the officers, warrant officers, NCOs and soldiers--are people who have clearly answered the question of whom they are serving and how they are serving. We have been lucky to preserve the combat readiness of our troops at a level that guarantees the reliable defense of the peaceful labor of the people of Ukraine under difficult conditions. And that is convincingly testified by the results of the recent performance evaluations for the past training year. Unfortunately, Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata continued, there are shortcomings and mistakes in our work. In the past year, for example, we were not fortunate enough to fulfill entirely the program relating to the training of units and subunits. Why, you ask? There is one reason--not enough matériel or funds. We had to cut back the training time of flight personnel in aviation units, say, owing to the acute shortage of fuels and lubricants, and we were not able to conduct regimental tactical exercises in the full amount with the use of vehicles and other means on which the professional proficiency of the commanders and their subordinates depends to a considerable extent. Consider this: It has been estimated that for an army to fulfill the tasks entrusted to it successfully requires somewhere around 3.6 percent of the gross national income for its maintenance and development. This is the ideal--that is, if the state already has well-formed statehood and developed armed forces. Ukraine is still on its way to that. So everything being supplied to the army today is not sufficient. The armed forces, for example, were allocated just a third of the amount we needed last year, and even less if the uncontrolled inflation is taken into account. The financial inflows, in short, are barely enough to feed and clothe the people and pay them. There is simply nothing left for the rest. There is also no money, most unfortunately, to supplement the inventory of combat vehicles, or for the development and manufacture of more effective models of weaponry. What has and will the army live on? To a significant extent on the former reserves of logistical matériel and military property. The reserves, meanwhile, if they are not replenished, will be exhausted sooner or later. As for the money, Minfin [Ministry of Finance] is also seeking out opportunities and passing them on each month for the needs of the armed forces. But the officers, warrant officers, workers and employees are nonetheless receiving their pay late these days. This, in turn, is having a negative effect on their attitude toward the work and the well-being of their families. It is especially difficult for those who reside in remote garrisons where there are not always kindergartens, schools, stores, or bus lines with the closest inhabited areas. Whatever one may say, everything is not as simple as it could seem to some. The state and the MO [Ministry of Defense] are nonetheless doing a great deal to ease the lives of servicemen and the members of their families. The question of issuing food rations to officers and warrant officers was positively resolved recently in particular, as well as cigarettes for soldiers and NCOs. There is no doubt that the issues that have acutely faced the people in uniform will also find understanding in the government. We return, however, to the problems connected with the renewal of hardware and weaponry. I would not be surprised if some of you were to ask me how it could have happened that we have such a mighty defense industry as ours, but the army today is still using what it got from the once-mighty and "indivisible"? We really did get a mighty scientific and industrial potential after the collapse of the Union. It must be said that the armed forces themselves have a solid production base--there are several dozen repair plants alone. But they, like the enterprises of the military-industrial complex, are in a difficult situation today. Quite a few of them, owing to the absence of funds in the Ministry of Defense for the procurement of hardware and weaponry and their repairs, as well as the ordering of new models of weaponry, have been forced to seek out ways that would permit them to at least make ends meet in these difficult times. The problem of military science, without which the army cannot manage, is no less acute. Everything would appear to be understandable here. But what is actually happening? Just a hundredth of what is required has been invested in the development of military science today. A great deal of scientific work has been curtailed owing to the lack of finances. We have considerable scientific potential at the same time. It just needs to be preserved and strengthened with funding. The need, however, does not always match the capabilities. The Ministry of Defense is losing excellent cadres of scientific personnel, who will scarcely be coming back in the future, as a consequence. Other difficulties being experienced by the army could be cited as well, said Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata. But it will live on nonetheless, and take on new forms and outlines. I am an optimist by nature, so if you ask me what I would like to see for our armed forces in the future, then I would answer without reflection--to be respected by the people and the state. How can that be achieved? There is certainly no unequivocal answer to that question, as it is complex and multifaceted. And nonetheless, it seems to me, many of these problems could recede by themselves if we are able to raise the prestige of military service and the prestige of the military person in society. So once again, how? You will not achieve anything here by punishment or some willful decisions, and could even make matters worse. Let us make a small excursion into the recent past in order to understand and look into the reasons for the decline in prestige of military service. More or less better conditions have been created for people in the spheres of trade, business and entrepreneurship over the last five or six years or so. That has had an immediate effect on the armed forces. Military cadres, and not the worst of them, began to flow out of the ranks. This process was not halted after Ukraine began to build its own army. I do not want to say that business and trade are not needed by our society. But without reliable people devoted to their homeland serving in the army, we cannot talk about a strong state. I would like to see, that is, intelligent youth loyal to their Fatherland come to us. I also touched at the beginning of our discussion on the problem of financing the army. I would like to see our armed forces have a budget that would be sufficient not only for their maintenance, the training of personnel and the upkeep of hardware in combat-ready condition, but also for the development of military science, the creation of new models of hardware and weaponry etc. Only in that case will our troops be engaged in what they should be, that is, raising the level of their combat readiness. But one can only think about that now; time does not wait. And that is where this could lead. I will refer as an example to a problem connected with the development and creation of our hardware and weaponry. Everything our army is equipped with today is hardware and weaponry of the former Soviet Army, which is, by the way, not eternal and has entirely concrete service lives. A completely new tank, say, can be operated for a span of fifteen or twenty years. The vehicle is obsolete upon the expiration of that period, and it must be replaced. Financing is needed today, in order to place an order for a new model of weaponry, for scientific development, and then for the manufacture of the vehicles at enterprises in the military-industrial complex. Taking into account the fact that the average time period for the birth of a new model of a weapon, depending on the complexity of the work, is seven to fifteen years, one may say that if money is not invested in the development of weapons today, then in seven or fifteen years we will not have them. It would not be quite correct to say that no one understands the ruinous nature of this situation. Ask any of our workers and you will be convinced of that. The understanding is possibly worse at higher levels. If, say, we want to get our finances in order, then people appear who will say that perhaps we could wait for the future for our armed forces, and let them survive through the reserves that they have. But everything that used to be in the army is coming to an end today. It has actually already lived and maintained its combat readiness for two years thanks to internal reserves. Today we need to think seriously about the future of the armed forces, that is, about their further improvement and development. And in all of this we have still not said anything about the accumulation of material resources and reserves for difficult times. Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata emphasized, in answering a question regarding what the ideology will be in the army, that the leadership of the armed forces is doing everything to see that it has one, uniform ideology--the state ideology. To put it in more concrete terms, then we will try first and foremost to see that every serviceman--officer or warrant officer, sergeant or soldier--is a citizen of his Fatherland, and that his level of training and readiness would permit him to fulfill his patriotic duties to defend the independent Ukraine with honor. That is first. Second, I also see my task as seeing that there is unity, harmony and understanding of their tasks among the servicemen with regard to the security of our state. Avoiding discord in the thoughts of soldiers, sergeants and officers is facilitated to no small extent by the work to avert the influence of political parties and movements on the military collectives. It is no secret that such influence exists in Ukraine. I would like to remind them once again that our army is not needed for political battles, it is needed for the protection of the interests of the state and its land, sea and air borders, and for the maintenance of peace and harmony in society. And there are not, and cannot be, even the slightest actions here by those who have quite different aims and interests. With a view to continuing the discussion of this topic, the chief of the General Staff was asked a question regarding the political situation in Sevastopol and, in particular, the motives for the recent murder of the chief of the press center of the Black Sea Fleet, Captain 1st Rank A. Lazebnykov. That city, said Anatoliy Vasylovych, is becoming a tangled knot of political problems and many unresolved issues pertaining to the further existence and presence of the ChF [Black Sea Fleet] on our land. As for the murder of the head of the press center, neither the armed forces nor the Ukrainian Navy have any relation to that whatsoever. The opinion of the chief of the General Staff is that there were no political motives at all at the heart of that tragic incident, the more so any of the conflicts that existed at one time between the sailors of the ChF and the Ukrainian Navy. Something else is concealed here. The journalists were also unable to avoid asking about some of their own problems at this meeting. The discussion concerned in particular the fact that it has become more difficult for the members of the press to obtain information pertaining to military topics, and whether that was connected with any prohibitions. That is in reality not so. The armed forces of Ukraine, emphasized the chief of the General Staff, have never been closed to the mass media. But here is something to worry about. Quite a few commentators have appeared here recently who are, without any authority or rights whatsoever, sharing with this or that correspondent their ideas pertaining to this or that factor or incident, and are frequently passing that off as the stance of the Ministry of Defense. I, said Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata, am categorically against that treatment of the issue. If we want to tell our people about the life of the military collectives, then we should turn to the people who know what they are talking about, what the essence of the problem is. Taking advantage of this opportunity, I would like to confirm once again what I have said many times before: Ask our specialists, ask me, ask our chiefs of directorates any question at any time if you please, and no one will fail to inform you of anything. By the way, we will never close the gates of a unit to journalists, we will not conceal problems from them connected with non-regulation relations, with desertion from the army. In confirmation of what he said, Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata related in quite a bit of detail how many of our servicemen are on the run today, and what reasons prompted them to take such a step. There are currently fifty-three soldiers "on the run" in the Carpathian region, for example. The motives that impelled them to leave their military collectives are very diverse. The people left their units, however, as a rule not because they were beaten or driven from them, but rather because many of them are simply not ready to bear all of the difficulties of military service in a steadfast manner. The army is not able to solve this problem alone. It exists, one might say, at the boundary of military and civilian activity. Much here depends on the schools, parents and labor collectives, and on their work with regard to the patriotic indoctrination of the pre-draft youth. Seeing alternative service as one realistic way of restoring the situation in the military collectives, the journalists were interested in hearing from the chief of the General Staff how the call-up for that service was proceeding, what difficulties are arising. Reminding them of some of the provisions of the Law of Ukraine "Alternative (Extra-Military) Service," Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata observed, not without regret, that hundreds of youth who have expressed the desire to work, for example, in construction or at treatment centers, hospitals or other places are not being called. Some fear the longer term of service, others are unaware, and still others... There is, in short, much here to think about and work on. The discussion next turned to national problems and, in particular, what the composition of the army will be. In accordance with the principles of military organizational development, said Anatoliy Vasylovych, the armed forces of Ukraine have to be popular rather than national. I like the name of our newspaper NARODNA ARMIYA on that plane. The people [narod] are a union of many peoples and nationalities. Look how many there are in our country. Living here, aside from the Ukrainians, are Russians, Belarusians, Moldovans, Poles, Germans... Why am I talking about this? Because if we want there to be peace and harmony in our independent state, then it is very important to have a well-disposed and understanding attitude toward each person, no matter what nationality he may be. The fact that each member of society is passionate about Ukraine and defends its independence is no less important in turn. And if that is so, then he is obliged to enjoy all the same rights as Ukrainians. There will otherwise not be harmony in society, and the state will not have a mighty and combat-ready army. At the end of the meeting the journalists were interested in the thoughts of the chief of the General Staff on the nuclear weapons that are located on the territory of our state, ways and options for dividing up the Black Sea Fleet, the procedure for the transfer and future use of of military compounds after the disbanding of military units in the strategic forces and a great deal more. Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata, answering all of the questions clearly and exhaustively, appealed to the journalists with the request and wish to be very considerate and delicate with regard to covering the life and activity of the armed forces, and called for objective writing on current event and more vigorous and purposeful work in favor of the army, to strengthen its reputation and raise combat and mobilization readiness.
