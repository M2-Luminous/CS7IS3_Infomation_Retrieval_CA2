The foreign minister, who is visiting Brazil, told the Russian ITAR-TASS agency on Wednesday that he knew of no reasons why Lithuanian-Russian relations should deteriorate. According to Mr. Gylys, Russia is halting the ratification of the bilateral agreement on most favored nation status in trade signed last autumn. Russia has already granted privileged trade terms to 130 countries, however,this does not apply to the Baltic states. Lithuania carries out its all commitments to Russia and would like Moscow in its turn to observe its obligations to Lithuania, said the Lithuanian foreign minister.
