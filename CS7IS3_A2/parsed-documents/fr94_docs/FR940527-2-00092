FR940527-2-00092 FR940527-2-00078 Privacy Act of 1974_Alteration of Notice of System of Records Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a), notice is hereby given that the Department of the Interior proposes to alter a notice describing a Departmentwide system of records managed by the Office of Aircraft Services to expand one category of records included in the system, to add one additional category of individuals covered by the system, and to add one new use of the records in the system. The notice being altered, which is published in its entirety below, is ``Federal and Non-Federal Aviation Personnel, Equipment and Mishap Information System_Interior, DOI&hyph;07,'' previously published on March 8, 1984 (49 FR 8680) as ``Aircraft Crew/Mechanic Information File_Interior, Office of the Secretary-7.'' The category of records proposed for expansion in DOI&hyph;07 is accident experience data. Added to information obtained in investigations of aircraft accidents is data reported involving aircraft incidents, aviation hazards, and aircraft maintenance deficiencies. The additional category of individuals covered by the system proposed for DOI&hyph;07 is pilots, aircrews, and ground personnel of cooperating government agencies, organizations and private individuals. The new use of system records proposed for DOI&hyph;07 allows for aircraft mishap trend analysis and for development of statistical data for use in the Interior Aircraft Accident Prevention Program. In DOI&hyph;07, the existing system name is revised to more adequately convey the Departmentwide extent of the scope-of-system coverage. All other changes proposed for DOI&hyph;07 are editorial in nature, clarify and update existing statements, and reflect organizational, address and other miscellaneous administrative revisions which have occurred since the previous publication of the material in the Federal Register : To wit, the existing storage statement is revised to more accurately describe the current method of data storage; the existing retrievability statement is revised to reflect current indexing capabilities; the existing retention and disposal statement is revised to account for the disposition of records proposed for inclusion in the system; the existing system record source categories statement is revised to more clearly identify current sources of system data; and the existing location statement and existing system manager(s) and address statements are revised to reflect changes in addresses of system managers. As required by the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a(r)), the Office of Management and Budget, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, and the House Committee on Government Operations have been given notice of this proposed alteration. 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(11) requires that the public be provided a 30-day period in which to comment on the new, intended uses of the information in this system of records. The Office of Management and Budget, in its Circular A&hyph;130, requires a 40-day period in which to review such proposals. Written comments on this proposal can be addressed to the Departmental Privacy Act Officer, Office of the Secretary, Office of Administrative Services, 1849 ``C'' Street NW., Mail Stop 5412 MIB, Washington, DC 20240, telephone (202) 208&hyph;6045. Comments received within 40 days of publication in the Federal Register will be considered. The notice shall be effective as proposed at the end of the comment period, unless comments are received which would require a contrary determination. Dated: May 20, 1994. Albert C. Camacho, Director, Office of Administrative Services.
