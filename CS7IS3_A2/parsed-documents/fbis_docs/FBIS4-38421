In his opinion, the Duma "claims on certain information exclusiveness", which may provoke a chain reaction on the part of other power structures, including the juridical one. "Then we will have a splendid TV and the radio," said Poptsov. Lamenting there were no deputies to show wisdom and understanding, Poptsov stressed "the main feature of democracy is openness, modesty and availability of power bodies, their ability of self-estimation, and not claims on privileges".
