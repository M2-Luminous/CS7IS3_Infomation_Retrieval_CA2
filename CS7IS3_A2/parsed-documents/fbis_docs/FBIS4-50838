It approved the government work report delivered by regional Chairman Gyaincain Norbu; the report on the implementation of the 1993 plan and on the 1994 draft plan for economic and social development; the report on the implementation of the 1993 budget plan and the 1994 draft budget plan; and the work reports by the higher people's court and the higher people's procuratorate. The session held that in the past year, the people of all nationalities in Tibet, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, earnestly implemented the 14th CPC National Congress guidelines, and deepened reform and opening up wider in close conjunction with the objective of establishing a socialist market economic structure and of modernizing the region, thereby quicking the pace of construction, promoting the development of productive forces, and scoring fresh achievements in all fields of endeavor. The session held that the government work report has factually summarized the work over the past year, objectively analyzed the existing problems and difficulties, and explicitly put forth the basic principles and fighting goals of the work in 1994. These principles and goals are inspiring the people in their advancement and can be accomplished through assiduous efforts by the people of all nationalities throughout Tibet. Regional CPPCC committee members have expressed concern over, and made suggestions and opinions on outstanding contradictions and problems, such as high price rises, poor performance of state-owned enterprises, low income of peasants and herdsmen, disorderly cultural markets, inadequate medical and health services in farming and pastoral areas, corruption of all kinds, and crimes in some localities. They hope the regional government will persist in the principle of fostering both material progress and cultural and ideological progress and attaching equal importance to both and adopt effective measures to solve these problems. The session held that 1994 is a crucial year for Tibet to carry out reform in an all-round way, to launch package reform programs, to achieve breakthroughs in key areas, and to accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economy. We must steadfastly take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic guidelines as our guide; and must comprehensively carry out the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, as well as the guidelines of the fourth and fifth enlarged plenary sessions of the fourth regional party committee. We must expedite the establishment of a socialist market economic structure and do everything we can to change Tibet's backward transportation, energy supply, and infrastructure. We must turn our advantage in resources into an economic edge for achieving a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the regional economy. We must step up the building of democracy and the legal system, as well as the building of socialist spiritual civilization. We must improve party work style, promote a clean and honest government, launch an in-depth struggle against splittism, safeguard the motherland's unification, strengthen national unity, safeguard political stabiltiy, and promote the progress of society in all fields. The work in all fields must serve and be subordinate to the overall interests of grasping the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability; and must be conducive to the proper handling of the relationship between reform, development, and stability. The session called on CPPCC committees at all levels and their members across Tibet to hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism, to diligently study Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," to earnestly carry out the guidelines of the current session, to bring into play their talent to serve the central task of economic construction, to conduct effective political consultation and democratic supervision, to take an active part in the administration and discussion of state affairs, to unite all forces that can be united and mobilize all positive factors, to pool the efforts of all, and to make their share of contributions to the maintenance of Tibet's political and social stability. The session called on CPPCC committees at all levels and their members across Tibet, to be led by the regional party committee, to rally still closer around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core; to emancipate their minds; to heighten their spirits; and to work hard and advance in a pioneering spirit in striving for new victories in Tibet's reform and opening up as well as the building of two civilizations.
