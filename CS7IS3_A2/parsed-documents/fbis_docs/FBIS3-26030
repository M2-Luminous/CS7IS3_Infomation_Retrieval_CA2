According to this official, property rights of state-owned enterprises being transferred to overseas financial groups must first go through strict examination; the liabilities of the former state-owned enterprise would be taken up by the enterprise that becomes a joint-venture. On this point, the state was planning to adopt a series of preferential polices including preferential treatment in the charge for transfer of land use right. The sources of the "state-owned enterprises reinvigorating fund" would be mainly the original bank subsidy loans, proceedings from disposal of property, and international aid; this fund would be used in purchases between enterprises from now on. Besides this, the state would establish and promote a "bankruptcy warning system," which would be used to standardize a bank mortgage insurance system; it was stipulated that from now on administrative organizations were not allowed to be guarantors of enterprise loans, and the guarantee between enterprises must be based on the principle of voluntariness, joint products, and multiple association in responsibility; this system should stipulate a certain index for the liability rate of an enterprise for it to go bankrupt. This State Economic and Trade Commission official disclosed that the state was considering revising the "Law on Bankruptcy" and formulating a series of new decrees that comply with the modern enterprise system.
