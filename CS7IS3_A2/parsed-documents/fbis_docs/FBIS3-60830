They only talk about the fate of some Israeli soldiers who were taken prisoner in Lebanese territory. This administration is not qualified to play a humanitarian role, Sayyid Nasrallah added. His eminence, however, voiced the party's readiness to discuss the fate of the Zionist soldiers and Lahdist agents held by the party with international and humanitarian organizations and with friendly parties that support our people's right to resistance in return for the release of all the detainees held in the Zionist occupation prisons. Asked about the U.S. plan, which aims to exclude Resolution 425 from the settlement process, Sayyid Nasrallah said: At the least, the Lebanese Government must withdraw completely from the negotiations because the United States and Israel are seeking to deprive the Lebanese authority of this resolution. The U.S. plan should serve as a warning to the Lebanese authorities and to all the people of the region. He said: We urge the political authority in Lebanon and the Lebanese people, as well as all forces, to realize that the only force that could be relied on in the liberation process is the force of resistance. He said that resistance will continue as long as occupation continues. In response to a question about the internal situation and the current crises, Sayyid Nasrallah said: The government is hatching plots against Lebanon and its people, as well as against Lebanon's alliance with Syria. Had our people and masses not been patient in the wake of the 13 September massacre and had it not been for the caution exercised vis-a-vis the role played by certain government figures, Lebanon would have collapsed. There are people working to render Lebanon an easy prey for the Americans and Israelis. Sayyid Nasrallah called for the creation of a broad opposition front based on clear-cut objectives to safeguard and salvage Lebanon. He said: This government has made enough mistakes, which has enabled the opposition to increase every day.
