FR941121-0-00018 FR941121-0-00001 Comment 8(b)&hyph;3 provides guidance on advertising account for which institutions offer a number of versions (certificate accounts, for example). The FRB revised its comment for clarity without any intended change in meaning, and the NCUA Board has conformed the comment to do likewise. (c) When Additional Disclosures are Required The regulation requires institutions to disclose additional information when the APY is advertised. Comment 8(c)&hyph;1 provides examples of account descriptions that do not trigger the additional disclosures. The FRB has eliminated the reference to a bonus of 1% over an institution's current rate for one-year certificates as an example of a trigger term. Based on comments it received and upon further analysis, the FRB believes a reference to an institution's own rates (to which a ``bonus'' rate or margin will be applied) is not a trigger term if those rates are not readily determinable from the advertisement itself. This position is consistent with the rules regarding trigger terms in advertisements under the FRB's Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226). For these reasons, NCUA has conformed comment 8(c)&hyph;1 in this regard. This clarification was also made in response to four commenters' requests. (c)(2) Time Annual Percentage Yield is offered Comment 8(c)(2)&hyph;2 has been added in to conform to the final Regulation DD commentary. It specifies that an advertisement may refer to the APY as being accurate as of the date of publication, if the date is on the publication itself. (e) Exemption for Certain Advertisements (e)(1) Certain Media One commenter requested clarification regarding whether messages on ATM and computer screens would be entitled to this advertising exemption. The regulation states that this exemption is available for broadcast and electronic media, such as radio and television, outdoor media, such as billboards, and telephone response machines. The Board believes that ATM and computer screens are similar to these types of media in many respects. First, ATMs are part of an electronic network, such as radio and television. Second, most ATMs are at locations outside of a credit union branch. Third, only a limited amount of space is available to make a message available to a member. With this reasoning, the Board has determined that ATM screens are subject to the electronic media exemption, and has clarified this in comment 8(e)(1)(i)&hyph;1. (e)(3) Newsletters A national trade association commenter noted that neither the letter, spirit, nor intent of TISA and part 707 would be violated if credit unions were permitted to make newsletters available to potential members. Since potential members must receive all required account disclosures upon becoming a member and opening an account, potential members could not be harmed by receipt of a member newsletter containing accurate information, but not conforming in every regard to the advertising requirements of part 707. It was also pointed out by the commenter that newsletters have traditionally been used by credit unions as a tool to increase membership, and that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for credit unions to prevent members from sharing newsletters with potential members sharing a common bond. The NCUA Board, which created the newsletter exemption based upon credit union uniqueness, is sympathetic to these additional reasons to expand availability of the newsletters to potential members. however, to do so at this time would require a rule amendment to ยง707.8(e)(3)(i), which would be beyond the scope of the initial, proposed rulemaking, and therefore, impermissible under the Administrative Procedures Act. This being the case, the Board has not made any changes to comments 8(e)(3)&hyph;1 and 2. The Board will continue to monitor this situation, and if additional Truth in Savings rulemakings are necessary in the future, will consider requesting comments on a proposed amendment to expand the newsletter exemption to cover potential member distribution. Similarly, another commenter asked that the Board include information provided on an ATM screen under the newsletter exemption. As the FRB has clearly included ATM screen messages as covered advertisements in the definition of ``advertisement,'' and NCUA must be substantially similar to the FRB, NCUA declines to make this change, which also is outside of the scope of this rulemaking. However, the Board has stated that ATM and computer screen messages may use the electronic media exemption. Comment (e)(1)(i)&hyph;1. Appendix A_Annual Percentage Yield Calculation Part I. Annual Percentage Yield for Account Disclosures and Advertising Purposes In response to commenters, NCUA has revised comments app.A.I.&hyph;2 and 3. Comment app.A.I.&hyph;2 adds that, for leap year annual percentage yield calculations, the ``days in term'' figure used in the denominator should be consistent with the length of term used in the dividends calculation. Comment app.A.I.&hyph;3 clarifies that the guidance on the first tier of a tiered-rate account only applies when such information is provided in a rate table format, and not in the written format of sample clauses provided at Appendix B, ยงB&hyph;1(a)(iv). In response to another commenter, NCUA added comment app.A.I.&hyph;4, which provides that term share club accounts may calculate the annual percentage yield based on the maximum number of days in the term, not to exceed the number of days in the year. Part II. Annual Percentage Yield Earned for Statements Comment app.A.II.&hyph;1 has been clarified without any change in meaning. Proposed comment app.A.II.&hyph;2, requiring the provision of certain collected balance information on the periodic statement, has been deleted since it is not in conformity with the FRB's position in Regulation DD and no uniqueness reasons exist for its existence. As a result, proposed comment app.A.II.&hyph;3 has been renumbered comment app.A.II.&hyph;2. A. General formula. Comment app.A.II.A.&hyph;1 provides guidance about the treatment of accrued, but uncredited, interest in the balances used to calculate the APYE. The FRB believes an inaccurate APYE would result if institutions include accrued interest in the balance figure when statements are sent less frequently than interest is credited. But when periodic statements are issued more frequently than interest is credited, accrued interest must be included in the balance figure for APYE computation purposes. The NCUA adopts the Regulation DD position.
