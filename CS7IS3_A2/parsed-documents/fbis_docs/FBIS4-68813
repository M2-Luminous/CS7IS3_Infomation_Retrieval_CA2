The Dutch were not deterred by the fact that last year Russia restricted foreign banks' opportunities to work with our country's companies and citizens. According to information obtained from Mr. Van Tets, a member of the ABN AMRO board of directors, in the very near future negotiations between the European Union leadership and the Russian Government should result in considerable easing of the terms under which European banks operate in our country. It is possible that within one month ABN AMRO will be able to provide a full range of services to residents of Russia. The Dutch have outlined three main focuses of their operations. First of all, there is the capital market. With help from ABN AMRO leading Russian companies will be able to float their stocks and bonds in the West. In this way the Dutch bank will not be "siphoning off Russian resources to foreign countries" (the fear that exists among many proponents of protectionism in our country), but instead will help aid the influx of capital into Russia. True, for that to happen our companies will have to be competitive and attractive from an investment standpoint. Secondly, ABN AMRO provides a whole range of services to private and privatizing enterprises. The Dutch have gained a great deal of experience working with countries that are reforming their economies, as the bank is already active in the Eastern European countries. Thirdly, ABN AMRO handles project financing. It is possible that major projects will be carried out with its aid in our city as well. A particularly favorable environment for this is being created by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which this week considered a number of projects in connection with our city's development. Of course, the instability of Russia's political and economic situation is hampering the influx of foreign capital, including banking capital. But the arrival of ABN AMRO in St. Petersburg on the heels of Credit Lyonnais and BNP-Dresdner Bank attests to a revival of international business connections.
