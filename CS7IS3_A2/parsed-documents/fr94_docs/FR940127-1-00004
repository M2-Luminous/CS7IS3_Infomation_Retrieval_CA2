FR940127-1-00004 FR940127-1-00003 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;81] Airworthiness Directives; Pratt & Whitney JT8D Series Turbofan Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes to supersede telegraphic airworthiness directive (AD) T89&hyph;05&hyph;52 by adopting a new AD, applicable to Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan engines. Telegraphic AD T89&hyph;05&hyph;52 currently requires repetitive ultrasonic inspections of a combustion chamber outer case (CCOC) weld, but also allows visual inspection or fluorescent magnetic penetrant inspection (FMPI) of certain CCOC's under specified conditions. This proposal would allow ultrasonic inspections only. This proposal is prompted by the greater availability of ultrasonic inspection equipment, which provides a more definitive means of discovering cracks than either visual inspections or FMPI. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent rupture of the CCOC, which could result in fire, engine cowl release, or aircraft damage. DATES: Comments must be received by March 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;81, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299. Comments may be inspected at this location between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
