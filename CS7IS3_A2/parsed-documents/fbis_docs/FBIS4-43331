The Labour party registered strong gains in its target seats in the Midlands and southern England. But the divided opposition to the Conservatives in the south appeared to have saved the government from the electoral "melt-down" predicted in some opinion polls. The protest vote against Mr Major's administration left Labour celebrating early victories in the symbolically important seat of Essex South, which embraces the Westminster constituency of Basildon, and in most of its top target seats. Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, said that the results had re-established, the party as the only real challenger to the Conservatives across the country. Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats won their first ever seat in the Strasbourg assembly, but the early signs were that their share of the vote had fallen substantially since last month's local elections. On the basis of BBC projections after 22 results, the Conservatives would have 29 per cent of the vote, Labour 43 per cent and the Liberal Democrats only 15 per cent. Labour, confident of winning more than two-thirds of the 84 British seats in the Strasbourg assembly, claimed that the election outcome marked the beginning of the end of the Conservatives' 15-year grip on power at Westminster. Despite the Liberal Democrats win, the surge in support for the party earlier this year was checked in the European poll by the strong rise in the Labour vote in southern England. That in turn allowed the Conservatives to retain control of some of its vulnerable seats. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, acknowledged the shift with the comment that "Labour has saved the Tories." Among the clutch of other early results the Conservatives held on to Wight and Hampshire South, one of the Liberal Democrats target seats. But it lost Somerset to the Liberal Democrats and Northants and Blaby, Norfolk and Leicester to Labour. Earlier, even before the votes were counted, sharp divisions in the Conservative party over Europe and Mr Major's leadership re-emerged as the government braced itself for the anticipated defeat. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, signalled the start of a concerted cabinet operation to shore up Mr Major's premiership. Mr Hurd, who defended Mr Major's strategy in the European campaign, said it would be "absolutely crazy" for the Conservatives to think about changing leader for the second time in four years. He told BBC Radio: "We have someone whom I believe to be an excellent prime minister." That view was echoed by Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, and Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, as the cabinet prepared for a backlash from disgruntled MPs when they return to Westminster tomorrow after the Whitsun recess. Characterising the European elections as the low point in the government's fortunes, Sir Norman held out the prospect that strengthening economic recovery would pave the way for tax cuts well before the general election due by mid-1997. But hopes that the party's warring factions would maintain the fragile truce which held during the European campaign were shattered by outspoken criticism of Mr Major from both the right and left. From the right the prime minister faced calls for a radical reshaping of the government's domestic policies combined with a toughening of the sceptical approach to Europe which featured in the campaign. But pro-Europeans, in a warning that Mr Major would depend crucially on their support if he was challenged for the leadership, said he must stop "appeasing" the Tory Euro-sceptics.
