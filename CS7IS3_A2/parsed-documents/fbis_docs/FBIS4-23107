FBIS TRENDS-15JUN94-UKRAINE Kuchma's Presidential Candidacy Divides Ukrainians Kuchma's Presidential Candidacy Divides Ukrainians SUMMARY As Ukraine approaches its 26 June presidential election, candidate Leonid Kuchma, with his clear pro-Russian identification, stands out as a frontrunner in many polls, but his candidacy sharply divides Ukrainians by region. Although Kuchma's program of economic change is vague--leaving it unclear if he would push economic reform or just defend industrialists' interests if elected--his themes of drawing closer to Russia and giving the Russian language a more or less equal status to Ukrainian evoke considerable enthusiasm in Krym (Crimea), Donetsk, Odesa, and other oblasts of the south and east, while antagonizing the west and Ukrainian nationalists. His stance on Krym is still ambiguous, and with only a week or so left before the election it is still unclear if he will soften his pro- Russian image significantly during the campaign to lessen west Ukrainian hostility to him. END SUMMARY Kuchma's stands favoring closer economic ties to Russia, raising the status of the Russian language, and giving up control of the Black Sea Fleet in return for Russian oil strike popular chords in the east and south and reinforce his support there. In May he stressed that Ukrainians depend 90 percent on Russia and should rent the Black Sea Fleet to Russia to get money for oil (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 31 May). On 2 June he bragged of signing the 1993 Russian-Ukrainian-Belarusian statement calling for an economic union in order to "have common prices and eliminate customs barriers" (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4 June) and complained that "Ukrainian media accused me of pro-Russian sentiments" (UNIAN, 3 June). He also said that the whole Black Sea Fleet, a "decrepit fleet" not needed by Ukraine, should be leased to Russia to get money to buy oil (Interfax, 3 June). Kuchma's pro-Russian positions have kept him on the defensive during his rare campaign visits to the west. In Lviv he was questioned about his "pro-Russian sentiments" and insisted he backed only economic union with Russia but "under no circumstances, political union" (Vysokyy Zamok, 12 April). In Ternopil on 7 June he denied accusations that he wants political union with Russia and a return to the ruble zone, stating that restoring the ruble zone would "lead to loss of sovereignty" (UNIAN, 8 June). Hostile media are suggesting that Kuchma is shifting his positions to fight off the accusations of being too pro-Russian. Molod Ukrainy on 31 May contended that he has stopped advocating federalism, acknowledging that it might lead to "26 Crimeas," and that he has changed from supporting to opposing return to the ruble zone. The article argued that his statements were "enough to baffle those present about who the real Kuchma is and who is the politician calculating how to get as many votes as possible in the election." Reporter Vyacheslav Pikhovshek argued in a 9 June Vybir News Agency item that Kuchma is now trying to play down his pro-Russian stance and has held talks with Rukh leaders, promising Rukh some key government posts if he is elected with their backing. Krym Although insisting that Krym should remain part of Ukraine, Kuchma's statements opposing Ukrainianization and arguing that more should be done for Krym please the Russophone population in Krym, who probably expect to find more sympathy in Kiev if he is elected. When the Crimean Supreme Soviet precipitated the latest Crimean-Ukrainian crisis by moving to restore its 1992 constitution calling for treaty relations with Ukraine, Kuchma tried to take the middle ground, insisting that Krym remain in Ukraine but expressing sympathy with Crimean demands and blaming Kiev leaders for the crisis. While defending Ukraine's territorial integrity and criticizing the Crimean Supreme Soviet for restoring the old constitution "without preliminary talks with Kiev," he argued that a treaty between Krym and Ukraine is "the only way to settle the conflict," insisted that use of force "should be fully excluded," and blamed the crisis on intrigues by "some Ukrainian political forces" and--apparently referring to Kravchuk--those who want an excuse to postpone the presidential election (Interfax in Krymskya Pravda, 28 May). Declaring that Ukraine's economic decline and distress are the basic causes for pro-independence agitation in Krym, he argued that the solution is to give Krym special status within Ukraine to speed up its economic development (UNIAR, 1 June). On 1 June he proposed in the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet to grant Krym the status of a free economic zone (Interfax, 1 June). In Odesa on 2 June he said "Crimeans must be given greater freedom within Ukraine" (UNIAN, 3 June). Moloda Halychyna on 7 June quoted Kuchma as saying that "the essence of the Crimean issue lies in the economy and not in politics" and that Krym's agitation is a result of Ukrainian economic collapse. To counter Kuchma's strong appeal in Krym the Kravchuk forces recently asserted that his actions as premier during 1992-93 had seriously damaged Krym. A 13 April Ukrainian cabinet statement blaming Kuchma's actions as premier for Ukraine's present economic decline in particular accused him of damaging Krym's wine industry by raising taxes on Crimean wine while lowering import duties on foreign wine and blocking development of leaseholding, which it said had become popular in Krym (Kiev radio, 13 April). Kuchma's Numerical Advantage Although polling organizations in Ukraine have not yet established a track record of accuracy, their polls clearly indicate that Kuchma is by far the most popular candidate in the east and south, the areas where his Interregional Bloc for Reforms (MBR) won Supreme Soviet seats during the March-April parliamentary elections. A 18-23 May poll of small samples in ten cities showed Kuchma well ahead in the three eastern and three southern cities included in the poll (see box). A 23-28 May poll by the International Institute of Sociology of 1,004 people in all 25 oblasts showed Kuchma outpolling President Leonid Kravchuk 34 percent to 12 percent in the east, 37 percent to 22 percent in the south, and 35 percent to 26 percent even in the central oblasts, while Kravchuk led Kuchma 40 percent to 3 percent in the west (Molod Ukrainy, 1O June). A June poll showed Kuchma leading in Mykolaiv with 23 percent to 19 percent for Kravchuk and 10 percent for Socialist-Communist candidate Oleksandr Moroz (Vecherniy Kiev, 9 June). Of all candidates collecting signatures in Mykolaiv to become candidates for president, Kuchma got the most (8,380), followed by Moroz (5,746), Education Minister Petro Talanchuk with 4,963, and Kravchuk with 4,011 (UNIAN, 13 May). Even with no support in the west, Kuchma has an advantage in that his strongholds in the east and south hold close to half of Ukraine's voters. Absolute vote totals by oblasts for the December 1991 presidential race and independence vote were not published, but one can get a sense of the proportions of voting strength of various regions by examining the allocation of Supreme Soviet seats, which are distributed on the basis of population. The east and south hold 220 of the 450 seats (152 in the east, 68 in the south)--46 percent. The west's seven oblasts, where nationalists and Kravchuk are strongest, have only 82 of the 450 seats--just 18 percent. Kiev city, which tends to vote for nationalists also, has 23 seats, which if added to the west raises the total for nationalistic areas to 105, or 23 percent. The main hope for Kravchuk and the nationalists is to run strong in the many central oblasts, which have 125 seats- -about 28 percent of the total. Polls for Ukraine overall usually show Kuchma ahead or close behind Kravchuk. A nationwide poll of 1,200 people in April showed 18 percent backing Kuchma, with Kravchuk second at 11 percent (Interfax, 30 April). The 23-28 May poll showed 27 percent for Kravchuk nationwide, 20 percent for Kuchma, 11 percent for Moroz, 6 percent for reform economist Volodymyr Lanovyy, and 4 percent for former Supreme Soviet Chairman Ivan Plyushch (Kyivskaya Pravda, 7 June; Demokratychna Ukraina, 9 June). Asked whom they would vote for in a Kravchuk-Kuchma runoff, 37 percent of the respondents chose Kravchuk and 32 percent Kuchma, while 17 percent said they would vote against both. Outlook With Kravchuk's popularity falling as his government takes virtually no action to counter the continuing deterioration of Ukraine's economy, Kuchma, one of Kravchuk's harshest critics, has become a spokesman for the disaffected east and south and one of the most likely to do well in the presidential race. Although he may have softened some of his divisive stands, it still is not clear if he will try to reach out to the west Ukraine and nationalists during the remaining days of the campaign or choose to try to win over their determined opposition, and thus exacerbate Ukraine's regional divisions. BEGIN BOX Mid-May Presidential Poll in Ten Cities A poll of 100-120 respondents in each of ten cities taken by the BOB [expansion unknown] Sociological Center during 18-23 May showed Kuchma leading in six cities, Kravchuk in only three, while economic reformer Volodymyr Lanovyy led in Kiev (Post- Postup, 26 May-2 June, and 3-9 June). Kuchma Kravchuk Moroz Plyushch Lanovyy East Donetsk 40% 15% 13% 8% 7% Kharkiv 30% 4% 14% 0 12% Zaporizhzhya 15% 5% 2% 1% 3% South Mykolaiv 26% 22% 12% 10% 6% Odesa 29% 10% 10% 5% 19% Sevastopol 38% 3% 3% 0 3% West Lviv 7% 50% 3% 5% 8% Uzhhorod 17% 22% 7% 5% 4% Center Kiev 21% 16% 8% 9% 23% Poltava 15% 26% 3% 7% 23% A 22-27 April survey by the same organization in Kiev, Lviv, Donetsk, Odesa, and Kharkiv published in the 29 April-6 May Post- Postup showed roughly similar results, although at that time Kravchuk led in Kiev with 19 percent to Kuchma's 18 percent and Lanovyy's 14 percent; Lviv respondents gave Kravchuk 36 percent, economic reformer Viktor Pynzenyk (who has since withdrawn) 30 percent, Plyushch 16 percent, and Lanovyy 12 percent, and Kharkiv respondents gave Kuchma 26 percent, Kravchuk 22 percent, Plyushch 11 percent, Lanovyy 9 percent, and Moroz 5 percent.
