FBIS4-9172 "dreeu078_y_94004" FBIS-EEU-94-078 Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 YUGOSLAVIA Serbia Oppression of Sandzak Muslims Documented Oppression of Sandzak Muslims Documented 94BA0240A Zagreb VJESNIK in Serbo-Croatian 30 Mar 94 p 9 94BA0240A Zagreb VJESNIK Serbo-Croatian CSO [Article by Ivkica Bacic: "Strike Wherever You Can"] [Text] Belgrade (From VJESNIK's permanent correspondent) -- Electric shock, beating with billy clubs on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet, sexual abuse with a stick, the beating of bound arrestees, the striking of all parts of the body with metal objects, the binding of arrestees to objects which prevent movement, pressure, rubbing the ears, karate blows to sensitive parts of the body--these are only some of the cruel methods in the excessively rich repertoire of abuse and harassment to which Sandzak Muslims have been exposed in Serbian prisons from the end of last year to March of this year. The Belgrade Fund for Humanitarian Law the other day presented to the public extensive documentation giving testimony to systematic torture of Muslims by state agencies of Serbia, most of all those in Novi Pazar, Sjenica, and neighboring villages, who for months have been the victims of extraordinary police violence, who have been imprisoned and arrested without any pretext whatsoever, even without warranted suspicion that they had broken the law in any way. The fund's representatives, led by Natasa Kandic, have visited Sandzak several times and talked to Muslims who are the victims of police violence solely because of their nationality and religion, whose elementary human and civil rights have been threatened to such a degree that Natasa Kandic did not hesitate to say in a recent news conference that it is a question of large-scale systematic violation of their rights that "can be compared only to what people have been experiencing in the bloody Bosnian war." Provinces Swallowed Up Those words of hers, backed up by the statements of the harassed Muslims (some of them have even complained to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who then ordered Police Minister Zoran Sokolovic to see "internally" what his subordinates are doing in Sandzak), certainly have not been made public in any government medium (something was written only by BORBA), presumably in order not to disturb the ceremonial atmosphere that prevails in Serbia because of 28 March, proclaimed Statehood Day. It was that day five years ago that "Serbia again became a state," as all the media euphorically recalled on Monday when they carried the comment for the occasion from the state agency TANJUG. It was on that day in 1989 that Serbia changed its constitution, that is, swallowed up the two provinces (which had been constituent parts of the former six-member federation), threatening the former Yugoslav republics with that same "constitutional ingestion," all of this under Milosevic's well-known slogan "Serbia will be whole or it will not exist," which was in fact the beginning of the war, an unambiguous announcement of what by the force of arms has been represented as "Serbian defense of its own" these past four years. In the TANJUG comment, this is referred to as "the tough struggle of Serbia, its leadership, and a great majority of the people for sovereignty," for "integrity of the state from Horgos to Dragas," a struggle without which Serbia "would perhaps now be even smaller than Serbia proper, reduced only to the Belgrade Pashaluk," TANJUG concluded. "Expel, Kill..." And that "Serbia wanted nothing but equality with the other nationalities and republics," as indicated by the documentation of the fund referred to, which proves with numerous examples that Serbia is not only not a civil state, as its constitution states, but is markedly discriminatory "from Horgos to Dragas," to the detriment of all except the Serbs, specifically those Serbs who "represent statehood." Many among the Muslims from Novi Pazar and Sjenica (just from the end of January to the end of February of this year, there were more than 400 of them in prison) were arrested in the drive to confiscate arms like the one in Prijepolje, during which the alleged arms were sought only from the Muslims, a practice, as asserted by the staff members of the fund, that encourages the Serbs and Montenegrins to continue to arm themselves. There is evidence of this in the fact that the government agencies have done nothing concerning the datum made public that at least 7,000 members of Seselj's party are armed (a statement by Zivota Panic, former top man in the Yugoarmy). But on the other hand, even those Muslims not found to be possessing arms or those who possessed arms with proper permits (most were in this category) were exposed to unprecedented torture by Sokolovic's police, who as they beat them called them "backward Muslim peasants, Turks, mojahedins," for whom "there is no place in Serbia" and who should be "driven out or killed," as stated in the extensive report of the Belgrade Fund for Humanitarian Law.
