For the time being, it should be emphasized that no such decision has been announced in any of the condemnations issued by the PLO. A member of the Israeli team to talks with the PLO said that the incident will harm the peace process, but it must not be stopped. The senior political source said that the horrible massacre must not play into the hands of the extremists who are opposed to the political process. We were told by this source: We could have many reasons, after every terrorist action or murder in the territories, to stop the discussions with the PLO, but it would be a terrible mistake to suspend the talks. The General Staff and defense establishment have held deliberations and engaged in situation assessments over the last few hours. The chief of staff instructed the cancellation of all vacations of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] commanders and Civil Administration heads. Military elements say that commanders have been instructed to avoid violent friction with the residents of the territories, but at the same time, to maintain law and order at all costs and to prevent a deterioration of the security situation. It has been reported that Israeli medical teams are aiding the wounded Palestinians.
