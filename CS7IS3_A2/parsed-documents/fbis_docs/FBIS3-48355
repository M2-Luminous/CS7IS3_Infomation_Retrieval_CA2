FBIS3-48355 "dreas016_c_94019" FBIS-EAS-94-016 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Jan 1994 North Korea Radio Denounces Japan Defense Adviser's Remarks SK2201025194 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1505 GMT 21 Jan 94 SK2201025194 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1505 GMT 21 Jan 94 Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [Text] According to a report, Sakuma, an adviser to the Japanese Defense Agency, made bellicose remarks that in the case of an emergency on the Korean peninsula, Japan cannot help but do something for South Korea, and that it must look into coming up with plans on how to cooperate with the U.S. Forces. His grave remarks greatly agitate us and are an open challenge to us that cannot be forgiven. These remarks clearly show the Japanese reactionaries' criminal attempt to invade our country again. The Japanese right-wing reactionaries have defined us as their first imaginary [kasangjok] enemy by babbling about our non- existent nuclear issue and missile threat. Also, they have made bellicose and absurd remarks by talking about a so-called preemptive attack and saying that Japan would participate in a war on the Korean peninsula. Warmonger Sakuma, who even served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Japanese Self-Defense Armed Forces, made the bellicose and violent remarks once again under these circumstances. This clearly shows the seriousness of the Japanese reactionaries' move to seek an opportunity to invade Korea again. The Japanese reactionaries' such move is of concern to us because Japan wants to act as a shock brigade backed by the United States. This was proven by the fact that Sakuma loudly babbled about cooperating with U.S. forces or providing it with Japanese aid. While DPRK-U.S. contacts have opened the prospect for basically resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, Japan has been looking for an opportunity to attack us with the backing of our partner in dialogue. Where else on earth can we find such indiscriminate remarks and acts? However, the Japanese reactionaries are miscalculating. They must fully remember that their indiscriminate maneuvers will bring them miserable results. Therefore, they must not act recklessly.
