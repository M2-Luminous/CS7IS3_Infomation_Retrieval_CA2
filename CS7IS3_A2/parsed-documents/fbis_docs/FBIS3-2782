"I believe that Sino-U.S. trade will continue," Qian told journalists after his second meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher who leaves here Monday at the end of a frosty four-day visit that has focused on the human rights issue. "There is no such thing of China implementing U.S. orders and laws," said Qian, reiterating Beijing's opposition to Washington's linkage of improvements in China's human rights record to this year's renewal of Beijing's most-favoured-nation (MFN) status. "China is opposed to linking MFN and human rights. China and the U.S. have different human rights concepts. It's worthless to put pressure on human rights," he said. Despite Washington's warning and condemnation of a recent round-up of some 15 dissidents, the Chinese side has all along appeared confident that the United States would not dare jeopardise its lucrative commercial ties with China by withdrawing MFN. Qian did not announce any major progress in resolving the two sides differences, saying only that they had signed an agreement setting out guidelines for the implementation of a 1992 memorandum of understanding (MOU) on prison labour exports. Washington has complained that China has failed to observe the MOU. Monday's agreement promises rapid arrangement of visits by U.S. teams to Chinese prisons suspected of producing goods for export. The two sides also decided to establish a joint military commission to develop cooperation in this area, Qian announced.
