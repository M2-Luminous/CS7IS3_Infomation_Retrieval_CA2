Economic and trade cooperation between China and Russia has its geographical superiority and is economically complementary, Hu Chusheng, minister-level economic and commercial counsellor at the Chinese Embassy in Russia, told XINHUA and ITAR-TASS reporters on the eve of Chernomyrdin's trip to Beijing. Sino-Russian trade, developed on the basis of Sino-Soviet trade, is growing rapidly with a great potential, Hu said. According to the counsellor, the volume of Sino-Russian trade was 7.68 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, compared with 5.6 billion dollars in 1992. The Sino-Soviet trade turnover in 1991 was only 3.8 billion dollars. Hu attributed the thriving bilateral trade to the stimulative policies adopted by the two governments, especially to the preferences granted to each other regarding trade. On the geographical superiority, the counsellor said that there is little difference between the CIF [cost, insurance, and freight] and FOB [free on board] prices because the two countries are so close to each other. As a result, an average of 30 dollars is saved for one ton of freight, he said. On the complementary nature of Sino-Russian trade, Hu said Russia's heavy industrial products such as automobiles and planes are welcomed in China while Chinese light industrial goods sell well in Russia. The counsellor was optimistic over the future development of bilateral trade, saying that he agreed to the prediction made by Russian businessmen that the annual volume of trade between China and Russia will surpass 10 billion dollars. It is very hard to achieve the goal this year as the volume of delivery dropped by more than 50 percent in the first two months this year over the same period last year, he stressed. Hu attributed the fall to the delay in signing some inter- governmental trade protocols, higher import taxes imposed by Russia and its new arrangement in granting visas. He believed that all these issues can be resolved through consultations. He expressed the hope that Chinese and Russian businessmen will deepen their mutual understanding and trust as bilateral economic and trade cooperation grows.
