This group has had to adjust to short-term, uncertain jobs. Meanwhile, there have been unemployment periods of varying length. Income consists sometimes of wages, sometimes of income transfers, or sometimes of work performed in gray markets. A diminishing group of people in the export industry or firms successfully operating in domestic markets enjoy income from secure wages. When the Labor Ministry announces that there were 524,300 jobless at the end of February, it is only slicing a momentary random sample from the existing number. In fact, over a million Finns applied for work last year at the Employment Office. Of that number 768,834 were unemployed at least part of the time. In Suikkanen's opinion, it no longer pays to talk of those who are working or those who are not. Instead of two groups, four groups that completely differ from one another have arisen: the lucky ones, those who live in uncertainty, those who have been ousted from the labor market, and the newcomers who are waiting for an opportunity. So the labor market has changed, but social security and social policy have not. "Our social security system is designed to protect the interests of people who have jobs that pay a regular wage during periods of illness or of brief unemployment. It simply does not take into account the circumstances of other groups." Suikkanen does not think that an upswing will alter the situation; on the contrary, it has become a permanent one. He would also revise income transfers to be flexible and simple. Since people's situations vary, the same solution does not work for everyone. Laying people off should be avoided, and those who have been laid off should be put back to work. Suikkanen suggests that one way of doing this would be to divide the work the way the Danes, for example, do: Three local employees and one unemployed worker share the work equally. Wages and per diem allowances are added up and each of them gets one-fourth of the total. Each gets every fourth week off. There are already signs in Europe of a willingness to share the decreasing number of jobs with several other workers. At the Volkswagen Corporation, for example, working hours were shortened and wages lowered for three years so that 30,000 jobs could be preserved during these years. Suikkanen thinks that the whole uniform wage society will begin to break down unless the changes are interfered with through social policy measures. The next parliamentary elections will indicate whether citizens who have been shunted to the sidelines have begun to revolt. People's attitude toward taxes has already changed: Business firms and households' delinquent taxes have increased. Uncertainty and reduced wage income are affecting everyone's life. Starting a family is postponed, renting one's home is becoming widespread, and pension accrual is decreasing. New life-styles have now come into being. People do volunteer work or fill the gap left between wage work and social security by doing odd jobs in gray markets. The drop in income is also apparent as households' indebtedness: People are not always able to pay bills that are part of everyday life on time. "Maybe we won't recognize the fact that the change is permanent before the end of the decade. Most of the influential research institutes still believe that economic cycles will patch things up. Only from 10 to 20 researchers are trying to talk of new solutions to the problem."
