Lithuania and Russia signed in 1992 a protocol and a timetable for troop withdrawal, but did not conclude any framework agreement to regulate the issue. "The Estonian Government doesn't intend to make any concessions to Russia," Laar emphasized in the interview with BNS. In the premier's view, Russia's failure to propose a date for the next round of talks in essence means suspension of the negotiations. "We are ready for talks and prepared to discuss all questions in a constructive spirit," Laar told BNS. The prime minister said the withdrawal of Russian troops has come to a virtual standstill in recent months and that about 2,500 troops still remain in Estonia. The prime minister claimed Russia lacks the slightest wish to reach agreement and sign the prepared troop withdrawal accord. Vasily Svirin, Russia's top negotiator, declared after the end of the latest round of talks that Russia will sign the agreement on the troop pullout only in a package with the accord on social guarantees for military retirees. He referred to the respective Latvian-Russian agreements initialed on 30 April.
