Russian Federation Presidential Edicts Initiate Them"] [Text] A lot of water has passed under the bridge since Russia was declared a land of reform. Whole oceans have flowed by while our legislators have waffled. The Russian Government (in one form or another) has repeatedly attempted to channel these reforms in the main direction -- that of improving the economy, boosting production, strengthening the country's power, and enhancing the people's prosperity. But, alas, the planned results have not been achieved. Throughout these years many Russian and foreign specialists, assessing the Russian leadership's practical policy, have repeatedly noted its contradictory and inconsistent nature in the economic sphere. Industrial production, particularly in relation to high-tech and labor-intensive output and to sectors ensuring our economic and defense might, has steadily fallen, depressed by various crises. The country is getting close to a situation where the economy, as the head of state recognizes, is on the verge of collapse. Only one thing can save it -- slowly transferring the reforms to the production sphere. Under these conditions the action taken by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who has signed a package of highly important edicts (on the abolition of quotas and the licensing of goods for export; on certain issues of fiscal policy; on the reform of state enterprises; on additional measures to normalize transactions; on the restoration of tax payment discipline; and on the consolidation of the Highways Fund into the Russian Federation budget) may be of decisive importance. In the opinion of experts, the first five of these edicts should have a decisive impact on the situation in Russia. The lifting of export quotas, for instance, should stimulate the further liberalization of Russian exports and remove the administrative barriers in the way of exporter enterprises. But this does not mean that the mechanism for monitoring their activity will be destroyed. The system of foreign exchange controls will continue to operate, and the institution of specialized exporters will be maintained and could even be strengthened in the future. Quite clearly, enterprises themselves can count on a lowering of export tariffs, which will have a favorable impact on their business. The second edict instructs the Russian Federation Government to submit draft laws to the Federal Assembly which would reduce the number of taxes and make it possible to lower the main taxes -- income tax and value-added tax -- by 10-20 percent on average. This measure is very necessary, since enterprises are being crushed by the burden of taxation, which makes it harder for their output to compete in the world market, rendering it inordinately expensive. This edict also establishes concessionary taxation for enterprises using foreign capital and engaged in the production sphere. Sanctions have also been tightened up against enterprises owned by the federal government which violate the state's rights as their owner. Currently the leaders of certain state enterprises are very actively manipulating funds and budget resources for their own interests -- for instance, federal appropriations are "put to work" on the interbank market, and the profits go straight into the pockets of the tricksters. Enterprises discovered to be acting in this way and not due for privatization will be immediately redesignated as treasury-funded [kazennyye] (the most stringent form of state ownership). The measures to normalize transactions envisage the introduction of strict chronological sequence [kalendarnaya ocherednost] being followed for payments from current accounts. If, say, an enterprise has no funds in its ruble accounts, it is obliged to convert money from its foreign-currency accounts and settle up with the other party. I think that even if this measure does not end the growth in mutual nonpayments between enterprises -- which is forcing many of them into extremely difficult positions -- it will at least stop the problem getting any worse. For entirely understandable reasons, the military are particularly interested in whether these edicts will be able to improve the situation in the defense industry. It is no secret that, for various reasons, the military department sometimes cannot even afford the output of military-industrial complex enterprises, and it owes the defense industry a lot of money. As for mutual nonpayments between enterprises -- it is hard to calculate just who owes whom how much. Add to this the pressure of the tax burden and it is clear that if this situation persists for a while longer, we run the risk of witnessing the wholesale bankruptcy of Russian arms, combat hardware, and systems producers. Almost 80 percent of military-industrial complex enterprises have already reached this point, and the number of potential bankruptcies is growing. We must assume that the signing of the aforesaid edicts will improve the condition of the severely ailing defense sector. But specialists believe that a full recovery will only come about when the first set of "healing" edicts is backed up by new ones. In complete agreement with this, it seems, is Aleksandr Lifshits, leader of the president's group of experts, who stated that the main task is to keep inflation reasonable and switch the reforms to the sphere of production -- the very sphere that forms the foundations of our power, the improvement of the economy, and the implementation of the reform program as a whole. The Russian Government, we understand, has so far received only an incomplete "guidance document." But even this is already a considerable normative basis for stimulating the reform process -- a process which the country's parliament was, regrettably, unable to come up with in good time.
