Clinton sounded the clarion call for joint action among the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations as he opened a G-7 ministerial conference to examine why job security and high wages appear hard to reconcile in much of the industrial world. [passage omitted on Clinton remarks] In industrial Europe, workers are cushioned by generous welfare perks, but the jobless rates have stuck in double digits. Even in Japan, a country known for its low unemployment rates, the government is considering broad restructuring in order to protect the so-called "lifetime" employment system. "At a time when vast changes are taking place in industries and at a time when workers too are changing their way of thinking, we too should realize there will be more labor movement across companies and industries in Japan over the long run," Japan's Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi told the G-7 jobs conference. Japan also urged its G-7 partners to maintain "sound macroeconomic policies and the multilateral trade system" in order to create more jobs. The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, represented in the G-7 jobs conference by Parliamentary Vice Trade Minister Otohiko Endo, also proposed easing government regulations, making capital more readily accessible to entrepreneurs, and expanding job-skills training, as answers to job creation. But Clinton acknowledged that there are no easy answers. "We are here because we have something to learn from each other and, hopefully, something to teach each other," Clinton said in his opening speech. No binding policy statement will be issued by the jobs conference, which is largely a closed-door forum among G-7 finance, economic and labor ministers. During four separate discussion sessions, spread over two days, the G-7 ministers were expected to discuss a vast range of labor-related issues, ranging from the impact of macroeconomic policies to the structure of the labor systems in each of the G-7 member countries. The exercise, Clinton said, should help produce a "real agenda" when the G-7 heads of state and government head to Italy in July for their annual summit meeting.
