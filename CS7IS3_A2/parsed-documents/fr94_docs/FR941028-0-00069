FR941028-0-00069 FR941028-0-00009 Withdrawal of former proposed ยง773.25 which would have provided procedures for challenging ownership or control links prior to entry in AVS. In the September, 1991 proposal, OSM proposed a rule to provide procedures for challenging ownership or control links prior to entry in AVS. That proposal which was numbered as proposed ยง773.25 represented OSM's attempt to go beyond the Constitutional requirements of due process. The proposal would have prospectively required OSM or a State regulatory authority to provide notice to those persons who were actively involved in surface coal mining operations and who were linked to a violation through ownership or control before such link information would be used to subject them to permit denial through AVS. Such persons would then have had an opportunity to challenge such information. Upon further consideration, OSM has decided to withdraw the proposed regulation. OSM believes that adequate due process rights to notice and an opportunity to be heard are afforded by current practices which permit a challenge to ownership or control and violation information after it is incorporated into AVS. Such challenges can be made currently both within the context of a permit application and independent of such an application. OSM believes that these opportunities suffice to pass constitutional muster. See Preamble to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38885 (``Due Process Provided'') and at page 38879 (``Procedures to Amend Applicant Violator System Information'') (October 3, 1988). Further, the Department's OHA is contemporaneously adopting a rule providing for temporary relief from an ownership or control link, under specified conditions. Such a rule significantly enhances the already available due process protections available to the members of the regulated community. The risk that someone will be inappropriately subjected to a permit block due to an erroneous link is substantially mitigated by the temporary relief procedures available before OHA. Moreover, the proposed rule would have subjected OSM and State regulatory authorities to a substantial paperwork morass as a condition precedent to implementing the provisions of ยง510(c) of the Act. OSM, which has been utilizing procedures similar to those proposed in the September, 1991, rule, discovered that the process was taking substantial amounts of time and resources to implement. The dialogue and paper exchange between the agency and persons debating the proposed ownership or control link was a prolonged exercise lasting, in some cases, for many months. Also, OSM was finding that most of these debates made no difference in the ultimate outcome, except where entities refuted the facts which would invoke a link. Typically, the ownership or control link was found to be well taken. The prolonged debate was preventing accurate information from being incorporated into AVS. During the period of the dialogue, the individual or entity subject to the ownership or control link was not relieved of the cloud of the potential link and the agency was not able to directly implement the link. Neither OSM nor the person challenging the link benefited by this course of events. Further, industry, environmental advocates, and representatives of State regulatory authorities were dissatisfied with the proposed rule. Industry commenters condemned the proposed rule as providing insufficient due process for challengers of ownership or control links. Environmental advocates criticized the proposal as deficient in not providing a set time frame for OSM to bring ownership or control decisions to closure and to incorporate such decisions into AVS. A commenter representing State regulatory authorities asserted that the proposed rules should either provide for no challenge of an ownership or control link prior to permit denial or for conditional issuance of a permit pending full challenge of an ownership or control link. As is stated above in the portion of this preamble captioned ``Due Process,'' OSM is unwilling, for a number of significant reasons, to accept that permits may be conditioned upon the appeal of ownership or control links. Nevertheless, the criticisms of the commenter representing the State regulatory authorities, the industry commenters, and the environmental advocacy groups also caused OSM to reconsider the proposed rules.
