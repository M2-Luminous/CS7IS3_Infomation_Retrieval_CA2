In a televised speech last night, President Salih said unity was a fact of life and that any thinking of secession is out of the question. He said it will not happen no matter what the price will be. President Salih indirectly accused Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party of heightening military tensions. He said he warned those who insist on this course that they will pay the price. He said a joint Yemeni-Jordanian and Omani military committee, which also includes the U.S. and French military attaches in Sanaa, was working to end the military tension and for the return of forces to their original bases.
