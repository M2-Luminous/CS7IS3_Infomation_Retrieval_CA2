During his visit to China last year, Chancellor Kohl surprised leading diplomats with his statement that another consulate should be established in Canton. Since Genscher's time in office, the idea of a consulate has appeared in diplomatic reports. This additional diplomatic representation is not necessary because, as a high-ranking German diplomat in China said: "Based in Canton, our economic interests will not be considered for a long time to come." According to a diplomatic message, it would be possible neither to find suitable rooms there nor to promote economic interests, because German companies still conduct business from Hong Kong and intend to carry on doing so. Following the completion of the new highway, Hong Kong is only two hours from Canton. The German diplomats' argument is that two German consulates would be a waste of money. This would appear to be borne out by the fact that France, which was the only European country with a consulate in Canton until it was closed following weapons deliveries to Taiwan, has decided not to reopen its representation there. A new German consulate in central and southwestern China (Wuhan or Chengdu) would be much more sensible than two neighboring consulates in south China and that is something that business circles have pointed out. Hong Kong, according to top diplomatic reports, will remain a "catalyst" for the development of China and even more so after the transfer of the territory to China in 1997. Diplomats, as well as business people, will be able to work on southern China from Hong Kong. What the report states with resignation is: "We now have to implement the chancellor's decision against our will."
