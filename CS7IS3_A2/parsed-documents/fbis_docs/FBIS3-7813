Our Bonn correspondent, Jiri Halousek, has more information. [Halousek] The Foreign Committee delegation is formed by 10 deputies from our Chamber of Deputies. The delegation was received by Hans Stercken, chairman of the Bundestag Foreign Committee, this morning. He told me after the first round of talks that, besides a number of shared views and interests, there were also some issues that were left open in the Czech-German agreement. Although these issues cannot be resolved within two weeks, we have to have a plan on the basis of which we can resolve them. The deputies should take a more active part in setting up this plan. Jiri Payne, chairman of the Czech Foreign Committee, summed up his first impressions with these words. [Begin Payne recording] I must say that, surprisingly, we have assured each other that both sides were interested in new contacts. I think that this is a good start for our talks in the approaching days. [end recording] [Halousek] This afternoon, our deputies delegation visited the Defense Ministry in Bonn. The deputies were received by Deputy Defense Minister Bernd Wilz, who said after the meeting: [Begin Wilz recording in German, fading into Czech translation] I believe that the NATO Partnership for Peace proposal is at present the right thing to do in the interest of the two countries--the Czech Republic and Germany--and the whole NATO Alliance. Of course, our long-term goal is equal security to all in Europe. [end recording] [Halousek] Bernd Wilz went on to say that the agreement on military cooperation between the two countries had already been signed, that Czech officers had been studying at military schools in Germany for four years now, and that good relations had developed between [military] units in the border area. It will be possible to launch joint military exercises, although their relevant legal basis still needs to be set up.
