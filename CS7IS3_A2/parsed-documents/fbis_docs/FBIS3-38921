The spokesman said: Greece is a just state and fully respects human rights. Turkey is neither concerned nor interested in alleged violations of the Muslim minority's human rights in Greece. It is merely seeking excuses, encouraging nationalistic extremism, distorting situations and facts, and unhesitatingly using the minority issue, obviously realizing the damage done to Greek-Turkish relations and stability in the region.
