Mr. Landyk also gave a negative assessment of the role of the former government of Russia, blaming Gaydar and Fedorov for attempts to crush Ukraine economically. "Possibly, the new appointments will benefit Ukraine," he said. He also said that the government will continue to provide credit for agriculture, "because one can live if there is something to eat." In the opinion of Valentyn Landyk, the crediting of agriculture will not lead to a new emission of currency; the government will not allow that to happen. The money owed by commercial banks to the National Bank of Ukraine could become a source of credit. The problems of credit do not only depend on the government. We are holding talks toward that end with the National Bank of Ukraine, Landyk stated. For example, in the first quarter alone the Bank "Ukrayina" has to return 2.5 trillion coupons. The overall debt for the credits granted by the National Bank is [words indistinct]. The debtors are mostly banks and enterprises and, of course, the debts of the countryside which, in the opinion of Landyk, could be paid off with grain. The deputy prime minister said: "We are in favor of reform and liberalization; however, not everything should be `let go'. Regulation is still necessary."
