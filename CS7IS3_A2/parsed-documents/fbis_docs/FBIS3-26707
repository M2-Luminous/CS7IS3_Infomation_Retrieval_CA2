They brought with them new year's greetings from the CPC Central Committee and the State Council to Sichuan's 100 million people. During their stay in Sichuan, Comrade Zhu Rongji attended a spring festival group greetings ceremony sponsored by Sichuan Province and Chongqing City. He met with and extended cordial greetings to local party, government, and military leaders as well as retired veteran comrades and fully affirmed the achievements made by Sichuan Province in all fields in recent years. He said that not only did Sichuan rapidly develop its economy last year, but it also quite satisfactorily handled the relationship between reform and development and stability. He urged the province to seize the opportunity to deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability in the new year to win greater victories. During the inspection tour, Zhu Rongji and his party also went down to factory workshops and research institutes to pay new year's calls on workers and research personnel working on the front line of production. They also joined plant managers in offering "group diagnosis" to enterprises having difficulties. On the afternoon of 6 February, Zhu Rongji and his party arrived at the Chongqing No. 1 Cotton Mill, where he held a "forum for difficult enterprises," which was attended by plant directors and managers of nine difficult enterprises. Comrade Zhu Rongji earnestly listened to the plant directors and managers on their situations and analyzed the causes of their problems and difficulties. He pointed out: The first thing we must do to build a modern enterprise system is to separate enterprises from the government. The government must not command enterprises blindly; enterprises shall make their own decisions regarding operations and management. Plant directors shall take responsibility for mistakes. All this should be institutionalized to allow supervision by the workers. Those enterprises with liabilities greater than assets and without any hope of stopping losses should go bankrupt on a trial basis and then undertake reorganization to begin a new life. Zhu Rongji also pointed out: Reform of the social insurance system is essential to a smooth shift of the operating mechanism and the safeguard of social stability at the same time. Zhu Rongji encouraged directors of difficult enterprises, saying: Difficulties are only temporary; the future is bright. Temporary difficulties can definitely be resolved step by step. While state policies will be instrumental to resolving problems, enterprises must rely primarily on themselves to regenerate through self-reliance and hard struggle, through market research and new products development, and through strengthened management and the change of operating mechanism. Enterprises must direct their attention inward to improve internal management. At present, special attention must be paid to the workers' livelihood to ensure their basic livelihood and the stability of society. He Chunlin, Chen Jinhua, Wang Zhongyu, Gu Xiulian, Yu Zhen, Li Yanling, Dai Xianglong, Li Yizhong, Pan Liansheng (3382 5571 3932), and Zhang Xianghai accompanied Zhu Rongji in his inspection of Sichuan.
