This has been announced by Ondrej Kvacek of the Czech National Bank Public Relations Department. The figure of more than 391 million korunas approximately equals 11.5 million ECU's, which is less than a tenth of the permitted level of 130 million ECU's. During the year that this level has been in effect, it was exceeded twice--in December 1993 by 40.2 million ECU's and in January 1994 by 46.1 million ECU's--and each time the Slovak party paid the difference in convertible currency in time.
