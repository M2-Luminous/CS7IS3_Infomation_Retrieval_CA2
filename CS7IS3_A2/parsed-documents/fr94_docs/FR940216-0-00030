FR940216-0-00030 FR940216-0-00008 Assumed halibut mortality rates for halibut PSC bycatch in 1994 are similar to those used in 1993 and are unchanged from those established in the proposed specifications. These rates are listed in Table 7 and reflect mandatory careful release measures implemented during 1993 (58 FR 28799, May 17, 1993). Further information on halibut mortality can be found in the November SAFE report. NMFS has determined that the Council's recommendation for the seasonal apportionments of the Pacific halibut PSC to gear types and the assumed mortality rates are appropriate and is implementing the Council's recommendations. Table 7._1994 Assumed Pacific Halibut Mortality Rates for Vessels Fishing in the Gulf of Alaska With Mandatory Careful Release Measures [Table Values are Percent of Halibut Bycatch Assumed to be Dead] 1Gear and target 1Observed vessels 1Unobserved vessels Hook-and-line: Sablefish 14.0 17.0 Other targets 11.5 14.0 Trawl: Pelagic pollock 75.0 75.0 Rockfish, shallow water flatfish, ``other spp.,'' Atka mackerel 60.0 60.0 Pacific cod, non-pelagic pollock, deep water flats, rex sole 55.0 55.0 Pot: All targets 5.0 5.0 Opening Date of the Directed Fishery for Sablefish for Hook-and-Line Gear Under regulations at ยง672.23(c), the opening date for the directed fishing season for sablefish with hook-and-line gear is the calendar day from May 9 through May 22 upon which the tide with the smallest tidal range occurs. According to annual tide tables published by NOAA for 1994, this date is May 18, 1994. Therefore, in accordance with ยง672.23 (b) and (c), the season will commence at 12:00 noon, Alaska local time, May 18, 1994. Responses to Comments Written comments on the proposed 1994 specifications and other management measures were requested until December 10, 1993. No written comments were received on the specifications as proposed. Classification This action apportions reserves to DAP fisheries on a date other than those specified in ยง672.20(d)(i). The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, finds that it is necessary to waive the opportunity for prior public comment provided by the regulations to prevent premature closure of the fishery. In accordance with ยง672.20(d)(5)(iv), comments are invited on the reserve apportionments as noted in `` DATES '' above.
