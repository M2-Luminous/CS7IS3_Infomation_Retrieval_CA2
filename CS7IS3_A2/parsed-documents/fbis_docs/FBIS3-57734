The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army Headquarters has reported that fierce battles are going on in the north of Kelbadzharskiy Rayon, along the Seydlar, Chatly, and Kamyshly line. The Azerbaijani side has sent a large force to the front and, despite huge losses, is still trying to break through the defensive line of the Karabakh fighters at any cost. The Karabakh side first checked the relentless pressure before launching a counter-attack, sending the enemy back. There are losses on both sides. Casualty figures are being determined. The situation is also tense in Mardakertskiy Rayon, where fierce fighting is taking place near Tonashen. Only positional exchanges of fire are occurring on the rest of the war fronts.
