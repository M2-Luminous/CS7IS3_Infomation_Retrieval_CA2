ADDRESSES: Written comments should be submitted to Director, Information Services Division, Office of Thrift Supervision, 1700 G Street, NW., Washington, DC 20552, Attention: Docket No. 94&hyph;252.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Eliot Goldstein, Senior Enforcement Counsel, Division of Enforcement, Chief Counsel's Office (202/906&hyph;7162); or Karen Osterloh, Counsel, Banking and Finance, Regulations and Legislation Division, Chief Counsel's Office (202/906&hyph;6639), Office of Thrift Supervision, 1700 G Street, NW., Washington, DC 20552. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background In August, 1991, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board of Governors), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) adopted Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure for agency adjudicatory proceedings. (OTS, 56 FR 38302, Aug. 12, 1991; OCC, 56 FR 38024, Aug. 9, 1991; Board of Governors, 56 FR 38048, Aug. 9, 1991; FDIC, 56 FR 37968, Aug. 9, 1991; and NCUA, 56 FR 37762, Aug. 8, 1991). The OTS codified these uniform rules in its Rules of Practice and Procedure in Adjudicatory Proceedings at 12 CFR Part 509, Subpart A. In this Notice, the OTS is proposing to amend one aspect of its rules relating to ex parte communications to clarify that the rules parallel the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The other banking agencies are issuing identical proposals. Currently, ยง509.9 prohibits ``a party, his or her counsel, or another interested person'' from making an ex parte communication to the Director or other decisional official concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding. When the uniform rules were proposed and adopted in 1991, the joint notice of proposed rulemaking (56 FR 27790, 27793, June 17, 1991) explained that the proposed rule regarding ex parte communications ``adopts the rules and procedures set forth in the APA regarding ex parte communications.'' There was no intention at that time to impose a rule more restrictive than that imposed by the APA.
