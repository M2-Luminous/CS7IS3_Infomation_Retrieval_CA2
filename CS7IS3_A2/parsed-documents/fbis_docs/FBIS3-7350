The statement expressed strong opposition to the resumption of the Team Spirit war game and the introduction of Patriot missiles, warning that they would only increase the danger of war on the Korean peninsula. It also criticized the "civilian government's" pro-U.S. treacheries, saying that the Kim Yong-sam regime "is entrusting important issues related to the existence of the nation to the United States through an inconsistent diplomatic policy."
