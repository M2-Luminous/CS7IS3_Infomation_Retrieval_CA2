What about the hypotheses concerning [Budget Minister] Spaventa, and the murmurings about [the chairman of the Institute for Industrial Reconstruction, IRI] Prodi? [d'Alema] So much empty talk. Our job is not to study farfetched formulas, but to give precise indications as to what we are prepared to do if we win the elections. [Verderami] Without first reaching an agreement with the center? [d'Alema] We must not announce an alliance with the center, but rather, with the citizens. In fact, the center might be irrelevant in the next parliament. The real problem is a different one: The electoral campaign is beginning now, and the opinion polls indicate an essentially balanced situation between the progressives and the right, with the center losing votes. Now, there is a considerable proportion of undecided voters. We are now in the run-up. Within the next few days the balance may turn in favor of one of the two alignments. So, although it may be premature to think in terms of a coalition after the elections, it is not premature, however, to think in terms of the government. The government constitutes the fundamental issue distinguishing the two alignments, and it is also the issue on which the progressive alliance has an advantage. [Verderami] Well, on the right there is [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi running for the premiership.... [d'Alema] Berlusconi's electoral campaign is similar to Craxi's in 1992. If, like Craxi, he does not win, his plans will collapse, and after a while he will move abroad. In any case, his leadership has been called into question by [League Secretary] Bossi. This means that a right-wing victory might open up the prospect of ungovernability. The progressives, on the other hand, are showing greater cohesiveness. The more guarantees we are capable of offering in terms of governability, the greater our chances of prevailing. [Verderami] Have you explained this to [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti? [d'Alema] Communist Renewal is excessively preoccupied with the need to establish its own identity, and in doing so it has not always made the right move. In fact, it would be well advised not to force matters just for propaganda purposes. However, I think Communist Renewal's case is receiving too much attention. In the final analysis, it is only a limited radical component within a much broader alignment. Communist Renewal is welcome to adopt any platform that it wishes, but, of course, it cannot possibly expect some of its proposals to be included in the platform of a government supported by the progressives. If Communist Renewal should propose taxing treasury bills and leaving NATO, this would be a reason for not forming a government together. [Verderami] Do you draw a distinction between the progressives and Communist Renewal? [d'Alema] If the progressives win a majority, they will guarantee a national reconstruction government for the country, not a left-wing government: a government committed to economic recovery and improving the employment situation; a government which will make the welfare system more efficient and uphold the principle of solidarity; a government which will propose a more authoritative and, at the same time, a less invasive, meddling type of state. I am speaking of the invasiveness of political power... [Verderami] ...and of judiciary power? [d`Alema] Yes. I believe, for example, that the electoral campaign must today consist of a political debate on the country's problems rather than being conducted on the basis of information leaked from the courts of justice... These are the objectives of a national reconstruction government, within a framework conditioned by the need to pursue a financial recovery policy. This perspective could be expressed through a new cabinet headed by Ciampi. I repeat: a new cabinet. When I refer to the current prime minister I am not referring to the current ministerial make-up. [Verderami] Is Ciampi therefore the progressive's candidate for the premiership? [d'Alema] Let us be clear. I am not saying that Ciampi is the head of the progressives. We do not have a presidential system in Italy, and we have no need to nominate a head of state in order to get people to vote for us. [Verderami] However, Ciampi is saying that he would rather see a member of parliament at Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's office] in the near future. [d'Alema] In my view, if at present the progressives are prepared to support this sort of government -- leaving aside the prerogatives of the head of state, and Ciampi's intentions -- this would be the wisest solution. This solution is necessary by the current stage of events, but it is not a concession that we owe anybody. In any case, the new government should mark a change in relation to the past. I am thinking, for example, of the Interior Ministry... [Verderami] With d'Alema replacing [current Interior Minister] Mancino? [d'Alema] It is not one of d'Alema's prerogatives to name ministers. However, it would not be with d'Alema in The Viminale [Interior Ministry], if this is what you are suggesting. [Verderami] What about the possibility of Spaventa heading a progressive government? [d'Alema] Spaventa is a statesman who, being young, can still make a contribution to the country for a long time to come. However, I believe that, after 28 March, in order to get out of the "bottleneck" and recover international credibility, we must give signs of stability. [Verderami] Do you believe that your allies will agree with you? [d'Alema] Actually, my intention is to address a proposal to the progressive candidates: As from today, we should be committed to having a consistent attitude after the elections, we must work with a view to maintaining cooperation in parliament beyond the electoral alliance. I am thinking in terms of a single parliamentary group or, at least, a federative pact. During this last stage of the electoral campaign, it would be important for us to tell voters: We are together today, we will be together tomorrow. This would be like offering them an investment geared to the future. [Verderami] Are you thinking in terms of a future Democratic Party? [d'Alema] I believe that by acting in this way we would establish the foundations for a future progressive democratic force, within a bipolar, European-type framework, which is what Italy should be aiming at. [Verderami] Do you think that everybody will agree on this proposal? [d'Alema] The single group will include forces prepared to take part in such a project. Of course, there are those who are aiming to preserve their own identity. However, what position will those candidates adopt who are an expression of civil society? And what will be the fate of Democratic Alliance, that was set up precisely in order to promote this kind of aggregation process? What will happen to the Socialist forces that have decided to join the progressives? Should we not be thinking in terms of common prospects? In the final analysis, we are all part of a single European Socialist party, and I do not think that the existence of two different reference points in our country will make sense for much longer.
