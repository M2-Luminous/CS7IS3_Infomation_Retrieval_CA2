There is no understanding of, nor forgiveness for such a horrendous act, the president said, extending his condolences to the bereaved families, the residents of Hebron, and the entire Arab population in Israel and world-wide. The president added: This act must not harm the peace process and the chance of fostering cooperation and coexistence in the region. At this difficult hour, I call upon all leaders, religious and otherwise, of all parties -- Jews, Muslims, and Christians -- to share in the pain of the unnecessary loss of life, but to show restraint and to prevent a further deterioration. Israel's Chief Rabbi Me'ir Lau said we have always opposed bloodshed, especially when it is committed against a religious background, and at a holy site and during prayers especially. It is the right of every person to pray to his God according to his faith, and anyone who deprives him of doing so is undermining the base of support on which human beings rely, particularly members of the Jewish nation who suffered from persecution and bloodshed throughout the ages. Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert has instructed the establishment of an emergency committee which will coordinate with the security forces on action necessary to prevent an escalation in the wake of the Hebron incidents.
