Since the ceremony threatens the interests of the global arrogance and its allies, the Saudi rulers prevented the Iranian pilgrims and those from other countries from holding the ceremony, said the speaker at the open session of Majles. Such actions were not unexpected from Saudi rulers in order to serve the interests of the enemies of Islam, he said adding that fortunately they were thwarted by the awareness of the leader's representative for Hajj-related affairs, Mohammad Mohammadi-Reyshahri. The speaker then described today's silence of Hajj pilgrims as very meaningful and added that this would exopose the real nature of the Saudi rulers for the Muslims world over.
