He added, however, that a rise in unemployment rather than inflation would pose a greater threat to China. Inflation to some extent is not inevitable for the maintenance of economic growth, according to Mr. Li who is attending the current session of the 8th NPC. Should the government make proper use of four important means at the present stage, namely savings deposits at bank for value preservation, adjustment of wages in accordance with the cost of living, pensions and the curbing of a price hike by administrative means, inflation would not worsen. Mr. Li said he believed that if people had a job and a regular income which could support their daily needs, inflation to some extent would not constitute a threat. By contrast, however, a person who had lost his job would be in anxious state and a group of unemployed persons in despair would be a potential source of unrest to society. It justified the thinking that reasonable economic gain should be not only in line with the national strength and with the market purchasing power, but also capable of providing sufficient job opportunities for the newly increased number of job-seekers. Mr. Li suggested that the central government should give priority to the handling of employment which involves job opportunities for ten million job-seekers every year. The important matter, Mr. Li said, lay in the relaxation of the policy on restriction on employment and in letting people seek a suitable job for themselves.
