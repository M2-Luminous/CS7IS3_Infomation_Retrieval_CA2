FR940505-1-00074 FR940505-1-00012 Since the requirements of the proposed RACT rule are currently being met, there should be no additional costs for Michigan-California to meet the rule's requirements. (e) Reynolds Metals (Placer). Reynolds manufactures aluminum ``Stay On Tab'' can ends in Rocklin, California and uses several VOC containing compounds which include end sealing compound, equipment cleaner and tab lubricants. Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(s) controls the VOC emissions from the tab lubricating process at Reynolds Metals Company (``Reynolds'') in Placer County. The end sealing compound is currently regulated by Placer County APCD and the equipment cleaner is covered by the Solvent Cleaning Operations rule discussed below. VOC emissions reductions from the tab lubrication process have been achieved by reducing the VOC content and application rate of the lubricant. Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(s) requires Reynolds' to meet limits that are based on the lower VOC and application rate of the tab lubricant. In 1992, Reynolds switched from a tab lubricant with a VOC content of 6.38 lbs of VOC per gallon, which was applied at a rate of 50 milliliters per minute (ml/min) to make 3240 tabs/min (or 2.60 × 10 ^5 lbs VOC/tab) to a tab lubricant with a VOC content of 5.73 lb/gal which is applied at a rate of 25 ml/min to make 3240 tabs/min (or 1.17 × 10 ^5 lbs VOC/tab). EPA is proposing a limit of 5.73 lb/gal for the tab lubricant and total tab lubricant VOC emissions of not more than 1.2 × 10 ^5 lbs of VOC per tab produced in a given press. Proposed RACT rule 52.2961(s) will also allow control equipment with an overall efficiency of 85 percent as an alternative to meeting the above VOC limits. In 1990, Reynolds emitted a total of 247.5 tons of VOC from which 77.5 tons was generated by the tab lubricant process. The changes made in 1992 achieve an estimated 55 percent reduction in VOC (or 42.3 tpy, 0.12 tpd). Since the tab lubricant changes required by the proposed RACT rule have already been implemented, there should be no additional costs for Reynolds to meet the rule's requirements, and apparently the past reformulations were cost effective.
