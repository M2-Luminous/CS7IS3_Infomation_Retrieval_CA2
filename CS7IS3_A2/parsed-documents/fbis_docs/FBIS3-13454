He did so because he learned his lesson, and realized that swimming against the tide of the Jewish lobby in the U.S. Congress could put a spoke through his wheels and relegate him to the fate suffered by Admiral Inman, who paid a price for not allowing Israel to have access to Washington's military secrets 13 years ago. Because of this, Inman was compelled to ask that his nomination for the U.S. defense secretary position be withdrawn. Similarly, acting against the wishes of the Jewish lobby could also relegate Talbott to the fate of nominated Attorney General Janet Reno, who, all of a sudden, turned in the eyes of the U.S. press from a clever, trustworthy, and capable lady into a weak, vain, careless, and indifferent woman because she failed to recommend that Jewish spy Pollard be released or show a measure of mercy toward him. Talbott has chosen to disavow a host of ideas he upheld in press articles published 13 years ago. In these articles, he condemned the forcible seizure of territories, and deemed necessary halting the domination of the Israeli civilian establishment by the Israeli military establishment. His rationale was that this would not only influence the future of Israel, but also turn it into a liability overburdening U.S. strategic interests in the Middle East and the world at large. While being grilled by the Zionist lobby in the Congress during his confirmation hearings, Talbott showed wisdom. He made a turnabout, contending that most of the articles critical of Israel that he has written were published a long time ago, and that age has rendered him "wiser" than he was then. He added: I have always believed that U.S.-Israeli ties are unshakable. That my feelings regarding the strategic importance of Israel have changed is a certainty. He was not contented with disavowing his old ideas. He went further by saying that he has always believed that a strong Israel serves the interests of the United States, and that the latter should not apply any form of pressure on a country to which it is bound by special ties. He did not forget to pledge to refrain from any activities related to Israel once his nomination is confirmed. It should be recalled that the campaign against Talbott was not designed to prevent him from taking the post. Otherwise, he would not have taken it in the first place. It was only a slap on the wrist, reminding him that he will remain under close watch throughout his tenure at the U.S. State Department. Given all this, one would say that the executive director of AIPAC [the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee] put it right when he said that the Clinton administration was in his pocket, "even before it was formed." In light of all this, do we have the right to wonder as to the reasons for the procrastination over the passage of a UN Security Council resolution on the Hebron massacre, although there is a strong international consensus condemning this heinous massacre?
