The increase in those optimistic about approval -- 17 percent -- is the largest recorded thus far. Mattias Bengtsson writes in the 4 February SVENSKA DAGBLADET on page 3 that this is an indication that the membership debate has entered a new stage: The yes side has been gaining momentum since January polls showed an 8 percent increase in support for membership. Bengtsson cites several reasons for increased optimism. An upturn in the economic situation in Sweden has given people more confidence in the future. At the same time, reporting on the EU accession negotiations has made membership a more concrete and less frightening prospect. About 25 percent more respondents now believe that the negotiations are being handled well: 55 percent in January versus one-third in October.
