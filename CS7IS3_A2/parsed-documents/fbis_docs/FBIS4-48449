The figure includes central government and parastatal spending, and no breakdown between the two components was available yesterday. Before the election, ANC officials said the cost to central government would be R39bn over five years, but economists said the figure appeared understated within the context of the overall amount. Institute head Max Sisulu confirmed the full programme would cost at least R80bn, but declined to say what portion would be financed via the Budget. He confirmed that spending in the fifth year of the programme was estimated at R39bn (including parastatal expenditure). Private sector expenditure, for instance on housing, was not included in the estimate. Housing would be financed mainly via the Budget. He said the institute's task had been to identify savings within the existing Budget and the scope for further spending, given conservative assumptions. These assumptions meant in the short-term there was little that could change. As the programme went on, the assumptions could be relaxed. Key assumptions for the first two years included that there would be no foreign grants, no major taxation changes and no further selling of strategic stockpiles. But the situation was assumed to have changed in later years. The model also assumed a given GDP growth rate, inflation and remuneration packages in the short-run. Criteria had been drawn up to rank programmes in order of importance. A major effort had been made to link the RDP to budgetary planning, hence this emphasis. Sisulu, who is an ANC MP, said he expected the research to be released soon. The Development Bank has drawn up a model costing a programme similar to the RDP, and found that overall spending (government and parastatal) of almost R57bn over five years would cause government debt to explode. Such a progamme would be unsustainable even if the economy grew at almost 6 percent by the end of the period.
