According to materials released by the parliamentary committee for economic policy, this programme provides for working out appropriate standard acts to control first hard currency proceeds and then import and barter deals, export and import of services, as well as movement of capital. The programme envisages tough sanctions up to non-acceptance exaction of funds from the banks guilty of incorrect and untimely settlements as concerns the compulsory re-sale to the state of part of their hard currency earnings. To make the activities of currency control bodies more effective, the Central Bank suggests strengthening the legislative basis, specifically taking legal actions against those accused of violations in the currency sphere, specifying certain provisions of the law on currency regulation and control, to pass legislative acts allowing to sign and ratify international agreements on currency issues. The programme also proposes building a database of all foreign trade shipments and payments on the basis of the Russian State Customs Committee's computer centre in order to check information on money and goods movement. This will make it possible to reveal cases of underestimated export prices and overestimated import prices.
