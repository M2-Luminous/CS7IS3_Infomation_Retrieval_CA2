FR941012-0-00189 FR941012-0-00013 Rulemaking Analyses and Notices Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures This rulemaking document was reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' The FHWA has determined that this regulation is a significant regulatory action within the meaning of that Order. This rulemaking is considered a significant regulation under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures because of substantial congressional and public interest. This interest involves minimizing risks while allowing reasonable highway routing for the transportation of NRHM. The regulation does not require the establishment of NRHM routing designations or the use of Federal preemption determinations, waivers of preemption, and dispute resolution, but does provide standards and procedures which are required to be followed if these actions are taken. The FHWA believes that for those States or Indian tribal governments which choose to adopt routing designations, the benefits from implementing these regulations, such as NRHM routing designation continuity, public participation, uniform standards, and preemption and dispute resolution procedures, will be greater than the costs, such as providing the required documentation, coordination, and analysis which allow discretion in level of detail. The FHWA anticipates that the economic impact of this regulation will be minimal based upon a regulatory evaluation. Regulatory Flexibility Act In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354; 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this regulation on small entities such as Indian tribes, local governments, and small businesses. The HMTUSA requires the Secretary to adopt standards which States and Indian tribes must follow if they establish, maintain, or enforce NRHM routing designations (specific highway routes over which NRHM may or may not be transported within their jurisdictions, limitations or requirements for highway routing). The regulation does not require the use of NRHM routing designations or Federal preemption determinations, waivers of preemption, and dispute resolution, but provides standards and procedures which are required to be followed if these actions are chosen to be used. The discretionary nature of the actions allows for cost saving options to be used in balancing the needs in commerce and the risks in the transportation of NRHM. To date, relatively few States and local jurisdictions have chosen to establish NRHM routing designations. The FHWA has concluded that the regulation does not substantially affect the ability of, or cost to, local jurisdictions establishing needed NRHM routing designations. The preemption and dispute resolution procedures provide all entities more effective and efficient means of resolving routing issues. Based on this evaluation, the FHWA certifies that this regulation does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment) This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612. The HMTUSA requires the Secretary to adopt standards which States and Indian tribes must follow if they establish, maintain, or enforce NRHM routing designations (specific highway routes over which NRHM may or may not be transported within their jurisdictions, limitations or requirements for highway routing). The regulation recognizes the State and Indian tribal role in the designation of highway routes for NRHM while de-emphasizing the role of local governments. The regulation provides for discretion by the States and Indian tribes as to whether they impose NRHM routing designations. Each State and Indian tribe is free to establish NRHM routing designations tailored to its own needs in accordance with the Federal standards, using the DOT ``Guidelines for Applying Criteria to Designate Routes for Transporting Hazardous Materials,'' or an equivalent routing analysis which adequately considers overall risk to the public. States and localities have a better understanding of the relative safety of the highways within their jurisdictions than does the Federal government. The regulation limits the policymaking discretion of the States, their political subdivisions and Indian tribes. The regulation is necessary, however, to achieve the purposes and implement the requirements of the HMTUSA. Accordingly, it is certified that this action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles, criteria, and requirements contained in Executive Order 12612 and, it has been determined that this action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
