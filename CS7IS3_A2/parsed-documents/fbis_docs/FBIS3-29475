In fact, the information was not really a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry. Our newspaper would like to apologize to its readers. Nevertheless, the information included a lot of details that are factual, clearly showing the good intentions and sincere cooperation rendered by the Lao side and the Lao authorities in implementing Lao-U.S. cooperation on Americans killed during the war in Laos. Because of the Lao side's wholehearted cooperation, the program has been carried out effectively so far. The remains of many MIA's have been recovered. While the search for more U.S. MIA remains was continuing, however, the Voice of America accused the Lao side of failing to cooperate. They even cooked up a story claiming that some live U.S. POW's were still in Laos. Why are they so suspicious and talkative? As everyone well knows, since 1985 and 1986 Lao and U.S. technical teams have cooperated in carrying out excavation missions at crash sites of U.S. planes shot down by the Lao People's Army and our people throughout Laos. By September 1993, the two sides had conducted 35 excavations in 11 provinces throughout the country and had retrieved the remains of 51 U.S. MIA's. According to the authorities concerned, Lao-U.S. cooperation in searching for U.S. POW-MIA's in Laos can be divided into four areas. The first is doing surveys and excavations of crash sites. Second is carrying out interrogations and searching for U.S. POW's that the U.S. side believes are still alive. Third is conducting interviews with prominent persons. Fourth is examining documents and movies related to the war. The Lao side has given its full cooperation to its U.S. counterparts in all these areas. We even comply with any additional requests by the U.S. This is because we are sincere. We think it is better to forget about past animosities and move on with rebuilding and developing our friendship. This is an act of goodwill on the part of the Lao side as well as a highly-esteemed humanitarian gesture by the multiethnic Lao people. We, the Lao people -- like the American people -- are able to differentiate between history, current reality, and the future. The Lao and American peoples should step up our cooperation in all fields in order to build our respective countries and make them prosperous. We should not talk and quarrel with one another about the past; it is not good for either of us. Of course our cooperation in the search for U.S. MIA's in Laos will continue. But it is ridiculous to conjure up the ghosts of the past in order to slander each other.
