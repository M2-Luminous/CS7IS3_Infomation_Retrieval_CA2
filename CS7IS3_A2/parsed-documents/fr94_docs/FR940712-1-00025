FR940712-1-00025 FR940712-1-00007 D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms The Service believes that the four newly discovered populations in Colorado are safe from human impacts since they occur on National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service lands. The population in Glacier National Park is protected by Park Service regulations. With the exception of the one or two populations within Jasper National Park, the Canadian populations apparently do not have any regulatory protection. The lack of regulatory mechanisms is not known to be a threat at this time, but could change at some point in the future. E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence At Peterson Lake, severe drought coupled with the winter water drawdown form the lake by Eldora Ski Resort, has on occasion lowered the water level dramatically. These events have exposed the Rocky Mountain capshell to dehydration and freezing conditions. In 1979, the existing access road adjacent to Peterson Lake was paved. This expedited runoff, thus increased the natural sedimentation process plus adding an influx of possible salt and sand contaminants into the lake. When the 90-day finding was made, the Service believed that the two populations in Jasper National Park had been extirpated due to the lakes they inhabited being poisoned. However, new information has shown that neither lake was poisoned. The Rocky Mountain capshell population in Peterson Lake may be threatened by natural or manmade factors, but none of the other 13 known populations are thought to be threatened by any of these factors. Finding Emergency listing is allowed under the Act whenever immediate protection is needed to prevent extirpation of a species. For an invertebrate species, endangerment must be considered throughout the range of the species rather than for a single population. Considering information previously discussed in this notice, only the Peterson Lake population of the 14 known Rocky Mountain capshell populations is thought to be subject to possible endangerment or extinction in the foreseeable future. Also, in less than one year's time, the number of reported populations increased from 7 to 14. Since little is known about the biology, ecology, and distribution of the Rocky Mountain capshell, and since recently discovered populations in Colorado, Alberta, and British Columbia point to a wider geographical distribution than previously thought, the Service believes that additional populations exist in suitable habitat in the United States and in Canada. After reviewing the petition, accompanying documentation, references cited therein, and research findings, the Service concludes that the petition requesting that the Rocky Mountain capshell be listed as an endangered species on an emergency basis throughout its range is not warranted. The petitioners also requested that critical habitat be designated. In the future, if a warranted finding is made for the species, then designation of critical habitat would be addressed in the subsequent proposed rule. After arriving at the not warranted finding, the Service changed the species' candidate status from category 2 to category 3C. The Service's 12-month finding contains more detailed information regarding the above decisions. A copy may be obtained from the Service's Golden office (see ADDRESSES above).
