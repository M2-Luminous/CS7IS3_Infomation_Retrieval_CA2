During the talks, Japan explained the macroeconomic measures included in its March market-opening package aimed at boosting domestic demand, the official said, requesting anonymity. The U.S. side "well recognized" Japan's efforts, he added, stressing that macroeconomic issues were not under negotiation at the informal talks. The marathon four-day session focused on the three priority areas -- automobile and auto parts, insurance business, and government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment, the official noted. As for the insurance field, for which the Finance Ministry holds responsibility, the official said his ministry wants to resume talks as soon as possible although the schedule is still undecided. Insurance negotiations will cover market problems in both Japan and the United States, and "qualitative and quantitative" goals instead of numerical targets to measure the progress of sectoral market access as agreed at the informal talks, he said.
