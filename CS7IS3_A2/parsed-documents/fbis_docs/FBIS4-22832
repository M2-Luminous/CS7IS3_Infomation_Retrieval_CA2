Bondarenko, A.A. Reznichenko (deceased), and A.A. Usachev, Dagestan Polytechnic Institute; UDC 620.172.3:669.295.5] [Abstract] Pipes made of the titanium alloy PT-7M (titanium plus 1.8-2.5 percent Al, 2-3 percent Zr, and 0.1 percent C) with a diameter of 13 mm and wall thickness of 1.5 mm were subjected to fatigue tests under a variable-sign load in a fixed plane on resonance-type units with electromagnetic excitation of vibrations. During the testing each pipe was bent like a beam on two supports under the effect of a running inertial load, inertia forces, and inertial moments of additional weights attached on its brackets. The span of each test pipe segment measured 520 mm, and the gradient of the bending moment on the section of likely fracture (about one-fourth of the span) did not exceed 0.1 percent/mm of the bending moment in the midsection. A loading frequency of 100 Hz, a symmetrical cycle with a constant deformation amplitude, and a test base of 10[.sup]8[/] cycles were used. The error in measuring the deformation amplitudes did not exceed +/-5 percent, and the temperature regimen conformed to the requirements stipulated in state standard GOST 25.502-79. Fifteen series of 15 specimens were tested. The titanium alloy's notch sensitivity was found to increase somewhat as the temperature increased. At T = 20�C, the effective notch-sensitivity index concentration K[.sub]eff[/] equaled 2.53 versus 3.13 and 2.77 at T = 250 and 350�C, respectively. An average value of K[.sub]eff[/] = 2.81 was assumed. (The maximum value of the theoretical notch-sensitivity for a stretched wafer of linearly elastic material is K[.sub]eff[/] = 3.) As the temperature was increased, the titanium alloy pipes' ``sensitivity'' to absorption of hydrogen (relative decrease in _s_[.sub]-1[/] as the hydrogen content increases) decreased. It was suggested that the test results summarized in table form be used to estimate the lifetime of equipment containing pipes made of PT-7M titanium alloy by hypothesizing the linear summation of instances of fatigue.
