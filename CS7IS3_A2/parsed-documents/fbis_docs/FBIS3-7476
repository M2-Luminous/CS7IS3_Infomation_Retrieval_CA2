FBIS3-7476 "dreas060_n_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-060 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Mar 1994 Vietnam Files Reportedly Stolen From Army Archives BK2503141294 Hong Kong AFP in English 1337 GMT 25 Mar 94 BK2503141294 Hong Kong AFP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] HANOI, March 25 (AFP) -- Foreigners have stolen at least 60 confidential files from Vietnamese army archives, the head of the military security protection department Colonel Cao Long Hy said in a report here Friday. The documents, including secret "internal documents," give details of the history and activities of several branches of the army dating back to their creation, said Hy in an article published in the army's daily newspaper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN. The papers have been taken out of the country by "foreigners" since the beginning of 1993, he said without identifying the culprits. Observers say this is the first time that such a high-ranking army official has talked publicly of documents being leaked from military archives and taken abroad. The colonel said bad management of the print-works and archives, as well as negligence and the breaking of rules on the protection of military secrets, had contributed to the disappearance of certain files. He said other documents had also vanished but acknowledged that the reason for their disappearance was not known. Observers say the files could have been stolen by army employees to be sold later outside the country. Colonel Hy said the documents had been "deformed, modified and re-written" before being published by "hostile foreign media" organisations, in order to "criticise the `doi moi' (renovation) policy, to caricature the army's role and to sabotage Vietnam's relations with other countries in the region." He called on the army to protect internal secrets and redouble its vigilance "in the face of sophisticated enemy manoeuvres and the bad elements of society." The colonel added that "the enemy takes advantage of diplomatic, economic, humanitarian and tourism activities, to examine Vietnam's... politics, economy, defence and security in order to commit sabotage by establishing contact with reactionary groups based inside the country". He said the issue of the protection of state and army secrets was a "task which has now become imperative," referring to a 1992 directive on the subject by Vietnam's defence minister. Conservative elements in Vietnam, especially military officials, have publicly expressed concern that economic and political pressure from the West since the lifting of the US trade embargo last month will destabilize the country.
