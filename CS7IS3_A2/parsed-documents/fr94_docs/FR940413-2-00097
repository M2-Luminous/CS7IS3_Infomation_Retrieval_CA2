FR940413-2-00097 FR940413-2-00055 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Drug Enforcement Administration Controlled Substances: Notice of Proposed 1994 Aggregate Production Quotas AGENCY: Drug Enforcement Administration, Justice. ACTION: Notice of proposed revised aggregate production quotas for 1994. SUMMARY: This notice proposes revised 1994 aggregate production quotas for controlled substances in Schedules I and II, as required under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. DATES: Comments or objections should be received on or before (30 days after date of publication). ADDRESSES: Send comments or objections to the Administrator, Drug Enforcement Administration, Washington, DC 20537, Attn: DEA Federal Register Representative/CCR. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Howard McClain, Jr., Chief, Drug & Chemical Evaluation Section, Drug Enforcement Administration, Washington, DC, 20537, Telephone: (202) 307&hyph;7183. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. 826) requires that the Attorney General establish aggregate production quotas for all controlled substances listed in Schedules I and II. This responsibility has been delegated to the Administrator of the DEA by ยง0.100 of title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations. On October 8, 1993, a notice of the 1994 established aggregate production quotas was published in the Federal Register (58 FR 52508). The notice stipulated that the Administrator of the DEA would adjust the quotas in early 1994 as provided for in title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, ยง1303.23(c). These aggregate production quotas represent those amounts of controlled substances that may be produced in the United States in 1994 and do not include amounts which may be imported for use in industrial processes. The proposed revisions are based on a review of 1993 year-end inventories, 1993 disposition data submitted by quota applicants, estimates of the medical needs of the United States submitted to the DEA by the Food and Drug Administration and other information available to the DEA. Therefore, under the authority vested in the Attorney General by section 306 of the CSA of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 826) and delegated to the Administrator by section 0.100 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the Administrator of the DEA hereby proposes the following changes in the 1994 aggregate production quotas for the listed controlled substances, expressed in grams of anhydrous acid or base.
