In his interview on the occasion of 16 June, Yugoslav Army day, General Perisic stressed that if it were up to soldiers to decide on matters of war and peace, they would always opt for peace, because professionals are well aware of what war entails and how extensive material destruction can be. As a professional army, we have been carrying out orders issued by state structures and implementing political decisions. The transformation of the Yugoslav Army, Perisic underlined, is primarily based on the establishment of state control over national defense, that is All National Defense [Opste Narodna Odbrana], on a new military doctrine, and other recent regulations. The basic objective is for us to remain masters in our own home, to defend the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], that is of the Serbs, Montenegrins, and all national minorities, because this is a bourgeois state. It is important to develop the defense capability of society as a whole, especially the army's combat readiness -- not in the sense of deploying this army outside the borders of the FRY but, first and foremost, of preventing any aggressor from threatening the country's security. The transformation of the Yugoslav Army is based on a series of real factors. This transformation fully corresponds with our doctrines, that is, with the protection of the population of our country. First and foremost, we are bearing in mind the real threat coming from abroad. We are also bearing in mind our real material capabilities and, of course, our human resources. In addition to this, we had to create units that are capable enough of preempting surprise threats in peacetime and at the same time flexible enough in wartime to create a massive army in a short period of time. Naturally, the transformation of the Yugoslav Army is an ongoing process, a process that encompasses everything -- ranging from organizational and structural changes, to the modernization of weaponry and equipment and the army's visual identity. Commenting on the fact that the largest part of the military industry has remained on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, Perisic said that the loss of territory and military industrial facilities is certainly a problem besetting today's Yugoslav Army and the overall defense capabilities of society. By carrying out an organized evacuation we nevertheless managed to capture most facilities and to save all our technical blueprints. Thus, while carrying out the transformation of the Yugoslav Army, we are also securing conditions for manufacturing vital pieces of combat equipment in our factories. The modernization of the army refers primarily to the modernization of the combat training system and supplying the army with new hardware, i.e., weapons and systems. During this period we have managed to replace or substitute the manufacture of the equipment we used to have until yesterday, either by modernization or by utilizing the collective scientific brain. We have managed to develop some new equipment which replaces the equipment we used to manufacture, only it has far better features, i.e., far better combat specifications, the chief of staff stressed. "In the light of the economic blockade of our country, in the light of the fact that a war was and still is being waged in the area of the former Yugoslavia, all of this has a negative influence on our total economic power and, consequently, on the Yugoslav Army too. Anyone who ignores the correlation between a country's economic potential and the financial resources earmarked for the army harbors unrealistic views. This is why the budget earmarked for the Yugoslav Army is precisely as big as our society could provide at a given moment, namely 7.43 percent of the national product." In response to the criticism that the Yugoslav army has perhaps retained some characteristics of the former Yugoslavia, the general said: The multiparty system has been introduced in our country, and many party leaders would like to have an army that suits them and, consequently, not everyone's wishes can be fulfilled. The most dangerous thing for any army, in any multiparty society, is the possibility of political parties interfering in the army's personnel policy. The sharpest criticism has been that the army has been depoliticized through the process of transformation. We pay great attention to the personnel policy, and we know -- and this is perhaps the greatest contribution to the transformation of the army -- that the Yugoslav army units are now being led by exceptionally capable people, people of great knowledge, ability, dignity and pride, people who are prepared to and capable of predicting events and making decisions in line with the combat capability of their units and the overall potentials of our society. It has always been, and still is, very important in the training and education of officers for them to be honest toward their own people and their soldiers, and to be exceptionally shrewd regarding their enemy. However, unfortunately, due to wrong training of the officers in the Yugoslav People's Army [former Yugoslav army -- JNA], all their capability was directed toward organizing themselves and leading the army so as to protect the country from an external enemy, completely ignoring the possibility of an internal enemy. Due to their naivety, many acted in a way they should not have done. Naturally, during this civil war, from Slovenia to Bosnia, many officers were not up to their task, and they fared as they deserved. A JNA unit under a capable officer did not suffer losses in either its equipment or people, and did not surrender. The Croats and the Slovenes have achieved everything they have achieved by deceit or some other method, but certainly not through armed combat. Speaking about patriots and patriotism, Perisic said that this human quality develops and grows throughout one's life. That is an exceptionally important quality in the Yugoslav army, I would say a quality without which tasks cannot be successfully completed. Therefore, in some important aspects, the officers must be proven patriots. To be a proven patriot means to be ready to help one's own people in most difficult times, to share the fate of the people, and to be ready for the greatest of sacrifices. General Perisic went on to say that NATO was set up to protect the interests of its member-states and it ought to be in the service of all these countries equally. However, it began serving the interests of one country which is the architect of the new world order. It is completely clear that NATO has somehow been abused, but in the final analysis, its raison d'etre following the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact is pointless, unless it wishes to continue doing what it is doing now. Of course, many NATO effectives have been brought to the vicinity of the FRY to support forces which took an active part in the disintegration of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [SFRY], and now in their attack on the republic of Serb Krajina and the Srpska republic; given that they are in our immediate vicinity, they are indirectly threatening the security of the FRY, but we have to know that they are not here only to help the secessionist forces, but also to exert some pressure on our country. Consequently, our country is under a multifold embargo, on the one hand under a complete economic blockade and on the other surrounded by NATO warships which pose a kind of threat to the security of the FRY. However, as we have much experience, and in the light of the four-year war waged by our compatriots living outside the FRY, we are aware that their presence could in a sudden turnabout bring into question the security of the FRY, and therefore we have been taking certain measures to avoid surprises of any sort. Perisic said that the civil war on the territory of the SFRY came about because of foreign influence and the skillful use of internal contradictions. As this civil war is primarily based on religious and national antagonisms, rather than on some other factors, there is a danger of it spilling over to the territory of the FRY, following a similar principle. Normally, since the architects of the new world order, when drawing up their scenario, did not reckon with the heroic resistance put up by the people of the two Krajinas, they were halted in some degree. That process has even been paralyzed, and if we continue to be united as much as we have to be in order to protect our national being, then we could even halt that process. Bearing all this in mind, the FRY has been trying to a maximum degree to stop the war on the territory of Bosnia as soon as possible, and in this respect has been offering support to all peace-loving forces in the world in preventing the spread of the war eastward, i.e., to this area here. Perisic was asked: As they are constantly threatening us with sanctions and bombardment, is there any reason to be frightened? Perisic replied: "Certainly, when the very fabric of society is endangered a certain degree of fear is inevitable." "In view of our experience throughout history, as well as the war under way, waged by our compatriots in the Republic of Serb Krajina and the [Bosnia] Serb republic under extremely unfavorable conditions, they have shown us that they could successfully withstand a numerically far superior opponent for four years now; moreover, this opponent is backed by the world media, not only morally but also logistically, including the air force [as received]. The conclusion to be drawn is that the Serbian and Montenegrin soldier, the Serbian and Montenegrin people, and the national minorities are ready and able to defend themselves -- with the Yugoslav army as their axis." The general commented on relations with The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which has received UN troops on its territory, most of whom are Americans. Of course, they are not there to protect the Macedonian people, but to set up their bases and, among other things, to help them secure their borders, as the Macedonians neither have the manpower nor the material resources to organize a modern army. However, as the border line is administrative and is not clearly defined, American soldiers are often apt to get lost and cross onto FRY territory, either out of ignorance or misinformation. All of these intrusions have been registered, some were thwarted or took place without incident. However, since someone in the world wishes to turn every border violation into an incident, we are often accused of this. I had several meetings with the UN commander for Macedonia to this effect, I warned about frequent border violations and he promised this would discontinue. Nevertheless, I am not so sure some of these violations are not deliberate. As far as accusations that Yugoslavia is amassing troops along the Macedonian border are concerned, this is "pure media fabrication." The situation along the Albanian border is almost identical in the sense of border incidents. Young men from Kosovo and Metohija and the Raska region, Shiptars and Muslims are dodging military service in the Yugoslav army, and since they are harboring illusions about violent secession, these young men are being sent for military training to various centers abroad through different channels. On their return -- by way of testing their abilities and smuggling arms on a grand scale -- they are entering our country illegally. As our border patrols try to prevent them from doing this, incidents occur. They are using weapons during these illegal crossings. Unfortunately, these incidents often have tragic consequences for the infiltrators, which the unsympathetic world is exploiting very efficiently in its media campaign against our country, Perisic said. The Yugoslav army, Perisic said, is a factor of stability for Yugoslavia as a whole, including stability in the region of Kosovo and Metohija, thanks to other elements and the people's support [as received]. I believe that the average Kosovo Albanian, that is Shiptar, would never choose the war option because he can see clearly enough what is happening in regions where people are trying to resolve something by force. Second, they can also see the living standards of their compatriots in Albania. It suffices to climb a mountain near the border to realize what a vast difference there is between the economic might and living standards of the Shiptars on this and on that side of the border, for the Shiptars in Kosovo and Metohija are at least ten times better off than their compatriots in Albania. I believe that all they have been creating under the fold of the FRY and Serbia is such material wealth that they would hate losing it in some showdown not of their own choosing, but imposed by their leaders. But they were wise enough not to have accepted this. If they had, they would have lost so much. They are aware of this, so I do not believe such a thing could happen. Even if it does, the army and militia in Kosovo, as well as other social factors, will be ready and able to defend the territorial integrity of their own country. The Yugoslav army and the FRY leadership are making tremendous efforts through various international factors and through political and military factors in Bosnia to effect peace there as soon as possible -- because we know that only peace, not any kind of peace but a just peace, can put an end to destruction and halt the suffering of all three peoples. However, there can be no peace if all three peoples are not equally determined to achieve it. Will there be fresh aggression, a major offensive? I am certain that a major offensive is a realistic possibility if the international factors responsible for the civil war in Bosnia do not exert pressure on the Muslims and Croats. I am sure that it will not be more successful than the ones so far, and you know that all of them ended in failure. If these Muslim-Croat forces, the Muslim-Croat coalition, were to be aided by certain international factors, especially NATO, then the situation would naturally be far worse. However, I do not believe the international community would allow such a thing to happen, and if it did, the consequences would be disastrous, not only for the people of the Srpska republic, but for the entire population of the Balkans, Europe, and further afield. Perisic commented on Croatian President Tudjman's statement that he would return Krajina into Croatia's borders and its state system by force: ``In view of the fact that there has been a political rift in the Republic of Croatia and that Tudjman is losing ground, everything is possible -- he could push the Croatian nation into another war in a feverish attempt to hold on to power. What the chances are to return the republic of Serb Krajina into Croatia's borders are perfectly clear from the operations on its borders so far. "Even though they engaged the entire country with help from the international community in a war against a far smaller nation, they did not manage to do anything; the Serbs have managed to protect their territorial integrity and did not allow deeper incursions to be made." How much can inter-party bickering influence the Yugoslav army and how much has the army protected itself from internal political divisions? ``It is obvious that the unity of a country is inevitably reflected in the unity of an army. The army is a social category which in every country, ours included, to a higher or a lesser degree reflects developments in society. The stronger the consensus between parties on vital issues of importance for the survival of a nation, normally the more positively is this reflected on the overall situation in the army, particularly its combat morale. "The stronger the disunity, the stronger influence it has over the army; but as we have said, the army has been depoliticized, it has got well-built defense mechanisms for the prevention of such negative influences, I think that the party influence on the overall combat readiness of the army is marginal." The Yugoslav army peace-time force is by its quality and quantity completely equipped to prevent any surprises. It is always capable of taking adequate measures to prevent any surprises, even under the most adverse conditions. This means that a very short period of time is necessary to transform the peace-time force into a war-time force of over 500,000 men, which now completely suffices to protect the nation from foreign threats of any kind, Perisic stressed.
