In an interview with LE FIGARO, the Mayor of Conflans shows that the Socialists have had no problems in adjusting from a government to an opposition frame of mind. [LE FIGARO] Edouard Balladur stressed, in his appearance on "L'Heure de Verite" ["Hour of Truth" TV show] that no other policy was possible. Do you share that opinion? [Rocard] There is an implicit hypothesis behind that statement: Namely, that general economic policy is limited to a monetarist policy. This is a postulate that I refute categorically. [LE FIGARO] How can you run a policy to fight unemployment when you can only act "on the fringes"? [Rocard] I would firstly say that the phenomenon of unemployment in France is currently taking on a new aspect. The number of long-term unemployed has passed the million mark while the rate of youth unemployment has reached a worrying level. When you consider that drugs and criminality are highly dependent on unemployment, how can we accept this linear growth without changing anything? The most serious threat hanging over us today is not bankruptcy but social disintegration. First, the room for action does exist, even if it is minimal, and it can be increased. Second, there are other things to take into consideration, aside from the room for maneuver. We can also work at the heart of the problems, for example, by considering the idea of a rapid New Deal to find the path to strong growth on the European level. [LE FIGARO] Is that not a new utopia? [Rocard] On the contrary, it is very realistic. Technically, Europe has a great potential for growth. The crisis has weakened all local and regional authorities, it is true, and countries. The European Union has escaped this torment. It is not in debt and has the best profile in the world, since it is underwritten by 340 million economically-powerful consumers. Politically, my friends in social democratic parties, several of whom are already in power and others on the verge of government, increasingly share the idea of an enormous European loan to finance the major projects which will lay the road to the future, create immediate employment, and stimulate activity. [LE FIGARO] Outside of Europe, then, there is no salvation? [Rocard] On the contrary. In France itself many things are possible. For example, the creation of jobs in the services sector. Vast numbers of essential needs can be covered: nursery education, treatment for the elderly and handicapped, environmental tasks, cultural activities, etc. To create and finance these jobs, we need a philosophy close to that of the employment-solidarity contracts (CES) that I created, which implies the true, active involvement of all bodies whose sole action today consists in paying out benefits. It will also require the state's determination to grant certain exemptions. There are a number of paths we can go down, but you can always say that there is no other policy possible when you do not invent anything. [LE FIGARO] Do you not think that the five-year employment law is nonetheless the beginning of a process for the reduction of working time? [Rocard] On the contrary. Mr. Jean-Yves Charnard, who poisoned the debate by caricaturing it, and Mr. Balladur, who opposed it haughtily, have between them slowed the process. While service jobs represent a considerable source of employment, the reduction in working time would be another major contribution. Mr. Balladur says it is unimaginable for France to go it alone in the world: I challenge this erroneous reasoning in its entirety. Firstly, because Germany, the Netherlands, and the Scandinavian countries have a slightly shorter working week. Also, because nobody has suggested an authoritarian, blind, and brutal reduction. Put more simply, everyone knows that if we are to recapture growth we need to work more. What we need is more work to be done by more people. Problems of adjustment are very complex, but the state must assist by supplying the required finance. Moreover, it must stimulate activity in two ways: Through the general law which can provide a framework for future negotiations per sector, and through its policy toward its own salaried workers -- there is nothing to stop it from negotiating within administrations and state-owned companies. There are many other possibilities that depend just on us. The Swedes did not wait for other countries before it created progressive retirement, i.e., the possibility for an employee to move from full-time to two-thirds time to one-third time. He keeps one-third or two-thirds of his salary and receives one-third or two-thirds of his pension, and that gives better results. Another method is applying a surplus tax to overtime in order to gradually start social negotiations for its suppression and replacement by compensatory leave. Then there is the issue of voluntary part-time work. Since this formula provides flexibility, is must be negotiated between the company and the employee. The five-year law does the opposite: It enables the selected work time to be imposed...by the employer! Once again, there are many paths we can take. I admit that I do not understand how a government which has such a comfortable majority can simply opt to do nothing. [LE FIGARO] Are your criticisms of Edouard Balladur aimed more at what he is doing or his method? [Rocard] They are leveled at what he is doing. What is his method? All heads of government negotiate to a greater or lesser extent. For him it is to a lesser extent. [LE FIGARO] The other side to the prime minister's argument is the desire not to be too hard on an already fragile society. Basically, we are not far from the reform by consensus that you wanted to implement when you were prime minister... [Rocard] Yes we are. When a consensus is possible, that is fine, it means that the reforms take deeper root. When it is not, decisions have to be made. Remember the general social contribution (CSG) and urban solidarity, and all those other decisions! I had no comfortable majority. I should add that the most important reforms are not always applied through legislation. I am in particular thinking of the renewal of public service, which I still think is a fundamental reform. Reform is more difficult when you have no absolute majority, but Mr. Balladur has 480 deputies behind him, a large majority in the senate, his friends control 20 of the 22 metropolitan regions, three-quarters of the departments, and one-half of all urban districts. So what is he waiting for to reform? We had none of these advantages. In periods of improving growth, as between 1988 and 1990, it is harder to reform because people cannot see the need as much: There is growth, some money, all you need to do is take people on. In difficult times, it is true, there is the temptation to turn inwards, but people are much more willing to listen. However, not once during the "Heure de la Verite" program did Edouard Balladur give the impression that he had the slightest idea of what France should be like in five or six years' time, not once! How can you expect people to make an effort themselves consisting of accepting reforms when you do not tell them why? I cannot accept the parallel between patience and immobility. Mr. Balladur either makes hasty decisions -- such as on pensions and the increase in the CSG -- or no decisions at all, with the promise of better days being constantly postponed. [LE FIGARO] Can we not already see the first signs of a recovery? [Rocard] The only recovery we can see is a renewed recovery by the right of the positions of power! Mr. Raymond Barre (UDF [Union for French Democracy]) was right when he spoke of the "partial state in disguise." Of course, all governments operate a policy of appointment -- I did. There are quantitative problems of speed and numbers; there are qualitative problems concerning men and women; and there are problems of the political balance of the new appointments. Everywhere, Mr. Balladur is methodically weaving his web. France is not made to be governed by some 30 or so men who, assured of political power, today control the whole banking sector, most of insurance and industry, and almost all the audiovisual sector. The latter area is the most obvious but is far from being the only one. However, when, on top of that, Mr. Balladur blandly claims he only heard about the Canal Plus affair in the press, I would say, to remain polite, that he is rather overestimating the French people's gullibility... [LE FIGARO] Is not a prime minister who is candidate to the presidency of the Republic necessarily inclined to err on the side of caution? [Rocard] I would say that the fact of finding yourself as candidate to the presidency just a few months from the elections should encourage you to implement reforms and launch yourself into the future. [LE FIGARO] In your opinion, then, the fact of being candidate to the presidency of the Republic is more of a spur. [Rocard] Yes, a spur to nurture results and, quite simply, to do what you have to do, what serves the present and prepares for the future. [LE FIGARO] You recently said that it is not the prime minister who determines policy directions... [Rocard] This is a formula that respects the attributions of the president and it appears to me to be profoundly true except, of course, during a period of cohabitation. As Edouard Balladur reminded us, it is then the head of government's job to determine the new policy's direction. [LE FIGARO] Does the current majority risk, during its term of office, encountering the same difficulties the Left encountered? [Rocard] Of course, but it always claimed that these difficulties were specific to the Left. It has been proved that this is not the case. Everything else comes on top of the basic concern generated by unemployment. Since the right has only made a political analysis of our electoral defeat, it did not consider it necessary to reply to this concern. [LE FIGARO] It appears that, at the beginning, you had some problem accepting the "Balladur phenomenon?" [Rocard] It is more in my nature to act than to demolish. I readily accept that I found it hard to apprehend what you call the "Balladur phenomenon." Since I do not like personal attacks and I do not like systematic criticism, I was caught in an awkward situation. However, Mr. Edouard Balladur determined the issue himself. It began with the announcement on the same day of 17,000 public company layoffs. The prime minister -- already -- said he had not been informed! Then there was Air France, then the Iranians wrested from the Swiss justice authorities, then the Falloux law, then the fishing disputes, it all started then... [LE FIGARO] What, in your opinion, has been the prime minister's biggest mistake? [Rocard] It is not a mistake, but a constant feature... perhaps of his character. The man who refused to meet with the fishermen is the same man who, in 1986, abolished the wealth tax. [LE FIGARO] Do you feel you have time to rebuild the Left and prepare its candidate for the presidential election? [Rocard] Yes. At the time when it took 23 years for a president to be replaced, you needed 10 years to prepare for the presidential elections. Now we know it can be done in just 23 months, so draw your own conclusions. [LE FIGARO] To gather the whole of the Left you need to adopt a policy of breaking away. Will you choose to break away from the past history of the Left or break away from the present of the Right? [Rocard] Break away, indeed! I think, on the contrary, that we must build on an assumed past to offer a vision of the future. Our party conference established our relations with the past, successes and failures, and without any complacency. I am one of the rare political leaders to have published a self-critical review. We need add nothing more. Now, the "PS house" is in reasonable order, our meetings go well, the active party members no longer always react according to events but in the aim of party progress. Similarly, we still have four major meetings planned to follow up on the Conference for Social Transformation. This is the first time since the beginning of the century that the whole of the Left is working together and that all sides agreed to have an open debate. It is with that and on that basis that we are going to build the project for society that we want to offer the French people. [LE FIGARO] Thus, you favor progress based on thematic affinities rather than renewing alliances? [Rocard] Yes. Nothing is more solid than shared convictions. The idea of agreements between party leaderships is an archaic one. Today's electorate is more changing, rather concerned, and very widely spread. Its capacity for gathering around a cause cannot be negotiated among the main political leaders. No one has a right to society's votes. That being said, aggression is not the right way to prepare for a second round of voting, either, as we saw in March 1993. The word "alliance" does not adequately describe the process that can occur. As for having an innovative imagination, I think we will be good enough. However, the main thrust of our future action consists less of looking for necessarily new ideas than applying ideas that already exist. An idea remains new for as long as it is not put into practice. It is true of the European New Deal, and it is true of the four-day working week. Having said that, that does not exclude us from coming up with new suggestions. [LE FIGARO] Who do you fear more in the second round of the presidential elections, Edouard Balladur or Jacques Chirac? [Rocard] I really do not care, since the problem lies elsewhere. Either we are not capable of a political rebirth and anyone can beat us, or we are capable and we can beat anyone.
