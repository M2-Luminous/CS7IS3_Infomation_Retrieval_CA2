The Russian Foreign Ministry did not take part in agreeing the document. Grigoriy Karasin, director of the press and information directorate of the Russian Foreign Ministry said this at a briefing today. It is necessary to study the contents of the document, he said, and then we will give a really qualified assessment of its contents through diplomatic channels. The Russian diplomat did not rule out that explanations would possibly be provided in a different form. Karasin stressed that he was against attaching unnecessary sensationalism to the matter. It should be sorted out, we should look at the document, at its wording, and who presented it, and after that we will promulgate our official point of view, he said. According to him, the Russian ambassador in Riga was invited to the Latvian Foreign Ministry where he had talks on the matter. Military aspects of bilateral relations between Russia and Latvia were resolved and are reflected in relevant agreements initialed by the two countries. We confirm once again, the Russian diplomat said, that we adhere to the agreements. We regard Skrunde as a facility and not a military base, so there cannot be questions here.
