Now a subdivision of exceptional importance to public health is taking action. PRAVDA UKRAINY interviewed Chairman V.G. Belyavskiy of the Drug Control Committee of the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, doctor of medical sciences. We will begin with a few words about him. He is a well-known toxicologist and he heads a laboratory in the Scientific Research Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, where he has been working for 25 years. [Vilenskiy] Vladimir Gavrilovich, what is the moral and legal platform of the committee you head? [Belyavskiy] The committee was established in accordance with the decision of the Ukrainian National Security Council "On the Status of the Struggle Against the Drug Traffic in Ukraine." No one is likely to disagree with the statement that an effective struggle against the drug menace necessitates the united efforts of all state and public organizations. The creation of the National Coordinating Council To Combat Drug Abuse could be viewed as the first step, and the next logical step was the creation of a special agency of the Ukrainian Ministry of Health to establish control over the production and distribution of medicines containing narcotic substances. That is how our committee came into being. [Vilenskiy] How will it operate? [Belyavskiy] First of all, we will be guided by the articles of the UN Convention on Narcotic Substances (1961) and the UN Convention on Psychotropic Drugs (1971) and by Ukrainian laws. Now that our state is effectively on its own in the fight against the expanding drug traffic, we need a new and more responsible approach to the import and export of drugs and semimanufactured products containing narcotic and psychotropic substances. Their inclusion in legal records, the issuance of permits to establishments and institutions for the use of these substances for scientific and medical purposes, the drafting of drug use standards in medicine and science, and the replacement of those that might lead to pathological addiction are the responsibility of the new committee. This is far from a complete list of what we plan to do. After all, there are no secondary issues in today's world of medicines and drugs. Incidentally, certificates of authorization to import and export narcotic drugs have already been approved. Now these regulating documents of the Drug Control Committee will be obligatory. The statute on the committee was approved by the Ukrainian Ministry of Health and Ministry of Internal Affairs. The committee members are medical experts and pharmacologists, as well as representatives of the Ukrainian Supreme Court, Security Service, Customs Service, Ministry of Justice, and ministries of foreign and internal affairs. Therefore, it is an interdepartmental subdivision on the state level. [Vilenskiy] Vladimir Gavrilovich, you have a draft of the law of Ukraine on the procedure for handling narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances, and precursors on your desk. Our readers probably have not heard anything about it.... [Belyavskiy] I will begin by clarifying the terminology. Narcotic drugs are the plants and compounds described as such in international conventions and categorized as such by our committee. Then there are the psychotropic drugs that can be dangerous to human health because of their psychological effects. Finally, precursors are the substances and salts used as chemical raw material in the production of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. The draft law consists of 33 sections covering this whole complex sphere. The passage of the law will be of inestimable importance to the future of Ukraine. [Vilenskiy] As far as I know, the law also restricts the cultivation of opium poppies and several strains of hemp used as narcotic raw materials. [Belyavskiy] Yes, and this is of vital importance. Besides this, it also proposes a new type of prescription for narcotic and psychotropic drugs. Medicine needs these drugs, but strict records will be kept of all prescription forms to guard against forgery. Each prescription will be recorded in a register, and receipts will confirm the legal acquisition of the drugs. In other words, the law will stipulate specific procedures for the physician and the pharmacist. It should guard us against drug abuse and protect the health care system from encroachments by the "black market."
