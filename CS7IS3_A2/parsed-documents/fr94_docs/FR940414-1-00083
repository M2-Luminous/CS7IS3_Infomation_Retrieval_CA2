The labor cost share of production value for compliance equipment manufacturing is based on the input-output composition of the Heating, Plumbing, and Fabricated Structural Metal Products Industry (Bureau of Economic Analysis industry classification 40). The labor share of production value for compliance equipment installation is based on information for the Repair and Maintenance Construction Industry (Bureau of Economic Analysis industry classification 12). 2 Annualized over 10 years at the social discount rate of 7 percent. 3 Number of jobs calculated on the basis of an average hourly labor cost of $17.21 and 2,080 hours per labor-year. 2. Indirect and Induced Labor Requirements of Complying With the PFPR Rule In addition to its direct labor effects, the PFPR effluent guideline may also generate labor requirements through the indirect and induced effect mechanisms described above. EPA assessed the indirect and induced employment effects by use of multipliers that relate aggregate economic effects, including indirect and induced effects, to direct economic effects. Using a range of multipliers from previous studies of the aggregate employment effects of general water treatment and pollution control expenditures, EPA estimated that the total labor requirement effect of the Option 3/S rule would range from 353 to 523 full-time equivalent positions. The lower end of this range reflects the use of lower multiplier values and conservative assumptions regarding effects on economic activity in industries linked to the PFPR industry. The higher end of the range reflects the higher multiplier values and assumes full incurrence of indirect economic effects in industries linked to the PFPR industry. J. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of PSES Options In addition to the foregoing analyses, the Agency has performed a cost-effectiveness analysis. Cost-effectiveness analysis compares the total annualized cost incurred for a regulatory option to the corresponding effectiveness of that option in reducing the discharge of pollutants. Cost-effectiveness calculations are used in setting effluent limitations guidelines to compare the efficiency of one regulatory option is removing pollutants to another regulatory option. Cost-effectiveness is defined as the incremental annual cost of a pollution control option in an industry subcategory per incremental pollutant removal. The increments are considered relative to another option or to a benchmark, such as existing treatment. Pollutant removals are measured in copper based ``pounds-equivalent.'' The cost-effectiveness value, therefore, represents the unit cost of removing the next pound-equivalent (lb eq.) of pollutant. While not required by the Clean Water Act, cost-effectiveness analysis is a useful tool for evaluating regulatory options for the removal of toxic pollutants. Cost-effectiveness analysis is not intended to analyze the removal of conventional pollutants (oil and grease, biological oxygen demand, and total suspended solids). The removal of conventional pollutants is therefore not addressed. For each of the regulatory options, the estimated pounds-equivalent removed were calculated by weighting the number of pounds of each pollutant removed by the relative toxic weighting factor for each pollutant. The use of pounds-equivalent gives correspondingly more weight to more highly toxic pollutants. Thus, for a given expenditure and pounds of pollutants removed, the cost per pound-equivalent removed would be lower when more highly toxic pollutants are removed than if pollutants of lesser toxicity are removed. Cost-effectiveness is calculated as the ratio of the incremental annual costs to the incremental pounds-equivalent removed for each option. So that comparisons of the cost-effectiveness among other regulated industries may be made, annual costs for all cost-effectiveness analyses are reported in 1981 dollars. Table 14 provides estimates of the total annualized compliance costs, in 1981 dollars, and the total pollutant removals in pounds and pounds-equivalent. Table 15 lists estimates of the incremental cost-effectiveness of the regulatory options.
