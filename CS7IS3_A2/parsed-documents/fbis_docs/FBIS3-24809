In the discussions, Prof. (Sory) commended the British Government for the positive steps taken in resuming aid to Sierra Leone. Baroness Chalker informed the high commissioner that the British Government will release 2 million pounds to the Sierra Leone Government to offset and cushion the effects of the structural adjustment program. Prof. (Sory) referred to releases made by the World Bank and the IMF, which, he said, clearly suggests that the NPRC [National Provisional Ruling Council] Government has been able to effect conditionalities imposed by the two international organizations who are, by all indications, quite happy with the economic performance of the NPRC Government. Prof. (Sory), however, noted that the rebel incursion has been concentrated in the economically important and viable areas of Sierra Leone and, to a greater extent, has dealt a severe blow in the strife toward the country's economic emancipation. High Commissioner (Sory) said that with the arrival of OAU-sponsored troops in Liberia, there is a possibility for faction leader Charles Taylor to disarm, a move which will increase the chances of peace returning to Sierra Leone, and a more greater possibility for a revival of the country's economy. On returning Sierra Leone to civilian rule, Prof. (Sory) pointed out that the NPRC will do everything possible to adhere to the transition program. Baroness Lynda Chalker in her reply expressed delight that the NPRC Government has produced a detailed transition program and expressed the wish to be kept informed about the work of the National Commission for Democracy. Touching on the issue of the four Vietnamese holding British passports now facing prison charges in Freetown, Mrs. Chalker hoped the matter would be resolved quickly in the courts through proper and acceptable legal procedures. Both Prof. (Sory) and Baroness Chalker discussed plans for the inauguration of the Sierra Leone- United Kingdom Chamber of Commerce due to take place on 4 February.
