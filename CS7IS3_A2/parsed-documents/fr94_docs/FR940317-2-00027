FR940317-2-00027 FR940317-2-00017 IV. Final Surplus Power Marketing Plan A. Conditions for Allocation Allocations of surplus energy will be made in accordance with the provisions of the Marketing Plan. These provisions include: 1. No energy will be allocated for export outside the Juneau market area (that is, the AEL&P service territory) without firm plans and commitment to finance and build the necessary transmission facilities. 2. In allocating surplus energy, APA will give preference to public bodies and cooperatives who conduct utility-type operations. 3. Surplus energy not allocated to preference customers may be available to serve major industrial loads. For this marketing plan, a major industrial load is one which does not conduct utility-type operations and whose major load is not currently served as a firm load by AEL&P. The major industrial load must also have the capability to meet its own baseload energy requirement in the long-term absence of Snettisham energy. Major industrial loads are encouraged to work directly with AEL&P so that AEL&P can request an allocation to serve their needs. In this case, allocations will be made to AEL&P. APA will consider requests for direct service of major industrial loads only if it is demonstrated that service through the utility is infeasible. B. Contract Provisions Entities receiving an allocation of Snettisham resources will be offered an electric service contract which will include the following provisions: 1. Contracts will be for a period of 20 years or less beginning at contract execution. Contracts for less than 20 years may include an option to extend the period up to a total length of 20 years. Contracts will be compatible with the proposed APA divestiture. Contracts will contain language guaranteeing the continuation of the allocation after divestiture. 2. Surplus energy will be marketed at the Snettisham firm rate. The rate is presently 3.21 cents/kwh and is subject to periodic review and adjustment. 3. The contractor will be required to sign a contract within 270 days of APA's letter granting an allocation. 4. In order to reserve the allocation, the contractor will be required to deposit 10% of the expected cost of the following year's energy with APA. If the allocated energy is taken during the year, the deposit will be credited toward the cost of the energy. To the extent that energy is available for delivery, if the allocation is not completely taken the deposit is non-refundable. In any year, energy reserved in this way but not taken by the contractor may be marketed by APA. In any case, an applicant must be ready, willing, and able to take initial delivery of power by January 1, 1997 or the allocation will be withdrawn and the energy reallocated. 5. If the contractor has not committed to a 20-year contract, the contractor will be required to pay a one-time, non-refundable payment within 30 days after contract execution. This payment will be based on 3% of the average estimated annual energy delivery during the years between the end of the contract period and the 20-year period times each year less than 20 years. C. Amount Available for Allocation Firm energy output (energy available 9 years out of 10) from the Snettisham Project is estimated at 275 gwh/year. Secondary energy is estimated to vary from 0 to 100 gwh/year and average around 50 gwh/year. This invitation is for requests for allocation for energy that is surplus to the needs of the Juneau community. An estimate of that need is shown in the table below. Applicants must be aware that these are only estimates and that the amount of energy required by the community may vary from these projections. In the event that there are competing requests from qualified applicants, the surplus energy will be divided equally among the applicants up to their maximum request. ‚ê£ 1Water community energy surplus: year 1Estimated requirement 1Estimated available 1994 232 93 1995 242 83 1996 250 75 1997 255 70 1998 258 67 1999 259 66 2000 260 65 2001 263 62 2002 264 61 2003 266 59 2004 267 58 2005 270 55 2006 271 54 2007 274 51 2008 275 50 2009 277 48 2010 278 47 2011 281 44 2012 282 43 2013 285 40 Issued at Juneau, Alaska; February 24, 1994.
