This has been reported by the Hamburg STERN magazine [to be published on 10 March]. The Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] found a document among Stasi files in which Weinrich noted that the "President of the United States of America" was a targeted person and where he described the weapons he needed: "Two Beretta submachine guns and handguns with silencers." Weinrich is regarded as the brain behind the attack on the "Maison de France," the French cultural center in Berlin. In the 25 August 1983 attack, one man was killed and 23 persons injured. It has been learned from legal circles in Berlin that the state prosecutor also has information that might point to a possible assassination plan. However, in this connection no preliminary investigations have been initiated yet against Weinrich, who is regarded as close confidant of top terrorist "Carlos." The investigating state prosecutor in the "Maison de France" case has meanwhile confirmed that an international arrest warrant has been issued against Weinrich for aiding and abetting murder. In addition, another arrest warrant was issued in connection with Weinrich's role in the attack against the Saudi Arabian ambassador in Athens in 1983. The ambassador survived the attack only by coincidence. The state prosecutor has further announced that he would soon request a third arrest warrant against Weinrich, namely in connection with the attack against "Radio Free Europe" in Munich in 1981, when many people were severely injured. According to the information of German security authorities, Weinrich is in Syria at the moment. The FRG has requested that the Arab country extradite Weinrich.
