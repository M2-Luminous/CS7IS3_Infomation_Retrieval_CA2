Sharing a 97-kilometer border line with Vietnam, the city is 187 kilometers north of Hanoi, capital of Vietnam, and 231 kilometers south of Nanning City, capital of China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Now Pingxiang has two import and export posts managed by the state and five exit posts managed by local government. Its railway and highway connect with those in Vietnam and the city now has become one of the major passages from China to Vietnam and other countries in Southeast Asia. In 1992, the State Council approved making the city an open city at the border and to set up a border economic cooperation zone of 7.2 square kilometers. From 1984 when China and Vietnam began to normalize their relations, the border trade between Pingxiang City and its Vietnamese counterpart has increased rapidly. The transaction volume of the trade between the two sides reached 776 million yuan last year. Moreover, Pingxiang City held a border commodity fair in the year, which was attended by about 3,000 Chinese and foreign businessmen. The fair's transaction value was about 2.3 billion yuan. This July, Pingxiang will also sponsor a national border trade fair. It is learned that more than 1,000 units and individuals from both at home and overseas have sent letters to the organizing committee of the fair to register to participate in the fair.
