Agnes Papp interviewed the prime minister there. [Begin recording] [Papp] What is your opinion about the result of the latest survey, which shows that 40 percent of the population is vacillating about going to the ballot boxes at all? [Boross] I hope that at least half of them will decide to go. [Papp] What turnout do you expect? [Boross] It is impossible to estimate. [passage omitted] [Papp] What sort of campaign do you expect, regarding the tone? [Boross] I am not very optimistic. If the tone of the campaign is to remain fair and clean, both the press and political players should make some sort of pledge. [Papp] Prime Minister, very many people are concerned that the extremists will get too loud and the style of the campaign will deteriorate because of this. To what extent do you share these worries? [Boross] If there are less provocative voices and less inciting protestations to keep up tension, than less extremism will occur. For extremism is often a reaction to something. [Papp] What sort of protests do you mean? [Boross] All kinds of protests, petitions, in writing, in articles. [passage omitted] At this moment extremists do not constitute any political danger and their upsetting the political balance is inconceivable. [Papp] Let me quote to you another opinion poll result: The MDF's [Hungarian Democratic Forum] election chances of a victory are declining, while at the same time, the HSP's [Hungarian Socialist Party] chances of a victory are increasing. How do you see this? [Boross] It cannot be denied that the HSP's position at the moment is better than four years ago. [passage omitted] I think that the Democratic Forum will achieve a better result at the elections than its rivals expect. [Papp] You warned about a kind of left-wing danger. How should one interpret this? [Boross] I observe with regret that the HSP seems to be drifting to the left. In the countryside, the old boys are reappearing among the ranks of the party. [passage omitted] Hungarian political life could very well do without this. That is, that a structure already removed from the agenda -- in some sort of new form -- should be revived. It is not even in the interest of the HSP, but the party probably cannot resist the temptation. [Papp] What is your party's relationship with the other two opposition parties? [Boross] I cannot envisage a coalition with the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] as long as it is led by the hard core. In my mind, more and more, the SZDSZ represents two parties: That particular hard core, which is of left-wing tradition and left-wing ideology converging toward the HSP, and another bourgeois-middle trend, which I cannot imagine embracing the HSP at any time. I think that the hard core is stronger, but this other trend has a larger number. Looking at the Fidesz [Alliance of Young Democrats] transformation from the start, it has taken on a national-liberal profile, which is taken seriously by them, it seems. Naturally, the national-liberal trend is a lot more to my taste than the liberal trend without the national adjective.
