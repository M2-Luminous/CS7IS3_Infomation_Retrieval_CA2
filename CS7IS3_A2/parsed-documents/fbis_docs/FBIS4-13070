FBIS4-13070 "drnes074dd_94010" FBIS-NES-94-074 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs 'Arafat Interview on Rabin, Gaza, Jericho Reported 'Arafat Interview on Rabin, Gaza, Jericho Reported TA1504112694 TA1504112694 BFN [Editorial Report] Tel Aviv SHISHI in Hebrew on 15 April in page 4 carries a 1,000-word report on an interview with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat by 'Uzi Mahanaymi conducted on 11 April at PLO headquarters in Tunis. Referring to Rabin, 'Arafat says: "I am pragmatic. I see things as they are. The man does not want to give me Gaza and Jericho." Moreover, he says, "Rabin regrets the whole business. Believe me." Mahanaymi asks him why should he not accept what Rabin promised, Gaza and Jericho, and then worry about the details. Shaking his head, 'Arafat replies: "Rabin does not want to give me Gaza and Jericho. I am sure about it." Asked whether he can afford not to accept Gaza and Jericho or complete what he started in Washington, the PLO leader replies: "I can wait. I have waited so many years, I can wait another 10 years. Just you wait and see what happens when I come out and tell the world that the process failed and why it did. You will see the reaction then. I have patience. I can wait." Moreover, 'Arafat notes, "I could have done business with Begin. I could have done business with Dayan. You know what -- even with Shamir I could." Asked why he should not meet Rabin to break the stalemate, 'Arafat replies: "There is no point to it. A meeting will not bring about a breakthrough." When Mahanaymi remarks that Rabin could divert his efforts to talks with Syria, whereas he had crossed the point of no return, 'Arafat answers: "I have patience. I am patient, I have all the time in the world." He goes on to say: "It takes two to tango, right? The same goes for peace. They do not want to. So, what can I do?" Commenting on the way Israel conducts the negotiations, he says: "They came to me in Cairo with their walkie-talkies. Everybody has his own personal walkie-talkie. They call Israel. They step out to the garden and speak. One reports to Baraq, another reports to Peres, and the third reports to Rabin. Is that the way to work? I swear to you, President Mubarak was kept waiting four hours until they finished all their talking. "I will not forget what happened with Peres. We came to talk business, and all of a sudden he gets on the walkie-talkie with Rabin. I saw his hair stand on end and his mood change. "And then there was the business of adjourning the talks because of Holocaust Remembrance Day. What was this all about? If Remembrance Day was the reason, then how do you explain that the economic talks in Paris continued? Not only did they hold talks on Remembrance Day, but also on the Sabbath. So, what is going on here? The economic talks are more important than the political talks. And, if they were really adjourned because of Remembrance Day, why did the Paris talks continue that day?" Asked where the Americans come into the picture, 'Arafat "does not reply, and makes a dismissive gesture with his hand." Wrapping up the interview, Mahanaymi asks 'Arafat the same question he has asked him for years: "Can a Western and European-oriented Israel, unwilling to assimilate into its environment, survive in the Middle East?" The PLO leader reported "smiled, but was not prepared to answer this question either."
