FR940527-2-00112 FR940527-2-00094 Under the proposal, the Department must be a party to the settlement agreement. In authorizing the transaction that would otherwise be prohibited, the Department will give appropriate consideration to whether such transaction is in the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries and is an appropriate measure for inclusion in a settlement of issues uncovered during the investigation. Accordingly, relief is limited to those transactions which have been authorized by the Department pursuant to a settlement agreement, following the Department's investigation. The Department notes that the proposed exemption is intended only to facilitate the implementation of settlement agreements where the proposed transaction agreed to by the parties as part of such settlement involves a separate prohibited transaction. Thus, the proposed exemption should not be construed as a substitute for compliance with the statutory requirements of ERISA and the Code. Individuals desiring to engage in any other transaction that is prohibited under section 406 of ERISA, and is not the subject of an existing administrative or statutory exemption, must seek exemption relief in accordance with the Department's exemption procedures. 5 5 See 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B, (55 FR 32836, August 10, 1990) Second, the proposal requires that a transaction or activity, in order to be covered by the exemption, must be specifically authorized or required in writing by the terms of the settlement agreement with the Department. This condition is intended to limit the application of the class exemption to situations where it is clear that the Department has considered the appropriateness of the transaction or activity for which the exemption is provided. The requirement of a writing is necessary to avoid subsequent disputes concerning the nature of the exempted transaction. Third, the proposed exemption requires that written notice of the transaction or activity be given by a party who is to engage in the transaction or activity to all affected participants and beneficiaries in advance of the transaction or activity taking place so that the PWBA office will have sufficient time to consider any comments. In addition, a copy of the notice and the method of distribution must be approved in advance by the PWBA area or district office which conducted the investigation and negotiated the settlement. The notice must include an objective description of the transaction or activity, the address of the PWBA area or district office that conducted the investigation and negotiated the settlement, and a statement apprising participants and beneficiaries of their right to forward their comments to such office. The purpose of this notice requirement is to afford affected participants and beneficiaries the opportunity to provide relevant information to the PWBA area or district office. This notice requirement should not be construed as conferring any additional procedural obligations upon the Department; nor does it require any further action by the Department prior to completion of the transaction or activity. The proposed exemption does not specify the manner in which notice must be provided to participants and beneficiaries. However, it is the Department's intent that notice be provided in such a manner that is reasonably calculated to result in its receipt by all participants and beneficiaries at least 30 days prior to entry into the settlement agreement. Finally, the proposal requires compliance with all other conditions of the exemption before the transaction or activity occurs. The purpose of the proposed exemption is to provide an exemption for an otherwise prohibited transaction or activity that is undertaken at the behest of the Department to rectify the violations of ERISA. The proposal is not intended to serve as a retroactive exemption for transactions that are in progress or have already occurred a the time of the settlement with the Department. Notice to Interested Persons Because many participants, plans, fiduciaries and parties in interests with respect to plans could conceivably be considered interested persons, the only practical form of notice of the proposed exemption is publication in the Federal Register .
