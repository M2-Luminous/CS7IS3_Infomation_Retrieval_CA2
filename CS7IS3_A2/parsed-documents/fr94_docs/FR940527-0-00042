Thibodeau, Marine Science Technician Second Class, U.S. Coast Guard, Aids to Navigation & Waterways Management Branch, Ninth Coast Guard District, 1240 East 9th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44199&hyph;2060, (216) 522&hyph;3990. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good cause exists for making them effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures would have been impracticable. The application to hold this event was not received by the Commander, Ninth Coast Guard District until May 2, 1994, and there was not sufficient time remaining to a publish proposed rule in advance of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date. Drafting Information The drafters of this regulation is Scott J. Smith, Lieutenant Junior Grade, U.S. Coast Guard, Project Officer, Aids to Navigation & Waterways Management Branch and Karen E. Lloyd, Lieutenant, U.S. Coast Guard, Project Attorney, Ninth Coast Guard District Legal Office. Discussion of Regulation The Tallship Erie 94 will be held on Presque Isle Bay and Lake Erie on July 8, 1994. This regulation restricts general navigation on Presque Isle Bay and Erie Harbor from the Perry's Landing to Erie Harbor Entrance Lighted Buoy 2 (LLNR 3520). This event will have an estimated 15&hyph;20, 70&hyph;200 foot sailing ships, parading in a closed course on Lake Erie and will have an usually large concentration of spectator vessels which could pose hazards to navigation in the area. This regulation is necessary to ensure the protection of life, limb, and property during this event. Any vessel desiring to transit the regulated area may do so only with prior approval of the Patrol Commander (Officer in Charger, U.S. Cost Guard Station Erie, PA). This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of part 165. Federalism Implications This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c of Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, they are categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. Economic Assessment and Certification This regulatin is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportatin (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of the DOT is unecessary. Collection of Information This regulation will impose no collection information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
