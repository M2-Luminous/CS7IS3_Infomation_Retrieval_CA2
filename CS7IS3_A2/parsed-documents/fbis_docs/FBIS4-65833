Announcing what constituted in his opinion an "important element for conclusion" of the negotiations on the Charter in June, Council President Theodoros Pangalos, Greek deputy foreign minister, was in fact only announcing the event a little early: The Committee of Permanent Representatives put the finishing touches on these conclusions at its meeting on Wednesday [18 May] and the decision will be taken formally (without debate) at the Transport Council on 25 May. EUROPE recalls that the European Energy Charter was signed in The Hague on 17 December 1991. Its purpose is to create the framework of an effective European energy market making energy supplies secure, improving energy yield and limiting the negative effects of energy generation on the environment. Negotiations on the conclusion of a treaty have been in progress since September 1991 under the chairmanship of Dutch Ambassador Rutten in order to give the undertakings made with regard to the Charter a sound and binding international legal basis. Mr. Rutten presented a compromise text on 22 April last for debate at the plenary session of the signatory countries of the Charter scheduled for the week of 6 June. The Twelve are preparing to take a position on this compromise in the following terms. 1. The European Union reaffirms its conviction that the conclusion, at an early date, of a substantial European Energy Charter Treaty is important not only for the future economic development of the European continent, but also for political stability in the world and the future of international relations. 2. At the initiative of the European Union, the Chairman of the Conference on the European Energy Charter agreed to draw up a final draft compromise of the Charter, which he presented to the parties on 22 April 1994. The EU considers that this text constitutes a solid basis for concluding the negotiations and will incontestably facilitate agreement at the upcoming and final plenary session in June 1994. 3. Nevertheless, to attain this objective, improvements must still be made in a certain number of areas. These include questions of trade and investments, as well as the need to ensure that the trade provisions of the European Energy Charter are fully compatible with the relevant provisions in the Treaties or agreements concluded or to be concluded in this spirit, and in particular the agreements negotiated or to be negotiated with Central and Eastern European countries, as well as the Republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 4. The EU will approach the final session in June with the will to reach an agreement on a global compromise, depending on satisfactory solutions to its fundamental concerns. It reaffirms its commitment to signing such an agreement, along with, it hopes, all other parties to the negotiations and is convinced that the latter will adopt the same attitude. 5. If the June plenary session does not lead to a satisfactory solution, the European Union will examine the best way of proceeding. It will, however, do all it can for negotiations to succeed and is convinced that all the other partners in the negotiations will do the same. [passage omitted]
