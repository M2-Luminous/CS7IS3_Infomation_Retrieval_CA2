Both of them reaffirmed the position of wanting to conclude the negotiations in the auto sector by the time of the Japan-U.S. summit in February. But debate on setting numerical targets is still ongoing with no differences in views being narrowed. Under Secretary Garten said: "We are not seeking managed trade. Nor are we seeking to set the numberical targets as objective criteria." But he added, "We need criteria to measure the degree of progress made" if trade balance in the auto sector, which remains a large factor in Japan's huge trade surplus, is to be improved. On the other hand, Okamatsu emphasized once again that Japan would continue to reject the setting of numerical targets as a way of measuring the degree of foreign products' entry into the Japanese market. Regarding the fact that the United States is pressing Japan to open its market, citing higher shares which foreign products hold in other major nations, Okamatsu insisted that "foreign products' share in the United States is not much different from their share in Japan" if the products from NAFTA member nations are excluded. He thus called on the United States to rethink its idea on criteria.
