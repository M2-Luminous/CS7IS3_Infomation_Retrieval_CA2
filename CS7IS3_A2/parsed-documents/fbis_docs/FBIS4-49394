The 19-member expedition, headed by Bryan Moon, former vice-president of Northwest Airlines of the United States, has ended its search of the wreckage of the No. 15 bomber in the Xiangshan Bay. Commanded by General Doolittle, a squadron of U.S. bombers launched America's first air strike on Tokyo during World War II on April 18, 1942. The bombers were scheduled to land at the airport in Quzhou, Zhejiang Province, but lost contact with the airport while returning from their mission. The airmen had to parachute from their planes after they ran out of fuel. It has been verified that six bombers crashed in Zhejiang Province and that 27 airmen were rescued by local residents and returned home, while three died. Three bombers crashed in the sea off Xiangshan County near Ningbo city. Ten airmen in bombers No. 7 and No. 15 were rescued by local residents, and returned home. Two airmen of No. 6 bomber were drowned and three others were rescued. While escorting the pilots to the rear, ten local residents were shot dead by Japanese soldiers. Attending the meeting on May 4 were seven local residents participating in the rescue operation 52 years ago and three descendents of the rescuers. Two of the seven rescuers are 82 years old and two are women. Also attending was Henry Potter, 76, a pilot in the squadron commanded by General Doolittle. Potter is a member of the American expedition. On behalf of the rescued pilots, their families and the American people, Moon extended sincere thanks to the Chinese rescuers and their descendents. Two American expedition members read two letters of thanks on behalf of Ted Lawson, a crewman with the No. 7 bomber, and Griffith Williams, a crewman of the No. 15 bomber, respectively. Other members gave the rescuers badges in commemoration of the friendship between the Chinese and American peoples. The expedition members and rescuers vowed to carry forward the friendship cemented 52 years ago.
