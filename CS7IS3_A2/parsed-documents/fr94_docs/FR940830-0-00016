FR940830-0-00016 FR940830-0-00005 E. Application Review Standards and Regulatory Streamlining The OTS proposed to incorporate into revised §563.22 the approval standards, definitional provisions and other provisions of the OTS's merger and transfer of assets policy statement found at 12 CFR 571.5. The proposal requested comment on whether any of the standards in §571.5 should be streamlined, clarified or otherwise modified or deleted in connection with their incorporation into §563.22. One commenter stated that some of the review criteria in §571.5 went beyond the standards applicable to transactions under sections 5(d)(3) of the FDIA and 10(s) of the HOLA, and therefore should not be considered by the OTS in reviewing applications under these statutes. Section 571.5 set forth not only the review standards for transactions under sections 5(d)(3) and 18(c) of the FDIA and 10(s) of the HOLA, but also general safety and soundness considerations applicable to all transfer transactions and combinations involving savings associations. Thus, the OTS believes it is appropriate to retain these review criteria. However, certain of the detailed criteria addressed in §571.5, for example those pertaining to retention of attorneys and other professionals, tie-in transactions, and fees paid in connection with transactions, are considered by OTS as part of the overall evaluation of the managerial and financial resources and future prospects of the savings associations involved in a combination or transfer transaction. The OTS believes that the detail of certain criteria is not necessary and that general standards are more appropriate for an evaluation of the safety and soundness of a given transaction. Accordingly, §563.22(d) of the final rule has been revised to incorporate streamlined and consolidated review standards derived from §571.5, and §571.5 has been deleted. F. Other Issues One commenter requested that the OTS clarify whether section 10(s)(3) of the HOLA (and §552.13(b)(1) as set forth in the proposal) precludes transfer or consolidation transactions where a resulting institution would own the shares of one or more constituent institutions. In OTS's view, section 10(s)(3) of the HOLA does not prohibit a Federal savings association from acquiring the stock of another insured depository institution and holding the other depository institution as a subsidiary. Section 10(s) was designed to cure what had been viewed as a statutory impediment to mergers or other combinations between a savings association and other types of insured depository institutions. 11 Section 10(s) was not established to bar transactions that are permissible under other, existing authority. Moreover, neither the text of section 502 of FDICIA nor its legislative history indicate that Congress intended section 10(s)(3) to override any separate legal authority for such an acquisition. 11 The primary impediment was section 5(d)(3) of the HOLA, which, in pertinent part, authorizes the OTS to provide for the merger of savings associations with other savings associations, but is silent as to whether savings associations could merge with other types of depository institutions. For many years, the OTS, and its predecessor, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, viewed the lack of express authorization for cross-industry mergers as, in effect, a prohibition on such transactions. Federal savings associations, therefore, may acquire the shares of another insured depository institution and hold the acquired entity as a subsidiary if the legal authority for the transaction derives from a source other than section 10(s) of the HOLA. Such legal authority may be found, for example, under the service corporation provisions of the HOLA, and the OTS service corporation and operating subsidiary regulations. 12 12 12 U.S.C. 1464(c)(4)(B); 12 CFR 545.74 and 545.81. Accordingly, the final regulations provide that a Federal savings association may ``combine'' with any depository institution (subject to compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and certain other provisions), and define the term ``combination'' as a ``merger or consolidation with another depository institution, or an acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets or assumption of all or substantially all of the liabilities of a depository institution by another depository institution.'' One commenter questioned the OTS's authority to require any filing from a savings association proposing to convert to a bank charter or merge or transfer all of its assets to a bank. This commenter also questioned the necessity of any filing with the OTS in view of the requirement under the BMA that the OTS be provided with a copy of the application filed with the regulatory agency of the resulting depository institution. The filing requirements in the regulations as adopted enable the OTS, consistent with its broad responsibilities under the HOLA and other statutes, to ensure safe and sound operation of savings associations, identify any pending or potential supervisory concerns or enforcement actions involving the savings associations that are parties to the transaction, and, at a minimum, advise the appropriate regulatory agency regarding these concerns. The procedures are not contrary to any of the provisions of section 5(d) of the FDIA, and, in fact, represent a significant simplification of long-standing OTS application and approval requirements, which have been upheld by the courts.
