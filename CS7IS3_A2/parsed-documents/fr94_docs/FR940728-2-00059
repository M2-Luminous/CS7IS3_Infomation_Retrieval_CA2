FR940728-2-00059 FR940728-2-00045 [FRL&hyph;5022&hyph;6] The State of New York; Adequacy Determination of State Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of Tentative Determination on Application of the State of New York for Full Program Adequacy Determination, Public Hearing and Public Comment Period. SUMMARY: Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR Part 258). RCRA Section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribe Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribe permit programs provide for interaction between State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by Part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities. The State of New York applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed New York's MSWLF application and certain revisions thereto, and made a tentative determination that all portions of New York's MSWLF permit program are adequate to assure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria. New York's application for program adequacy determination and its revisions are available for public review and comment. Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a hearing on any determination to approve a State/Tribe's MSWLF program, the Region has scheduled two public hearings on this tentative determination. Details appear below in the DATES section. DATES: All comments on New York's application for a determination of adequacy must be received by the close of business on September 13, 1994. Two public hearings will be held in New York State. Both hearings will begin at 7:00 p.m. The First hearing will be held on September 12, 1994 at the Quality Inn Hotel which is located on Interstate 90 and Everett Road in Albany, New York. The second hearing will be held on September 13, 1994 in the Katie Murphy Amphitheater which is located in the Fashion Institute of Technology, 7th Avenue at 27th Street in New York City. New York State will participate in the public hearings held by EPA on this subject. ADDRESSES: Copies of New York's application for adequacy are available between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. at the following two addresses for inspection and copying: U.S. EPA Region II Library, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 402, New York, New York, 10278, telephone (212) 264&hyph;2881, and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, 50 Wolf Road, Albany, New York 12233&hyph;0001 in the Office of the Division of Solid Waste. Written comments should be sent to Stanley Siegel, Chief, Hazardous and Solid Waste Program Branch, U.S. EPA_Region II, 26 Federal Plaza, Rm. 1006, New York, New York 10278. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David Savetsky, U.S. EPA Region II, Mail Stop 2AWM&hyph;HWP, Room 1006, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, New York, 10278, telephone (212) 264&hyph;0547. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR Part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under Part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine that State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs are adequate to comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate. EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA. Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program. These various components of authority and capability were submitted by New York State in its application and revisions thereto. EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``Adequate'' program based on the interpretation outlined above. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program.
