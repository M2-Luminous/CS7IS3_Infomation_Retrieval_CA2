We are one people and one country. In fact, coordination and cooperation are a must. We should explore the future and how the situation will be in the Middle East. The Jordanians and the Palestinians are one people and have common interests. The aim is to organize these common interests in the future, to draw up rules for them, and to reinforce the brotherly ties between us. The previous experiences we have faced as one unit cannot be seen as just a relationship between one country and another, but as one among the members of one family. This is our concept of the work for which we have come and for the future we want to work out together, God willing. [Reporter] There is a crisis in Jordanian-Palestinian relations. What are the dimensions of this crisis? [Qaddumi] There is no crisis. This is, regrettably, the creation of Arab or non-Arab media. There is, in fact, a persisting desire to carry out joint action because we are moving toward a serious stage. This esplains his majesty's statement that stressed desire to base relations on sound foundations. This, in fact, is our opinion and our trend. Therefore, what is being portrayed as a crisis is not a crisis at all. There is not crisis among the members of one family. [end recording]
