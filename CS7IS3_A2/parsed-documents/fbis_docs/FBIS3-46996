And to complicate matters, higher police authorities in Davao denied having arrested the suspects identified as Abdul Munib, and Jacob Ibrahim. The extremist Abu Sayyaf Group was held responsible for a series of kidnappings and bombings in Mindanao last year. Senior Inspector Tranjirol Ainin, Sta. [Santa or Holy] Ana Patrol Station Commander however, insisted he led a team of more than 20 operatives which swooped down on Treasure Inn, where Munib and Ibrahim were billeted Tuesday night. The inn is just a kilometer away from the San Pedro Cathedral. Ainin said Munib had been positively identified by five witnesses as one of three armed men who lobbed one of three grenades inside the cathedral Sunday night, which killed seven persons and injured 150 others. The Sta. Ana police commander said the two were also among 25 Tausugs rounded up near the cathedral at about 10 PM Tuesday. He said intelligence reports had also tagged Munib and Ibrahim as being part of the group which planted a bomb at the Fortune Inn in Davao which killed three persons in 1992. Presidential Peace Adviser Oscar Santos warned against immediately attributing the spate of Mindanao bombings to religious fanaticism, saying this could unwittingly encourage a religious war. Santos said: "For the sake of the innocent population of Davao, let us move cautiously so as not to ignite further violence. We do not know if the bombings are religiously motivated." "We may be imputing a Muslim-Christian conflict where there is none." Earlier, Senior Superintendent Teddy Carian, regional police chief, said a group calling itself the New Christian Democratic Army claimed responsibility for the attacks on three Muslim mosques allegedly in retaliation to the bombing of the San Pedro Cathedral. The claim was made in telephone calls made to newspaper offices and radio stations in Davao City, he said. President Ramos hailed leaders of multi-sectoral organizations of Davao City for joining hands with government in its resolve to put an end to the spate of violence in that city. "The people of Davao City have shown us how the people, united and working together, can deal with irrational elements out to sow fear and hatred particularly during the holiday season," he said.
