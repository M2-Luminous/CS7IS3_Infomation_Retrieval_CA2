This is aimed at stimulating foreign investors' confidence. He stated this at an audience granted to Mr. Gibson Phillip Henry, extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador of New Zealand to Cambodia, at the Council of Ministers office on the morning of 27 January. At the meeting, his excellency the second prime minister made three requests for assistance from the New Zealand Government. First, he asked the government to provide general vocational training for the Khmer Royal Armed Forces' troops; second, supply necessary materials for the training; and third, develop Cambodia [words indistinct]. If New Zealand agrees to help develop Cambodia, it is requested that Cambodian soldiers are hired as workers. This is to give them jobs and so they may earn their living. H.E. Hun Sen also requested that New Zealand provide the RGC with materials, mosquito nets, blankets, and medicine which will be given to Khmer Rouge soldiers rallying to the RGC. The royal government will not ask for armaments or ammunition, he emphasized. With regard to the Khmer Rouge problem, H.E. Hun Sen reaffirmed that the RGC at all times leaves open the possibility for them to join in national reconstruction and achieve national unification. This is, however, possible only if they fulfill the five points of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman. On the contrary, they have continued to attack the RGC and people and refuse to recognize the legal royal government. Before concluding, H.E. Hun Sen profoundly thanked the New Zealand troops, who had taken part in the elections and mine clearance in Cambodia. New Zealand continues to assist Cambodia in the demining operation in its capacity as a state in the same region. For his part, Mr. Phillip reaffirmed to H.E. Hun Sen that New Zealand is always ready to cooperate in rehabilitating, rebuilding, and redeveloping Cambodia. New Zealand, he added, is willing to help restore Cambodia and is prepared to share weal and woe with the country. Currently, New Zealand is striving to promote cooperation in the development of the two countries.
