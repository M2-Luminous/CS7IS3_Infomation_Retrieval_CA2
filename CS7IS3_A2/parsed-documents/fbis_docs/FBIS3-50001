The situation, which Mr. Mikhaylov described as "critical," arose after members of the Riot Police Squad shot and killed two counterterrorist commandos ("Red Berets") in an unauthorized operation in a Sofia neighbourhood last Friday [14 January] night. Assuming full responsibility for the tragic incident, Mr. Mikhaylov handed his resignation on Sunday [16 January] but the cabinet unanimously rejected it by secret ballot yesterday. Mr. Mikhaylov said that this "tremendous gaffe committed by the members of the Riot Police Squad," paralyzed the Interior Ministry services. "We must do something to help them get over this shock. I think we have got enough people who can get things out of this shock situation," the minister told his interviewer. Mr. Mikhaylov said that the Riot Police Squad will be reorganized and may be replaced by two other units with different functions. "We will probably consider a shift of control over stand-by units," the minister said in his interview. Before the passage of the Judiciary Act, there is no method by which the crime control institutions could work like a single mechanism fighting crime, in his view. Mr. Mikhaylov said that Mr. Nikolay Slatinski MP, chairman of the National Assembly Committee on National Security, with whom he conferred today, promised him cooperation in this direction. Cooperation among the state institutions in crime control was high on the agenda of the meeting today between senior members of the National Assembly Committee on National Security and the Ministry of the Interior. Crime in Bulgaria has reached a level which jeopardizes the very integrity of the state, Mr. Slatinski said after the meeting. The Interior Ministry officers cannot cope with the situation on their own because it involves a struggle for dominance between major economic groups. According to Mr. Slatinski, it is not a separate force or institution that should tackle this problem but all competent institutions should agree on cooperation. "It is a pity that things had to get that far before my colleagues could realize why our committee was pressing so urgently to prioritize national security legislation," Mr. Slatinski said. Asked whether organized crime groups may already have a lobby even in parliament, Mr. Slatinski answered that he would not commit himself to such an assertion which is insulting to his fellow MP's. Still, the stalling of laws concerning national security made him suspect some connection between economic groups and politicians.
