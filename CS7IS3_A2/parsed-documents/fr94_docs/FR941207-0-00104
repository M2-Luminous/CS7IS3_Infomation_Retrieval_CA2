ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: USEPA is publishing elsewhere in this Federal Register a direct final rule fully approving revisions to the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the Rhinelander, Wisconsin sulfur dioxide (SO 2 )) nonattainment area. The revisions concern rules for certain sources of SO 2 ) in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. USEPA is also publishing a proposed rulemaking in this Federal Register to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on USEPA's action. If a person submits adverse comments on USEPA's proposed action within 30 days of publication of the proposed and direct final actions, USEPA will withdraw its direct final action and will consider any comments received before taking final action on the State's submittal. Based on the proposed full approval, USEPA is making an interim final determination by this action that the State has corrected the deficiency for which a sanctions clock began on May 13, 1993. This action will defer the application of the offset sanction and defer the application of the highway sanction. Although this action is effective upon publication, USEPA will take comment. If no comments are received on USEPA's proposed approval of the State's submittal, the direct final action published in this Federal Register will also finalize USEPA's determination that the State has corrected the deficiency that started the sanctions clock. If comments are received on USEPA's proposed approval and the interim final action, USEPA will publish a final rule taking into consideration any comments received. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 7, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On April 28, 1989 the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) submitted a revision to Wisconsin's SO 2 SIP to USEPA, consisting of Wisconsin State Rule NR 418.07, for which USEPA published a final disapproval on May 13, 1993 (58 FR 28362). The USEPA's disapproval action started an 18-month clock for the application of one sanction (followed by a second sanction 6 months later) under section 179 of the Clean Air Act (Act) and a 24-month clock for promulgation of a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) under section 110(c) of the Act. The State subsequently submitted a revision to its SIP for the Rhinelander, Wisconsin SO 2 nonattainment area on October 21, 1994. The USEPA has taken direct final action on this submittal pursuant to its modified direct final policy set forth at 59 FR 24054 (May 10, 1994). In the rules section of this Federal Register , USEPA is issuing a direct final full approval of the State of Wisconsin's submittal of the Rhinelander SO 2 nonattainment area SIP. In addition, in the proposed rules section of this Federal Register , USEPA proposes full approval of the State's submittal.
