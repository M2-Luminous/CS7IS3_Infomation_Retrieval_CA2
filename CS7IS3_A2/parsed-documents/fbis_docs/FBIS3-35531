The Zionists' history is replete with terrorism and massacres against our people and nation, and against mankind. Had they not already committed the massacre at Al-Aqsa, and before that others in Sabra and Shatila and in Dayr Yasin, Qibyah and Nahalin, and Kafr Qasim? Have they not committed massacres against the people in southern Lebanon and the Golan? Ahmad Jibril added: These Jews have been marked by God Almighty in the Koran as the killers of prophets and messengers, and as those who violate the pledges they make although God has given them many opportunties to repent. They insist, however, on continuing their actions, which shows complete disobedience to God, his teachings, and to mankind. In his statement to Al-Quds radio, Ahmad Jibril added: As I said, we are not surprised at the perpetration of such a massacre in one of God's houses. What surprises us, however, is that Yasir 'Arafat and a handful of mercenaries continue to shake hands with the killers in Oslo, Washington, and Cairo. We are surprised that they continue to offer concessions and to give in completely to the Zionist will. We are also surprised at some Arab leaders who act out the role of cheap brokers for the sake of the Zionist movement. We are surprised at the behavior of some Arab rulers who started to open their countries to the Zionist movement and to the Jews while the Zionists still occupy all of Palestine, the Golan Heights, and southern Lebanon. Ahmad Jibril said: We are certain that the people's will, our Arab people, and nation will punish all those who relinquish the holy places, the land, and history. Our Palestinian people in and outside [the occupied territories] will not forgive these massacres that are being committed against them, massacres which will remain vivid in our minds, and in the minds of our children, and grandchildren. Our revenge will be devastating, God willing. We are the nation of martyrs and martyrdom, and we do not fear death. This odious massacre will further enhance the cohesion and determination of our people and nation and their faith in the inevitability of victory. In conclusion, we offer condolences to our Palestinian people in the occupied territories and to the martyrs families and we tell them that tomorrow is close for those who are waiting.
