You had better ask Patten himself. But, I feel that he himself is putting pressure on Hong Kong's media by making such remarks now, and I hope he himself will show respect for the freedom of the press. Judging from his actual performance, he has put pressure on Hong Kong's press circles in various ways." Zhang's remarks were made in answer to a reporter's question before he attended the opening ceremony of the "Exhibition of Exquisite Chinese Works of Art," which is being co-sponsored by Hong Kong's Tsi Ku Chai Company Limited and the Hong Kong and Shenzhen Boya Art Company and is being held in the China Cultural Relics Gallery yesterday. Zhang Junsheng said: "Some people are now shouting loudly for democracy with all their might. In fact, what democracy can be obtained here under colonial rule? Actually, there is no democracy here, so why do they shout loudly for democracy? Hong Kong can only enjoy real and substantive democracy after 1997."
