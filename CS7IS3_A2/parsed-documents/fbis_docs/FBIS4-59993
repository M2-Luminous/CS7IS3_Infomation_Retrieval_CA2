What are your views on how to avoid this disaster? [Muhammad] First, it pleases me to address the Arab people on the Cairo Radio. I would like to greet the fraternal Egyptian people and their leadership. I salute President Husni Mubarak, who has stood by the Yemeni people from the beginning of the crisis. He has actively made telephone calls and held meetings to contain the crisis that threatens national unity, security, and stability in Yemen and the security and stability of the region. Yemen is a littoral country on the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, and so our country affects and is affected by what takes place around us in the region. In my view, the problem in Yemen is the responsibility of our brothers and friends. I am making efforts to help Yemen overcome this ordeal. [Riyad] You say that the brothers and friends should shoulder their responsibilities. You met in Damascus with a number of envoys from Sanaa and Aden; do you sense that they are ready to accept Arab mediation efforts to address the crisis? [Muhammad] In fact, the efforts by brothers and friends have not ceased; they are continuing. However, frankly speaking, what has happened and is happening in Yemen is the responsibility of the brothers there. The meeting of the Yemeni leaders in Amman and the signing of the Pledge and Accord Document there, their meeting in Salalah, and other meetings provided opportunities for direct dialogue between the political leaders in Yemen. Regrettably, numerous Arab and international overtures clashed with certain positions, prompting certain Arab leaders to balk. Personally, I played a humble role last year and this year by making certain overtures and proposals to contain the crisis. Regrettably, my proposals and overtures contradicted certain positions, and thus failed. I acted out of my concern for the security and stability in Yemen and the region. I am following up on my efforts with my brothers and envoys, both in Yemen and abroad. I am following developments and am concerned to stop the bloodshed and halt the deterioration and collapse in Yemen. [Riyad] Does this mean that there are mediation efforts by the Yemeni sons to address this crisis? [Muhammad] As I noted, I already put forward certain overtures. I think that if the brothers there had responded to my overtures, they might have borne fruit and led to a relaxation of the situation. I held contacts a week ago with a number of Yemeni figures who are concerned about stability and want to contain the crisis in Yemen. They responded positively and welcomed my overture and the proposal to hold a meeting. They also welcome my readiness to go to Yemen. I am holding contacts with the Yemeni leadership. If the Yemeni leadership and figures in the Arab homeland and outside agree, I am ready to go to Sanaa and Aden to help the Yemeni leadership contain the crisis, because the danger threatens everyone inside and outside Yemen and even the region and the Arab nation. Unity is not the exclusive province of the two Yemeni parties nor of certain individuals. Yemeni unity concerns all Yemeni people, for they and the Arab nation, particularly Egypt, made sacrifices for it. I consider that Yemeni unity is the fruit of the struggle by the Yemeni people, in both north and south. [Riyad] Mr. Muhammad, as you said, unity was the result of all the Yemeni people's struggle. But what is the future of this unity since the break caused by the war between the two sides? Can it be maintained when weapons are being used? [Muhammad] I do not keep my view secret; very frankly, I support unity. I have said that I am opposed to fighting and to secession. The bloody events inflicted on the Yemeni people and their gains, on the army, the economy, and the citizens' morale could leave a deep rift in the people and in Yemen's unity. But there is no alternative. As for secession, Yemen cannot revert back to the 1990 borders, the year when unity was established. I have said this repeatedly and on several occasions, even to officials. I met yesterday with [name indistinct], who used to be foreign minister, and told him that it is impossible to go back to the 1990 borders. If Yemen is partitioned, then possibly more than one state and more than one entity will be established, and a series of conflicts and wars will break out between these entities in Yemen. This could affect Yemen's future. [Riyad] Do you believe that dialogue is still possible? [Muhammad] There is no other path than that of the dialogue. The doors to dialogue remain open amid all the wars that happen in the world. There are in fact bloody and painful battles today, but there is no path other than dialogue. Continuing the war means the complete destruction of everything. That is why I underlined the need to go back to the dialogue and to persist with it in order to stop the shedding of blood and to protect Yemeni national unity. [Riyad] Do you think that the two sides are willing to stop the fighting and bloodshed? [Muhammad] Everyone talks about going back to the dialogue, about a cease-fire and a disengagement. Everyone is talking, but the battles are in fact still raging even while I am talking to you. This is why I call again on the leaders to rely on the dialogue, the Constitution of the unified state, and the Pledge and Accord Document. [Riyad] Thank you 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, former president of [South] Yemen. [Muhammad] Thank you for continuing to follow the situation in Yemen.
