According to the Korea Maritime and Port Administration, Changyong Maritime Company, an inshore shipping company engaged in shipping between the ROK and Japan, represented by Kim Chong-su, recently applied to the National Unification Board [NUB] for permission to contact North Korean residents to open a regular sea route between Japan and North Korea for transporting agricultural and sea products. Accordingly, the NUB consulted with the Korea Maritime and Port Administration, the office mainly concerned, to determine if it is acceptable for an ROK shipping company to open a sea route between Japan and North Korea. The Korea Maritime and Port Administration has informed the NUB that it is necessary for a domestic company to open a sea route between Japan and North Korea because this would help domestic shipping companies secure shipment territory in the East Sea economic area in the future.
