The Government Has Raised $500 Million To Build Another White House"] [Text] Yesterday a deputies commission on accommodating the State Duma once again unanimously confirmed its previous decision: The building of the former Comecon is unsuitable for the work of the lower parliament chamber. The deputies refused to be convinced otherwise by Pavel Borodin, chief of the Main Socio-Production Directorate of the presidential administration, and his deputy Andrey Voykov, who were present at the commission session. Both of them, however, reaffirmed: The White House will not be ceded to the Federal Assembly. Instead Mr. Borodin promised an early construction of a special parliament building next to the former House of Soviets (presumably in the place of the Krasnaya Presnya stadium). At the end of January bidding is to be held among a number of foreign construction companies and as of 1 February the erection of the future compound for the Federal Assembly will begin, planned to be completed by 1 January 1995. The compound includes an administrative building (360,000 square meters) and a hotel for the deputies (700 suites, mostly of three and four rooms). Some $500 million is earmarked for this. As one of the deputies noted, precisely this sum is required to implement a conversion program in the military industrial complex. A source in the Russia's Choice parliamentary faction told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent that his impression is that everything is being done to make the Duma monolithic in its opposition to the executive branch, since Russia's Choice also favored the Duma's presence in the White House. The former Comecon building itself is being hectically prepared for the deputies' arrival. True, its present lessees -- for the most part commercial (and fairly well known) structures -- have not yet moved out. As people from the presidential administration have promised, this will probably happen by the end of the month and by 1 March the refurbishing of the building will be completed. At present it lacks telephones, service areas, furniture, and various technical equipment. With respect to the latter NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's confidential source commented tersely: It has been stolen, although judging by the documents, everything is in perfect order. It can therefore be assumed that after its first session the Duma will have to interrupt its work for one to one and a half months. Incidentally, chances are that there will be no joint session of both chambers on 11 January since Boris Yeltsin is not planning to address it. On one hand, this is not provided for under the new constitution; on the other, he apparently does not want to let the deputies into the Kremlin and report anything to them. According to sources in the president's administration, there are plans for the president to address an assembly of deputies who will be invited to the Kremlin as a group of citizens. Many questions are scheduled for the first session's agenda: the election of the Duma chairman and his deputies, the approval of the number of committees and their leadership, and the adoption of interim rules of procedure. This agenda can apparently be fulfilled only if consensus is reached at the ongoing preliminary consultations between factions. At present, however, it has been achieved on only one issue -- the rejection of the premises assigned to the Duma. The candidacy of the speaker has not been determined yet, and it is not even clear according to which principle he will be elected. Russia's Choice, although it continues talks on the chairman candidacy with the Agrarian Party of Russia, the Russian Federation Communist Party, and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, is still committed to the idea of electing him from among representatives of small factions. As one Russia's Choice deputy told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent, these factions include primarily Yabloko and Women of Russia, and their candidates, Vladimir Lukin, Anatoliy Adamishin, and Alevtina Fedulova, although the last two figures arouse objections: the first within his own faction, the second from the negotiating partners. With respect to electing four deputy speakers on a party principle (this idea is a kind of compromise between large and small factions) with the speaker representing some non-influential group, Russia's Choice is fairly well disposed, hoping that it will manage to uphold the concept of a weak Duma leadership. The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, in the words of its chairman, is ready to swap "its" deputy for three committees, although in the general interfactional bargaining it is laying claim to the international affairs committee, whereas the Russian Federation Communist Party wants the defense and security committee, and the Agrarian Party wants the agrarian committee and the constitutional and judicial reform committee. Russia's Choice is claiming chairmanship in all financial and economic committees, of which there will be two or three. At present, however, the communists and the agrarians have decided to abandon the idea of proportional formation of the Duma bodies and of a weak speaker, which would perpetuate the situation as it emerged prior to the elections where no one gained any advantage. They are slowly gathering a majority coalition and want it to receive leading posts and also to form a certain omnipotent Duma Council -- something like the presidium in the former Supreme Soviet. This was reported to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent by a source from the Russia's Choice faction.
