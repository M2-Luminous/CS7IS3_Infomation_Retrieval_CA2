FR941207-0-00123 FR941207-0-00022 24. We will also retain the existing gross revenues and total assets limits for the entrepreneurs' blocks and for small business size status. We find the arguments of those who oppose any reduction in the gross revenues limit most persuasive. BET, for example, supports the balance it perceives the Commission has struck between small and mid-sized firms by adopting a $125 million gross revenues test. We agree with BET that a decrease in the gross revenue limit would eliminate many mid-sized firms from entrepreneurs' block participation while not substantially raising the level of competition in the blocks. Conversely, an increase in the gross revenue limit would not necessarily provide for greater capital access for applicants. We believe our $125 million gross revenues test represents an appropriate benchmark for entry into the entrepreneurs' block, given our interest in including firms that, while not large in comparison to other telecommunications companies, are likely to have the financial resources to compete against larger competitors on the MTA blocks. 25. In addition, we will retain the aggregation methodology to assess the size of an applicant, with certain exceptions. We reject NABOB's proposal to eliminate our aggregation rule and we cannot adopt Omnipoint's proposal to determine entrepreneurs' block eligibility and small business size status by separately evaluating the assets and revenues of each attributable investor. Aggregating the gross revenues and total assets of all attributable investors in and affiliates of the applicant is central to an accurate size determination, and consistent with the Small Business Administration's (SBA's) approach to similar determinations. Viewing gross revenues and assets of each investor in isolation could result in very large entities bidding for these licenses. We reject Omnipoint's suggestion that a multiplier approach be used to make these size determinations. A multiplier is appropriate to arrive at an accurate determination of ownership interest in an applicant or licensee. In this context, however, we are not concerned with ownership, but instead seek to make a financially-based size determination in order to assess whether an applicant is eligible for significant governmental benefits. 26. We agree with CTIA that clarification is required concerning the two-year period in order to provide applicants with a uniform way to measure gross revenues for purposes of qualifying for the entrepreneurs' blocks. For the initial entrepreneurs' block auctions involving broadband PCS, companies should use audited financial statements for each of the two calendar years ending December 31, 1993 or, if audited financial statements are not prepared on a calendar-year basis, data from audited financial statements for their two most recently completed fiscal years. Therefore, if applicants and their investors do not have audited statements ending on December 31, 1993, they will have to use one annual statement ending at a later date (sometime in 1994). This approach will enable the Commission to obtain timely financial data while providing applicants with some degree of flexibility in their financial reporting practices. For subsequent entrepreneurs' block auctions ( i.e., license reauctioning), we will require applicants to use their last two annual audited financial statements to determine compliance with the financial caps. Newly-formed companies should use the audited financial statements of their predecessors in interests, or financial statements current as of the time their Form 175 (short-form) application is filed that are certified by the applicant as accurate. 27. Clarification is also needed with respect to the issue of growth and takeovers of an entrepreneurs' block licensee or its investors. We clarify our rules to the extent necessary to indicate what types of growth will jeopardize an applicant's continued eligibility as an entrepreneurs' block licensee during the holding period. A licensee could not maintain its eligibility if a member of its control group were itself taken over, effecting a transfer of control of the licensee during the license holding period. However, an attributable investor would not affect the licensee's continuing eligibility for the entrepreneurs' block if another of the investor's affiliates grew or its investments appreciated during the holding period. Our rules consider such growth either to be revenue from the investor's operations or to be normal business development and, in either case, fully permissible. If an attributable investor is taken over or purchased by another entity, the other entity steps into the shoes of the original investor and its assets and revenues will be considered under the continued eligibility rule. However, if an affiliate of the applicant is taken over by (or sold to) another entity, the other entity's assets and revenues would not be considered, so long as no new affiliation arrangement between the applicant and the other entity is created by the takeover or sale. That is, in most cases, the affiliation with the applicant would be severed by such a takeover and the gain from the sale of the affiliates' assets would have already been taken into account by the initial consideration of such assets at the time of application. 15 We emphasize that we have a strong interest in seeing entrepreneurs grow and succeed in the PCS marketplace. Thus, normal projected growth of gross revenues and assets, or growth such as would occur as a result of a control group member's attributable investments appreciating, or as a result of a licensee acquiring additional licenses would not generally jeopardize continued eligibility as an entrepreneurs' block licensee. 15 Thus, for example, if Applicant A is affiliated with Corporation B and that corporation sells its business to Corporation C, the income derived from the sale would not affect Applicant A's continued eligibility, unless a new affiliation arrangement arises between Applicant A and Corporation C. Personal Net Worth 28. In addition to the gross revenues and assets caps, the Fifth Report and Order also established a personal net worth limit to determine eligibility for bidding in the entrepreneurs' blocks. The current rules require that persons that are applicants, attributable investors in the applicant and all of their respective affiliates who are themselves individuals each have less than $100 million in personal net worth. Additionally, the rules require that if the applicant seeks to qualify as a small business each individual in the control group, attributable investors and all affiliates who are individuals, must have less than $40 million in personnel net worth. See 47 CFR 24.720. 29. BET requests the Commission relax the personal net worth limits applicable to attributable investors in minority-owned firms. BET argues that eliminating the personal net worth standard would help ensure participation by minority and women-owned businesses by allowing successful individuals to bring their experience to bear in the PCS marketplace. At the same time, BET argues that this measure would ensure that relatively small, minority and women-owned enterprises have a meaningful opportunity to participate in the provision of PCS. TEC also requests the Commission liberalize its personal net worth standard to permit an attributable individual investor to hold up to $125 million in personal net worth. MasTec claims that net worth/net revenue definitions are overly restrictive and will exclude those minority businesses that can best survive and succeed in the competitive PCS market. 30. We will eliminate the personal net worth limits (both for the entrepreneurs' blocks and for small business size status) for all applicants, attributable investors, and affiliates. The obstacles faced by minorities and minority-controlled businesses in raising capital are well-documented in this proceeding and are not necessarily confined to minorities with limited personal net worth. Therefore, we agree with the view that the personal net worth requirements should be eliminated in the case of minority-controlled applicants seeking to qualify for entrepreneurs' block licenses. However, rather than eliminate the personal net worth limits for minorities only, we will eliminate the requirement for all applicants because personal net worth limits are difficult to apply and enforce and may be easily manipulated. We do not believe that eliminating the personal net worth limits will facilitate significant encroachment by ``deep pockets'' that can be accessed by wealthy individuals through affiliated entities because, in those instances where access to such resources would create an unfair advantage, the affiliation rules will continue to apply and require that such an entity's assets and revenues be included in determining an applicant's size. Thus, we emphasize that we believe the affiliation rules make the personal net worth rules largely unnecessary since most wealthy individuals are likely to have their wealth closely tied to ownership of another business.
