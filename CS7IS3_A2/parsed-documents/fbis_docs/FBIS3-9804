According to this, privatizations should be suspended from 7 April until the new parliament is formed, the reason being, among other things, that the chances of supervision are further reduced during the election period. For such a measure to be taken, or at least to deal with this proposal, talks should be started as a minimum, but Pongracz is not aware of any such talks at the moment. In his view, suspending privatizations would be a catastrophic mistake because, on one hand, this would completely frighten away foreign capital -- and it would hardly be possible to lure it back again -- and, on the other, it would also create immeasurable domestic political confusion and dissatisfaction. It must not be forgotten, either, that even in the case of the left wing's advancement -- which is feared by many -- it would not be sensible to halt privatizations because both the Liberals and the Socialists are in favor of privatization, even if they have different views on the ways of implementing it. All the parties have returned to the notion of social market economy and they are emphasizing the small differences. Privatization is a good battle ground for them and the attacks can be concentrated on this area. However, it is strange, and politically unethical before the elections for a coalition partner to give the impressions that it has not actually been part of this at all, Pongracz stated.
