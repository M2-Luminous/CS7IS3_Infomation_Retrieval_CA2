FBIS3-44462 "drchi002_n_94006" FBIS-CHI-94-002 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Jan 1994 Economic & Agricultural Li Tieying Addresses Economic Conference HK2312002093 Beijing ZHONGGUO JINGJI TIZHI GAIGE in Chinese No 11, 23 Nov 93 pp 6-15 HK2312002093 Beijing ZHONGGUO JINGJI TIZHI GAIGE Language: Chinese Article Type:BFN [Speech by State Councillor Li Tieying at cadre meeting of the State Commission for Restructuring Economic System on 14 October 1993: "Opportunity, Understanding, Framework, and Work"] [Text] Reviewing history, whether of the international or domestic situation, today is conducive to China's development and reform, and a rare historical opportunity. It is imperative for us to understand and grasp actively, comprehensively, and correctly, Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, to seize the opportunity and accelerate reform as well as development. The issue of development today is in essence one of reform, and an issue of what we should reform and how. A high growth rate is brought along by reform, and only through reform will it be possible for us to master the "high technology" of control over the macroeconomy in high-rate economic operation. Stability can only be relative; stability cannot be sustained for long without reform and development or by seeking stability at the cost of reform and development; only social progress brought along by reform and development is the foundation of stability. To give full play to the initiative of the central authorities as well as localities is the principle that we have adhered to for a long time, as well as summation of historical experiences. In the course of reform, we will not consider taking the initiative in one aspect, while jeopardizing it in the other. In the present phase when reform enters the stage of tackling bottlenecks, should we overstress being gradual, sure and steady, we will miss the opportunity. Generally speaking, the basic way of pushing China's reform should be "making gradual progress in entirety, with phased breakthroughs." From breaking up the old strucuture to building the new, from dismantling the "old house" to setting up the "new building" it is a process of the conversion from breaking up to setting up. Setting up the "new building" of the socialist market economy calls for meticulous design of the main pillars, and drawing the blueprint of the whole framework. Seize the Opportunity, Accelerate Reform as Well as Development The Central Committee attaches great importance to seizing the opportunity, accelerating reform as well as development. In recent years, Comrade Xiaoping has on several occasions said: "It is imperative to seize the opportunity; now is a good opportunity. I am just worrying about losing the opportunity. If we fail to seize the opportunity, then the opportunity before us will be lost. Time waits for no one." "It seems that in our development, we should seize the opportunity in a certain phase and pursue high growth for several consecutive years." "Today the world is undergoing a major turning point, it is precisely an opportunity." His series of important remarks were made by standing high and viewing far, and they are his understanding of contemporary China as well as the world today. It is imperative for us to deeply understand the spiritual essence of Comrade Xiaoping's repeated emphasis on seizing the opportunity. The general spirit of General Secretary Jiang Zemin's speech delivered at the Central Party School last year, the important topics at the 14th Party Congress, as well as the series of important meetings convoked by the Central Committee and the plans for reform presented, all spell seizing the opportunity, accelerating reform as well as development. Opportunity means precisely a specific period in which the objective situation has provided us with the greatest number of advantageous factors and conditions, which are most concentrated at the same time. Reviewing history, deciding whether the international or domestic situation today is conducive to China's development and reform, and a rare historical opportunity, it is imperative for us to lose no time in pushing reform, accelerate conversion to the socialist market economic structure, accelerate development and realize the second- and third- step magnificent goals in realizing modernization. Internationally, the world bipolar pattern has come to an end, and it has entered the transition period of multipolar development. Various forces in the international community are undergoing disintegration and reorganization. Major Western developed countries are facing many domestic problems, suffering from economic recession, having enough trouble even in taking care of themselves. There is the possibility for us to win a comparatively long period of peace, while working hard to make economic construction come up. Toward the end of the 1980's, economic recession surfaced in major Western industrial countries with a rising unemployment rate, continuously shrinking saturated domestic market, and growing surplus capital. Such a condition has inevitably led to the pursuit of new international market and investment outlet. Statistics show that world trade volume is $7,400 billion, and China accounts for only 2 percent over, with very great potential for development. Direct capital investment of various countries overseas is already $2,000 billion; from now on, every year will see a possible rise of $300 billion. That is extremely helpful for China to expand opening up, utilizing foreign funds, and technological imports. Viewing the situation at home, Comrade Xiaoping's important remarks made during his southern inspection tour last year incisively analyzed the world and domestic situation, scientifically summarized the basic practice and experiences of reform and opening up, explicitly answered many important issues that had perplexed and shackled people's thinking. Consequently, the whole party and whole people have enjoyed unprecedented unification in their ideological understanding. We have Deng Xiaoping and other proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation at the helm, as well as the correct leadership of the leadership collective of the third generation with Comrade Jiang Zemin at this core; we enjoy political stability and sound social order, a high rate of economic growth, and the people are living and working in peace and contentment. Thus we possess a sound social and political environment for further accelerating development. The 15-year reform and opening up have enabled China to double its economic strength, with people's living standards improved by a wide margin. Between 1978 and 1992, China's GNP increased by 2.33 times, with an average annual growth rate of 9 percent; financial revenue increased by 2.7 times, with an average annual growth rate of 9.8 percent; overall popular consumption increased 1.48 times, with an average annual growth rate of 6.7 percent and 1.22 times for the non-peasant populace, with an average annual growth rate of 5.9 percent; by the end of last September, savings deposits of the urban and rural populace were 1,390 billion yuan, in addition to cash in hand and other financial assets in individual possession amounting to several hundreds of billions of yuan; the industrial setup was tending to become more rational, with the GNP proportion of tertiary industry increasing by 5 percentage points; the proportion of agriculture continued to drop, some 100 million people in the agricultural work force have been transferred to non-agricultural industries, with the degree of socialization in agricultural production further upgraded. Over the past 15 years, we have genuinely taken the road that leads to modernization. The great accomplishments scored in reform and opening up have firmed people's determination to take the road of the socialist market economy, with experiences accumulating and large numbers of qualified people brought up. All this has laid down a solid foundation for accelerating economic development. Since the beginning of this year, the national economy has continued to sustain the momentum of vigorous development on the basis of the high growth of last year. The series of measures of macroeconomic regulation and control that the central government has taken since last June are themselves a reform of economic administration and measures to conduct macroeconomic regulation and control with economic means. Marked results have been scored since their implementation. While applying to economic and legal means in the main, administrative means are supplemented to conduct macroeconomic regulation and control; this is necessary today, and also indispensable from a long-range view. Any country that pursues a market economy may conduct marcroeconomic regulation and control in various forms. Some contradictions and problems have also surfaced in our economic life today. Basically, their cause is the coexistence of new and old structures, and backwardness and stagnation in reform of the macroscopic control structure. This being the case, the basic way to resolve these contradictions and problems is in deepening reform and quickening the pace of building the new socialist market economic structure. Through long-term repeated fermentation, study, and exploration, a number of the plans for reform of the banking, finance and taxation, foreign trade and foreign exchange, and investment structures, the enterprise, social insurance, housing, and civil service systems, and the wage system of administrative organizations and institutions have already been presented, and more are to be presented soon. All these are precisely reform of a deeper tier, and serve precisely to basically resolve deep-tiered contradictions and problems we have been talking about for years. With this as a sign, economic restructuring in China has already entered a new phase characterized by comprehensiveness, acceleration, and forming into a whole range. To seize the opportunity means precisely the need of a sense of pressure to quicken the pace in reform and development to resolve deep-tiered contradictions and problems as quickly as possible. Opportunity is an objective thing and will not come about through subjective wishful thinking. We lost several opportunities for great development in the 1960's and 1970's; consequently, our gap with developed and peripheral countries widened. Today, history has once again endowed the Chinese nation with an opportunity for great development. The opportunity will be lost should we procrastinate. Comrade Xiaoping has indicated: "By not being courageous to emancipate the mind and give a free hand to one's work, the consequence can only be the loss of opportunity, like a boat sailing against the stream must forge ahead or it will be driven back." Every comrade working in restructuring the economic system departments must genuinely understand and firmly grasp this rare historical opportunity, work hard, and live up to the mission entrusted to him by the times. Correctly Understand and Handle Several Important Relations in Reform and Development To grasp the opportunity for deepening reform, it is imperative to raise our ideological level and ability to understand. This involves the imperative to understand and grasp Comrade Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics enthusiastically, comprehensively and correctly. Only then will it be possible to grasp the overall situation and orientation, learn to view things from a dialectical view, guard against rigidity as well as onesided views, while continuously make breakthroughs and progress in theory and practice. The Issue of Emancipating the Mind and Seeking Truth From Facts Back in 1980, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "To emancipate the mind means precisely that one's thinking must conform with reality, making subjective thinking conform with the objective situation, and seeking truth from facts." In addition, he indicated: "From now on, to genuinely adhere to seeking truth from facts, it is imperative to emancipate the mind." Emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts is our party's persistent ideological line, and an invincible truth that has been testified to by practice of many years in the revolution and construction in China. To adhere to emanciapting the mind, seeking truth from facts is not an empty slogan, but a principle that guides our practical work. On the issue of development, it is precisely the need for a sense of pressure, a firm grasp of the opportunity to accelerate reform and development. All projects that have the conditions to be accelereated should be developed with quicker pace, and those projects that cannot be accelerated for the time being, should have conditions actively created to gradually accelerate their development. At the same time, it is imperative to respect the objective law that governs things, act according to one's abilities, while preventing great ups and downs in the economy and great losses. On the issue of reform, it is precisely necessary to combine theory with practice. Without a ready pattern to follow in the exploration of building the socialist market economic structure in such a large country as China, we have to rely on ourselves in practice. It is necessary to give a free hand to and be courageous in practice; regarding those things that one is sure of, they should be boldly experimented in blazing new trail. At the same time, it is necessary to guard against major mistakes, for things one is not sure of, experiments should be allowed. Those which have been proved to be correct should be persisted in, and those which have been proved to be wrong should be corrected. It is necessary to respect the mass spirit of initiative; at the same time, it is necessasry to earnestly summarize experiences, and elevate successful experiences to theory, while making them last through laws, decrees, and regulations. Regarding the issue of opening up, it is necessary to emancipate the mind to boldly absorb and refer to all fruits of civilization created in human society, including all advanced operational and managerial methods that reflect laws governing modern production in capitalist countries; at the same time, it is necessary to proceed from China's national conditions to embody the essential characteristics of socialism. We should not study pure theoretical patterns deviating from China's national condition and the practice of reform and opening up; at the same time, we should refrain from regarding some structural patterns of Western market economies as a panacea for all diseases. China is a large country with a huge population, and a cultural tradition of 5,000 years; the development level of productive force and the market system is comparatively low, with a comparatively great gap between its urban and rural areas and an imbalance in regional development. China is a socialist country, which is building modernization as well as a socialst market economic structure. All these are basic Chinese national conditions. To seek truth from facts, it is certainly necessary to proceed from our national conditions and build a socialist market economic strucutre with Chinese characteristics. The Issue of Development, Reform, and Stability On this issue, Comrade Xiaoping has made a series of important statements. Comrade Xiaoping said: "Development is the final word. [fa zhan cai shi ying dao li 4099 1455 2088 2508 4289 6670 381]" "What is socialism? What is Marxism? We did not have a completely clear picture in our past understanding of these issues. Marxism places the greatest importance on developing productive forces. The essence of socialism is to emancipate and develop productive forces." Of course, the development Comrade Xiaoping referred to means the elevation of the comprehensive national strength, in both quantity and quality, "it does not mean encouraging an impratical high rate, but paying attention to economic returns as well as steady, harmonious development in a down-to-earth way." In addition, Comrade Xiaoping indicated: "With the establishment of the basic socialist system, it is necessary to basically change the economic structure that impedes productive force development to promote productive force development. This is reform; therefore, reform also means developing productive forces. In the past, we only talked about developing productive forces under socialist conditions, saying nothing about emancipating productive forces through reform, and that was incomplete. We should talk about both emancipting and developing productive forces." The issue of development today is precisely one of reform in essence and a question of what should be reformed and how. Only by grasping the opportunity of reform will it be possible to seize the opportunity of development. Without reform, development will not be able to get rid of the bonds of the old structure. Reform must aim at those deep-tiered contradictions that impede healthy, high econonomic growth, and reforms that cannot promote development are just fancy things and undesirable. Practice has shown that wherever a good job is done of reform faster development is enjoyed. Many problems existing in present economic life were brought about by the old structure. Under the situation of high growth, the old way is sure to bring serious trouble. High growth is brought along by reform, and only through reform will it be possible for us to master the "high technology" of control over the macroeconomy in a high growth rate economic operation. It is necessary for us to learn the skill of qickening the pace of reform under a situation of comparatively fast economic development and comparatively tense economic relations. By no means should we stop to pursue reform. Regarding the relationship among development, reform, and stability, Comrade Xiaoping indicated: "Through reform, it is necessary to acquire conditions for long-term, sustained, and stable development." "Reform certainly calls for a stable political environment; nothing can be achieved by deviating from this point." Stability is the prerequisite for reform and development. The great ups and downs in economic development, major mistakes, reforms surpassing the bearing capacity of society, enterprises and the people, and corruption will all jeopardize stability. However, stability can only be relative. Stability cannot be sustained for long without reform and development or seeking stability at the cost of reform and development; only social progress resulting from reform and development is the foundation of stability. Only through reform will it be possible to build the socialist market economic structure and operational mechanisms as quickly as possible, and to insure and promote sustained, high, and healthy economic growth. Only when the economy is developed with the comprehensive national strength augmented and people's living standards upgraded will it be possible to insure the long-term and basic stability of the country. The Issue of Planning and the Market As for the issue of whether both planning and the market are economic means, and socialism can pursue a market economy as well, Comrade Xiaoping has made it very clear in his discussions. The essence of the market economy is to achieve optimal allocation of production essentials through the competition mechanism characterized by elimination through selection and pursuit of maximum interest. The efficiency of the market economy in allocating resources has been evidenced by history. However, behind market efficiency are market shortcomings; regarding some social goals, such as fairness, public undertakings, and environmental protection, it is not effective to rely solely on the "invisible hand," namely, spontaneous market regulation, which has some blind spots, and can hardly insure the balance of economic general volume, resulting in periodic economic crisis. This being the case, modern Western countries have introduced government macroeconomic regulation and control and social welfare policies into the market economy and has greatly alleviated periodic economic crisis and class confrontation. Restricted by the basic system, however, they are unable to find a radical solution to the basic contradictions of capitalism. Practice has proved that modern market economy with macroeconomic regulation and control is more efficient than the traditional planned economy and a market economy taking its own course. The socialist market economy stresses the basic role of the market mechanism in resource allocation; at the same time, it does not reject and give up the application of macroeconomic regulation and control as well as planning means, while doing a good job of applying the "visible hand." Under market economic conditions, the chief functions of the government are: Maintaining national unification and stability; conducting macroeconomic regulation and control; conducting resource allocation in non-competition arenas; and readjusting patterns of social distribution. Presently, some patterns in macroeconomic regulation and control have already been shaped in Western countries, however, they cannot provide us with a pattern to be copied intact. The subject of macroeconomic regulation and control in Western countries is the private ownership economy, whereas the subject of macroeconomic regulation and control in China is mainly an economy with public owernship as the main body. In our macroeconomic regulation and control, we should pay attention to doing a good job of protecting productive force, especially promoting the structural readjustment of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, by improving their economic returns, development, and growth. We must proceed from China's national conditions, consciously explore the building of basic conditions, including positive, effective state macroeconomic regulation and control institutions and a policy system, as well as a whole range of national economic statistical index systems, and a law and decree system, avoiding the surfacing of disorderly phenomena in the course of developing the socialist market economy and shortening the period of advancing toward the modern market economy to create a new economic structure with greater vitality and vigor. On the Issue of Economic Relations between the Central Authorities and Localities To give full play to the initiatives of both the central authorities and localities is a principle that we have persisted in for a long time, as well as the summation of historical experiences. Initiative is precisely a productive force. To suffocate initiative means precisely to jeopardize productive forces. In the course of reform, we will not consider the initiation of one aspect, while jeopardizing initiation of another. In handling relations between the central authorities and localities, the part must be subordinated to the whole, and the whole should give considerations to the parts. Only when the initiative of both are given play will the overall situation be insured. If the proportion of the central financial revenue is too low, central macroeconomic regulation and control would be affected and weakened, the common development between regions and social organizations could not be insured, and it would even be difficult to cover necessary expenditures in state administration and the normal operation of state organs. For the unification of the state, social stability, and economic development, minor truths must subordinated to the major one. Of course, the vested interest of the part should also be given full consideration. To accelerate the reform of macroeconomic regulation and control, we shall implement a standardized tax-sharing system; that is not to return to the old path of excessive centralization, not to negate the plural subjective aspects of interest, nor does it mean forgetting about the initiative of localities, but building the basic framework of the socialist market economic structure in its macroscopic aspect. It requires defining financial power on the basis of defining the power of governments at various levels, and implementing a standardized, scientific financial distribution system of the central and local governments to promote the common economic development in both eastern and western China. Our principle is to allow some regions to become well off first, but not to slow development in the eastern regions to narrow the gap between east and west. Because the tax-sharing system is helpful in breaking regional blockades and market separation, the coastal areas where the market mechanism was built earlier with high economic efficiency will acquire more interest through fair competition in a unified, orderly large market. Whereas middle and western regions may have greater opportunity for development on the basis of augmenting central financial strength and building a unified market system. Basically, of course, the development of the middle and western regions should be realized in market competition, by relying on their own efforts and improvement in economic returns to gradually realize common prosperity. The building of a new macroeconomic regulation and control structure will be helpful in giving play to the initiative of various aspects. The central authorities may utilize financial and monetary policies in a comprehensive way to regulate the balance of the general social volume to insure sustained, high, and healthy economic growth. All regions should compete with and support each other to achieve common improvement and prosperity. On the Issue of Fairness and Efficiency Fairness and efficiency are ancient propositions in the theory of economics. The majority of Western economists have tried to study realistic economic operation and laws of development to seek the greatest possible economic return under private ownership without touching the capitalist economic system as a prerequisite. Marxist political economics takes production relations as its subject of study, and its basic aim lies in developing the productive force to the maximum through changing production relations and emancipating productive forces. It is a misunderstanding to believe that Marxist economics deals only the issue of social fairness. The superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system does not depend on moral criteria, but mainly finds expression in its ability to create a higher productive force than capitalism. Basically, the realization of social fairness and common prosperity on the basis of high efficiency is the essential definition of the socialist system. It is imperative to adhere to the principle of giving priority to efficiency while giving consideration to fairness. Paying attention to development, material interests, market allocation of resources, and advocating science and technology being the primary productive force are all included in the principle of giving prominence to efficiency. It is necessary to stress the principle of giving priority to efficiency in primary distribution. Adherence to the principle of distribution according to work, more work for more pay is precisely the principle of giving priority to efficiency; it embodies genuine fairness at the same time. The principle of fairness is stressed in social redistribution; however, efficiency should not be jeopardized by any means. Through regulation of taxation, building of the social insurance system, and other means of social redistribution, the government resolves the excessive gap resulting from primary distribution, and guards against polarization on the basis of insuring efficiency top realize common prosperity. In a certain sense, fairness is not only embodied in the arena of distribution, but also in the opportunity and condition for competition on an equal basis to achieve high efficiency through such competition. This being the case, it is necessary for us to work hard to build standardized market competition order and regulations, so that efficiency and fairness may be genuinely unified. On the Issue of Gradual Reform and Phased Breakthroughs The development of productive forces is permanent, so is the change in production relations. The way to push reform should be determined by the needs of development. Development in different stages and areas sets out different requirements on reform; therefore, we should suit measures to local conditions and the time, form, magnitude, and steps of pushing reform. Experiences in 15-years of reform show that gradual reform in the market orientation has avoided the tremendous shock in the socioeconomy that resulted from the "shock treatment" adopted by the former USSR and East European countries, and is a successful road that falls in line with China's national conditions. The graduality of reform in its entirety was grounded on the fact that we had no ready pattern to copy in theory and practice; consequently, we must learn war through war. In development, we have adhered to reform to promote development with reform, while checking and testing reform with the results of development. That is a basic experience in China's reform. However, when reform has entered the present stage of tackling bottlenecks, should graduality, being sure and steady be stressed excessively, this would end in missing the opportunity, artificially prolonging the transition period, and eventually increasing the risk and cost of reform. This being the case, we should adopt more enthusiastic and active principles, working hard to gain substantial progress at every stage. Generally, the fundamental way to push China's reform should be "making gradual progress in entirety, with phased breakthroughs." Regarding reforms that have a bearing on the macroscopic tier of the overall situation, such as finance, taxation, and banking and foreign exchange, it is imperative to have a unified design and thorough-going implementation. Regarding some reforms at microscopic tier, such as enterprise and housing reform, they can be conducted in certain units on an experimental basis to gain experiences and then spread at an appropriate time. Regarding some reforms with ripe conditions, larger strides and a quicker pace can be taken. The pace of reform may be quickened in special economic zones, coastal areas, and cities where experiments are conducted; they may take the lead in building the new economic structure. Development zone in various categories and newly-built projects should be designed and operated based on the new structure from the very start. In reform, it is imperative to boldly blaze new trails, and break through old structures, and at the same time acquire rational standardization and build new structures. Standardization is relative; in some cases, experiments can be conducted first before standardization; in other cases, standardization can be formulated first before implementation. The mature, effective practices and experiences of countries which have implemented the market economy for years, and which embody socialized production and the general law governing the market economy, can be taken for reference and direct absorption. Accelerate Building of the General Framework of the Socialist Market Economic Structure At the discussion meeting on economic work of 10 provinces and regions of southcentral and southwestern China, Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized: "Building the new economic structure is a great feat of socialist system engineering; it is imperative to firmly grasp the formulation of the general framework." From breaking down the old structure to building the new one, from demolishing the "old house" to setting up the "new building," it is a process of conversion from destruction to establishment. Setting up the "new building" of the socialist market economic structure involves the meticulous design of the pillars and drawing the blueprint of the general framework. At a meeting in May, I listed 10 aspects in the general framework of the socialist market economic structure. Through several months of study and exploration and hearing opinions from various departments, we have further deepened our understanding, and the contents are now somewhat readjusted. Here, I should like to deal briefly with the main points. On the Ownership Structure Our basic principle is to adhere to taking public ownership as the main body, with the long-term coexistence, common development, and equal competition of diversified economic factors. Taking the public ownership as the main body is the basic characteristic of the socialist economic system; resolution of realization of the microscopic forms of the public ownership economy under the condition of the market economy, as well as the organic combination of the public ownership and the market economy, are the most important topics in building the new economic structure. The core issues and difficulties in reform today do not lie in the question of whether or not diversified economic factors can develop, but in how state-owned enterprises can be developed and strengthened. It is necessary to study how to do a good job of managing state-owned enterprises, continuously strengthen their vigor mainly through the channel of improving quality and efficiency, and have them play the dominant role in fair market competition. Of course, the development of a non-public ownership economy has its own place and role; it is necessary to augment guidance, supervision, and control while encouraging its development. State-owned assets should realize value preservation and appreciation through readjustment, which precisely means flowing. However, the flow of state-owned assets does not mean loss. The readjustment and flow of state-owned assets are means of appreciation; in other words, it is realizing optimal allocation of resources under the working of the market mechanism to endow the form of capital to state-owned assets. With the flow and reorganization of assets, the number of economic units with mixed ownership of assets will become increasingly greater; inevitably, the ownership structure will take on a new pattern. This is a trend that calls for our sufficient attention. On the Building of Modern Enterprise System Building a modern enterprise system is the enrichment and development of the socialist market economic theory as well as the foundation and key to building the new structure. This is just the task for state-owned enterprises, and enterprises in other categories should also work hard in this direction. State-owned enterprises should have explicit ownership of state- owned assets and a legal say in the disposal of enterprise assets; on this basis, they should explore the effective forms of realization according to different situation. The company is the main form of modern enterprise system. However, the modern enterprise system does not equate with turning an enterprise into a company, or a share-holding company, limited, or a listed share- holding company, limited. The key to reorganization of the company system is reorganizing those state-owned enterprises with mature conditions into companies with limited responsibility or limited share-holding companies according to the law, so that the enterprise many genuinely become a legal person and vigor, operating on its own, assuming sole responsibility for its profits and losses and the subjective aspect in market competition. Regarding the small number of enterprises that possess conditions, they can be reorganized into listed limited share-holding companies through strict examination and approval. Presently, the key to the voluminous enterprises that do not possess conditions to be reorganized into companies is to implement the "Enterprise Law," "Rules and Regulations for Industrial Enterprises of Ownership by All People To Convert Operational Mechanisms," and "Rules and Regulations for Financial Supervision and Control Over State-Owned Enterprises," work hard at converting enterprise operational mechanisms, find specific ways of cutting back the historical and social burdens of state-owned enterprises, and insure enterprise autonomy, as well as the value preservation and appreciation of state-owned assets. In the wake of a state-owned enterprise realizing the modern enterprise system, if it has genuinely converted its operational mechanism, completed and perfected management, mastered high technology, and enjoyed advantages in fierce world competition, then that reform is successful. Of course, the enterprise system does not have an ultimate pattern, and will be continuously developed, completed, and perfected in practice. On Building a Unified, Open Market System of Orderly Competition Presently, the two-track price system for production essentials remains and is a cause leading to non-standardized economic operation and the rise of unhealthy tendencies and phenomena of corruption. With the exception of some individual varieties, control over prices for the overwhelming majority of commodities, the labor force, and other production essentials should be lifted to shape the mechanism of the market determining prices. The task is still great to make the market decide prices for production essentials. To complete and perfect the market system, it is necessary to make nurturing a developed commodity market the base, with developing production essentials market as the key. We should gradually shape a unified and open-market pattern, which is healthy and complete, which is characterized by the coexistence of diversified economic factors, operational ways, and channels of circulation, organically links wholesale and retail businesses, and mutually accommodating domestic and foreign trade. Presently, it is especially necessary to emphasize the unification and opening up of the domestic market, oppose separation and blockades, and build a unified, healthy, and complete market competition order and a complete and perfect market organizational and administrative system. On Converting Government Economic Administrative Functions and Building the Macroeconomic Regulation and Control System To build an effective macroeconomic regulation and control system is to overcome the shortcomings of the market mechanism itself and insure sustained, high, and healthy economic growth. To do a good job of macroeconomic regulation and control, it is necessary to correctly handle relations among planning, finance, and banks so that they may work in a rational division of labor and form a whole range in harmony, while restricting each other. The main target of banks is to maintain a stable currency and the control monetary supply; regarding finance, its main target is to conduct readjustment in the economic as well as regional structure and social distribution; with planning, its main target is to formulate principles, policies, and strategic planning for long and medium- range economic development, and set out economic policies and means of comprehensive application. The state should apply financial and monetary policy in a comprehensive way, and guide as well as regulate the large balance between the general volume of demand and supply. While converting the government economic administrative functions, it is imperative to reform government economic administrative organizations; augment macroeconomic regulation, control and supervise departments; intensify social administrative functions; be determined to remove or merge specialized economic administrative departments; build, complete, and perfect the administrative system of state-owned assets, as well as its operational system; and implement a civil service system based on the principle of streamlining and high efficiency. In addition, it is necessary to establish standards in conformity with the needs of the market economy according to law and complete and perfect intermediary organizations. On Building an Individual Income Distribution System Giving Priority to Efficiency While Taking Fairness Into Consideration It is necessary to adhere to the principle of distribution according to work, with coexistence of diversified means of distribution. Worker pay should be chiefly determined by market competition, with implementation of the principle of more work for more pay, and the wage gap appropriately widened; the enterprise wage level and form should be chiefly determined by labor productivity, economic returns, and the condition of supply and demand on the labor employment market. It is necessary to change the lack of standardization and transparency in individual income resulting from distribution in kind and subsidies from various departments and gradually realize individual income in the form of banknotes. With market economic development, pluralism in the ownership structure, and the gradual increase in individual chattel, it is imperative to study in depth the new conditions and problems arising from production essentials entering individual income distribution. Through the building of the tax regulation and social insurance system and other means of social redistribution, especially work in completing, perfecting and augmenting collection of individual income tax, the individual income gap will be narrowed to avoid the surfacing of polarization resulting from the sharp difference in individual income while taking the road of common prosperity. On Building the Socialist Insurance System The key to the social security system is the establishment of the socialist insurance system, while shaping a whole range of social relief and welfare, as well as arrangements for special care to disabled servicemen and family members of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen. Presently, the key is to build, complete, and perfect pension and medical care insurance systems. It is necessary gradually to increase the proportion of individual payment through reform and implement the combination of overall social planning and individual accounts. It is necessary to determine the sources of social insurance funds according to different types of social security to shape into a sound circulation mechanism for the collection, operation, and appreciation of the social insurance fund. Attention should be paid to a relative balance in the social security level, the productive force development, and bearing capacity of various social and economic aspects; we should refrain from pursuing high welfare levels. Presently, it is necessary to unify the administrative structure of social security and formulate unified policies according to the principle of separating government and institutions, while establishing multiform intermediary organizations and realization of socialized service. China's new urban housing system is one characterized by a combination of market regulation and social security. It is necessary to set up an accumulation fund and other forms of savings for housing; an investment structure for housing construction with expenses shared by the state, the unit, and the individual; a commodity housing supply system with high-income residents as subjects, as well as an economical, practical housing supply system possessing the nature of social security, with ordinary citizens as the subjects; a system of transaction of housing property rights; and augmentation of maintenance and management services after sales, and so forth. Reform today should take the marketing of public-owned housing as the key and accelerate the progress of turning housing into a commodity. Social security and reform in the housing system should start with state-owned enterprises, especially large and medium-sized enterprises; the enterprise burden should be cut back, while promoting the conversion of enterprise operational mechanisms. On Building Foreign Economic Structures in Conformity With International Usual Practice, in Active Participation With International Competition, and Cooperation The market economy is itself an open-type economy. With the progress of reform and opening up, China will inevitably further expand its link with the world economy. On the one hand, it is necessary to utilize comparative advantages in the international division of labor and international exchanges. In establishing the new structure, we should promote the two-way dovetailing of the domestic and world market. On the other hand, it is necessary to see that mormal international practices are not absolute, and the present-day normal international practice is to the advantage of developed countries. Even so, the friction in trade between developed countries remains very intense. It is necessary for us to work hard to build a new world economic order, pay attention to protecting national interests, and promote economic development in opening up and world competition. It is necessary to further reform the administrative structure of foreign trade and exchange. We should develop a large number of foreign trade companies which are internationalized and standardized in behavior and combine industry and trade, push large-type enterprise groups and enterprises in townships and towns where conditions are ripe to directly participate in world competition, and expand economic, technological cooperation and ties in trade with all countries. On Deepening Rural Economic Restructuring Presently, special attention should be paid to studying the building of rural macroeconomic regulation and control system and increasing peasant income. Macroeconomic regulation and control of the general volume of farm produce will be conducted through such means as a special grain reserve, grain risk fund, finance for the implementation of rural policy, and control over import of farm produce. It is necessary genuinely to increase peasant income through reform and resolve the comparatively low interest of agriculture. Several steps may be taken into consideration, namely: First, readjust the rural industrial setup by developing agriculture of high quality, yield, and economic return; second, conduct operations of appropriate scope, while allowing the inheritance and transfer of peasants' contracted land use according to the law; third, develop enterprises in townships and towns in a big way; fourth, adopt a policy of protection, including state price protection for major farm produce, protection of arable land, and environmental protection; fifth, develop urban and rural labor employment markets in a planned way to absorb the surplus rural labor force; and sixth, accelerate building of small rural towns, giving play to economic returns of scope and effects of assembling. In addition, it is necessary to do a good job of county-level comprehensive reform, and promote the progress of urban and rural economic unification, as well as the overall development in rural social, economic and cultural undertakings. On Building a New Structure for Social Development in Undertakings in Science, Technology, Education, and Culture Compatible with the Socialist Market Economy Science and technology are primary productive forces; the realization of modernization is ultimately determined by improvement in the quality of the entire nation. Economic competition in the 21st century focuses on scientific and technological levels and the modernization of education. Whoever masters high science and technology and high-quality talents will win the initiative. The majority of research institutes should directly serve economic construction and establish a system of the economic legal person. In scientific research institutes, results as well as scientists and technicians that are able to enter the market should be open. Division in the flow of qualified people should be implemented, science and technology markets developed, and the unification of science, technology, and the economy promoted. It is necessary to regard education as the basic engineering of economic development, while giving full play to the enthusiasm of society running schools so that education may bring up more high-quality qualified people for socialist modernization. On Building Completed and Perfect Legal System of the Socialist Market Economy The market economic structure is in essence an economy characterized by the legal system. The change from the "rule of man" to a legal system in economic administration is an important sign of the establishment of the new structure. In the course of building the new structure, a major task for the government is to establish a complete and perfect system of laws, decrees, and regulations to standardize the operation of all economic arenas and links, the economic behavior of the government, enterprises and individuals, and augment economic supervision to realize the standardization and legalization of economic relations, operation, and administration. We may put it that the speed in establishing economic laws, decrees and regulations has a direct bearing on the progress in building the new structure. Augment Study, Elevate Our Political, Ideological, Theoretical and Policy Level By the end of the year, we are to mark the centenary of Comrade Mao Zedong's birth. Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping will also be published and circulated. Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the chief architect of socialist reform, opening up and modernization in China, and the contemporary Marxist founder of the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Jiang Zemin indicated that the 14th Party Congress set out the strategic task to arm the whole party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory. This is the pressing need of the great practice in pushing reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, and basic insurance for adhering to the party basic line for a century without wavering. The three volumes of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping are a whole. The Volume 3 to be published soon and Volume 2 published 10 years ago have collected the most important works with the greatest originality of Comrade Deng Xiaoping in the shaping and development of his theory. They are rich in content, cover an extensive range of subjects with incisive insight, filled with sharp spirit of the times and the national spirit, and shine with the brilliance of the Marxist truth. In studying volume three, it is imperative to earnestly learn from Comrade Xiaoping in applying to the Marxist position, viewpoints, and approaches, his scientific attitude, creative spirit, and revolutionary style in studying new conditions to resolve new problems. It is necessary to bring forward the Marxist study style in a big way. Efforts should be made in studying the original texts, working hard to achieve mastery through comprehensive study, and grasping their spiritual essence, and in combining theory and practice by linking them to the current situation and tasks to improve the ability to analyze and resolve problems. It is necessary to work hard at unifying thinking by linking it to the experiences since reform and opening up and the realities of one's thinking and work, to summarize experiences and lessons, clarify muddleheaded ideas, and guide one's practice with correct theory. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee to be convoked soon is to adopt a "decision" on several issues on building the socialist market economic structure. The "decision" is a programmatic document to guide our reform work for several years to come which also calls for efforts to do a good job of organizing its study. Sole reliance on zeal in pursuing reform is not enough; one must work hard and be good at study. Practice, research, summation, and reference all fall into the category of study. The better one's study, the faster one's level will be elevated, and the greater the results in one's work. Here, I should like to set a requirement on you, namely, I hope that every comrade will work hard to become an expert in some field and keep in touch with a number of Chinese and foreign experts in the same field. This way, the situation of our work will certainly be greatly changed. It is impossible to enlighten others with one's muddle-headedness. At the same time, one should not always be ignorant, repeating what other people said. For this reason, it is imperative for us to set up a complete and perfect system for study and adhere to it. Change Work Method, Do a Good Job of Self Reform To Be Compatible With Reform's Historical Change From "Destruction" to "Establishment" Comrades of restructuring the economy departments must be modest and meticulous and good at cooperating with other departments, and set out their plans and train of thought on the basis of earnestly lending an ear and absorbing the opinions of other departments. The cause of reform is one that concerns the whole party and country, not just the affairs of one department alone. We should offer help to each other, by no means should we jeopardize each other in our relations with other departments. We should attach importance to the formulation of plans for reform. In the wake of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee, the Commission for Restructuring the Economy should formulate more detailed planning for reform and present its plans for implementation. In planning and the plan for implementation, it is necessary to have a definite object in view, with a very explicit goal and a whole-range of decrees and regulations which can working. At the same time, it is necessary to include in our work agenda plans for bringing up cadres, specific regulations for implementation, and wide ranging decrees before implementation, as well as possible problems surfacing in the course of implementation. We are "designers" but should also be good at being "engineers." While formulating plans for reform, it is necessary to augment work in policy research. We should watch closely and analyze the actual conditions in economic life, think in line with what is in the minds of leading comrades, and be anxious about what leading comrades are anxious about, while making proposals and suggestions of decisionmaking value. Key, difficult points and hot spot issues and deeper-tier problems are precisely those key points and hot spot issues to be studied in our reform. For example, with the presentation of reforms in banking, finance, and taxation, it is necessary for us to earnestly study the possible further widening in the gap of western region with its comparatively low competitiveness; the question of how to resolve the social and historical burden of large and medium-sized state-own enterprises; and the issue of how to increase peasant income. In building the socialist market economic structure, there are many things that call on us to refer to the experiences of Western market economies. One way is to make investigation overseas; another way is to study from books. However, we should always bear in mind China's national conditions. That precisely means doing a good job of investigation and study, analyzing where the crux lies, and writing research reports that are of some weight, with deep insight and sound proposals. I suggest that comrades more often go down to stay at the grass-roots rural areas and enterprises to make friends with more workers, peasants, intellectuals, and entrepreneurs, and hear straight from them their opinions and suggestions. We hope that various localities will attach importance to, augment, and support work in restructuring the economy. Comrades in restructuring the economy departments should also accomplish something and do a good job of being the assistants to leadership at various levels through their own hard work. Another Very Important Task for Restructuring the Economy Departments Is Precisely To Augment Building of Rank and File, Improve Their Qualities, and Improve Work Style We should pay special attention to improving our own political qualities. The aim of reform is to build the socialist market economic structure. It is not enough to have some general knowledge about the market economy, and it is imperative to genuinely grasp the basic principle and essential characteristics of socialism, and a comparatively high cultivation of Marxist theory and political level. Presently, it is necessary to implement earnestly the central decision to continue to push the anti-corruption struggle. Comrades of the Commission for Restructuring the Economy must exercise self- discipline on the one hand and block structural loopholes that give rise to corruption through accelerating reform. It is necessary to further improve work style as well as work efficiency. We who are engaged in reforms must primarily have a strong awareness of reform. We should not stop at formulating plans for reforms and asking others to conduct reforms, but should take the lead in reforming our own work, improve work and work efficiency inside the Commission for Restructuring the Economy in the spirit and courage of reform. The cause of reform calls for a strong enterprising spirit, and people with devotion. I believe that many comrades who are determined to conduct reform are willing to work at restructuring the economy departments and make contributions to China's reform. I believe that many comrades of our restructuring the economy departments will do a good job of restructuring theeconomy. We should create conditions to absorb a large number of fine qualified people with aspirations to work in restructuring the economy departments. Presently we are in a new historical period, and are pursuing the building of a socialist market economic structure, an undertaking unprecedented in human history. Our task is precisely to do a very good job. Comrades of the Commission for Restructuring the Economy must emancipate their minds, brace up, and work hard to accomplish something. I believe that under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the leadership of the Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, our cause of reform will certainly be successful, and the magnificent goal of modernization will certainly be realized.
