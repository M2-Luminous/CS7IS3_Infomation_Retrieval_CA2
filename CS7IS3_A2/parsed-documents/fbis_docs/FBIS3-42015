The Shutting Down of Nuclear Power Stations Presages a Power Catastrophe''] [Text] It could happen as early as February. The Russian president and government will find it necessary to introduce a state of emergency. This was stated by directors of nuclear power stations who gathered in Moscow. They warned that, as early as February, the Leningradskaya, Smolenskaya, Kurskaya, Novovoronezhskaya, Kolskaya, and Bilibinskaya power stations will be unable to operate, and hence they will have to shut down their reactors. Yes, the ``greens'' who have been ``at war'' for some years now with the aid of their Western colleagues against Russia's nuclear electric power stations [AES's] can celebrate a ``victory.'' In the situation which has developed our power stations are simply physically incapable of operating, since there is no fuel, it is impossible to carry out systematic repairs, and there is no money to buy spare parts and consumables. And this is at a time when the only sector in Russia which has not decreased production since 1991 and has not permitted a slump [sentence as published]. Moreover, on the results of the work for 1993 our nuclear power stations were superior in virtually all indicators to the AES's of France and the United States. This applies to the reliability of operation, the number of breakdowns, and the performance of the service personnel. These are not ``our'' statistics, but the conclusions of international experts and organizations. It should be remembered that in the European part of Russia AES's produce almost one-half of the electricity, and one-fourth of this goes to such centers as Moscow and St. Petersburg. Add to this the fact that ``nuclear'' electricity is two to three times cheaper than the price which we, the consumers, have to pay. Therefore, the shutdown of AES's will at the very least provoke a two- to threefold increase in tariffs; but we are already used to this.... But something else is more dangerous: Stations are turning from producers into mighty consumers of energy, since this is required in order to maintain safety. And you can't just ``hit the switch''--we all know full well what happened at Chernobyl. And there is no use in hiding it, because of the shutdown of enterprises--including chemical, metallurgical, and machine building enterprises--an electricity surplus has developed in Russia. Electricity is mainly generated by coal and other thermal stations, and consequently, the ecological situation is sharply deteriorating. Discharges into the atmosphere of all manner of substances harmful to man and life in general will increase dramatically. Here is a truly ``Pyrrhic victory'' for ecology! Surely we can learn something from the experience of Armenia, where the decommissioning of AES's led to catastrophe? Or from the sad experience of Ukraine, where the power situation provoked a disastrous slump in industry and agriculture, and therefore, in the life of society as a whole? Do we really prefer to learn from our own mistakes? However, there is not long to wait: If we do not intervene in the fate of Russia's nuclear power stations today, within a month we will find out what a power crisis is really like.... So prepare the candles, ladies and gentlemen! The directors of Russia's AES's, who gathered at the ``Rosenergoatom'' concern for their emergency meeting, see as the main culprit of their woes the ``supermonopoly structure of the RAO `YeES Russia' [Russian joint-stock company `Integrated Energy System of Russia']--the sole consumer of our output.'' In their appeal to B. Yeltsin and V. Chernomyrdin they laid special stress on this fact. And it is possible to understand the directors: Any monopoly is harmful. The RAO buys energy from nuclear stations and, as is the custom with us, does not pay for it in full. But the RAO also does not receive money from consumers--it is probably impossible to find one enterprise today which has paid for the electricity it has received. Moreover, even our neighbors in the nearby foreign parts prefer not to pay--there are more than sufficient examples of this. Effectively Russia has provided just over 3 trillion rubles' [R] worth of electricity free of charge over the past few years--they took it and did not pay! You might think that we were already living under communism.... No, not ``we,'' but a great many enterprises and republics; and ``we'' are forced to pay over the odds for our light and heat. The nuclear physicists work well. And the government understands this: It is no accident that the country's top leadership listened attentively to their problems. And hence the directors of Russia's AES's write in their appeal: ``We thank our government for the fine decisions aimed at stabilizing the financial position in nuclear power engineering which it made in October-December of last year and which have been sunk by the prevailing reality existing in our country, where it is not the decisions of the government or the president that are fulfilled, but those of structures of the type of the RAO `YeES Russia' and people who prefer to burn scarce organic fuel, rather than deliver cheap power from AES's to consumers.'' The directors go on to cite a surprising fact: ``Of the credits worth R70 billion allocated by the government in October 1993 to pay for energy delivered from AES's, in three months only R6 billion has reached the AES's; R30 billion of the indicated sum for some reason was left in a commercial bank'' (I omit the name of the bank so as not to give it further publicity--V.G.). True, the AES directors are mistaken here: The money was not ``left'' in this bank for two months, but was successfully ``put to work''--it brought in to the bank twice the amount, since the ``nuclear R30 billion'' really ``did its stuff.'' And very few employees of the bank cared that at some nuclear power stations employees are not receiving their pay.... No, the employees and directors of Russia's AES's are not threatening a strike: They understand full well how serious the situation is today in power engineering and industry, but are warning the president, the government, and all of us, that they will be forced to shut down AES's, since their duty as professionals and as human beings forbids them to allow new Chernobyls. The AES directors clearly state that they cannot allow the slightest risk in the operation of AES's. But, to be honest, the AES directors no longer hope for help from the government, since not one of its decisions has been fulfilled.
