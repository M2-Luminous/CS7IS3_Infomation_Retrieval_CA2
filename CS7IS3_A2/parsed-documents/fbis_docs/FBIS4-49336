In a rare show of unity, the Liberal Party gave its backing to a motion initiated by the United Democrats leader, Martin Lee, attacking the current and incoming sovereign powers for violating the Joint Declaration -- the agreement under which Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. Lee's motion was passed without opposition -- by 23 votes, but three government officials and a maverick legislator, Chim Pui-chung, abstained. Other members were absent. Lee accused China of interfering in Hong Kong affairs ahead of 1997 and said Britain was "joining hands" with China in violating the Joint Declaration, signed in 1984. The leader of the Liberal Party, Allen Lee, said he did not believe Britain and China "deliberately went back on their word" to uphold the Joint Declaration, but he charged them with abandoning their promises to co-operate to achieve a smooth transition. Martin Lee said the motion amounted to a vote of no confidence in the two powers. "My motion is effectively a vote of no confidence aimed at both Britain and China," Lee said outside the chamber. "It shows a profound concern among legislative councillors that Britain and China will not adhere to their obligations under the Joint Declaration." During the debate his colleague, Szeto Wah, said: "We have reason to believe that the British and Chinese sides have ganged up to destroy the spirit of the Joint Declaration. We are being betrayed." Martin Lee said the Joint Declaration seems to have become "a declaration of joint destruction". He listed 10 "incidents of violations of the Joint Declaration". Among them were the seven diplomatic letters exchanged between Britain and China in 1990 which showed a joint attempt to slow democratic development. He also quoted a secret Sino-British agreement on the composition of the Court of Final Appeal as an example of Britain's complicity in violating the Joint Declaration. Martin Lee said the Basic Law, announced in 1990, violated the Joint Declaration, without protest from Britain. "If we don't defend the spirit of the Joint Declaration, Hong Kong will be ruled by a puppet regime from the north," Martin Lee said. Christine Loh, an independent legislator, said Britain seemed resigned to letting China "re-interpret and redefine" the Joint Declaration. "Britain seems to take the view that it will have vacated Hong Kong by 1997, so that whatever happens here is not Britain's responsibility," she said. The Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, Nicholas Ng, said it was "plainly untrue" that the Hong Kong-British government had failed to abide by the objectives of the Joint Declaration. Ng rejected criticisms that the government betrayed the aspirations of Hong Kong people for a legislature of more directly-elected seats. "As a responsible government we have to strike the right balance between the expressed desire of the community for a greater say in running their own affairs on the one hand, and a form of government capable of transcending 1997. I believe we've struck the right balance," he said. Ng also defended the secret Sino-British agreement on the Court of Final Appeal.
