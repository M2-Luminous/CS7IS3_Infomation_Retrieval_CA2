In asking me to write a preface for the anthology, its chief editor said: "The Chinese Society for the Study of Cultural and Economic Development Along the Huang He, the Managerial Science Research Institute, and the Xinhua Publishing House have organized scholars and experts in various professions to jointly compile the `Anthology of Education in Professional Ethics in China' by -- in light of the norms of professional ethics in their respective fields and under the current conditions of developing a socialist market economy -- elaborating on the principles, content, styles, and methods of vocational ethics education in order to make vocational ethics education more methodical and standardized. Such books are useful in laying a foundation for raising the entire nation's vocational ethics standards and for promoting socialist spiritual civilization, in clarifying and surmounting the ideological confusion created by ultra-individualism and money worship, in improving the competence of the ranks of the workers and staff, and in resisting and overcoming unhealthy practices in various industries, trades, and professions." It is my belief that vocational ethics education can be carried out well and effectively only when it is integrated as an essential part of socialist spiritual civilization. I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to write this preface to say a few words about my personal views on the relationship between the two civilizations. With the founding of New China, the CPC became the party in power, and it bore upon its shoulders the heavy responsibility of promoting the two civilizations. Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the party as a whole carried out the party's three important styles of work (integrating theory with practice, practicing criticism and self-criticism, and forging close ties with the masses); firmly bore in mind the party's purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly; was modest and prudent, guarded against arrogance and rashness, worked hard, observed discipline, and expended great efforts in learning how to run the economy, administer state affairs, and ensure the nation's security. Within a few years, we were able to recover from the wounds of the war, we revived the national economy, and we implemented rather successfully the first Five-Year Plan and the remolding of socialism, thus bringing about a situation characterized by thriving economic development, an improvement in people's lives, and a clean and honest party style and general standards of social conduct. Comparing the new society with the old one, people became aware that only socialism could save China. Aside from the correct line, the great successes achieved in the construction of two civilizations can also be attributed to a group of party cadres who, in the prime of their lives, had undergone various tests and had set an example of correctly carrying out and executing the party's correct line. Upon the basic completion of its socialist transformation, China has entered a period of full socialist construction. When we say full, this naturally covers the building of both material and spiritual civilization. The policy decision made by the Eighth CPC National Congress has been correct, in holding that socialism has been basically established in China; and that despite the continued existence of class struggle and the need for further strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship, the nation's principal contradiction is no longer between the working and the capitalist classes but rather between the people's urge for rapid economic and cultural development and the current economic and cultural conditions that fail to satisfy the people's needs. The principal missions of the people throughout the country are to concentrate their strength for the development of social productive forces, to realize the state's industrialization programs, and to gradually satisfy the people's ever-increasing economic and cultural needs. However, due to insufficient ideological preparedness for all-around socialist construction -- particularly the emergence of a relapse concerning the understanding of the principal contradiction -- and the "leftist" mistake we have committed, we have been unable to persist in the correct line set by the Eighth CPC National Congress. Although the party intended to focus its attention on economic development, the approach was wrong. While the people were zealous for construction, the party's guiding principles have not been in line with the objective economic law, thus resulting in the blunders of the "Great Leap Forward" and the "People's Commune," which frustrated the building of the two civilizations. After the party discovered its flaws and after a five-year adjustment period, China managed to regain its lease on life concerning the national economy, with encouraging results being achieved in the building of spiritual civilization. Jiao Yulu, Lei Feng, and Wang Jinxi were typical advanced models who sprung up during this period. Unfortunately, the party has abandoned its central task of economic construction and has clung for a long period to the wrong guiding principle of "taking class struggle as the key link," which subsequently caused the decade-long civil strife of the "Great Cultural Revolution" and thus the grievous devastation of the building of the two civilizations. The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee made a great historic turn by resolutely terminating the use of the wrong slogan of "taking class struggle as the key link" -- which was not suitable for a socialist society and which ran totally counter to China's actual state conditions -- and by making a timely strategic policy decision to divert the party's central task to the socialist modernization drive. As reform and opening up went deeper, Comrade Deng Xiaoping profoundly pointed out: "The Essence of socialism is to emancipate and develop the productive forces, eliminate exploitation, and remove polarization for the final attainment of common prosperity." "Upholding reform and opening up is a move that will determine China's fate." Making sure that reform and opening up will be carried out in a healthy manner, he also put forward the packaged principle of "being firm in attending to both material progress and cultural and ideological progress." Under the guidance of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we have scored successes that have become the focus of world attention. There is no denying the fact that during the new-old transition process, we did made mistakes on the question of precedence, amid calls for improvements in such aspects as the party and social atmospheres. Our party is taking measures to solve these problems. With efforts in party building being intensified, with the fundamental improvement, enhancement, and perfection of the party's democratic centralism for a genuine application in daily life; with the legal system being improved to such a level that there are sufficient laws for us to follow, with the anticorruption drive going deeper, and with the gradual establishment of a socialist market economic order, all these problems are solvable. Of course, we need time to solve these problems once and for all. As long as long as we carry out our work unswervingly and succeed in finding ways and reaching a consensus, I think that these problems may -- in fact, must -- be solved within three to five years. From a brief account of the historical process mentioned above, we can reach a common understanding on the following two points: 1) The extent of the achievements scored by us in building the two civilizations depends, first of all, on whether the party's line is correct or not. If the line is correct, our achievements will be great; if the line is not on the right track, our achievements will be small or even incline to the opposite direction. The extent of our achievements also depends on whether our party organizations at all levels can correctly implement the party's line as well as a series of principles and policies it has adopted. The level of understanding gained by cadres, their ability to have the overall situation well in hand, and whether they really implement the party's line, principles, and policies in handling concrete tasks and play an exemplary role will affect, to a great extent, the success of the building of the two civilizations. Therefore, arming the whole party with the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, enhancing the consciousness of all comrades of the party concerning the implementation of the party's basic line -- "one central task and two basic points," and adhering to the principle of grasping two links at the same time and of taking a tough stand on both become a key aspect of our endeavor to successfully build the two civilizations. 2) We must persist in paying equal attention to building the two civilizations at the same time. Not a single one of the two civilizations can be dispensed with. They interact with and promote each other. The building of material civilization provides a strong material basis for the building of socialist spiritual civilization. "Poverty is not socialism." "Socialism must get rid of poverty." It is very hard to imagine that we can successfully build a socialist spiritual civilization if we do not develop the economy or get rid of poverty and backwardness or if we deviate from an economic basis. Of course, neither do we approve of the concept that spiritual civilization will be good naturally when the economy is developed. With regard to spiritual civilization, what counts is the effort to build it. If the building of spiritual civilization is carried out successfully, this will in turn provide a spiritual driving force as well as support in terms of intellectual resources for the building of material civilization and an ideological guarantee for the correct orientation of its development. The two are organically integrated in the practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Recently, the central authorities have repeatedly stressed: "Judging by the overall situation of reform, opening up, and modernization in China, the crux of the matter lies in properly handling the relationships between reform, development, and stability." I think that these six [figure as received] Chinese characters -- reform, development, and stability -- are very profoundly expounded because they also summarize the dialectic materialist internal relationship between the building of spiritual civilization and that of material civilization. The purpose of reform is to achieve development, but if we want to achieve development very satisfactorily, we must have a stable social environment. An organic integration between reform, development, and stability will enable the three to promote one another. It includes the building of both material civilization and spiritual civilization. Professional ethics education is an aspect that ought to be included in the building of socialist spiritual civilization and an indispensable condition for establishing a socialist market economic order. "The Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on the Guiding Principle for the Building of Socialist Spiritual Civilization" pointed out: "We must make vigorous efforts to promote professional ethics in all trades and professions." Promoting professional ethics becomes particularly conspicuous and important in the process of shifting from the traditional planned economic system to a socialist market economic system. High standards for professional ethics become increasingly necessary as a new socialist market economic system is gradually established and as socialist laws and regulations are gradually amplified. We are entirely capable of attaining these high standards because we have Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought as our guidance, because we have accumulated both positive and negative experience in more than four decades after the founding of the People's Republic, and because we have a socialist system, the fine traditions of the party, and the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation. All these are our strong points. Meanwhile, we must also draw lessons from the Western countries' advanced experience in management and their successful employment of professional ethics education. While making unremitting efforts to successfully promote economic construction, we must pay close attention to successfully building spiritual civilization, and we must vigorously advocate regular education in and the study of professional ethics among all trades and professions in a bid to enable all citizens to live up to a code of conduct compatible with rapid social development, to conscientiously abide by their respective trades' and professions' standards of professional ethics, and to become a new generation of well-educated, well-disciplined people imbued with lofty ideals and moral values. If everyone in all trades and professions can "start cultivating professional ethics for himself or herself" to enable a social custom under which everyone observes professional ethics to take shape, the general mood of society will surely improve, we shall certainly be able to promote the development of social productive forces, and the overall quality of our entire nation will surely be enhanced.
