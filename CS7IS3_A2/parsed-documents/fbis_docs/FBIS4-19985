Addressing the annual spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund here he also called for fiscal discipline among the industrialized nations and declared, "The markets need signals to confirm the fact that the increase in American rates will not stop the decline in European rates." "We are called on to act in a non-inflationary way, and not only through monetary policy, to bring down the cost of capital in real terms," the central banker continued. "Medium-term fiscal recovery must, therefore, continue for the objective of stimulating and strengthening savings and stabilizing expectations." Fazio said the industrialized nations must also pursue "wage moderation, which prevents the risk of inflationary pressures." Providing a run-down of developments in basic economic policy in Italy following the devaluation of the lira, the governor touched on wage dynamics brought under control, discipline on the monetary and budget fronts and public sector reform, all of which have led to "important progress in reducing inflation and improving the balance of payments." "This strategy can be strengthened and carried further forward in the context of recovery in the economic cycle which is now beginning to materialize," he added. Citing the figures, Fazio said the balance of current accounts in Italy moved from 2.3 percent of GDP in 1992 to a surplus of 1.1 percent of GDP the following year. The surplus, he said, "should be significantly larger in 1994." On another issue here, Bank of Italy Director General Lamberto Dini said increases in rates and instability on international bond markets "are not consistent with the favorable scenario on the inflation front." At a meeting of the Group of Ten, Dini reviewed recent events on the bond markets and the highly-speculative hedge funds which came to influence the course of bonds and their yields. Earlier, the director general told a press conference that, "At the end of 1993, a certain euphoria dominated the market because of the expectation of lower short-term interest rates in Europe and long-term rates in the United States. Then a series of events, beginning with the first small increase in February in FED fund rates in the United States, caused a strong shift in the expectations of dealers, a change which was perhaps excessive compared to the fundamentals of the economies," he noted. "In fact, we have witnessed the phenomenon of overshooting which caused this rise in long-term rates." A communique issued at the end of the Group of Ten meeting said, "Ministers and governments have agreed on the fact that despite the presence of sharp price movements in the prices of securities, the financial markets have worked well and have managed the increase in the volume of transactions without systematic problems and tensions."
