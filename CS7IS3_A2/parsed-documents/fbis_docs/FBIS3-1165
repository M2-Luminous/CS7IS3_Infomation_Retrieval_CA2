Addressing the sixth session of the kwaZulu legislative assembly, Mr Buthelezi said: "I cannot see that a large number of the people of kwaZulu/Natal will be willing participants in the elections." Mr Buthelezi accused the government and the African National Congress [ANC] of using the power of the state to shake the country and seize power at the polls. "They have the laws which were made to assist them, and the security forces which they are reconstituting to apply the laws in their favour," he said. Mr Buthelezi said kwaZulu took a stand against the interim constitution because its grassroots constituency had demanded it. "There is a vast Zulu concern about the future governance of kwaZulu/Natal, which they see as the kingdom of kwaZulu. "I warn that should the ANC attempt to destabilise the kwaZulu government, as it destabilised Bophuthatswana and has threatened destabilisation against the Ciskei, a conflict of awesome proportions will be unleashed to the tragic detriment of South Africa and the democratic process." Mr Buthelezi said his rejection of the interim constitution, the Transitional Executive Council and other transitional mechanisms carried with it powerful conviction that the Zulu people would not be robbed of their right to self-determination.
