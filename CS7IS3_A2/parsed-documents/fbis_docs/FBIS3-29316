FBIS3-29316 "dreas033__a94011" FBIS-EAS-94-033-A Document Type:Daily Report 17 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Increase in U.S. Auto Sales Reportedly Possible OW1602144694 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 14 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 11 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1602144694 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] It has been learned that a joint survey by the Japanese and U.S. Governments was conducted to check the market share of imported automobiles in Japan and that judging from the survey, a joint survey report estimates that it is possible to increase sales of U.S.-made autos by 37,000 a year if such obstacles as a "keiretsu" structure between auto manufacturers and dealers are removed. It also estimates that if such conditions as securing of sales personnel and funds, and U.S. manufacturers' efforts to produce autos that can appeal to the Japanese market are met, sales of U.S.-made autos will be increased by 57,000 a year. Japan and the United States, in negotiations on autos and the auto parts sector under Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, confronted each other over "objective criteria," and the two nations failed to reach an agreement at the Japan-U.S. summit talks held last week. But since the joint survey report says that increasing sales of U.S.-made autos in the Japanese market is possible, it is likely that the report will have an impact on the future negotiations on auto and the autoparts sectors. The joint survey was based on a meeting of market-oriented sector-selective (MOSS) committee. The survey was conducted from February of 1992 by the Nomura Research Institute and the U.S. firm Boose Allen and Hamilton [as published] at the request of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] and the U.S. Department of Commerce. The survey report lists 1) difficulty in securing sales personnel; 2) the shortage of sales floor space; 3) financial shortages; 4) lack of the three biggest U.S. auto manufacturers' (Big Three) efforts to make autos that can appeal to the Japanese market; and 5) the existence of the "keiretsu" system, which connects Japanese auto manufacturers with dealers, as obstacles to the promotion of Japanese dealers' sales of U.S.-made autos. The estimated figures shown in the report were calculated on the assumption that the above obstacles are removed. The report estimates that it is possible for dealers to increase sales of U.S-made autos by 57,000 a year if the above four obstacles (1 to 4) are removed, adding that it is possible to increase sales of autos by 37,000 a year if the "keiretsu" system is abolished and if dealers make a franchise contract directly with U.S. auto makers. The report also says that if prices of U.S.-made autos are lowered by 10-25 percent, it is possible to increase sales by 6,000 to 27,000 a year. According to the Japan Automobile Importers' Union, the number of U.S.-made autos imported by Japan in 1993 from the Big Three was 19,335.
