Citizen confidence in these politicians slightly declined against the February results. Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, favored by 86 percent of Czech citizens, remains the most popular politician. Klaus placed second (73 per cent), and Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec third (69 per cent).
