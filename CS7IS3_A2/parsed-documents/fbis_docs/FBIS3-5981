At a conference in Vientiane yesterday, senior members of the Lao government spelt out a range of incentives to attract foreign investment. They include foreign investment laws; customs and taxation; flexible rules and regulations; and a number of bilateral Lao-Thai economic and investment agreements, such as agreements on trade and on investment promotion and protection, as a basic guarantor to Thai investors. While they expressed a strong desire to develop the country's natural resources to improve its ailing economy, they repeatedly stressed that Laos' arts and culture, ecology and environment will remain intact and well preserved. The calls were made yesterday during a conference in Vientiane on "The Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge: Economic and Investment Prospects in the Lao PDR" which was organized by THE NATION ahead of the official opening of the Mittraphap bridge early next month. Lao PM's Office Minister Phao Bounnaphon inaugurated the conference while Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan gave a keynote speech on prospects for Lao-Thai economic cooperation. Phao said his country of 4.4 million people is full of natural resources, and has stable political and social systems, which are conducive for foreign investment. He called on Thai business people to probe Laos' economic potential, especially in the fields of agriculture and forestry, industry and services for local and external needs. Laos' new market-oriented economic policy, he said, has received full support from the private and government sectors of friendly nations, especially Thailand which "has warmly extended its assistance and cooperation" to Laos. Amnuai warned Thai businessmen and investors not to exploit the resources in Laos or other neighboring countries for short-term gains. He said traders and investors should always bear in mind the "philosophy of cooperation," which purports "mutual benefits" and "fairness in profit sharing" with host countries. He said the cooperation should provide "sufficient economic returns" to host countries including the transfer of technology and management know-how so that they will eventually stand on their own feet. Lao-Thai cooperation will contribute and lead to broader sub-regional and regional economic cooperation, which is developing under the structure of the four northern Mekong-rim countries in the Quadrangle Economic Cooperation and the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Amnuai said. He said he believed the opening of the Lao-Thai Friendship Bridge across the Mekong River by His Majesty the King on April 8 will set a new era of bilateral relations and cooperation. About 250 people attended the conference yesterday at the Lan Xang Hotel, including 140 Thai businessmen and investors, about 30 representatives of the Lao private sector and officials from various key Laos economic ministries. Among the Lao delegates were six deputy ministers from key economic ministries and offices who gave a broader perspective of Laos' economic and investment potential and outlined national foreign investment laws, incentives, rules and regulations. Somphong Mongkhonvilai, vice president of the National Committee for Planning and Cooperation (CPC), discussed Laos' economic development plan towards the year 2000, while another CPC vice president Leuan Sombounkhan talked about national foreign investment policies. Somphong said the new eight-year economic development plan was implemented in February 1993 with the objective of boosting the country's financial capital by developing its own natural resources in the fields of minerals, hydropower, tourism, agriculture and forestry, husbandry and human resources. Rural development has been the government's priority in order to bridge the economic disparity and to distribute wealth to provide better living conditions and standards around the country, he said. Vientiane has set an economic growth target of 7-8 per cent annually. Leuan said Laos is open to investors from around the world, but that Thailand has an advantage due to its territorial proximity and racial and cultural similarities. He acknowledged several shortcomings that have hindered economic growth, such as a shortage of capital markets, manpower, lack of economic expertise and technology, and poor management systems. He described in detail an 11-point incentive program, which Vientiane has introduced to attract prospective investors. They include opening investment in all economic fields including human resources in the fields of academia, education and culture; protecting against nationalization; three different forms of investment, from contract agreements to joint ventures, or 100 percent foreign investment; full repatriation of personal and corporate assets; freedom from government intervention in investments; recruitment of foreign labor and human resources; repatriation of profits; and a certain period of relaxation of income and profit taxes and the establishment of a "one-stop service" to facilitate investments. Four other Lao ministers gave a good perspective of investment in Laos. They stressed that Vientiane has pursued an economic policy of sustainable development for mutual benefits with the aim of protecting its culture, social structure, environment and ecology.
