The ruling will take effect on the day of publication in the Digest of Laws. The Constitutional Court reacted to President Vaclav Havel's proposal to delete the above provisions, but to keep the provision on the defamation of the republic. Article 103, concerning the defamation of the president of the republic, also remained untouched. President Havel had not recommended that it be deleted. Court spokesman Vladimir Klokocka said the Czech Republic was not exceptional in protecting the republic and its constitutional organs in this special way. What was unusual, he said, was the way in which they were protected, with no difference being made between the crime of defamation in various specific constitutional organizations, which had certain functions and certain competence. Justifying the court's ruling, Klokocka said that similar to Article 102 were Articles 154 and 156, which dealt with gross insult or slander of a state organ or public official. The similarities and differences between Article 102 and Articles 154 and 156 would lead to interpretations which kept under which parliament, the government and the Constitutional Court would not count as state organs, although they were. In Article 102 they were offered a superior type of legal protection, which was otherwise only usual for abstract symbols of a state, such as the republic. Here Klokocka pointed out that the conception of Article 102 was at variance with the Czech Republic's international undertakings, and that it went over the head of its constitutional order. "What is important is not only how Article 102 would be interpreted by the courts, but also the way in which these laws would be interpreted by the general public. If people are uncertain about the law, they will lose confidence in the legal state and will also be hindered in civic activity," Klokocka said. Because suitable special protection for these institutions was not specified, "the concept of defamation takes on a general and indefinite meaning, abused by the old authoritarian regimes," which in certain questions allowed misty formulations to be used, and these could be interpreted according to need. Article 102 did not have to be a necessary measure for the very reason that the protection offered to state organs in paragraphs 154 and 156 was sufficient, and from the point of view of limiting the object of protection, even more precise, Klokocka said. The concept of "defamation" was used in the Czech lands by the criminal law in 1852. In 1923 Czechoslovakia incorporated it into the law on the protection of the republic, and later into the criminal codes of the 1950's and 1960's. Defamation was understood as a gross detraction of dignity, gross dishonoring, degradation and ridicule. The term was still understood in the same way today, Klokocka said, but the difference was that the 1923 law used it only in connection with defamation of the republic, with a concept, therefore, which was not an expression for a certain institution with certain competence.
