Khryapov, Institute of High-Current Electronics, Siberian Division, Russian Academy of Sciences, Tomsk; UDC 621.384.6] [Abstract] A new electron beam for experiments on the generation of high-power UHF radiation is described. Experiments are conducted to form tubular electron beams in a coaxial diode with magnetic insulation. Beams are obtained with a diameter of 340-360 mm with diode voltage of 0.85-2 MV and a pulse length of 0.6-1 ï¿½s. The power of the electron beam reaches 100 GW in the drift tube.
