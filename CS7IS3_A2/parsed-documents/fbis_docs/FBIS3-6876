Had he not collided his deadly vehicle with a motorcycle he would have killed many more people than the one innocent truck driver. The explosives on his truck, set to go off at the flick of a battery switch, would have levelled an entire building or more, and killed and wounded people in a wide area. The bomb was assembled mostly from easily obtained common items. It was similar to the bombs that exploded last year at New York's World Trade Centre and before that at the Israeli Embassy in Argentina. In short the bomb was practically a signature for international terrorists using Mideast grievances as their flimsy excuse for killing. Our security officials have rightly taken a cautious role and avoided assigning a motive for last week's abortive bomb attack. This will not stop the man in the street from speculation, nor should it prevent those same officials keeping a close watch on suspects. The means and methods of this unsuccessful attack clearly point to professional terrorists with international backing. Identification of the driver of the truck as of Mideast appearance provides at least some clue in the search for the criminals. There must be a forthright, unyielding investigation of this truck bomb. In the first place, one Thai citizen has already been murdered. Although the attack itself was stopped thanks to the bungling of the driver coupled with the unwitting tenacity of a motorcycle taxi driver, the terrorist was clearly planning massive killing and destruction. Whether the target of this foreigner's attack was other foreigners, as seems likely, is not the point. The blast would have killed and injured more innocent Thai citizens as well as the foreign officials our authorities are pledged to protect. The worldwide publicity after a successful blast would have also done untold harm to the country's image. Despite its good relations with all sides in the Middle Eastern disputes, Thailand as a country would have thus become an innocent victim of international terrorism as much as have the unfortunate passengers on hijacked or bombed airliners. International terror has seldom visited Bangkok. But when it has the results have been deadly. A Black September attack on the Israeli Embassy in 1972 ended peacefully after several days of tense negotiations. But since then, hijackings and attacks have cost several dozen innocent lives. Authorities pledged after the deadly 1988 Kuwait Air hijacking from Bangkok that anti-terrorism procedures would be tightened. During the Gulf War, when suspected terrorists were poised to make attacks in Bangkok, they were intercepted and sent packing. Of course, there is no way that every act of terror can be detected and stopped. New York's blast and the recent attacks on London's Heathrow airport show that even the most security-conscious governments are helpless against the determined terrorist. But it is clearly imperative that police and other security officials continue to do their utmost to prevent such heinous acts. Few doubt that last week's giant bomb could not have been assembled without help from people other than the lone, and possibly suicidal, truck driver. Whether these helpers were foreign diplomats or private Thai or foreign citizens should not influence the strength of efforts to root out dangerous threats to our country. Diplomats involved in terrorism can and should be expelled. Those who hold no such special status, Thai or foreign, can be investigated and dealt with under the law. There is a general belief -- whether true or not -- that on occasion our law-enforcement officers go easy on disputes between foreigners. At the personal level this may at times be the wisest course. But acts of great violence like that which would have been triggered by the truck bomb deserve full investigation and, if possible, direct action. Indeed, it is exactly Thailand and its citizens who have been wronged even during the spineless lead-up to last week's non-bombing. There may be no fingerprints to identify positively the driver of the bomb truck or the murderer of an innocent Thai. But the fingerprints of international terror lie over this entire case. The real culprits should be sought by aggressive police work. Even if they escape there still remains the responsibility to determine who brought terror into our capital. If suspected, such persons should be rigorously investigated. Any diplomats found guilty should be immediately expelled and other suspects charged in court. Terrorism must not be tolerated anywhere within Thailand. Our security officials must take tough action and must also be seen to be taking such action. Bangkok is not Beirut or the occupied territories. Those who would use the uncivilised violence of terrorism in our country must be identified and dealt with unflinching firmness.
