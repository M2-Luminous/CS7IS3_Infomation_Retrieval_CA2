The protesters handed over to the U.S. forces side a letter of protest addressed to the U.S. Administration, shouting "Away with the U.S. Forces" and "A permanent stop to the `Team Spirit' war exercises". In the letter written in the name of the Pusan and South Kyongsang Provincial Federation of General Student Councils the students strongly demanded that the United States stop putting pressure upon South Korea to liberalize import, including the rice market opening pressure, and abandon the planned deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea and dismantle the U.S. military bases. That day the Kim Yong-sam group arrested all the participants in the sit-in. According to a radio report from Seoul, more than one thousand students under the Eastern Seoul District Federation of General Student Councils including those of Hanyang and Konkuk Universities held a rally at Hanyang University on the afternoon of March 18 and bitterly condemned the Kim Yong-sam group's criminal act in illegally submitting to the United States a plan on the implementation of farm produce market opening. The students branded the criminal act of the Kim Yong-sam "regime" in presenting beforehand the "final implementation plan on the Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations" to the United States in mid-February in secrecy as an "obvious act of pro-American flunkeyist treachery". They called for an all-people struggle against a "parliamentary ratification of the bill" on farm produce market opening. Then they burnt a stars and stripes and staged a demonstration, shouting "We oppose the Uruguay Round" and "Yankee, go home".
