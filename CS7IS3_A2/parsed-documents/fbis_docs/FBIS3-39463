"This is the day of change and the greatest day in the history of the Republikaner," Schoenhuber stated at his party's Ash Wednesday rally in front of an audience of -- according to police estimates -- about 6,500 people in a beer tent on the outskirts of Osterhofen, Lower Bavaria. The end of the traditional parties is near. "I have been chosen by fate to help the German people," Schoenhuber said. On Wednesday the hour of the CSU's decline tolled in Passau [where the CSU is holding its Ash Wednesday rally]. The rise of the Republikaner cannot be stopped anymore, Schoenhuber stated. Schoenhuber accused Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of Jews, of fanning anti-Semitism in the FRG. There is no collective guilt for the crimes of the Nazi period. "Today's Germany is not guilty. Our only crime in world history was that we lost two world wars," Schoenhuber said.
