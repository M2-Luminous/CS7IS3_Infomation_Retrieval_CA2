It is in Puerto Lopez, Meta Department, and is apparently building a base to help fight drug production. Meanwhile, Marines arrived at Malaga Bay in Valle del Cauca. Although it is rumored in certain sectors that the reason for their presence here is to pressure the Cali Cartel to surrender and build a radar and communications center, today--in full view of local residents and tourists--the North Americans began their construction of a school and a road in Juanchaco, social projects that they say will help the people. They brought all types of vehicles, construction equipment, bulldozers, and barges to produce electricity. If their instructions were to hide why they are here, their behavior showed the opposite. The environment today was normal, although they were prohibited from talking to the media. Some local residents welcome the Marines with open arms: [Begin unidentified speaker recording] They are welcomed, because if they come to Juanchaco to build projects for the good of the community and we reject them, other locations will be asking for them with open arms. [end recording] Others question their presence here: [Begin second unidentified speaker recording] We have not heard the government, the mayor's office, or the governor's office clearly tell us what they are going to do. [end recording] The presence of U.S. troops in Colombia is nothing new. Five months ago CMI was with the U.S. Armed Forces in San Jose del Guaviare, where they built an operations base for the river force of the Colombian Navy in an area where there are many guerrillas and drug traffickers. As if this was not enough, the residents of Puerto Lopez, Meta, have also reported the presence of U.S. soldiers. They are apparently there to build--jointly with the Colombian Navy--what might be an operations center in that area, where drug-trafficking activity has been detected. [Begin recording] [Puerto Lopez Mayor Hernan Saavedra] We have learned that U.S. Navy personnel are building a naval base for the Colombian Navy in the jurisdiction of Puerto Lopez. [Unidentified reporter] Are they armed? [Third unidentified speaker] Of course. Each one is armed with at least their regulation weapon. [Fourth unidentified speaker] They have been seen armed like any officer with his pistol on the side. [Fifth unidentified speaker] I at least disagree with the government's decision to permit those gentlemen to come here to our territory, because we do not know what their mission is. [end recording]
