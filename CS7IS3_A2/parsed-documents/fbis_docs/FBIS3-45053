The investment structure, which is the important driving force and core of the cause of reform and development, and reform of this structure, have again become a matter of great concern to senior Chinese leaders and basic-level enterprises alike. On the basis of carefully analyzing the course of history and the lessons of reform of the investment structure over the past 14 years, we should search for a general model for the reform of China's investment structure in the light of the overall objective of the reform to establish a socialist market economy system, and we should work out short-term reform measures for realizing this target model. This has become our pressing task in promoting reform of the economic system as a whole. I. A Basic Appraisal of Reform of the Investment Structure Over the Past 14 Years In China, the term investment structure generally refers to the operating mechanism and management system for activities in fixed- assets investment. It mainly covers the activities of investment entities, fund-raising methods, the ways in which investment is employed, the process by which projects are decided upon, the management of construction programs, and the macroregulation and control system. China's investment structure is basically one which has gradually developed in the wake of large-scale economic construction shortly after the founding of the People's Republic, and constitutes the integral core of the traditional planned economy structure. The experimental reform introduced in 1979 to replace government allocation by bank loans for investment in capital construction heralded the reform of the investment structure. Reforms carried out in this connection in the 14 years since then have produced a new investment structure: First, the opening of multiple channels of investment in diverse economic sectors has put to an end to the singular channel of investment under the traditional structure, where units owned by the whole people were mainly dependent on state financial administrations, and this has greatly aroused the enthusiasm of all quarters to invest in construction projects. This plays an important role in the extensive and rapid raising of nearly 500 million yuan of investment in the past 14 years. [figure as published] By the end of 1992, the investment share of state-owned units had dropped to 65 percent of the total from 95 percent in 1978. Of this, the financial investment weighting (which forms a part of the state capital construction fund) dropped from 80 percent to 11 percent. Investment raised by local governments, departments, and enterprises accounted for 41 percent of the total. Bank loans and foreign investment, which account for 22 percent and 11 percent respectively, have become a major source of funds for the reproduction of fixed assets and laid the foundation for the establishment of a new investment and financing structure. Second, a management model where multiple investment entities coexist and where each level exercises decisionmaking power has taken shape. The situation of the central government being the sole investment entity has been completely smashed. Local governments and departments, particularly state-owned enterprises and nonstate collective enterprises, township enterprises, foreign-funded enterprises, enterprise groups, individuals within the country and foreign investors, have become important direct investment entities. This has promoted changes in the system by which projects are decided upon, examined, and approved, and this has prompted the central government to raise ceilings for projects submitted for examination and approval and to simply examination and approval procedures. However, reform in this respect is lagging behind the new development of multiple investment entities. Third, the compensated use of state investment, the investment responsibility system, and the method of treating government investment as a commercial undertaking have been experimented with. In a sense, the "replacement of financial appropriations by loans," the investment responsibility system introduced in the early stages of reform, and the project proprietor responsibility system introduced in 1992, are all to solve the problem under the traditional structure where everyone ate from the "big pot" of government investment and for improving returns on government investment. In terms of actual results, it is not entirely due to the drawbacks of these reform measures that the original intentions of these reforms have not been fully realized. Rather, it is mainly because the investment responsibility system lacks the necessary foundation and exists in name only. This is one of the greatest weaknesses of reform of the investment structure over the past 14 years. Fourth, in respect of project decisions and consultations, feasibility studies, design, construction, and material supplies management, a series of reform measures with the market competition mechanism at the core have been introduced to reform the assessment, bidding, and contracting of projects and to establish a raw materials market. Reforms in these areas have probably been the boldest and most effective in the reform of the traditional investment structure. Of course, because the market system is still not fully developed on the whole and enterprises have not completely cut off their ties of administrative subordination, it is still very difficult to bring market mechanisms into play in place of construction investment. Fifth, attempts have been made to improve macroregulation and control of investment by economic means and indirect management. The two major pillars of the traditional investment structure, namely the mandatory investment planning system and the administrative system for the examination and approval of projects, have come under fierce attack during 14 years of reform. Some reforms have been introduced, whether actively or passively, consciously or unconsciously. These reforms, including the narrowing of the scope of mandatory planning, the introduction of guidance planning, the implementation of state industrial policy, the levying of energy and transport fund contributions and construction tax (later replaced by investment orientation tax), and the application of differential interest rates, "new charges for electricity generated by new plants," and other economic levers to regulate the flow of investment, have produced some concrete results. However, in spite of these efforts, the two major pillars of the traditional investment structure still have not been fundamentally removed and a new system of macroregulation and control has yet to take shape. This is another great weakness in the reform of the investment structure over the past 14 years. Looking back at the reform of the investment structure in the past 14 years, our first conclusion is: As far as the total abolition of the traditional model of investment structure and the eventual establishment of a new investment structure under the conditions of a market economy are concerned, the reforms carried out in these 14 years have, in the process by which the old system is being destroyed and the new system is being established, played a role in exploration, experimentation, and laying down a base. Most of the reform measures have actively promoted the solution of existing problems and the development of the productive forces. On the whole, the reform of the investment structure in the past 14 years should be affirmed and taken as a point of departure for further studies on ways to deepen reform of the investment structure. Looking back at the reform of the investment structure over the past 14 years, our second conclusion is: Due to the difficulty and complexity of the cause of reform, reform of the investment structure is bound to experience mistakes either in the planning of the program or in its implementation, thereby affecting the progress and effectiveness of reform. If we further assess the actual results of reform against the principles of a market economy, we can clearly see that the existing investment structure still bears the deep imprint of the traditional investment structure and has many drawbacks. In particular, a number of deep-level contradictions have yet to be resolved. We will try to analyze these contradictions from the following six angles: 1) Investment entities: Although multiple investment entities have been developed, in essence, enterprises have not totally renounced their role as appendages of government departments. In particular, the majority of state-owned enterprises still lack the ability to accumulate their own capital. They are still subject to administrative control and have not become truly independent investment entities. 2) Investment decisionmaking: The system of centralized decisionmaking by the central government, which has "cage-like" indices and unified policies as its distinctive features, is still used in forming macroeconomic investment policies. For most projects, there is a basic division of decisionmaking power between the central and local authorities and among departments. The simplification of examination and approval procedures has not brought about a complete change in the system of examination and approval by administrative departments. 3) Investment channels: Although there are now multiple channels for investment and fund-raising, the utilization of funds is still subject to direct government intervention and control to varying degrees. What we have is a disguised form of administrative allocation. It goes without saying that fiscal funds are thus allocated. However, domestic bank loans and funds raised through securities issues and foreign loans are either allocated in blocks or handed down to specific projects by the government. Investments by units with their own funds are also arranged in blocks in accordance with aggregate targets. 4) Investment operations: Because there has been no change in the administrative jurisdictional structure which poses barriers between ministries and regions, the formation and development of a long-term funds market has been sluggish and investment liquidity continues to be poor. The movement of funds between different industries and different regions is particularly difficult. With the deployment of resources still largely dependent on administrative orders and planning, the positive role of the market has still not been fully brought into play. 5) Investment management: Because the reform of the investment planning structure began quite late and the reforms have been quite passive, the functions, management means, and objectives of various management departments concerned with investment are still unclear. Administrative means still play the dominant role in investment management, and a new system of macroregulation and control has yet to take shape. 6) Investment responsibility: A strict system of responsibility and legal constraints have not been instituted for the whole process from investment decisionmaking to project implementation. Effective measures have yet to be developed as regards the bearer, scope and bearing of responsibility, and the problem of state-owned units all eating from "the same big pot" in investment still prevails to varying degrees. Why is it that the distinctive features of the traditional investment structure not only have not been thoroughly removed from the existing investment structure but have produced negative effects in obstructing reform and hindering development to a greater or lesser extent? This is definitely not a natural outcome of reform itself. Rather, it shows that in reform we cannot expect to "get twice the result with half the effort." As the saying goes, "a boat sailing against the current must forge ahead or it will be driven back." Only by unswervingly adhering to a clear direction of reform and by speeding up and deepening the reform can we fundamentally eliminate the drawbacks of the traditional investment structure. This is the only way for China's investment structure to ultimately realize the transition from a planned economy to a market economy. II. In Deepening the Reform It Is Necessary To Update and Change Several Concepts The scale of investment in China has seen more rapid growth since 1992. This rapid growth has continued in 1993, and is widely regarded as the main reason for the tense financial situation as a whole, particularly the money supply, and is deemed to be a possible cause of high inflation. Meanwhile, as localities and enterprises continue their fervent call to quicken development, the existing investment structure is seen as an obvious stumbling block in more ways than one. Under this historical backdrop, the question of investment and investment structure has once again become a subject of great concern to state leaders and basic-level enterprises alike. They have come to the conclusion that while speeding up the transformation of government functions, it is necessary to further reform the planning, financial, and monetary systems, with the focus on the investment structure. Over the past year, all kinds of proposals and suggestions have been put forward for the reform of the investment structure, but the views remain divided. An important reason for this is that people still differ in their concept and understanding of major issues in the investment realm. Although we are all talking about reform, we are widely divergent, even going in opposite directions on the goals, targets, and measures of reform. In view of this situation, we believe that when studying and putting forward proposals for deepening the reform of the investment structure, it is necessary to update and change from the high plane of theory some of the customary formulations and concepts originated from the traditional planned economy and understand afresh several major investment issues in accordance with market economy theory. 1. The question of controlling the scale of investment In a modern market economy, macroregulation and control by the government has four target areas, namely, the economic growth rate, the employment rate, the inflation rate, and the international balance of payments. The scale of investment is an important economic variable. Changes in the scale of investment are mainly due to the market situation and the government's economic policies and are not the direct targets of government regulation and control. In other words, under a market economy, enterprises are the principal investment entities and investment activities are enterprise activities. The government cannot, and indeed should not, directly determine and control the overall scale of investment. Thus, in deepening reform of the investment structure, the state should, in a clear-cut way, change the method of directly controlling the scale of investment and cease the handing down of so-called "cages" or annual plans on the scale of investment. Such plans (particularly medium and long-term plans) may still be drawn up, but these should only be used by the state as a base for the formulation of macroeconomic policies and may be published as economic forecasts. Some comrades have suggested replacing regulation and control over the annual scale of investment by regulation and control of the overall scale of investment for projects under construction. In essence, this is still a concept of direct regulation and control under a planned economy. It not only goes against the principles of a market economy but is difficult to implement and is not feasible. However, the overall scale of investment for projects under construction is still of significance as a leading economic index unique to China. Will there be a massive expansion of investment, as many fear, if the state changes its direct mandatory controls on the scale of investment? The conclusion we have drawn after summing up the experience of market economies is quite the contrary. Due to government intervention and influence in running the economy through the use of macroeconomic policies (including fiscal policies and tax policies, interest rates and exchange rates), investors are very sensitive to market signals and government policies. The fact that they are subject to strict constraints of their investment responsibility also contributes to the fundamental elimination of the causes of investment expansion. Some comrades insist that there should be direct controls on the scale of investment on the grounds that market economy mechanisms and enterprise constraints have not yet been developed. As soon as investment shows excessive growth, they advocate a return to the old practice, that is, suppression of the scale of investment, consolidation of existing projects, control of newly launched projects, and strict mandatory planning. This arbitrarily cuts off the natural course of the transition from a planned economy to a market economy, objectively prevents enterprises from truly becoming investment entities, and fetters the development of the productive forces. Actually, experience over the past 40 years and more has demonstrated time and again that direct government control of the scale of investment has never been truly successful in keeping the scale of investment under control. Rather, we have gone through a course of suppression--expansion-- further suppression--further expansion. We can no longer follow this course which simply has no future. 2. The question of the regulation and control of the investment structure The investment structure includes the investment ratio between different industries and the investment ratio between different regions. In order to ensure the optimum deployment of resources between different industries and regions in accordance with the principles of a market economy, the flow of investment should be toward industries and regions with the best rate of return, and this should mainly be achieved through regulation by market mechanisms. In the past we have always been advocates of the regulation and control of the investment structure through the formulation of state industrial policies. However, it is not in accord with the principles of a market economy to treat industrial policies as mandatory policies. Industrial policies themselves are for guidance only and should mainly be implemented through various economic and technical policies, but state laws formulated in accordance with state industrial policies for specific industries and products are mandatory. The fixed assets investment orientation regulatory tax introduced in 1991 seems to be an economic means for indirect regulation and control, but in fact it is not completely cut off from the framework of an administrative means which embraces all trades and professions and entails direct intervention. This, complicated by how the tax revenue is distributed between the central and local governments and the overelaborate way of calculating how much tax should be levied, has made its actual implementation very difficult. This deserves attention. In future, the government should adopt necessary measures for the indirect control of the investment structure. The following are some of the major measures we should adopt: First, we should rationally determine the ratio between government investment and non-government investment in order to ensure that the government will have sufficient funds for public utilities and infrastructure construction. Second, we should correctly fix charges for infrastructural services in order to ensure that their revenues can at least cover operational costs. Third, we should adopt a policy of financial equilibrium and support the underdeveloped regions in their development of public utilities and infrastructure. In this connection, speeding up the pace of price reform and seeing to it that market mechanisms play their role in providing correct guidance is one of the key steps. Of course, the principles of a market economy do not completely reject government involvement in the structural readjustment of certain industries in the non-government sector through macroeconomic policies (such as supporting priority industries, supporting key projects, and promoting an export- oriented economy). However, such support does not normally take the form of direct investment. Rather, it is given through indirect means, such as preferential policies, discounts on exchange, or subsidized investment. 3. The question of preventing duplicate construction The concept of duplicate construction is entirely a concept of the traditional planned economy. It means engaging in the construction of similar projects in addition to those already provided for in the state plan. They are generally regarded as superfluous and unnecessary. According to theories of the planned economy, we should expand the capacity of production in proportion to need and launch projects within the limits of funds and resources available. Thus, it is necessary to prevent "duplicate construction." Under the principles of a market economy, however, the prevention of duplicate construction is not tenable whether in theory or in practice. The basic laws of the market economy are: the law of value, the law of competition, and the law of supply and demand. Without some "duplication" in construction, supply and demand will be perfectly balanced (which is unlikely in real life in any case), and there will not be any competition. What this means is that market mechanisms will have no place in the optimum deployment of resources. More importantly, without competition and the elimination of the inferior through competition, it is impossible to increase efficiency and promote technological progress, and economic and social development as a whole will lose vigor and vitality. This was the situation which prevailed in many of our industrial enterprises prior to reform. Hence, the concept of duplicate construction in the traditional sense can no longer be adhered to. If we find it necessary to avoid excessive competition or low-quality construction which wastes resources (duplicate construction in a given sense) during a period of transition when a mechanism of microeconomic constraints has yet to be developed, then rather than devising a system for the prevention of duplicate construction, we should make the best of the situation and create a mechanism and environment that can truly encourage and meet the needs of moderate competition between investors. Only by truly unfolding market competition and encouraging the movement of funds will it be possible to truly eliminate low-quality, low-return, and unreasonable duplicate construction. If we continue to resort to methods of planning, we will only encourage the practice of "vying for more investment and more new construction projects" and will have no way of prohibiting duplicate construction. This has been the situation in China over the past decades. 4. The question of the shortage of funds for key construction projects of the state In market economies, the scope of government investment is usually clearly defined and mainly covers those sectors that are monopolistic and are not predominantly profit-oriented, such as public utilities and infrastructure. In the past, government investment in China covered all areas. After reform, the scope of government investment has been somewhat reduced and no longer covers all trades and professions, but it still covers a wide scope. Seen in terms of the key construction projects approved by the state each year and in terms of construction projects with state investment in different industries, the number is not very high, but the number of industries covered is very impressive. Such a state of affairs is not in accord with the operational laws of a market economy. One of the problems that can be directly attributed to this is the lack of congruence between the capacity of the government to invest and its scope of investment, and between its financial power and its administrative power. This is also the problem of the capital shortage for key state projects that we have been talking about all these years. One line of thought for the solution of this problem is the planned economy approach. What this means is that we should concentrate financial resources by all and every means, thereby increasing the amount of funds directly controlled by and at the disposal of the government. In other words, the government should have greater financial power. According to the principles of a market economy, however, we should focus our efforts on reducing administrative interference and thoroughly put an end to the situation where government intervention in investment is both excessive and inefficient. In respect of those projects which definitely need government investment, apart from some public utility investment which will continue to need funds allocated by financial administration, other major social infrastructure projects should increasingly rely on the absorption and mobilization of social capital (such as public bidding and the issuance of bonds and shares). We should no longer follow the beaten track of centralized funding and direct allocation. There are many other questions in the sphere of investment, such as how to do things in strict accordance with construction programs and overcome over-investment. If we look at enterprises as genuine investment entities in accordance with the concept of the market economy, we will be able to gain a new understanding of and give new meaning to these questions. Only when we have come to a consensus on these major theoretical and practical issues will there be a solid foundation for the design and implementation of investment structure reform. III. The Target Model and Overall Framework for Reform of the Investment Structure in China If we briefly sum up the traditional model of investment structure as a direct management model based on mandatory investment plans and administrative examination and approval of projects, with government investment playing the dominant role, then the target model for an investment structure that meets the needs of the socialist market economy may be summed up as a capital factor distribution mechanism and management system based on market-regulated investment activities and decisions made at the investors' own risk, with enterprise investment playing the dominant role and the government exercising indirect regulation and control. The above-mentioned target model for reform of the investment structure may be described as the realization of the following six fundamental changes: 1) Investment entities will change from entities with government investment or government activities playing the dominant role into entities with enterprise investment and enterprise activities playing the dominant role. The scope and ways of government investment will also be more clearly defined. 2) The market rather than the government will decide how investment, as long-term capital, is to deployed. The law of value and the law of average rate of profits will play a fundamental and principal regulatory role in the deployment of resources, while the government will only play a supplementary role. 3) The microeconomic bases of investment activities will change from enterprises which are no more than government appendages in terms of their administrative jurisdiction and which do not have complete investment decisionmaking power and responsibility constraints, into true economic entities with independent economic interests and clearly defined property relations. These entities will work under tough responsibility constraints and will make their own policy decisions, assume responsibility for their own profits and losses, manage their own affairs, and bear their own investment risks and responsibilities. 4) The mechanism for the deployment of various capital factors will change from one which relies on planned distribution into one which works on fair competition. The pricing of capital factors, such as interest rates, wages, rents, and the prices of investment goods, will be determined by the market and will be able to correctly reflect the scarcity of resources and the relationship between supply and demand. Capital factors will be free to circulate and will be naturally pooled and centralized in projects with high returns through fair competition. 5) The investment financing mechanism of enterprises and the government will change from one which works on allocation in accordance with planned targets into one which favors the flexible and diversified use of both direct and indirect investment, separates policy financing organs from commercial banks, and manages government investment as an entrepreneurial undertaking. 6) The means with which the government regulates investment activities will change from administrative orders by governments at various levels into the stimulation and constraint of the interests of investment entities. Through its financial policies, monetary policies, and various other economic levers, the government will make targeted corrections of market signals, thereby indirectly influencing (raising or lowering) the anticipated rate of return on investments and realizing the fixed macroeconomic goals of the government, while guiding enterprises to pursue their own economic interests in their investments. The most essential characteristic of the target model for reform of the investment structure is as follows: Enterprises (including state-owned enterprises and other types of enterprises) have become the principal investment entities. They have a perfect investment and financing mechanism, have full power to make autonomous decisions on projects, regulate the movement of investment in accordance with the principle of maximum profits and market laws, and independently bear investment risks and responsibilities. The government's function in investment management has completely changed into one of macroeconomic management, indirect regulation and control, and the provision of policy guidance, information, and services. The period between 1993 and 1995 will be a period for the implementation of the near-term program for deepening reform of the investment structure, while the "Ninth Five-Year Plan" period could be a period for the implementation of a long-term program. The overall framework for a long-term program could be based on the following four tasks: 1) Defining property relations and restoring enterprises as investment entities. This mainly refers to the introduction of the shareholding system to state-owned enterprises, the establishment of state-holding limited liability companies and limited joint-stock companies with large enterprise groups as the main form, and the separation of the economic management functions of the government and the ownership management functions of state-owned enterprises. 2) Improving management and operating systems for government investment. This mainly involves the division of capital construction funds into social public investment and industrial development investment. Social public investment shall be managed by the respective departments in accordance with state plans, while industrial development investment shall be managed by government investment companies. At the same time, a system of indirect investment management by the government based on a "state investment credit fund" and a "state long-term investment bank" shall also be established. 3) Making clear the social division of labor between different categories of investment entities. This mainly involves efforts to clarify the scope of government investment and divide investment between the central government and local governments in accordance with the principle of regional division of labor. There is no need to delimit the scope of private investment in various types of enterprises and by domestic and foreign investors. 4) Establishing an indirect macro-regulatory and control system for investment. This is mainly about making full use of investment policies, investment information, economic levers, legal means, and necessary administrative intervention in the indirect guidance and regulation of the activities of investment entities. IV. Proposal on Near-term Measures for Deepening Reform of the Investment Structure Since the reform measures put forward in the target model and the overall framework of the long-term program for the reform of the investment structure will take time to gradually be put into implementation, the pressing nature of the reform makes it imperative for us to seize the following breakthrough points in taking substantial steps forward in deepening reform of the investment structure. In accordance with the principle of dovetailing with the target model and helping solve imminent problems in real life, we should concentrate on the following three areas in our immediate reforms. 1. Standardize and strengthen the constraints mechanism on state-owned investment entities State-owned investment entities comprise three major types of investment entities, namely, the central government, local governments, and state-owned enterprises. Restricted by various conditions at present, apart from extremely rare cases like the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation, very few state-owned enterprises can really be called independent investment entities. However, as far as the orientation of reform goes, state-owned enterprises will definitely become investment entities with a decisive role to play in the development of the national economy. The standardization of of investment entities' activities mainly involves two aspects, namely self-constraint mechanisms within investment entities and mechanisms for the state and society to guide and restrain the activities of investment entities. 1) Promote and improve the system of responsibility for construction project proprietors. In our present endeavor to invigorate large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, we must concentrate on resolving the problem of "the lack of clarity in three respects," that is, the lack of clarity in property rights relationships, the lack of clarity between ownership and operating rights, and the lack of clarity between government and enterprise functions. The fundamental way to resolve this problem lies in the enterprises order at their root, that is, carrying out reform of the decision making, financing, and construction of projects. The establishment of the system of responsibility for construction project proprietors is an important measure in this reform, and efforts must be made to speed up this stage of reform. Seen from the trial implementation of this system on construction projects over the past year or so, we can see that standardizing the process whereby proprietors are generated, ensuring the full implementation of the powers of proprietors, establishing a mechanism of responsibility constraints and a mechanism of interest stimulation for proprietors, as well as improving relevant policies, laws and regulations and strengthening the service functions of the government, are key links in deepening this reform and producing actual results. 2) Reorganizing state-owned enterprises and clearly defining property rights relationships. Investment and financing rights are rights enjoyed by the ownership principals in property rights relationships. In order to turn state-owned enterprises into true investment entities, it is necessary to grant them investment and financing rights. To this end, it is necessary first of all to clarify who has proprietary rights over the state-owned assets of enterprises. China has a vast number of state-owned enterprises, and there is a vast difference between the scale of enterprises and the management level and quality of their leaders. If we stipulate in general terms that factory directors or managers are representatives of the owners of state-owned assets of enterprises and give them full power of investment and financing, the resultant over-decentralization of investment and financing power and a host of poor policy decisions could inflict heavy losses on state-owned assets. A desirable approach is to reorganize state-owned enterprises by organizing (or incorporating) most of state-owned enterprises making up the "national team" into large or giant enterprise groups. In other words, we should amalgamate or merge state-owned enterprises around large or medium-sized enterprises with outstanding performance on the basis of voluntary collaboration. Medium-sized or small manufacturing enterprises with antiquated equipment and poor performance which no enterprise group wants may be declared bankrupt or sold to members of the public so that the state can redeem their assets. State-owned public utilities in localities may continue to be run by local governments. 3) Establishing a personal responsibility system for investment. There should be clearly defined property rights relationships in all enterprise groups, with the board of directors or management committee of each group exercising the powers and functions of the ownership entity on behalf of the state. Their responsible persons and principal members should be selected and appointed by the state- owned asset management department from among entrepreneurs. Enterprise groups are primary-level corporate bodies. They are vested with investment and financing power, assume responsibility for profits and losses in their operations, and hand over a given proportion of the profits to state-owned asset management departments. Basic-level enterprises within the group are secondary-level corporate bodies. They only have operating power and do not have ownership rights or investment power. They hand over all their profits to their enterprise group, which bears responsibility for their profits and losses. Their responsible persons only assume personal responsibility for operational results. Thus, the principals of these investment entities are the board of directors or management committees. Constraints on their investment activities are based on contracts that combine rights, responsibilities, and interests concluded on the basis of the benefits principle. Although the state does not interfere in their investment orientation, they must realize the annual targets for profit and assets appreciation stipulated in the contracts signed at the time of their appointment by the state. The contracts should also make clear their personal income, and promotion will be pegged to the overall performance of their enterprise group. In order to ensure the implementation of this system of personal responsibility for investment, it is necessary to strengthen the system of constraints and supervision on government investment managers by making public servants stake their "political life" on their investment decisions and management results. 4) Establishing an external mechanism of constraints for state- owned asset investment entities. Although results generated by different orientations of investment may assume different forms, whichever way investment goes people expect maximum results for the money they put in. Only in this way can we make our limited state-owned asset investment yield maximum results and fundamentally change the problem of serious wastage in state-owned asset investment. Thus, all talk about restraining the investment activities of state-owned asset investment entities centers around returns. In other words, constraints must have the improvement of investment returns as their major objective and are intended to make state-owned asset investment yield satisfactory results. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to continuously strengthen the system of scientific decisionmaking for investment projects, improve the system of investment auditing and supervision, promote the system of post-construction appraisal, and put the system of investment information and engineering consultation on a sound footing. In particular, we must speed up legislation in the realm of investment to bring investment activities into an orbit whereby investment entities' actions are standardized by law. 2. Improve and perfect the investment and financing systems of the government and enterprises Under the market economy, government investment and enterprise investment differ greatly in target, scope, and form. This makes it necessary to have separate investment and financing systems for the government and for enterprises. 1) Enlarge the investment and financing mechanism in the form of government shareholding. In the international arena, participation in projects by way of share investment and financing is a basic form of government investment and financing. At present, expanding key construction funds by gradually increasing the shareholding weighting in total investment, practicing diverse share investment and financing methods, and issuing shares to obtain new investment has become an objective inevitability. 2) Put existing state-owned asset investment and financing mechanisms on a sound footing. The irrational deployment of the huge amount of existing assets in China often imposes serious restrictions on the optimum organization of limited new investment. China has state-owned assets worth nearly 2,000 billion yuan. Of these, about one-third either lie idle or operate inefficiently. The irrational deployment of existing assets not only results in the waste of a large amount of new investment, but greatly restricts the scale of new investment in key construction projects. Thus, it is necessary to do away with "insulation" between existing assets and new investment and to turn surplus assets into a new flow of investment which covers key construction. At the present stage, the conversion of existing assets into new investment may be realized through the marketization of existing assets. 3) Strengthen the self-accumulation mechanism of enterprises. In the development of enterprises, the forms and channels of investment and financing are multifaceted. Seen in terms of raising funds internally and drawing funds in from outside, there are two major forms of investment and financing by enterprises, namely, their own capital and borrowed investment. The experience of developed countries clearly tells us that in investment and financing, enterprises should focus on the internal accumulation and expansion of funds rather than drawing funds from outside. In raising of industrial capital, enterprises in developed countries obtain most of their funds, or at least half, through internal fund raising. The investment and financing structure of Chinese enterprises is extremely irrational. This is mainly manifested in imbalances in the asset and liability structure of enterprises. When an enterprise does not even have 20 percent of the funds needed and uses loans to cover the other 80 percent of the funds necessary to expand production, they will naturally have difficulty expanding their scale of investment and financing. In order to increase the ability of enterprises to build up their own accumulation and develop, it is necessary to strengthen the self- accumulation mechanisms of enterprises. On the one hand, it is necessary to strengthen the replacement investment mechanism of enterprises on the basis of accelerated depreciation. On the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen the mechanism whereby retained profits are turned into additional investment for expanding production. 4) Establish a securities investment and financing mechanism for enterprises. As the present state of affairs in Chinese enterprises shows, there are imbalances in the raising and utilization of construction funds: too much liability financing and too little investment using their own capital, too much short-term financing and too little long-term financing. A more salient problem is that there is too much indirect financing and too little direct financing. There are currently many barriers preventing enterprises from entering the securities market. It is medium-sized and small enterprises rather than large enterprises that have been given permission to raise funds through the issuance of bonds and shares. Today, bonds and shares account for less than 10 percent of enterprises' construction funds. Thus, it is necessary to gradually open more channels of securities investment and financing for enterprises and enlarge the scale of direct financing. This will also be of great help to strengthening the self-restraining mechanism of enterprises. 3. Establish and improve the macroregulatory and control system for government investment First of all, we must make clear the aim, object, means and bases of the macroregulation and control of investment: 1) The aim of macroregulation and control of investment is to sustain rapid and healthy development under existing low levels of inflation. The indirect regulation and control of the overall scale and structure of investment serves this objective. In other words, the aim of regulation and control is to arouse the enthusiasm of all quarters for investment and promote economic development, not to inhibit enthusiasm for investment. 2) The object of the macroregulation and control of investment is to promptly regulate and control the parameters of the investment market and indirectly influence the investment activities of enterprises. It does not seek to directly control the activities of investors or to exercise decisionmaking power on enterprise investment entities. 3) Means of macroregulation and control of investment are indirect. This mainly relies on economic means, supplemented by necessary administrative intervention. It is of a guiding rather than a mandatory nature, and is service rather than command based. 4) The bases of the macroregulation and control of investment are threefold: First, the establishment of a microeconomic investment operational mechanism (mainly for enterprises), especially the establishment of a mechanism of self-constraint; second, the perfection of market development; and third, the support of other institutional reforms, especially reform of the financial, monetary, and pricing systems. These are the prerequisites for the full implementation of various measures for the macroregulation and control of investment. The establishment of an indirect macroregulatory and control system for investment involves a wide range of tasks. In the near- term, we may focus on the following three areas in our reform endeavors: 1) Fully activate and strengthen the financial means of regulation and control. The financial means here refer to funds (money) financing centering around bank credit. The principal function of the financial regulatory and control mechanism is to regulate and control total demand through the regulation of the money supply. The common means include statutory reserve funds, open market operations, and rediscount and relending rates. At present, we should attach importance to the regulatory and control function of the interest rate lever. The reason is that in investment, the anticipated rate of return determines whether or not an enterprise will invest, and the level of the anticipated rate of return has a close bearing on the level of interest rates and taxation. Thus, as a market parameter or signal, it is obvious what effects interest rates will have on investment. However, from the way the government's regulatory means and indirect regulatory and control mechanisms exercise regulation and control, we can see that the government is obviously trying to affect interest rates by using its monetary policy to regulate the money supply in the whole society, and through this to indirectly regulate and control investment. Hence, it is necessary to gradually delegate the power of interest rate adjustment to the lower levels and rationally structure deposit and lending rates so that the interest rate lever can regulate investment activities in a flexible and positive way. 2) Accelerate the establishment of a system of state investment credit funds and organize a long-term state investment bank. This state investment credit fund is a long-term credit fund pooled by the central government in the form of state credits from the public. It offers compensatory payments in accordance with the principle of exchange at equal value and is spent on fixed asset investments in line with the policy objectives of the state. Our aim in establishing an international credit fund and organizing a long-term state investment bank lies in searching for and creating a flexible and effective macroregulatory and control tool that not only meets the needs of investment in a market economy but can effectively guide the flow of non-governmental investment. 3) Replace the existing system of administrative examination and approval with a system of project registration. We should, in accordance with the principles of a socialist market economy, reform the system whereby construction projects are decided. Specifically, we should make clear the "three separations." First, we should separate the making of decisions on launching of projects from administrative management. How much money should go into a project, where the investment should go, when to invest, the form of investment, investment returns, and so forth are all matters that must be taken into consideration in making decisions on projects. In these matters, the decision should be made by the investors themselves, and government approval should not be required. The effects of projects on town planning, land use, the environment, employment, safety, and other points of public and state interest come under the jurisdiction of administrative management and must be examined and approved by government departments concerned in accordance with the law. Second, we should separate the investment function of the government from the management function of the government in investment. In the past, we were often told that government- invested projects must be examined and approved by the government. This measure was ambiguous and failed to separate the two functions. It is also not conducive to making the government concentrate its energy on strengthening its investment management (particularly macroregulation and control) function. Thus, the investment function of the government should be handed down to enterprises that handle government investment and project decisionmaking should be left to these enterprises. The government may set production and profit targets and leave construction and operations to the contracted enterprises. As regards the small number of government-invested projects with a vital bearing on national or regional development, a system of review and decisionmaking by local councils (people's congresses) may be practiced, as is done in foreign countries. Third, we should separate the system of project decisionmaking from the system of project registration. Following the establishment of a system where construction projects are decided upon by investors themselves, it is necessary to establish a strict system of project registration. This will serve as a crucial foundation for efforts to ensure the accuracy of the state's macroeconomic investment policies and the effectiveness of its macroregulation and control.
