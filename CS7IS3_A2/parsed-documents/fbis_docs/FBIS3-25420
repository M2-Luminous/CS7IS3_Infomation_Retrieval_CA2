President de Klerk was speaking at a press conference in Cape Town. [Begin recording] [De Klerk] I basically say that there is time left, and, as I heard him when he was quoted directly in his own voice, it was not all that negative. I really hope that all the parties, who have not joined in the election as yet, will very seriously consider their position, make a proper study, and not take hasty decisions. I think that the initial negative reaction might still change to a more positive one. I have spoken to him last night. It is not impossible that at the moment members of my party and of the government are in discussion with members of his party and of his government. We have been trying to put it together. It might be taking place right at this moment. I haven't been informed. I have been too busy thus far. [Unidentified correspondent] Is this your final offer? [De Klerk] It is not a question of a final offer. This is a substantial improvement from our own vantage point and from the vantage point of the Freedom Alliance, as it was. It addresses the heart and the core, maybe not exactly as they would like....[pauses] They would have liked it to be addressed, but it addresses the heart and core of what has been on the table and on the agenda. I think it offers substantive reassurance on issues of fundamental importance to them and to us as federalists, and I think the new principle that the powers will not be diminished, that is what it says in essence, in a final constitution is a very important reassurance that central government will not be in a position, and a new central parliament will not be in a position, to undermine the fundamental federalist principles already built into this constitution. I think it offers a good basis, a good platform from which to enter into a final constitution-writing process, and I think the right of the provinces, without prescription, to determine the composition of their own executors and legislators, is also tremendously important. I really think that out of hand rejection of this is not justifiable and that they should look very, very carefully at it. This is a reasonable improvement which forms, in another sense of the word, a basis which nobody can any longer say that I am justified to stand aside and to disrupt what the overwhelming majority of all South Africans want--and that is an election on 27 April.
