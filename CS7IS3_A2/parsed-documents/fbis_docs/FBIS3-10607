The president sends his regards because he cannot be with you this morning. Therefore, I will answer your questions during the president's weekly news conference. This morning we want to inform all of the media in attendance that at the beginning of this news conference we will discuss an issue of utmost importance. It is the human rights issue. Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria and presidential Human Rights Commissioner Benjamin Cestoni are here with us this morning. Cestoni recently returned from the 50th Annual Conference on Human Rights at Geneva. Previously, the foreign minister himself had been in Geneva. We want to devote the first part of this morning's news conference to this issue -- an issue we consider having the utmost importance. We want to report to you that the government is very satisfied that in Geneva, Switzerland, a conference took place in which our country was included on the agenda -- the UN agenda on human rights policy as discussed by the Human Rights Commission that meets annually in Geneva. The conference was held within this framework. The Salvadoran case was analyzed from the different points of view. Diverse individuals who have dealt with the human rights issue in our country took part in the conference -- namely, the Human Rights Prosecutor's Office; Onusal's [UN Observers for El Salvador] Human Rights Division, which also travelled to Geneva; and, of course, the Salvadoran Government through its permanent mission in Geneva. In addition, high-level government officials also travelled to Geneva, as I have already mentioned. The foreign minister and the presidential commissioner on human rights also discussed the issue and presented arguments we believe should be publicized in terms of El Salvador's human rights policy. We were able to establish that marked progress has been made here in respecting human rights; this is evident. Based on this, we have been working on a consistent, sustained policy to improve and strengthen human rights. Proof of this has been the diverse forums in which this issue has been discussed. During the past year, numerous contributions have been made in this area. Other human rights representatives who, on one occasion or another, have visited the nation also have witnessed this. In turn, we were able to make a presentation that we considered fundamental. This contributed to the fact that at the conclusion of the conference, the commission decided that the Salvadoran case should be included in an agenda different from the one in which it had been included up until this point. We contended that the Salvadoran case should be viewed from various perspectives. We want to be honest, and we want to be realistic. Taking into account the progress we have made, El Salvador should be encouraged in its human rights policy and not be subjected to disciplinary action or punishment. Sometimes it seems that evaluations by international organizations on a given country's human rights situation focus on what that country should do. We think we have done a lot. Indeed, we have done a lot, and you are witnesses to the fact that here we have not only one but a number of mechanisms that have contributed to our human rights policy. They have all been contributing. We have a Human Rights Division, which is part of a human rights verification and promotion mechanism; we have a Human Rights Ombudsman's Office, which also verifies and promotes human rights; and we also have a presidential commissioner for human rights as part of a policy that we consistently carry out. Human rights are also handled by way of an independent expert. As mentioned on previous occasions, the expert has also been involved in human rights within the country. We can possibly say that few countries have as many mechanisms dealing with the verification and promotion of human rights as El Salvador. Nevertheless, I think there comes a time when a country shows proof and must say: We have progressed so much that we think the policy should be handled differently, especially at the level of international organizations. This is exactly what we did in Geneva. We said that the Salvadoran case should be seen from a different viewpoint or perspective, and that our progress has been so significant and evident that we have sufficient reasons and arguments to support our request. This is what the international community heard. Although the role of the expert continues to exist -- and we have stated that there is reason for this -- his role, his function, is totally different from the one he had in the previous period. This is stated in the resolution I am going to quickly read. In (?Point 2), it states: The commission decides to extend for one year the mandate of the independent expert for the purpose of facilitating the advisory services for El Salvador and of informing, in close cooperation with the Human Rights Division in El Salvador and the Salvadoran Government, the Human Rights Commission in its (?21st) period of sessions -- in other words, next year -- regarding the evolution of human rights in El Salvador as part of the Advisory Service on the Topic of Human Rights. This is the name of the program we now have. This is the government's achievement we mentioned earlier. We are no longer under a process of observation concerning violations of human rights. Instead, we have come under a program which, as you heard, gives advice on human rights. This is the context within which the Salvadoran case has been seen by the authorities of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, and this is the treatment the country is now being given. There has been a favorable response. We see that the objective that took us to Geneva has been achieved. We went to explain our reasons for the Salvadoran's being viewed from another perspective and to say that we were willing to work in the area of human rights within the framework of strengthening and promoting those rights in El Salvador. Messrs. members of the press, El Salvador receives this resolution as encouragement, as a vote of confidence for the work we have carried out. We think it is consistent with the reality of the country's situation. This was my introduction in which I wanted to tell you how the topic was viewed and addressed. If you have any questions for me, the foreign minister, or the presidential commissioner for human rights, I hope you will ask them within the context of this topic I am discussing. Thank you. After we address this topic, they will leave and I will stay here to answer questions on other topics you regularly ask me about. [Moderator] Mr. Mario Jovel from the "Up to Date" newscast. [Jovel] Good morning, Mr. Minister. I would like to know the difference between the function or role that the special rapporteur on human rights had before and the one he has now. If the international community's eyes are no longer on the country, might not this lead to the reemergence of lack of respect for basic rights? [Santamaria] I would like the presidential commissioner, who arrived last night, to explain the context of the resolution. [Cestoni] Thank you, Mr. Minister. Look, the difference is substantial in terms of procedure. First of all, as the minister read in the resolution, the report must be drawn up in close cooperation with the Salvadoran Government. There must be coordination on the information when providing a report to the commission; this is done as part of the advisory process. Previously, the report by the independent expert was based -- and [words indistinct] could contain this -- especially on the analysis of human rights violations. The topic is very specific. Topic 12 is called Violation of Human Rights, and it is the topic under which El Salvador was observed for 11 years. Beginning now -- and this is related to your second question -- the advisory service is precisely designed to strengthen the mechanisms that the country or the international community have to protect human rights in any country. In other words, we think that via the institutional mechanisms we have as a government, we can handle the human rights situation under standards acceptable to the international community. I want to tell you and the other reporters here that there is no country in the world that is exempt from observation by the international community in Geneva. The topic covers the violation of human rights anywhere in the world. This means that these violations might exist anywhere in the world. Nevertheless, I want to be very specific in stating that in the case of El Salvador, the advisory service and our mechanisms have led to the establishment of a favorable climate for full respect for human rights. [Santamaria] I would also like to ask the foreign minister to comment on the last part of what you said [words indistinct] or not. [Salaverria] I do not think so, but before that I would like to tell you about the strategy we have followed with the human rights commissioner and the Presidency minister. The Foreign Ministry carried out a strategy to obtain the support of all the diplomatic representatives in El Salvador. We also wrote to all our ambassadors abroad. I directly addressed the foreign ministers, and the president also held discussions with all the presidents who could help us in Geneva. By way of this strategy, we presented ourselves in Geneva to explain that El Salvador did not deserve to be included in the group of human rights violators. What we wanted was to be removed from that group to alleviate doubts about whether El Salvador was a violator of human rights. I think we have been successful. Dr. Santamaria has already read the part of the resolution in which the commission decided what it will do with El Salvador. But, if you read the entire resolution, it commends El Salvador. All of the paragraphs commend the work that has been done and the progress we have attained. Now, to be practical and to answer your question, we have 150 human rights observers here. They are working very successfully and have helped El Salvador a great deal. The appointment of a human rights adviser by the UN secretary general represents additional assistance we are receiving. This is stated in Point 9, which says: We ask the UN secretary general to provide the Salvadoran Government with the counseling services requested through the Human Rights Center. In practical terms, there is absolutely no difference between having 150, 151, or 160 human rights advisers. The job they are carrying out is destined to help the Salvadoran Government improve its human rights situation. Ultimately, I think the process will help us have a better society that will serve as an example for the rest of the world. [Moderator] Thank you, Mr. Minister. Jorge Barahona of El Salvador's Teleprensa. [Barahona] Good day. Mr. Pedro Nikkem is the UN special human rights rapporteur. A few days ago, he prepared a report with which you disagreed. My question is this: Is this human rights adviser the same Mr. Nikkem who drafted the report critical of El Salvador? If so, did you request that Mr. Nikkem not be reappointed human rights rapporteur? Would not the appointment of this gentleman place the government in the same situation as before? [Santamaria] I am going to ask the peace commissioner to answer your question. [Cestoni] We did not disagree with the Nikkem report. What happened was perhaps a lack of communication on Nikkem's arrival in the country. I had the opportunity to speak to him on Friday. We both expressed satisfaction that mechanisms will be sought to enable him to carry out his mandate. I want to tell you that regardless of the name of the person appointed by the UN secretary general, whether Nikkem or someone else, we will assist him or her in carrying out his or her duty. I also want to tell you that a new position has been created by the United Nations. This position is the UN high commissioner for human rights. Dr. Jose Ayala Lasso is the first UN high commissioner for human rights. He was elected and appointed last November in New York. The Salvadoran delegation had the opportunity to get in touch with him to review the human rights mechanism carried out worldwide by the United Nations. I say this because the new procedures may permit us to have the same human rights rapporteur or replace that person or seek other mechanisms. The thing is that there is now within the United Nations a Human Rights Center, where there are many individuals capable of serving as a human rights adviser. This will be a decision of the UN secretary general. We hope that any person appointed fulfills the mandate of advising us. In this regard, we want to make it clear that all countries, especially El Salvador, will always require counseling in human rights affairs. [Barahona] If Mr. Nikkem is appointed once more, would you consider this as a defeat [words indistinct]? [Cestoni] No, no, quite the contrary. If a person is allowed to continue in one position... [pauses] I want to make it clear we have nothing personal against Dr. Pedro Nikkem. We clarified this with Mr. Nikkem last Friday. We appreciate him very much, because he has been close to the negotiation process since day one. We want to make it very clear that we have nothing personal against Nikkem. We simply want the mechanisms provided by the United Nations to be definite to enable us to prepare reports jointly. As you may recall, before now he was allowed to prepare reports without even coming here. The idea is now we will work closely together in drafting reports. At the end of the news conference, you will receive copies of the resolution, and this will give you a chance to read the part on cooperation with the Salvadoran Government. [Moderator] Thank you. Ismael Beltran of EL DIARIO DE HOY. [Beltran] Good morning, Mr. Foreign Minister. It is still unclear to me as to whether El Salvador has been exempted from the group of countries considered to be human rights violators -- a group in which we have been included in the past. Did you manage to get us out of this group or are we still there? [Salaverria] I can tell you that there are three categories. Point 12 includes countries considered to be human rights violators. El Salvador has never been included there. El Salvador was included in the so-called Point 3 group, which includes countries that were under observation and that may be placed on the list of human rights violators or under the category of those countries that must have a human rights adviser. Therefore, our achievement stems from the fact that we have moved onto the category of those countries that are assigned an adviser, which can only benefit El Salvador. It was a shame that Mr. Nikkem could not come to El Salvador, but this was mainly due to a misinterpretation -- to poor communication. Nikkem was appointed as the expert to advise El Salvador in July 1992, and his term expired in July 1993. In July, no one told us, however, that his appointment had been renewed. After his term expired, he wanted to come to El Salvador, and we asked on what grounds he was going to visit our country because we had never received notice that his appointment had been renewed. It was not that we opposed his visit, but we wanted to know the reason for it. Later, we were given the news that his appointment had been confirmed in July. Unfortunately, by that time Mr. Nikkem had become upset and said he no longer wanted to come to El Salvador. Despite all of this, we are on friendly terms with him, and we do not believe he is trying to hurt us for the sake of hurting us. It is a shame that Nikkem could not come to witness the changes that have taken place in recent months, and that his report was solely based on his observations during the months of August, September, and October of last year. Other human rights delegates who are visiting El Salvador also attended the meeting in Geneva. For instance, Dr. Garcia Sayan was there, and he issued a very positive statement for the Salvadoran Government regarding the progress achieved in the area of human rights. I believe we are at a position where we can deal with anyone, be it Nikkem or any other person, on a friendly basis. [Moderator] Thank you, Mr. Minister. [Salaverria] Excuse me. I need just another minute. I want to make an observation: No country can be exempted from these groups overnight. There is a procedure to be followed in this organization. Things must be done and undone in a uniform manner. Therefore, just as we entered gradually and ascended to the top, we have also been exiting gradually. First, we were in Point 12, where we stayed for a while, and later, last year, we moved on to Point 3 -- where we might remain or be removed. Today, we have reached the last phase of this process, in which we have virtually gone through all observation mechanisms. Currently, we have moved from the observation mechanisms to the counseling stage, which is like going from night to day. [Moderator] Thank you. Mr. Raul Mengen of Radiocenter network is next. [Words indistinct] Mr. Fausto Valladares of Megavision. [Santamaria] I want to know whether you have any more questions on the human rights issue, because our colleagues will be leaving now. If not, we will drop the subject now. [Valladares] Does this mean, then, that the [word indistinct] will not be able to report if there is a deterioration in human rights? He will not be able to... [Santamaria, interrupting] Look, I want to clarify one thing. The report can contain his perception of the country. We are not denying his legitimate right to report whether there are human rights violations in El Salvador, or whether we are moving backward instead of forward. No, that is not the mandate. The mandate involves obtaining broad powers to be able to report a country's reality. In this case, we managed to ensure that the report will be written in an atmosphere of close collaboration between Onusal and the Salvadoran Government. Why? To ensure an agreement between the time in which an event occurs and the time of the release of the report, because at times, as was the case today, he could base his work on a three-month-old report because he was unable to come to El Salvador. Perhaps this report did not reflect the country's true reality when he arrived in El Salvador. We have never denied reality. We have welcomed harsh criticism. Remember, we have faced very delicate and serious problems. In the past there was talk about serious human rights violations in El Salvador. Therefore, I think [words indistinct] the resolution mentions the word offense. In other words, the language that is already being used to describe El Salvador is completely different. He, however -- and this point is important -- is free to draft his report without having to overcome any government obstacles. He is free to draft his report as he sees fit. [Valladares] At any rate, does this not imply that El Salvador is under permanent observation? [Santamaria] No, it does not imply being under permanent observation, because, as I said, it is one thing to seek advice to open a business; if you want to buy a house, however, you go to someone to advise you on whether it is a good house, while it is another thing be told you cannot buy the house because you are unable to buy it. [sentence as heard] In other words, we are talking about two completely different issues -- two completely different analyses of the situation. I want to say that this does not mean El Salvador has reached the end of the line, as is the case with many countries. We are trying to strengthen mechanisms to reach satisfactory goals. [Moderator] Are there any other questions on this topic? [Unidentified reporter] [words indistinct] there seems to be some confusion as to what entails advisory and observation. If this rapporteur appointed by the UN is going to be in our country, or if he is going to remain in our country long enough to prepare a report, will he not have already served in some advisory capacity? Moreover, from the moment the individual arrives in El Salvador he will be observing human rights issues, either violations or observance of fundamental rights. Then, according to the United Nations, the person appointed... [Santamaria, interrupting] Of course. It is a fact that in order to advise, the person must first evaluate. If someone is asked to repair a house, I believe an engineer would first have to check the foundations, the walls, and so on. We could describe that process as the evaluation stage. Now, for him to evaluate how we can overcome these difficult problems, we will find that he will most likely suggest that in order for El Salvador not to find itself in a position -- such as the one our reporter friend here described as a human rights violator, as classified by the international community -- then we must increase this or that procedure, issues must be reviewed, and certain institutions must be strengthened. In other words, the general idea is that he is going to guide us in a way that, at the end of the process, which is next year, we... [pauses] Just to give you an example, by November when the next UN General Assembly session takes place, it will not even be necessary to discuss the Salvadoran issue anymore. By November we will have been excluded from the General Assembly agenda. Today we are being taken off of the Human Rights Commission agenda. In other words, this detail is very important because, as I explained to my friend here, there are steps to be followed. Listen very carefully. In terms of New York -- the UN General Assembly -- we have already been taken off of the agenda. In order words, El Salvador is not going to be included on the agenda for this year. In February 1995, at the Human Rights Commission, we will also be taken off of the agenda. [Unidentified reporter] [words indistinct] that our country is excluded at the international level [words indistinct] but in another analysis made in this case by the UN appointee [words indistinct] human rights violation? [Cestoni] Of course. The issue here is human rights. He will come to analyze the human rights situation. If he perceives that in the next eight or nine months we in El Salvador experience a setback in human rights -- let us hope this does not happen -- and there are serious violations, he will obviously report them. No one can prevent the human rights rapporteur from doing so. What we as government, people, and society must do is to try to ensure that such a report, which must be based on a true account of reality, be as effective as possible in reflecting an improvement in the human rights situation. Let me add something else. When a government wants to do something right, it does not wait for others to tell it what to do. That is why it has been made clear that when the Salvadoran Government requires counseling, the UN secretary general is obliged to provide it. If we feel we need UN counseling, we will request it; the United Nations does not necessarily have to offer it. It can work both ways. [Santamaria] I do not know if you have any more questions on this topic. If you do not, I would like to thank the foreign minister and presidential human rights commissioner for their presence here to answer the reporters' questions. [Unidentified station announcer] We are broadcasting live from the Presidential Palace. Dr. Santamaria continues to speak. [Moderator] [words indistinct] Raul Monge of Cadena Radio Sol. [Monge] During the past decade, the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] described the elections as an electoral farce. Do you believe, as a government, that the participation today of the FMLN in the electoral process, based on peace accords, is sincere? Do you believe the FMLN will let you govern if it fails to win the elections? [Santamaria] Well, I think that the credibility and confidence in one's actions is generated by deeds, not words. However, this is the first time the FMLN has taken part in an elections process. All Salvadoran citizens are aware of this fact. If we base our opinion on words, particularly those from the FMLN's top leaders -- namely, that they will respect the results, regardless of who wins; that their participation will strengthen the democratic process; and that this is the objective of the FMLN's political participation -- then we would have to believe that we are witnessing a strengthening of democracy in El Salvador. This involves not only respecting election results, but also respecting government actions exercised by one person as part of the responsibilities of exercising the government. [sentence as heard] We believe words must be accompanied by deeds. This is yet to be seen. I cannot give you any real opinions. Nevertheless, what we have heard is that the FMLN will respect the elections. In fact, this morning I heard an FMLN leader speak of accepting the results. He said the FMLN definitely wanted to return to civilian life, adding that overcoming the armed conflict was an irreversible reality. We hope that the FMLN keeps its word. [passage omitted] [Moderator] Ismael Beltran from EL DIARIO DE HOY. [Beltran] Good morning. Last week there were attacks during several political rallies. One deputy who was hit in the eye said political terrorism exists. What does the government plan to do to prevent this? Will it protect political rallies and motorcades? [Santamaria] The cases that have occurred have affected some political organizations. The PCN [National Conciliation Party] is one of them. You remember that the PCN already reported an incident at a public rally in an outlying city. It has now happened to a mayoral candidate and his delegation, who were attacked in a San Salvador market. Another member of Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance] was also attacked during a visit to Apopa municipality. We are completely opposed to these actions, and we condemn such actions. This is really incompatible with what we are trying to promote. We are trying to promote the consolidation of the peace process and a culture of peace. This brings to mind what we have just done in this country. The behavior, attitude, and the way people act in these cases all contradict the peace process. Moreover, these things show that there exist people who still believe that the way to discuss the country's problems is through violence. If we have a political campaign and there are political opportunities to air our ideas, there is no reason why we should respond in the opposite manner and carry out violent actions. This is totally denounced, criticized, and condemned by the government. The public security institutions must respond to all reports of such actions to guarantee the people's safety. We think that those political groups and sectors that are staging these types of actions to drive away or intimidate people... [pauses] because we think this is perhaps their aim, they want to intimidate people so that they will not go to public events to support their candidates. We think this must be publicly stated because, I repeat, such actions are not compatible with a dignified campaign, as Onusal has been requesting. Onusal has said the electoral process is admirable. At the same time some people are resorting to these low and dirty tricks of attacking candidates. We condemn these actions, and the government will adopt measures to provide the support that is requested from the public security institutions. It will enforce the law in those cases in which they must be enforced against those responsible for such actions.
