He will arrive in Moscow on May 31 and stay until June 2, Grigoriy Karasin, Information and Press Department director in the Russian Foreign Ministry, said at a briefing held today. The reason of putting off the dates is linked with the fact that the both ministers had been busy attending different international forums, Karasin noted. "However, the aim of the forthcoming talks - the continuation of an active Russian-Greek political dialogue - remains unchanged," the spokesman said.
