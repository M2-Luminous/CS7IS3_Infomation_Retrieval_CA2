This came in the foreign minister's speech addressed to the Refugees Working Group of the multilateral peace talks, which began its meetings today. The speech was read out on his behalf by Ambassador Ahmad 'Utham, the head of Egypt's delegation to the meetings. The foreign minister said Egypt is convinced of the chances for pursuing the long road to peace and overcoming its difficulties and challenges. Musa reiterated Egypt's stance on the refugee issue. He said that without a fair solution to this problem, there will be no peace or stability in the region, especially after the Palestinians felt that they were left alone to suffer, deprived of their legitimate and acknowledged rights, after their brothers in Namibia and South Africa were liberated. He also stressed the importance of the repatriation of the diaspora refugees and reunion of the displaced families, noting that the Egyptian delegation can see no reason to delay the realization of such a humane goal. Representatives from 45 countries, including Israel, in addition to UN and World Bank representatives, are participating in the three days of meetings. The delegates will discuss several issues, including reuniting Palestinian families, improving the health conditions of the refugees, especially those of the children and women, and improving the economic situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The delegates will also discuss a report from the committee that visited refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon last month.
