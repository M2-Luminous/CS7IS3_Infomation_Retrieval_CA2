As he reports, "the fighters of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Maglaj heroes withstood the wave of attacks and have once again saved their town. A true cannonade of the defense positions and civilian targets ensued." As Fermic continues to report, "the afternoon brought a more peaceful spell, which the aggressor, judging by the reports of military scouts, has been using to fill its ranks and reposition its arms, preparing itself for the continuation of the offensive." He adds that the situation regarding food and medicine supplies in Maglaj is "highly dramatic." Reporting from the 7th South Operative Group of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, Mirudin Aldobasic says that "the situation was particularly hellish in the area of Kamatova Kosa today, where the enemy has attempted tank-infantry breakthroughs on several occasions. Thanks to the outstanding bravery of the fighters of the 207th Famous Hill Brigade Jela and the 110th Famous Brigade of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] Usora, all enemy attacks were successfully resisted." "In retaliation for unaccomplished tasks, the chetniks did not leave the civilians, the civilian quarters of Tesanj, and the free territory of Doboj and Teslic in peace the entire day. The chetniks have been using this 44th day of the constant offensive at this area to regroup their forces along the entire defense line, which is 133 km long. A large concentration of enemy troops and hardware has been spotted in the vicinity of Usce on the Doboj battlefield." As Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac "the earth has been simply burning since 1300 [1200 GMT]." According to him, many parts of the town are no longer recognizable due to massive destruction. "The destruction of the industrial zone of Bihac is terrible," Sadikovic exclaims. "At the moment, it is not possible to establish the number of casualties; however, it has exceeded 200 over the last three days. There are also many dead civilians, and a considerable number of defenders perished in the savage shelling, too. The defenders in Grabez and Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau have been exposed to horrendous attacks of howitzers, tanks, and multiple rocket launchers from Jelaca Greda, [word indistinct], and Tihotina throughout the day, especially since 1300." Sadikovic draws attention to the "joint fervent battles fought by the members of the 5th Corps, the fighters of the HVO of this region, and the members of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Besides this, the chetnik helicopters performed combat actions on several occasions today, firing rockets at Jezero and transporting fresh troops and military hardware."
