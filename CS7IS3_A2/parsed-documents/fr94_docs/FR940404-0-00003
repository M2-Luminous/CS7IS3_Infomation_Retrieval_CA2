FR940404-0-00003 FR940404-0-00001 The marketing order requires that the assessment rate for a particular fiscal year shall apply to all assessable grapes handled from the beginning of such year. An annual budget of expenses is prepared by the Committee and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of the regulated commodity. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget is formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input. The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments of table grapes. Because this rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committee's expected expenses. The recommended budgets and rates of assessment are usually acted upon by the Committee shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis. Therefore, the budget and assessment rate approval must be expedited so that the Committee will have funds to pay its expenses. The California Desert Grape Administrative Committee met on November 4, 1993, and unanimously recommended a total expense amount of $103,544, which is $75,056 less in expenses than the previous year. The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.01 per lug for the 1994 fiscal year, which is $0.01 less in the assessment rate from the 1993 fiscal year. The assessment rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 9,000,000 lugs, would yield $90,000 in assessment income. This along with $2,500 in interest income and $113,000 from the Committee's authorized reserves will be adequate to cover estimated expenses. Major expense categories for the 1994 fiscal year include $50,000 for a U.C. Riverside research grant, $24,000 for the Western Grape Leaf Skeletonizer project, $11,704 for salaries, and $4,340 for rent. Funds in the reserve at the end of the fiscal year, estimated at $101,956, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses. This action was issued as an interim final rule on January 13, 1994, and published in the Federal Register (59 FR 3316, January 21, 1994). A 30-day comment period was provided for interested persons. No comments were received. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rate to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 553) because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis. The 1994 fiscal year for the program began on January 1, 1994. The marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal year apply to all assessable table grapes handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the Federal Register as an interim final rule. No comments were received concerning the interim final rule that is adopted in this action as a final rule without change.
