As a result of the Belarusian-Russian talks held on 15 March, the volume of gas deliveries to Belarus was restored to the level of 54 million cubic meters per day. Since then, however, the Belarusian debt to Gazprom has risen to 500 billion rubles, and it continues to increase. The Belarusian Government's attempts to collect money from Belarusian consumers and pay the debt have so far been unsuccessful.
