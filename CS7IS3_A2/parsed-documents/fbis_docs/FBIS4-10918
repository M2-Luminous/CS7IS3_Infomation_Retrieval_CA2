The Honduran foreign minister also expressed his support for a review of the military treaty that Honduras and the United States signed in 1954. Paz Aguilar said it is necessary to review this treaty, adding that in the specific case of the U.S. Palmerola Air Force Base, it makes no sense for it to be used as a military platform when it should be used as a center to fight drug trafficking. "Central America and the Caribbean will continue to be areas of interest to the United States, and we must take as much advantage as we can of this fact," the foreign minister said. Paz Aguilar said many agree that conditions are appropriate for Honduras to begin a new relationship with the United States. The foreign minister added that U.S. aid to Honduras can be used to combat drug trafficking and the smuggling of illegal aliens. Foreign Minister Paz Aguilar said Honduras, through its authorities, will ask the Honduran Congress to review the treaty. The Honduran Armed Forces today said Honduras should break the military treaty with the United States because the treaty is obsolete and yields no benefits to Honduras.
