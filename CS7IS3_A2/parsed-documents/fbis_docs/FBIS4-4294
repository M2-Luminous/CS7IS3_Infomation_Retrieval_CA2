It has now established an effective protective network following more than a decade of hard work in reform and opening up. In an interview with a reporter on 26 April, Cai Cheng, vice chairman of the National People's Congress Law Committee, revealed that China will soon formulate specific provisions to punish copyright infringement crimes, in order to further curb and punish acts which infringe intellectual property rights. He said: China will strengthen intellectual property rights protection in external economic and technological trade activities. It will focus on formulating laws and regulations that stipulate border-control measures on products which infringe such rights, and enhance the customs authorities' functions in protecting intellectual property rights and stopping rights-infringement products from leaving the country. Regarding law enforcement, China will soon give prominence to and consolidate law enforcement forces at all levels that are involved in copyright protection, so as to guarantee the effective enforcement of copyright laws. He said: Intellectual property rights administrative and law-enforcement organizations may jointly investigate and handle major and important cases with science and technology, economic, cultural, public security, and industrial and commercial departments. Since August 1993, Beijing Municipality, Shanghai Municipality, Guangdong Province, and Shenzhen city have successively established judicial courts for intellectual property rights. Cities such as Guangzhou, Zhuhai, and Shantou are also making plans to establish similar courts which specialize in trying intellectual property rights cases. Recently, seven departments, including the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department, State Planning Commission, and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce issued a joint document urging quality control over compact discs and laser discs, as well as strict investigation and handling of copyright piracy cases. Cai Cheng stressed: China will vigorously strengthen supervision and inspection over law enforcement on intellectual property rights. It will plan nonperiodic joint inspections by relevant departments on progress made by all localities and departments in enforcing intellectual property rights laws, focus on inspecting major rights-infringement cases, and exercise supervision over and solve problems arising from failure of certain localities to strictly enforce laws, and mete out stern punishment for rights-infringing acts. He said: The state will fully bring into play non-government forces such as associations related to science and technology, and economic and cultural fields, as well as special social groups and socialized service organizations that are involved in intellectual property rights. It will guide them toward launching all kinds of legal consultations and services on intellectual property rights. At the same time, the state will also establish a group of organizations to provide legal services related to intellectual property rights, in order to help parties concerned investigate and collect evidence against rights-infringement acts, and to help settle rights-infringement disputes through legal means. It will turn these organizations into capable assistants of law enforcement agencies in intellectual property rights protection. Citing examples, he said: Acting on behalf of the British (?Hezzelin Snow) Company this March, Beijing (?Zhongcheng) Intellectual Property Rights Protection Company, China's first and only civilian-operated intellectual property rights protection company, extensively investigated and collected evidence against a certain chemical product factory in Chaoyang city -- which falls under the jurisdiction of Shenzhen -- in Guangdong Province for producing imitation (?Hezzelin Snow) soap, and reported the relevant situation to the local public security organ. The factory was instantly closed down, and (?Hezzelin Snow) was prevented from suffering major economic losses. The Beijing company won praise from the British company. Cai Cheng said: China put in place an intellectual property rights system not long ago. As such, different degrees of intellectual property rights infringement will exist. However, China is earnest and serious about intellectual property rights protection. China has established a relatively intact legal system. It has also joined international organizations and treaties such as the World Intellectual Property Organization, Paris Convention on Protection of Industrial Property, Madrid Agreement Concerning International Registration of Trademarks, and Berne Convention on Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.
