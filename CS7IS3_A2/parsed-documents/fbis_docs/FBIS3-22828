Western intelligence services have, over the past three months, monitored the movements of Iranians carrying suitcases and wearing lightweight shoes in the Czech capital. The visitors turned out to be the men running Iran's nuclear program. Notable among these are Seyyed 'Ata ollah Mohajerani, who works on the nuclear cell attached to President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. At the same time as the giant Skoda company's factories on the outskirts of Prague were being sold to the private sector, Iranians rushed to buy shares, particularly in the company's nuclear operations. To that end, they set up a network of agents, a majority of whom became active in the "Iraqi lobby' in the communist era. The mullahs are in the market for technology for their nuclear sites. What are the secrets of the nuclear network operating between Prague and Tehran? From early September to mid-January, Western intelligence services were struck by the unusual movement of Iranian delegations in Prague and an increase in the staff of the Iranian Embassy there. American, Arab, and European monitors were convinced that the Iranians arriving in the Czech capital were pursuing contacts and nuclear and arms deals. Such was their conviction that an Arab military attache sent a report to his superiors saying "the Czech Republic is on its way to becoming a main conduit for advanced western technology to Iran, specifically in the fields of military electronics and nuclear knowhow." Hence, the successive visits to Prague over the past three months by Iranian officials responsible for their country's nuclear program. The last such visit to be noted was the one led by Haj 'Azimi, deputy head of the Atomic Energy Authority, assisted by an "adviser" living outside Iran, who has been well versed with Iran's nuclear program since the days of the shah. 'Azimi was once in charge of the Iranian Energy Corporation. It was he who signed the first agreement with the West German firm Kraft Werkers Union - K.W.U -- [preceding acronym in Latin letters] to build two reactors -- one in Bushehr, 60 km from the port, the second, 1,200 megawatt strong, in Ahvaz. After that nuclear mission, a delegation representing "Iranian military industries" came to Prague seeking a radar monitoring system of the "Tamara" type, one of the most efficient and sophisticated of its kind in the world, intended for detecting airborne objects flying at an altitude as high as 250-300 km. According to Czech sources, Tamara can spot airborne objects that other traditional radar systems find hard to detect and track down. They cite such targets as the small-size cruise missiles that fly at an altitude almost so low as to touch the ground, the Stealth fighters developed by Washington to blind radar systems, including the "F-117" used extensively against Iraq during the Gulf war, and the new strategic B-3" bombers, introduced into the U.S. Air Force recently. In the second week of January, 1994, what was dubbed by surveillance services "the largest Iranian nuclear delegation to visit the Czech capital" arrived in Prague. It comprised Amer Ollahi, the official in charge of the Nuclear Power Authority in Iran, Mehdi Shemran, a nuclear physicist from the Californian Berkley University, who is also a prominent official of the "Vavak" agency, who, in late 1991, negotiated the purchase of three nuclear warheads with Kazakhstan authorities in Alma-Ata. The extraordinary delegation also comprised Seyyed 'Ata ollah Mohajerani, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's adviser for nuclear affairs. They sought to put the finishing touches on a deal of nuclear components and technoloy, the draft of which had been negotiated by Mansur Haj 'Azimi and an adviser living in a European capital under the guise of an opponent to the mullahs regime. Various sources repored that the Iranians were interested in completing the Bushehr reactor, on which work was begun by the Munich-based Kraft Werkers Union firm, which is a subsidiary of the giant Siemens company. Mohajerani asked the "Skoda Energy" firm to go through with the project at the projected cost of billions of dollars. This Czech firm is known to be part of the "Skoda Concern", and is now undergoing privatization. Tehran may have offered to become a shareholder in the company, as the final profile of the distribution of its equity is yet to take shape. However, the biggest three potential shareholders are the German Siemens, the French Framathone and the American Westinghouse, in addition to the company's director general Dr. "Souskek", a prominent ex-communist in Prague. It is now established that Mohajerani sought 30 percent of the "Skoda Energy" shares in a barter deal involving oil shipments of up to half a million barrels every three months. The Iranians also showed an interest in purchasing equity in a number of Czech arms manufacturing firms. According to reliable information, a deal to buy [baqdami] iron fell through. The Czechs insisted on being paid in a basket of hard currencies. The two sides agreed that the Iranians visit Prague again in mid- February, on the eve of the announcement of Iran's budget for the new Iranian year beginning 21 March, which earmarks several billions of dollars to nuclear facilities and their six secret locations. Most likely the delegation will be made up of Mohajerani, Mansur Haj 'Azimi, and advisers. Sources contacted by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI are unanimous that the Czech Government, in order to avoid dealing directly with the nuclear mullahs, has authorized the director general of "Skoda Energy" to do the talking with the Iranians and work out an agreement with them, with the assistance of Vratislav Lopovoski, the man responsible for the commercial section at the Radiation Company [al-sharikah al-mushi'ah], who is well known to Iranian politicians. Also joining the talks overtly or covertly are establishments specialized in the manufacture of nuclear components, including the "P.B.S" and the "CKD" which were taken over weeks ago by the French "Elstom" company through its "Sougilik" branch specializing in the supply of electric power to reactors and the reactors' security and safety. Also taking part in the negotiations is the "ZVU" firm, formerly the "Skoda Moravia" which manufactures military equipment used in the production of chemical and germ weapons. Another firm joining the effort is the "Centizia" which produces the "Semtex" explosive. The Americans and Europeans are alarmed at the prospect of Iran acquiring equity in these factories that are being auctioned off. They note that, over a 30-year period, these factories turned out weapons of the highest caliber for the Soviet bloc. Influential members of Iran's National Security Council -- the highest military decisionmaking body in the land -- believe that these Czech factories, which Prague finds itself unable to operate for lack of hard currencies, fit the requirements of Iran's nuclear and armament program. It is interesting that Iran has spread a network of agents, spies, and informers in Prague. The Iranians are said to have recruited dynamic members of the "Iraqi lobby" that were active in the Czech capital during the eighties. That lobby, made up of local and foreign agents and politicians and military personnel, went into a state of "hibernation" after 1990. With the invasion of Kuwait, members of that lobby became jobless. They formerly served in the K.G.B. and its arms and all of a sudden found they had no role to play. Faced with the Iranian "bait", they offered their services to Iran's nuclear program. If the behind-the-scenes negotiations produce a happy ending, as seems likely, given an Iranian preparedness to meet all the financial conditions, Iran will shortly take delivery of two reactors of 1,200 megawatt capacity each for the Bushehr location. Thus, as the major shareholders in "Skoda", German firms will, through the back door of Prague, have a stake in the Iranian nuclear program. A Western diplomatic report of limited circulation has indicated that Iran recently received special equipment for the 935-megawatt Darkhovin reactor. A Czech firm that works as a front for a major European establishment delivered the equipment to Iran. So far the goods are still in their boxes. The only obstacle hampering the unpacking is the European technicians, who were scheduled to have arrived at the Darkhovin site, have been slow in arriving due to bargains being conducted in back channels. Israel stepped onto the scene, further complicating the issue because of the difficult conditions entailed. It has been reported that the Iranians are seeking the laser technology required for the enrichment of uranium so that more thorough research can be conducted at Tehran University. This plan is part of a program to establish a nuclear technology base that would subsequently facilitate the acquisition of nuclear capability. Some Western surveillance sources expect that 1995 will be the year that Iran will manufacture its own nuclear bomb. The Carnegie Foundation has revealed that Tehran has made tangible advances in its quest to acquire various kinds of nuclear technology equipment and extract fuel from uranium. Sayrafi is an Iranian nuclear scientist who has, for several years, been working at an atomic laboratory in a certain European capital. Before that, he worked at the Iranian Nuclear Energy Organization for a long time during the shah's rule. He has indicated that Tehran invested some 5.5 billion German marks, an amount equal to $3.73 billion, in the Bushehr project started by the K.W.U. firm, an affiliate of the German Siemens Company, in 1975. In his last visit to Tehran, Heinrick von Perrere, the Siemens director, told the Islamic Republic News Agency that the Bushehr story is regrettable. It embarrassed the Siemens workers, as well as the Iranians, he added. He went on to say that this story should not be an obstacle to future trade deals. That is why the Iranians created the Czech back channel to circumvent U.S. bans and other regulations the Westerners spelled out in Bonn in May, 1993. These bans and regulations prohibited sensitive technology supplies from being transferred to Iran. However, not everyone's interests are served by compliance with these bans, especially when the mullas express a readiness to foot their bills in cash and on time. Those well versed in the mullas' quest to obtain nuclear technology have cited authorizations to spend limitlessly on efforts to obtain nuclear technology by the highest echelon of power in Tehran, regardless of the crisis pertaining to oil revenues. These authorizations coincided with the first test firing of a long-range 1,100 km missile that is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead in the desert of Tabas. Chinese and DPRK experts attended the test firing of the missile.
