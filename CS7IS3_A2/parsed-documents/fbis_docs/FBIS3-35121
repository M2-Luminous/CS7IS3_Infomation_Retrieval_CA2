FBIS3-35121 "drnes034_s_94004" FBIS-NES-94-034 Document Type:Daily Report 18 Feb 1994 Iran UN Visit to Iraq, Nuclear Potential Viewed LD1702230494 Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran in English 1930 GMT 17 Feb 94 LD1702230494 Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran Language: English Article Type:BFN [Unattributed commentary] [Text] The spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, Hans Myers, said on Wednesday [16 February] that the Agency is not able to reject Iraq's likely potential for making nuclear weapons with any certainty. The spokesman said: Though the IAEA will exercise long term monitoring of the Iraqi nuclear installations, Iraq is a big country and it might have some center which have not been discovered so far. In this connection a UN team is expected to begin a nine day visit to Iraq today in order to arrange a program for controlling Iraq's military industries and stop the production of long-range missiles. During its stay in Iraq, the UN team is also expected to select a suitable place for installing the surveillance cameras and other such equipment. Despite the UN concern many political experts think it is quite difficult and inconceivable that Iraq can become nuclear now, or in the future, specially when its last recognized consignment of nuclear material was moved to Russia last February 12. This is beside the economic weakness and vulnerability that has afflicted Iraq following the Persian Gulf war. According to certain experts this very issue may, to a large extent, adversely affect Iraq's nuclear program. At any rate a major part of the pressures being brought by the UN may be the result of the activities and influence of the Israeli lobby in the White House. In fact in the opinion of Zionists any Iraqi threats to the security of the Qods occupier regime are not to be ignored. On this basis many political observers consider Washington's pressures on the UN for controlling Iraq's military industries and also for continuing the existing economic sanctions against Baghdad to be related to this very issue. These sanctions remain in place under the conditions when Iraq's ailing economy is going through difficult phases with a threat of famine and hunger, as well as grave health conditions of the vast majority of the Iraqis is looming large. This issue may focus the Iraqi people's attention on the Baghdad regime. Naturally this is not the objective desired by the White House ringleaders.
