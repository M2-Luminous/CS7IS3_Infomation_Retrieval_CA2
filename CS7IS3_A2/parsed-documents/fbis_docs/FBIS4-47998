Interviewed at Durban's Louis Botha Airport on Friday night, Jacob Zuma said without irregularities in the election process his party would have won in KwaZulu/Natal. While ANC supporters would find it difficult to accept the result, he thought they would in the interests of peace. Mr Zuma told journalists it was time to open a new chapter in the province where people could join hands to bring about peace and stability. He indicated he accepted Independent Electoral Commission Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler's announcement that the election in all nine provinces had been free and fair.
