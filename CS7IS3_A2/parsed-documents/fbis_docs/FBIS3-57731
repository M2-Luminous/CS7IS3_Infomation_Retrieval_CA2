In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday, Kostikov warned against attempts to overdramatise the situation. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has repeatedly said lately that he will remain adherent to the course of reform, Kostikov said. At the same time, he said Chernomyrdin's statements at the recent agricultural conference in Oryol, Central Russia, resembled "the distribution of unbaked bread" and caused certain alarm. "The president is closely watching the situation in the government and will not allow (anyone) to backtrack from reforms while publicly pledging (one's) adherence to them," the spokesman said. He recalled that the new government has been working only a few days since the reshuffle and has not taken any real steps yet. "The president is inclined to judge by deeds, not by words," Kostikov added. He noted that the president is concerned about statements which can be interpreted as partial restoration of "the administrative-command distribution and state planning system." "Under the new Constitution, the president has enough powers and possibilities to direct the government and insist on the continuation of the course chosen by Russia, the spokesman said. Asked about Yeltsin's relations with the parliament, Kostikov replied that the tragic experience of the October events in Moscow has given food for thought for both the president and the parliament. The president was the first to draw conclusions and meet with the heads of the parliament houses. "I think the deputy corps which has passed the trial of democratic elections is interested in constructive interaction with the president," Kostikov continued. He said number one task is to isolate extremist forces in the parliament. Kostikov said that the president is preparing a message to the parliament in which he will outline the main tasks facing the country. It will reiterate his adherence to the continuation of the tough anti-inflationary policy and privatisation as one of the key prerequisites for the country's transfer to a market economy. These measures will be accompanied by social welfare guarantees, especially for those in need. "No one will give out unbaked bread from uncollected wheat," the spokesman said. "The president has no intention of interfering in the operative work of the government and wants to see what the corrections proposed by Viktor Chernomyrdin will give. There may be various variants of tactics, but the president has a clear-cut limit, that is the continuation of reform. If he sees that a tendency towards its curtailment has emerged, he will nip that tendency in the bud," Kostikov said.
