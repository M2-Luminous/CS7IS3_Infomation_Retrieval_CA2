FBIS4-33660 "drlat111_r_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-111 Daily Report 28 May 1994 Peru Minister Plays Down CIDH Report on Garcia Minister Plays Down CIDH Report on Garcia PY0706235294 Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 28 May 94 p 6 PY0706235294 Lima LA REPUBLICA Spanish BFN [Text] Efrain Goldenberg, president of the Council of Ministers and foreign minister, said yesterday that the preliminary report of the OAS Inter-American Human Rights Committee (CIDH), which recognizes the violation of ex-President Alan Garcia Perez's human rights, has no juridical effect and that this organization lacks any jurisdiction. He harshly questioned the leaking of the preliminary report which he said is a "confidential" report. Goldenberg expressed annoyance over the CIDH report which adds that Peru violated the guarantees of an adequate process in the case of Alan Garcia. He said the judicial proceedings against Garcia for illegal enrichment and for the illegal possession of weapons will continue "because this investigation is completely independent of the matters discussed by the CIDH which has no power to make decisions or issue rulings." He said the Peruvian Government has a term in which to implement appropriate actions, adding that the committee could even decide to shelf the case. Goldenberg several times denied that the committee's preliminary report was a warning of the unstable Peruvian juridical system. Regarding the release of the report in Washington, Goldenberg accused the head of the CIDH executive secretariat of unduly releasing the report. He added that the diplomatic protest was already conveyed to the OAS through the permanent representative to that organization. He believes the "leak" could affect the calm consideration of issues still pending for study by the committee. The CIDH preliminary report indicates that the trial for illegal possession of weapons and illegal enrichment are based on "evidence obtained illegally" because action was taken without a court order and without the presence of a prosecutor. But the forceful part of the report is the condemnation over the violations of the human rights of ex-President Garcia, his wife, and children. Minister Goldenberg labeled the classification of Peru as a "narco state" by a French independent organization as completely out of place. He said Peru was once in danger of becoming a "narco state" but this is no longer the case. He stated categorically that it is not state policy to encourage the production, consumption, and traffic of drugs. On the country, he said, Peru fights that criminal activity and the "results can be seen." He said that the French organization was probably using old information. He added: "The newspapers now frequently show the capture of light planes and other concrete facts." Goldenberg did not want to be more specific of when there was a danger of becoming a narco state. At the insistence of reporters he said, smiling, that he was not referring to the Middle Ages "but to a recent period." Goldenberg also revealed that Peru has signed agreements on investment protection with Paraguay, Colombia, France, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and that one is about to be signed with the United States. He expressed the government's great interest in continuing to sign this type of agreements with all countries with which it maintains relations. Goldenberg also talked about the recent creation of the National Patriotic Council [Junta Patriotica Nacional--JPN] headed by Hugo de Zela Hurtado which strongly defends the enforcement of the 1929 Treaty with Chile and demands the annulment of the harmful 1993 Lima Convention. In a conciliatory tone, Goldenberg said the government fully agrees with the objectives of the council but refused to talk about annulling the questioned convention. He said the government will at no time neglect the defense and protection of national interests. He said the enforcement of treaties is part of the government policy and that there is no need to worry about the government failing to enforce international treaties or neglecting the country's interest. Foreign Minister Goldenberg made these comments after signing an important food aid agreement with U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams, USAID Director George Wachtenheim, and Peruvian Economy Minister Jorge Camet.
