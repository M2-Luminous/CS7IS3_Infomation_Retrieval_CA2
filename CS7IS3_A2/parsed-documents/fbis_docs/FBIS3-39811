The Commission said it was very concerned about the step, which it argued went against European law. Greece blocked access to its northern port of Salonika to its neighbouring state last week, accusing it of usurping the name Macedonia and having territorial designs on the northern Greek province of the same name. Under EC law, the unilateral sanctions would be illegal unless Greece could prove the action was justified by a threat to public order and safety. The Commission cited Article 169 of the European Union Treaty, which says that if the Commission feels a member state has not met its obligations, it has the right to issue a decision on the matter after asking the member state concerned to contribute its observations. If the member state does not comply with the decision in the period specified by the Commission, the latter can have recourse to the European Court of Justice, according to the treaty.
