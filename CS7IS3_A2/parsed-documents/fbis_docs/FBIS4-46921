Yugrina: "Give...Stop...We Demand..."] [Text] Yesterday morning at 0815 representatives of industrial enterprises of Novosibirsk organized a picket line at the entrance to the oblast administration building. The participants carried placards: "Halting production to curb inflation is insanity!" "Taxes are an octopus on the body of production." "The country was proud of the working class and now they are firing them." "We demand work!" "Without wages how will we feed our children?" "Stop the decline of production!" Judging from their content it is possible to determine the demands of the forthcoming protest rally, which will take place on 9 July. So far they are economic ones. That is what trade union leaders of the defense industry have decided. A natural question: "On the eve of a large action why was it necessary to 'besiege' the front entrance to the oblast administration?" "It is a warning action. We want not only to draw attention to the needs of the working class but also to awaken the awareness of those who are still in an inert condition," says V. Tyulenkov, chairman of the trade union committee of the Kometa production association. Unfortunately, for certain people the 50 percent decline of the production volume in "defense" and the radioelectronics industry is no cause for alarm. It is not without reason that they say that some people will not do anything until disaster is at their door. And perhaps the working man did not notice the first signs of it. Hidden unemployment has created the illusion of temporary difficulties with entering the market economy, and the pacifying speeches of government bureaucrats about the grace period for privatization hypnotized the people for a certain amount of time. But now the voice of the workers is beginning to cut through, and they are saying: "It is silent in the shop--it is an ominous silence!" "Why did you decide to join the picket line today," I asked Olga Grigoryevna Baturina, an engineer of the scientific research institute of automatic instruments. "I last received my wages in February. For six months now I have not received a stipend for my child," the young woman said almost in a whisper. I could see that she was very agitated because this was the first time she had participated in such a measure. Friends and acquaintances usually say of such people: "Quiet, modest, retiring, cannot stand up for herself." But Olga Grigoryevna's last hope lies with the local authorities. And today she has come out to defend herself and her child. "They will definitely help us. After all, I have an eight-year-old child. What am I supposed to feed him?"--the woman asks. "There is no money, but they order us to survive!"--this was the theme of the reproachful placards of the engineers of another scientific research institute. A group of women here are in the mood for a more purposeful discussion. "Our Zoya Nikolayevna Sadkova died recently. She had a month to go before she received her pension. The diagnosis on the death certificate was exhaustion from hunger"--this is what the person carrying the placard told me. These women no longer believe in either the local or the higher authorities. I met the chief of the oblast administration, I.I. Indinok, with the picketers. "Ivan Ivanovich, how do you intend to solve the social problems in the oblast?" a television correspondent asked the governor. "Perhaps we can solve this problem together?" I. Indinok answered a question with another question and pointed to a placard--"Oblast administration! Protect the children from the decadence of TV and radio!" The questions, demands, and requests were left for the rally. What will it do? Will the circle of mutual nonpayments be broken, will the tax rates change, will the jobs be returned, will earned money be paid?...
