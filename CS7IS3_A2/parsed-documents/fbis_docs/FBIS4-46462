Indeed, without having accurate, objective, unbiased, and obviously timely information at your disposal, it is hard to make a correct decision. The demands for information rise considerably and its role increases many times over if it is intended for top state leaders adopting political decisions. In this case, however, it is not just "pure information" that is needed, but also information that is analyzed beforehand by specialists and is presented in the form of analytical reports with brief conclusions and even recommendations. The Russian Strategic Studies Institute [RSSI], formed by an edict of the Russian Federation president, is one of information and analysis centers working for the country's top organs of power and administration. "What is the priority in your activity, and who receives your materials?" -- a conversation between your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent and RSSI Director Yevgeniy Kozhokin, began with this question. [Kozhokin] The institute's specialization is the problem of Russia's national security in all its multifaceted aspects. Hence the main range of consumers of our output: The President's staff, the government apparatus, the relevant Federation Council and State Duma committees, the Security Council, the CIS Joint Armed Forces staff, and a number of ministries and departments -- defense, internal affairs, the security service, the Russian Federation State Committee for the Defense Sectors of Industry, and others. [Khrustov] What are the main avenues of the RSSI's scientific research? [Kozhokin] Targeted comprehensive programs form their basis. I will briefly outline the basic ones. The first one is Russia's national security. A number of studies have been carried out within the framework of this program to determine approaches toward a concept of national security and the structuring of this problem. Methods of recognizing and predicting threats to Russia's security are being elaborated, and proposals for elaborating the strategy of the country's national security are being prepared, taking into consideration its new role and position in Europe and the Asia-Pacific Region, and indeed the whole world. The second one concerns the so-called nearby foreign countries. The main point here is revealing factors of strategic risk on Russia's borders, which have emerged following the collapse of the USSR and the formation of the new independent states: interethnic conflicts, territorial claims and disputes, the creation of national armies and the quest for an autonomous military policy, and the aspiration of individual states to economic autarky. The third is European security. This avenue of the institute's activity specifically embraces problems that are strategically important to Russia, such as prospects of European political and economic integration, new developments in NATO policy, in particular the "Partnership for Peace" program, the West European Union, and the CSCE. The fourth program is connected with ensuring Russia's economic priorities. The institute is comprehensively identifying the most important factors in the economic sphere. Conceptual proposals for protecting Russia's vital interests in the sphere of currency and credit, energy, and food security are being elaborated. The latest trends in the development of the world economy, which are influencing economic reform in the Russian Federation, are being studied. Problems and prospects of our country's participation in authoritative international economic organizations are being examined. Another important avenue of activity is military policy and conversion. The purpose of this study program is to analyze and elaborate proposals for Russia's top organs of state power in the sphere of military doctrine and organizational development, the conversion of the defense industry, the commercialization of space, the arms trade, and military-technical cooperation with foreign countries, taking world experience and the latest trends in international markets into account. We consider participation in the elaboration and implementation of comprehensive conversion programs to be an independent sphere in the activity of the RSSI. This involves the coordination of efforts in formulate legislative initiatives in the sphere of conversion; information and analysis backup for conversion projects on the basis of developing data banks on the state of markets for conversion output and on domestic and foreign enterprises which are potential partners in the implementation of conversion programs; and the conducting of independent experts' appraisals and competitions for conversion projects. And finally, the last program, the sixth, concerns the environment. A study of the environmental policy of foreign countries is being conducted within the framework of this program, the development of state-of-the-art environmentally clean technologies is being examined, and proposals are being elaborated to amend Russian legislation in the sphere of the protection of the environment, in particular in connection with military activity, and so on. [Khrustov] What is the institute's output proper, and in what form do the consumers receive it? [Kozhokin] It is primarily information and analysis material in the form of reviews, information, and memorandum. In order to work out appraisals that are as objective and balanced as possible, the RSSI makes fairly active use of seminars, exchanges of opinion, and situation analyses, which are regularly conducted with the participation of experts in the interests of a number of Russian Federation ministries and departments, the Security Council, and also parliamentary committees. For example, the institute has already produced around 20 situation analyses on the problems of Russia's relations with the new independent states in nearby foreign parts, the economic situation in the country, treaties on the reduction of strategic offensive weapons, the role of the United Nations in the modern world, the conversion of defense production, and other questions. Of the major subjects which are "in progress," I would single out the conflict in Yugoslavia. The analytical material we are currently preparing for the Russian Federation president and the Security Council will also contain a forecast on the postwar development of the countries which were once part of Yugoslavia, and the Balkan region as a whole. [Khrustov] It follows from what you have said that the task of the RSSI specialists is to analyze information, summarize it, and make forecasts. From what sources do you obtain this information? [Kozhokin] From all kinds of sources: Russian and foreign scientific research centers, and the press. We also have official information -- from ministries and departments. [Khrustov] Do you rely on your colleagues from other institutes? [Kozhokin] Of course, and we involve them very extensively in our work. This includes scientists from the Russian Academy of Sciences, for example, the United States of America and Canada Institute, the Europe Institute, and economic institutes, as well as associates of departmental scientific research organizations and experts from various sociopolitical movements and organizations. [Khrustov] What about colleagues abroad? [Kozhokin] Yes, of course, them too. We understand the need for the broadest cooperation with foreign scientific centers and individual specialists for the purposes of an objective and comprehensive analysis of the problems being studied at expert level. The RSSI is developing constructive relations with a whole range of state structures, political organizations, and scientific research centers of foreign countries. These include the North Atlantic Assembly, the NATO International Secretariat, the Atlantic Council, the Heritage Foundation (United States), the National Defense University (United States), the International Institute for Strategic Research (Britain), the International Peace Institute (Austria), and others. I can say that we have added to this list the Chinese Institute of Contemporary International Relations and the PRC Academy of Social Sciences Institute of East European and Central Asian Countries, whose specialists were the RSSI's guests recently. [Kozhokin ends] From Our Files: Yevgeniy Mikhaylovich Kozhokin is 40 years old. He is a graduate of the Moscow State University History Faculty and a candidate of historical sciences. He has worked in Russian Academy of Sciences institutes and has studied West European history (specialization -- France). He was a Russian Federation Supreme Soviet deputy in 1990-1993.
