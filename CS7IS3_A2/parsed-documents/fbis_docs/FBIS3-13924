In the morning, the commission heard testimony from Brigadier General Moshe Ya'alon, the former commander of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] in Judaea and Samaria, who told the commission that "it had not been foreseen and that he did not prepare contingency plans for events he considered remote from reality." The committee heard testimony behind closed doors from Colonel Moshe Zarqa, the IDF intelligence officer in Judaea and Samaria. Harley Braidman reports: "Brig. Ya'alon told the committee that from the evidence so far it emerges that among officers and men there was a misunderstanding about the order not to fire at Jews and this needed correction. He said there were many confrontations between Arabs and Jews at the Patriarchs' Cave, mainly over prayer arrangements. Ya'alon made it clear that it was decided to allow Jewish worshipers to enter the cave armed because of the attacks against Jews in the Hebron area. Even after the massacre no hasty conclusions should be drawn about the license to carry weapons there in view of the concern that a large number of Arab worshipers might attack Jews. "As for the orders on opening fire, the brigadier said there was clear discrimination because sometimes during Arab rioting the soldiers' lives were endangered and they had permission to start shooting in certain circumstances. One the other hand, there was no permission to fire on Jewish worshipers because the possibility of a Jew attacking a soldier was not envisaged. He also noted that the use of tear gas against Jewish rioters required special approval by the commander of Israeli forces in Judaea and Samaria. Ya'alon added: It was obvious that the soldiers seeing somebody commit a grave crime endangering the lives of others should intervene to prevent that crime and even shoot the perpetrator." In the afternoon, the commission heard testimony from Brig. Gen. Gadi Zohar, head of the Civil Administration in Judaea and Samaria, who said that the Cave of the Patriarchs "had been a source of tension for years between Arabs and Jews." Harley Braidman reports: "Zohar said it is not mission impossible to make satisfactory prayer arrangements for Jews and Arabs at the Patriarchs' Cave, but it is problematic. The Muslims believe the presence of Jews in the place which they think belongs to them is a slight. They acquiesce in silence with the status quo, but are prepared to make prayer arrangements. The Jews, Zohar added, are trying to base a permanent presence in Isaac's Hall to the chagrin of the Muslims. Both sides attempt to change specifics. The constant changes in Muslim and Jewish holidays are a source of tension, he said. The issues have been raised in discussions with the Central Region commander and in the Forum for the Territories with the participation of Defense Minister Rabin. Prayer arrangements are now being discussed with the Civil Administration and when the cave is reopened there may be new arrangements. Zohar also was not happy about the way the police functioned at the cave because it had failed to deal effectively with a string of illegal incidents there, such as throwing acid on carpets and tearing off mezuzot."
