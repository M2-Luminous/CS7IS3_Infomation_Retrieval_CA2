FR941019-2-00139 FR941019-2-00081 Reason for Change: The present formulation does not account for unenforceability arising from anything other than the public disclosure of trade secret information. Information that is claimed as a trade secret also may not be enforceable if it is readily ascertainable or had not been the subject of adequate precautions to preserve confidentiality. The change also gives effect to all proceedings to which information alleged to be confidential by Pilkington has been held to have been publicly disclosed or with respect to which Pilkington's rights have been held unenforceable for any reason.

United States District Court, District of Arizona United States of America, Plaintiff, v. Pilkington plc and Pilkington Holdings Inc., Defendants. No. CIV 94&hyph;00345 WDB. Additional Comment of PPG Industries, Inc. on Proposed Final Judgment (Exhibits Filed Under Seal) PPG Industries, Inc. (``PPG'') submits this Additional Comment on the Proposed Final Judgment in United States v. Pilkington plc as follows: Paragraph IV.D of the proposed Final Judgment provides that ``[n]o defendant, with the intent of restraining or limiting the amount of exports of FLOAT GLASS to the United States [etc.]''. We have suggested [Comments at 8] that the paragraph should be changed to add ``or from'' after the word ``to.'' Enclosed are documents recently produced by Pilkington in the suit by PPG Industries against Pilkington in the District of Arizona (No. CIV&hyph;92&hyph;753&hyph;TUC&hyph;WDB). Those documents demonstrate the need for the suggested change. They show, we believe, that Pilkington's conduct, as alleged in the U.S. complaint and in PPG's complaint, is designed to foreclose PPG and other American manufacturers from competing with Pilkington in the construction of new plants in foreign countries and, as well, in the export of glass from the United States to those foreign countries. They suggest that such exclusionary conduct is continuing to the present day. The documents are filed under seal because they were produced to us on a restricted basis. We therefore suggest that the Court should seek from Pilkington a statement of the reasonable terms and conditions under which the Court may inspect the documents and obtain comments thereon from counsel appearing for the United States.
