He said Washington wants Thailand to reduce its import tariffs on foreign films even further than it already has. Dr Suphachai said the US should not use the issue as another stick with which to beat Thailand. Washington already has Thailand on its Priority Watch List pending passage by the Thai Parliament of an improved copyright bill. Once that bill is passed, then Washington should take Thailand off the list, he said. Dr Suphachai also said that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks would focus on establishing the World Trade Organisation [WTO]. Thailand faces only one problem in its bid to become a founding member of the WTO -- a tax-collection system based on prices and conditions. GATT wants Thailand to base its tax collection on price, and Dr Suphachai said Thailand would do so. In a related development, Business Economics Department deputy director-general Khanitson Nawanukro said Thailand had finally agreed to offer greater tariff cuts on five products under GATT in a bid to end negotiations on market access for industrial and agricultural products at the Uruguay Round. The cuts, which apparently are being offered in reply to demands by the United States and Canada, will set the bound rate on compressors at 30 percent, other wood at 10 percent, herbicides at 20 percent, film at five baht per metre and gems at 1 percent. In exchange for the tariff cuts, the department expects Thai exports to gain about 102.4 billion baht, or 74.3 percent of the total value of industrial goods exported to the US in 1991. The offer would help reduce the tariff on 37.6 billion baht in imports from the US, or 43.4 percent of the total in 1991. He said Thailand also agreed not to collect specific tariff rates more than ad valorem rates, to cut taxes more in five categories for the US and Canada, and to try to conclude the negotiations with the two countries at the market-access talks of the Uruguay Round. Several countries have protested against Thailand's tariff-cut offer. Thailand added specific tariff rates to its list submitted last December 15 and on February 15, while only ad valorem rates had been put on its list submitted in March and December 1992. There are considerable differences between these two rates. Thailand's proposed deductions are considered invaluable because the country will get more protection and higher net import limits, so it agreed not to collect more specific tariff rates than ad valorem ones. The US and New Zealand were the major GATT members that complained about the Thai offer of specific tariff rates. For example, the 50,250 kilogrammes of Kiwi fruit worth 3.9 million baht that was imported by Thailand in 1993 would have been charged 1.17 million baht in tariffs if based on the ad valorem rate of 25 percent. But the tariffs would have totalled 1.25 million baht if based on the specific tariff rate of 25 baht a kg.
