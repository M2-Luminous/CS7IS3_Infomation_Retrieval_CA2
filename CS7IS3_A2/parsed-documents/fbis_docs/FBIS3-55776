Is the Scandal To Continue?"] [Text] Belarus joining the CIS collective security system. Currently, this issue, on which so many discussions were held half a year ago, has quietly disappeared from the press, and has almost been forgotten by the people. However, over the upcoming weeks, this issue will probably again become the number one topic in the legislature and a reason behind the fierce battle for power. In Ashgabat, a Belarusian delegation headed by Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich participated in work on drafting documents concerning collective security. There have been reports that our CIS partners do not want to accept the stipulations, on which Belarus insisted while signing the agreement. [Zhdanko] There have been contradictory rumors about Belarus signing the agreement. [Shushkevich] Belarus signed the agreement on joining the CIS collective security system long ago. However, there are still certain forces here which are ready to treat this issue differently. It is interesting that our partners have far fewer doubts. For example, in an interview with INTERFAX, Viktor Samsonov, chief of the Headquarters for Coordinating Military Cooperation of CIS countries, stated that Belarus joined the system of collective security and fulfilled all procedures. In the same INTERFAX bulletin, Mechyslav Hryb questioned this fact. Since the honorable chairman of the Supreme Soviet committee had such doubts, I have asked lawyers to further analyze the issue. What is the result? As a matter of fact, there are no doubts, however there is a question of terminology. The point is that the Vienna convention provides for joining agreements by signing them or by issuing a statement saying that they will be ratified. The 10th paragraph of the agreement on collective security says that one can join the agreement. It does not provide for signing it. [Zhdanko] Cannot one remove the ambiguity of this situation? [Shushkevich] On 31 December, I sent a letter to CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Karatchenya. I informed him that I legalized the agreement in the same way Azerbaijan and Georgia did. However, since the Supreme Soviet requested that I not join the agreement but sign it, I replied that, had I done so, I would have actually confirmed our joining the agreement, and I cited the Supreme Soviet resolution attaching stipulations to it. The stipulations, as is known, prohibit the participation of our troops in any actions abroad and activities of armed forces of the countries that have signed the agreement on our territories, without Supreme soviet permission. It was not only this issue which forced me to write the letter. I was surprised that Vyacheslav Frantsevich Kebich, the head of our delegation, did not sign certain ordinary documents regarding collective CIS security at the meeting in Ashgabat. These were a resolution on further work on a draft protocol of the agreement on collective security, the resolution "On Key Measures for Implementing the Agreement on Collective Security," a protocol on terms and procedures of joining the agreement, and a resolution on appointing the secretary general of the Collective Security Council. Had I been well and able to head the delegation, I would have unconditionally signed the documents. I believe that, having consulted the Supreme Soviet Presidium, I will still have an opportunity to announce that we are ready to sign the documents. [Zhdanko] But, immediately after the Ashgabat meeting, the prime minister explained why Belarus had been forced to play an observer's role during debate on this issue. [Shushkevich] I do not like when somebody tries to complicate something simple. If the head of the delegation -- the prime minister -- had been convinced that I had not signed the document, he could have demonstratively stated that he would do it. He had the right to do so as the head of a delegation appointed by the Supreme Soviet. But such a question did not arise, since it would have been nonsense. Therefore, I believe that this is just part of a campaign to prove that somebody does not want to do anything against the interests of Belarus. [Zhdanko] Assuming that the procedures for signing the agreement were violated, is the Foreign Ministry responsible for this? [Shushkevich] In countries with statehood experience, their official state structures establish appropriate procedures. If the Foreign Ministry believes that I did not properly sign the agreement, it is its responsibility to inform me about this and indicate which procedures were not fulfilled. The Committee for National Security could have done the same as well. But, instead of doing this, they began ununderstandable hysteria. I sent this letter to clarify the situation. [Zhdanko] Is it possible that Belarus will join the system of collective security, having stipulated certain terms and its special status within this structure? [Shushkevich] The stipulations adopted by the Supreme Soviet, in my opinion, contradict, to a certain degree, the very sense of the agreement... One must realize that our stipulations can be approved only if this is agreed with all countries which have signed the agreement without any stipulations. I believe that our diplomats should handle this issue. I have not seen any move by the Foreign Ministry and the Cabinet of Ministers which would be aimed at implementing the Supreme Soviet resolution. In a previous letter to leaders of CIS countries and the latest one, I could not conceal the stipulations -- I was obliged to reveal them. When will the issue be finally solved? When the Supreme Soviet adopts a resolution on ratification. If the stipulations are approved, they should also be accepted by other countries. Should this not occur, we should annul the stipulations. I believe that preparing the agreement for ratification would be the best form of work for today, as well as completing a thorough analysis of the question of whether our joining can be accepted with such stipulations.
