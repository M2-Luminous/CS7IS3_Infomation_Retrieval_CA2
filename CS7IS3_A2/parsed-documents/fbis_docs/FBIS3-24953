FBIS3-24953 "drafr024_c_94020" FBIS-AFR-94-024 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Feb 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 4 Feb MB0402131794 MB0402131794 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Swing Vote To Ensure Election Democracy -- Referring to the findings of a Market and Media Research poll commissioned by THE STAR, Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 4 February in a page-10 editorial welcomes the fact that "a quarter of the voters are undecided." This means the outcome of the election "is not pre- determined, that the campaign, the election issues and the arguments and counter-arguments are more than the ritual din of electioneering." The undecided voters will ensure "there will be an element of unpredictability and excitement." THE STAR believes that "democracy depends on the swing vote." BUSINESS DAY Economic Policy Taking Shape -- "While the constitutional negotiations stumble on, the policy negotiations are having far more success," remarks a page-6 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 4 February. The "public spats" about the ANC attitudes to mines and banks are but the latest examples of this process, "which is proving hugely beneficial and is the best reason we have to hope for economic prosperity." "The ANC [African National Congress], like the NP [National Party], is considering new ways of achieving an unchanged goal. The NP switched from domination to negotiation to secure white survival, and Afrikaner survival in particular. The ANC wants to redress apartheid's ills, ending the economic focus on white businesses and individuals spreading economic empowerment and tangible benefits to blacks while using state resources to attack poverty, disease, illiteracy, homelessness and unemployment." The country has "come a long way since 1990," and its politics "may be in a mess but, draft by draft and argument by argument, an acceptable economic policy is taking shape." SOWETAN ANC Can Afford Double-Ballot Elections -- "As the party that is likely to get most of the support in the coming elections, the ANC can be magnanimous and accept some of the demands made by the Freedom Alliance," declares Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 4 February in a page-10 editorial. This would "call the bluff of those in the alliance who refuse to go into the elections as they know they will be voted out. Apart from anything else double-ballot elections which will have credibility might even expose those homeland leaders who have no support in their own areas." Black Economic Empowerment -- A second editorial on the same page welcomes the pending takeover of African Life by a coalition of black business people and community organizations. It is "a great step towards black economic empowerment." WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN Poll Predictions Fit NP, DP Agenda -- "Beware of the opinion polls," cautions a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in English for 4-10 February. "Predictions of an ANC landslide in April have the effect of lulling ANC activists and supporters into complacency and promoting the view among doubters that they should vote for a strong opposition. The poll that predicts an ANC landslide fits a National or Democratic Party agenda. The ANC's own polls give it only a little more than 50 percent. That's a more realistic figure, all things considered."
