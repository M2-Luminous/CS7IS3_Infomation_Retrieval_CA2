As a result, EPA considers a season-specific program to be unnecessary in order to achieve the objectives of this program. E. Level of Renewables Required 1. Existing Renewables Market Share During the rulemaking process, EPA considered requiring greater and lesser levels of renewable oxygenates and requested comment on the appropriateness of the proposed 30 percent level for renewables. Under the winter oxygenated fuels program, which began in 1992, ethanol has been used in approximately 30 percent of the oxygenated gasoline. That program includes certain areas that will require RFG, but in general it focuses on non-RFG areas with wintertime carbon monoxide (CO) problems. Based on this experience, it appears that splash-blended ethanol can be expected to be used in at least thirty percent of the oxygenate market when the RVP increase resulting from the blend is not constrained, given existing incentives for the use of ethanol and other renewable oxygenates. The 30 percent requirement for the renewable oxygenate program helps assure that, at minimum, renewable oxygenates will be used to an extent similar to what would have occurred in the RFG-related oxygenate market had the air quality imperatives of the RFG program not required constraints on RVP levels. This will avoid a situation where the requirements and complexity of the RFG program limit the growth of renewable oxygenate use. Today's renewable oxygenate requirement will in effect set a floor to avoid reduced use of renewable oxygenates in the future. It does not set a ceiling, and should not interfere with growth of renewable oxygenate use. There are no similar restrictions placed on the remaining 70 percent of the RFG oxygenate market. As discussed below in section III.E.4, if MTBE dominates this portion of the RFG oxygenate market as anticipated, MTBE use will still grow dramatically over its current demand. 2. Renewables Production Capacity In the December proposal, EPA stated that given the current absence of renewable methanol capacity, ethanol and its ether derivatives were likely to be the primary oxygenates used to meet the renewable oxygenate requirement in the short term. Based on 1990 data, EPA estimated that the 30 percent renewable oxygenate requirement would require an average production of roughly 630 million gallons of ethanol per year, or about 60 percent of EPA's estimate of current ethanol production capacity of roughly one billion gallons per year. EPA has updated these estimates, as discussed more fully in the RIA, and now estimates that approximately 670 million gallons per year of ethanol will be needed to meet the requirements of the renewables program alone in the 1995&hyph;1996 time frame. Other analyses have reached similar conclusions; for example, USDA's analysis indicates that the 30 percent renewable oxygenate requirement would require an average production of 680 million gallons per year. As discussed below in section III.F, EPA believes that this new demand can be met, provided there is a phase-in of the program in 1995. A phase-in will give oxygenate producers, refiners, and terminals one additional year to obtain permits, construct facilities and negotiate contracts before the full program goes into effect in 1996. 3. Comments Regarding the Level of Renewables The majority of comments from ethanol suppliers and feedstock producers who addressed the appropriate level of renewable oxygenates supported the 30 percent requirement. The primary rationale for their support was that the current market share for ethanol in the oxygenated fuels program should be maintained. Comments were received recommending both higher and lower levels of renewable oxygenates. Higher levels were suggested in the belief that the ethanol industry needed the additional encouragement through just such an incentive to grow at a more desirable rate. At this point in time, however, the 30 percent renewables requirement in those areas covered by the RFG program represents a considerable stimulus to the renewable oxygenate industry. EPA believes that a larger renewable oxygenate requirement would call into question the near-term feasibility of the renewables program. Furthermore, EPA believes that the 30 percent level is all that is necessary to overcome the ethanol blending limitations in RFG caused by the VOC performance standard, since this is the level ethanol was able to achieve absent any blending restrictions under the winter oxygenated fuels program. In addition, the 30 percent renewables requirement being promulgated today is a minimum requirement. It does not prevent renewable oxygenates from increasing their share of the gasoline oxygenate market. Many of those opposing the 30 percent requirement argued that it could create the potential for supply disruption and significant cost increases in the short-term. The oil and MTBE industries objected to the necessity for a renewable oxygenate program out-of-hand. They argued that since ethanol already has a large portion of the current wintertime oxygenated fuel market and since the market for ethanol would likely increase when the RFG program begins in 1995, the 30 percent renewable oxygenate program was unnecessary. Others, notably state air pollution control officials, recommended that the 30 percent requirement be lowered to 10 percent in order to mitigate any potentially negative environmental and energy impacts, as well as to allow the market more input in selecting the oxygenates used in the program. EPA has considered these comments but continues to believe that the 30 percent requirement is appropriate and feasible given the energy and environmental benefits of the renewables requirement and long-running governmental policies to promote renewable fuels. The basis for these conclusions is discussed elsewhere in this notice and in the RIA.
