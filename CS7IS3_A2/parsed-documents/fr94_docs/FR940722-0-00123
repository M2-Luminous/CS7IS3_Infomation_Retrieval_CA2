FR940722-0-00123 FR940722-0-00019 G. Tax Certificates 142. Congress instructed the Commission to consider the use of tax certificates to help ensure designated entity participation in spectrum-based services. See 47 U.S.C. §309(j)(4)(D). In the Second Report and Order we observed that tax certificates could be useful as a means of attracting investors to designated entity enterprises and to encourage licensees to assign or transfer control of licenses to designated entities in post-auction transactions. We stated further that we would examine the feasibility of using this measure in subsequent service-specific auction rules. Second Report and Order at ¶ 251. 143. We believe that tax certificates, which allow the recipients to defer capital gains taxes made on sales, are an appropriate tool to assist women and minority-owned businesses to attract start-up capital from non-controlling investors in broadband PCS. As explained above, due to discrimination in private lending markets and other factors, these designated entities face added obstacles in accessing capital. Therefore, in order to ensure that such businesses have a meaningful opportunity to participate in auctions, it is necessary to adopt measures to encourage investment in minority and woman-owned companies. Moreover, because of the severe underrepresentation of women and minorities in telecommunications, we believe that it is appropriate to give PCS licensees the incentive, through the grant of tax certificates, to assign or transfer their authorizations to such entities in post-auction sales. This measure will provide added assurance that minority and women-owned entities have the opportunity to participate in broadband PCS services, as mandated by Congress. Accordingly, we will issue tax certificates to non-controlling initial investors in minority and women-owned broadband PCS applicants (in any frequency block), upon the sale of their non-controlling interests. We will also issue tax certificates to broadband PCS licensees (in any frequency block) who assign or transfer control of their licenses to minority and women-owned entities. 144. We have used tax certificates over the years to encourage broadcast licensees and cable television operators to transfer their stations and systems to minority buyers. 121 We also have granted tax certificates to shareholders in minority-controlled broadcast or cable entities who sell their shares, when such interests were acquired to assist in the financing of the acquisition of the facility. 122 These broadcast and cable tax certificates are issued pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. §1071. While Congress' goal in authorizing tax certificates under Section 309(j)(4)(D) of the Act is somewhat different, and focuses on ensuring the opportunity for designated entities to participate in auctions and spectrum-based services, we think that tax certificates will be equally valuable in the broadband PCS context. Issuance of tax certificates to investors in minority and women-owned businesses and licensees that sell to minorities and women will augment the other measures we adopt today to encourage minorities and women to participate in broadband PCS and will increase the ability of these entities to access financing for that purpose. 121 See 1982 Policy Statement; 1978 Policy Statement. We have also employed tax certificates as a means of encouraging fixed microwave operators to relocate from spectrum allocated to emerging technologies. See Third Report and Order and Memorandum Opinion and Order, ET Docket No. 92&hyph;9, 8 FCC Rcd 6589, 58 FR 46547, Sept. 2, 1993. 122 See 1982 Policy Statement, 92 FCC 2d at 855&hyph;58. 145. In implementing this program, we will borrow from our existing tax certificate program and grant tax certificates, upon request, that will enable the licensees and investors meeting the criteria outlined here to defer the gain realized upon a sale by: (1) Treating it as an involuntary conversion under 26 U.S.C. §1033, with the recognition of gain avoided by the acquisition of qualified replacement property; or (2) electing to reduce the basis of certain depreciable property; or both. Tax certificates will be available to initial investors in minority and woman-owned businesses who provide ``start-up'' financing, which allows these businesses to acquire licenses at auction or in the post-auction market, and those investors who purchase interests within the first year after license issuance, which allows for the stabilization of the designated entities' capital base. The definition of a minority or women-owned entity is set forth below 123 and, with regard to our investor tax certificate policy, the entity in which the investment is made must satisfy that definition at the time of the original investment as well as after the investor's shares are sold. For post-auction market sales, tax certificates will be issued only to licensees who sell to entities that meet that definition. Tax certificates will be granted only upon completion of the sale, although parties may request a declaratory ruling from the Commission regarding the tax certificate consequences of prospective transactions. 123 See infra ¶¶ 181&hyph;192. 146. One-Year Holding Period . As with our other tax certificate policies, we are concerned about avoiding ``sham'' arrangements to obtain tax certificates and, pursuant to Section 309(j)(4)(E), thus adopt measures to prevent abuses. As in our existing tax certificate program, 124 we will impose a one-year holding requirement on the transfer of control or assignment of broadband PCS licenses by women and minority-owned businesses who obtained such licenses through the benefit of tax certificates. We believe that the rapid resale of such licenses at a profit would subvert our goal of ensuring the opportunity to participate by minority or woman-owned businesses. If the buyer itself is a women or minority-owned business, however, our objectives still will be satisfied. Thus, as an exception to the holding requirement, we will permit the assignment or transfer of control of licenses during this period to other qualified minority and women-owned businesses. We note, however, that the assignee or transferee who receives this license before the end of the original one-year holding period will also be subject to a one-year holding requirement, from the date of consummation of the assignment or transfer. 124 See Amendment of Section 73.3597 of the Commission's Rules, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 99 FCC 2d 971, 974 (1985). 147. Finally, in the Broadband PCS Reconsideration Order , we indicated that we would address in this proceeding proposals for issuing tax certificates to cellular operators who divest their cellular holdings in order to come into compliance with our rules governing cellular operators' participation in broadband PCS. Several commenters argued that tax certificates should be issued to all such companies who divest their holdings. 125 To accomplish the directive in Section 309(j)(4)(D) that minority groups and women are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services, we have decided to issue tax certificates to such cellular companies so long as their cellular interests are divested to businesses owned by minorities and/or women, as defined in this order. In this manner, we can further implement Congress's goal to facilitate the participation of minorities and women in spectrum-based services. We will also impose a one-year holding period requirement on the assignment or transfer of control of cellular licenses obtained by women and minority-owned businesses through the benefit of this tax certificate policy. 125 See, e.g., Petitions for Reconsideration of GTE Service Corporation and Comcast Corporation of Second Report and Order in GEN Docket 90&hyph;314.
