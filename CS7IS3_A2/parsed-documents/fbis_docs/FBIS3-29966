They also resolved to use the deepest point of the river to demarcate the international boundary on the bridge. The Thai-Laotian boundary on the bridge will thus continue to be the same line as the boundary in the river, as insisted by Thai negotiators. The agreement was reached yesterday at a meeting between Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri and his Laotian counterpart Somsavat Lengsavat. Somsavat had stopped over in Bangkok on his way to Europe for an official visit which will take him to France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and Russia. The setting up of the joint committee will be followed up when Somsavat returns from his European tour on March 10. The committee will be in charge of ruling in disputes regardless of which side of the bridge they may have occurred. But the Thai side of the committee will take responsibility for incidents involving Thai nationals and vice versa. Problems involving nationals of other countries will be ruled jointly by the committee. Both ministers yesterday also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Development of Luang Prabang Airport. The MoU detailed a plan for the development and reconstruction of the airport which is expected to cost about Bt [baht] 50 million. The project will cover the construction of a passenger terminal building. The Department of Civil Aviation and the Ministry of Communications will start bidding procedures in order to select a suitable Thai construction company to undertake the work which is scheduled to begin in May and should be completed within 18 months.
