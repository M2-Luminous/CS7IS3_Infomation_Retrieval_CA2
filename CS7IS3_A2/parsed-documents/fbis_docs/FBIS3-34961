The explosion shattered the window and the windshields of two cars parked opposite it; there was no other damage or casualties. The security source said the device was primitively made and was similar to those made by children to make popping sounds. The source added that this proves that the act was only meant to attract media attention, which remnants of the deviants are trying hard to do to show that they still exist. The source said that the security services are warning the deviants that they will face a strong and decisive confrontation. The security services will not hesitate to confront these attempts decisively. At the same time, the source said, all security services sense the people's confidence that the police will put an end to these petty criminal attempts, which show how weak the deviant terrorist groups are. The security source said that Egypt's nationalist forces stand behind the security forces, defending by all means the culture and history of the nation. They will never allow a stray criminal group to sabotage the homeland.
