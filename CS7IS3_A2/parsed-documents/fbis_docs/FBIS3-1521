"The whole question of the sovereignty of the kingdom of kwaZulu must finally be resolved before there can be an election," he said in a hard-hitting statement from Ulundi. Mr Buthelezi directly blamed the ANC for Monday's violence, describing the shooting of Zulu marchers outside the ANC's head office as the "Shell House massacre". April 27 -- the initial election date -- should be declared a "national Zulu day of mourning", to remember those killed on Monday, said Mr Buthelezi. He added that there were reports of Zulus massing at Johannesburg hostels while others were travelling to the Reef to support their kin. "If we do not take action as elected representatives of the Zulu people and as grassroots leaders, there is no saying what the people will do in taking the law into their own hands." "The only way to be sure of avoiding the degeneration of the South African situation into one of ungovernability and violence beyond control is to suspend the election date, and to seek to establish a proper basis for a free and democratic election. Very unfortunately what has thus far taken place in kwaZulu and in the Transvaal are only precursers of what will yet come," said the Inkatha Freedom Party president. Mr Buthelezi's comment that there could be no effective negotiations on Zulu sovereignty within the framework of the present election timetable apparently ruled out his participation in this week's planned summit with State President F W de Klerk and ANC President Nelson Mandela. King Goodwill Zwelithini earlier on Tuesday also pulled out of the summit, citing Monday's violence as the main reason. Mr Buthelezi charged Monday's killings made it clear the ANC remained committed to its "pre-prepared plans to destroy the kwaZulu government and the kingdom. We can now see that the ANC is very serious in the attempts it is making to destroy the kwaZulu government and to take all Zulus into an ANC-dictated future by the force of violence that they are capable of." He alleged there could be no doubt the ANC was fully aware of the consequences of what "they planned and executed". "They know that the Zulu resistance to what they are attempting to do constitutionally and politically will now lead to a flash flood of demands for retribution running through Zulu society. The pretext that most of the Zulus support the ANC in kwaZulu is now shown to be ridiculous. One does not do to your supporters what the ANC did to people who were doing no more than marching to express their solidarity with their king's call for the recognition of the sovereignty of the Zulu people. The Shell House massacre shows that we have now entered a final struggle to the finish between the ANC and the Zulu nation, unless there is the extension of the voting date deadline." Mr Buthelezi alleged "the same ANC which perpetrated the Zulu massacre" controlled the Transitional Executive Council [TEC]. The world was now witness to what the TEC's intentions were. He charged ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa's call for the disbanding of the kwaZulu government was a call which "the TEC will back with ANC political violence and state violence". The IFP had called for an immediate Goldstone Commission investigation into Monday's bloodletting Mr Buthelezi said, but claimed the commission was perceived to be partial to the ANC. "If it is to correct the negative image it has, now is the time to do so." But, Mr Buthelezi added, the police had to act against the ANC and arrest those behind Monday's violence. "It is now time that the state president came to his political senses. In agreeing to the election in the present climate of violence, and ignoring the fact that many millions of ordinary people are opposed to the election, he has agreed to a course of events, and to an election, in which it is not the will of the people that will determine the results, but the Machiavellian planning of the ANC and the capacity they have to unleash violence that will decide the election." Mr Buthelezi said international mediation on the constitutional deadlock should now take place in the wider context of the election being staged in an atmosphere charged with violence. Had the IFP's bottom line amendments to the interim constitution been met, Monday's events and "other events yet to come" would not have taken place, Mr Buthelezi claimed.
