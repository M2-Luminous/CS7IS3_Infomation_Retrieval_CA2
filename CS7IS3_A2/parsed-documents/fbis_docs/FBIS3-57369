Ivan Plyushch, the Supreme Soviet Chairman, told deputies that opposing views had crystallized. Numerous deputies want to keep the rights of the presidential representatives intact, not delegating part of them to the elected bodies. Others insisted on electing all local authorities. Plyushch also said that if the Supreme Soviet did not make a decision on the referendum, the president had a right to do so. The proposal that a referendum on basic constitutional provisions should be held had been made by the constitutional conference held on January 14. These provisions include the list of the powers to be exercised by the president, the Supreme Soviet and the government. By that draft, the president's functions would be only representing the country on the international scene and supervision of the government activities. The Supreme Soviet would remain the highest legislative body while the government would take over all the executive functions. Parliament will continue the debate on January 26.
