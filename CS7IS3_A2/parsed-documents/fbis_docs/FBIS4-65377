Asked if the Cypriot Government considers that the process to find a Cyprus solution in general through the method of talks has also been terminated, Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the methods followed to date have proven that there cannot be progress, due to the lack of political will by the Turkish side. Kasoulidhis added that what should be done now is for the Security Council members to consider alternative ways to promote a Cyprus solution. He added: After the UN secretary general's report is submitted, the Security Council might give some time for consultations to be held among its members in order to agree on the alternative methods to be promoted. He also noted that these consultations might include the guarantor powers in Cyprus.
