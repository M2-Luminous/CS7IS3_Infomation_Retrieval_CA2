The outbreak that occurred in the south of Russia in 1988-1989 raised the country right away to the same level as the rest of the world, which had long known the pleasures of AIDS. At the same time it emphasized our vulnerability even here: Rather than having the disease occur in risk groups in large cities, we got AIDS as a children's epidemic in provincial, out-of-the-way places. But if only that were the only problem! In the last 5 years some of the infected children have managed to become adults, but no one is yet certain that such an outbreak will not occur in our country again. The official explanation was given very quickly--infection occurred due to the absence of disposable syringes and poor sterilization of reusable ones. This was the version presented by Vadim Pokrovskiy, the director of the All-Union AIDS Prevention Laboratory. It took him several days in Elista, where mass infection was first detected, to reach this conclusion. This version was actively supported, including at the international level, by Valentin Pokrovskiy, president of the USSR (now the Russian) Academy of Medical Sciences. An entire boom of purchasing disposable syringes has passed (as an example Yeltsin brought 100,000 from England, paid for by an honorarium for his book), and production in this country was organized. Concurrently it seem as if the chain of infections that led to the single adult infection in the Elista hospital, which started it all, was untangled. With this, official medicine relaxed. But here's what's strange--the unprecedented mass outbreak of hospital infection has rather distinct bounds: It began in mid-1988, and ended in the middle of the next year. There were still not enough syringes, the investigation was still ongoing, but the infections had already ceased, as if someone had dropped the boom in the virus's path. Just 2 years ago physicians of one of the ``capitals'' of children's AIDS, Rostov, said: ``Syringes are far from always to blame. If a child that was already infected was lying in the first floor of the hospital, then another who was on the fourth floor at this time, and who was infected at the same time, couldn't have received the virus from him. Syringes don't circulate between floors and wards.'' The question, asked in amazement, ``So how could he have been infected?'', was usually followed by a long stare, leaving the dilettante bewildered. Nobody wanted to talk in Rostov back then, and no one especially wants to today. But there are grounds for this. In 1989 the AIDS laboratory of the Rostov Plague Institute began its own investigation of the circumstances behind the infection of the children, which didn't fit with the official ``dirty syringes'' version. Its associates turned their attention to the fact that immunoglobulin had been administered to most of the infected children in the hospital. This preparation is made from blood, including placental blood, which is taken from women during labor. No one asks the female donors for their consent for this--as a rule, they are not even informed that the procedure is taking place. A maximum of 100 milliliters is obtained from one person, while an industrial lot consists of over 100 liters. One can imagine how many people have been ``mixed together'' to create the preparation. The shelf life is limited. After it expires, anything left over is scrapped. In several series of experiments the laboratory diligently reproduced the immunoglobulin production procedure after first infecting the raw material with the virus. As a result in the second series of experiments the virus was still alive in the fifth, or second-to-last, production stage. It should be considered that the laboratory meticulously adhered to the procedure, which requires, in addition to other things, the use of alcohol. How strictly it was observed in industry, under the conditions of the fight that was going on then against alcoholism, remains only to be guessed. The first results were communicated at a meeting of Rostov's extraordinary epidemic commission by the institute director, Yuriy Lomov. And literally just a couple of weeks later the order came from Moscow, from the Main Administration of Quarantine Infections of the USSR Ministry of Health, to close the AIDS laboratory of the plague institute ``as being not consistent with its profile.'' The two series of experiments were the only ones completed. Mikhail Norkevich, who was then the director of the main administration, now heads the AIDS control department of the Russian Ministry of Health. He categorically rejects the immunoglobulin version. He has his own arguments for this. Nor does Vadim Pokrovskiy recognize it. We weren't able to learn his reasons, because he refused to talk with this journalist. But neither ever gave reasonable explanations why this study of an alternative approach had to be stopped quickly and at its roots. One of the main arguments against the danger of infection by way of immunoglobulin is that the initial blood is tested for AIDS. It is in fact tested for antibodies. But between infection and the appearance of antibodies, there is a ``dead zone'' of from 3 weeks to 3 months, during which tests are blind. If infection and pregnancy occur simultaneously, this would be precisely the time period during which women would go in for an abortion, at which time blood would be taken. There is one other argument--the procedure itself, which consists of six stages, kills the virus. However, in 1984 HIV was detected in such a blood preparation in the USA. Since that time the finished product undergoes a seventh stage there--processing by gamma-radiation, which kills every living thing. This is a 100 percent guarantee, and it also saves on tests to determine the quality of the blood and the end product. On the backdrop of the punctures formerly suffered by the by-far more procedurally precise and disciplined Americans, the calmness of AIDS fighters in Moscow appears, in the least, as not too justifiably presumptuous. It seemed as if the disbelief of Rostov doctors in the sole true version of infection was fated to remain at the level of talk--no one is eager to stick his neck out when the two highest AIDS officials are avidly interested in preserving only one cause. But it turned out that there is an unrelated power interested in conclusive investigation of all the details. The procuracy in Rostov has been conducting an investigation since the moment the first infected individuals were revealed. Examining magistrate Valeriy Lysenko is rather cautious: ``Clarification of the causes of infection is still continuing. The personal opinion of no individual, even the most authoritative, can be considered to be the truth until all of the details are clarified.'' And there is plenty that is unclear: For example, there has been no sanitary-epidemiological analysis of infection in Rostov Oblast. The investigation conducted its own expert examination at the Rostov Oblast Children's Hospital, where 44 children were infected (a total of 99 children were infected in the oblast, and 75 remain alive). After meticulous examination of all cases the experts brought in by the procuracy concluded that for practical purposes not a single child could have been infected by a syringe from the infected girl from Elista who was also lying in this hospital. After this conclusion the procuracy began searching for the lots of immunoglobulin sent to Rostov in the middle of 1988, and scrapped a year later. Control samples are supposed to remain in the factories making the blood preparations, but the suspected factories remain silent. In the meantime one other fact that may turn even the local version of infection several degrees in who knows what direction fell into the lap of the procuracy. Until quite recently there were eight infected adults in Rostov Oblast. One man, and the rest women. The husband of one of the women divorced her after the diagnosis, while another three women became pregnant (after the diagnosis!) and gave birth, leaving their husbands healthy in this case. And it became clear just recently that there should be many more infected adults in Rostov. Following the death of Gennadi Ilchenko, the director of the oblast's main medical school, it was revealed that he had been ill with AIDS since 1985. While he was alive he was known as a person who could use his official position to his advantage. As it now turns out, not only materially but even physically. After the cause of his death was announced, both male and female students, past and present, and even instructors at the school, who had managed to have relations with the deceased director, appeared for testing at the oblast AIDS centers. The scandal is growing in Rostov's medical circles. However, it turns out that what was a secret in Rostov was known for a long time in Moscow. Ilchenko had been on record at the hospital on Sokolinaya Hill, presently the Russian Scientific and Teaching Center for AIDS, since 1987. It was then, and is now, under the command of Vadim Pokrovskiy, who (no one in Rostov doubts this) set up treatment for Ilchenko without publicity. Unauthorized people shouldn't know about an AIDS diagnosis, but even the chief physician didn't know about this in the oblast AIDS center, which takes care of Rostov Oblast. Two persons infected by Ilchenko have been revealed in Rostov thus far. But few doubt that this is only the beginning. People infected by the chief of the medical school may be at any of the oblast's therapeutic institutions. Including at blood transfusion stations, and in children's hospitals. The procuracy is preparing to investigate a new version of the possible mass infections--by way of infected medical workers. As for what conclusions will be reached by the investigation, which has gotten into a matter that is not in its typical line of work, time will tell. But until medicine opts to investigate all versions at a serious scientific level, not one of us can be assured that new hospital infections won't break out.
