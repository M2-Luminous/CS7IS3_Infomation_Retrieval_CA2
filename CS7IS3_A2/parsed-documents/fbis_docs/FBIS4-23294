Opening a meeting of African presidents and representatives of Western donor nations in Harare, he said that perhaps at no other time in Africa's history had the continent felt so acutely the need for partnership and a genuine friendship than today. Africa was an essential component of global policy, he said. The failure or success of Africa affected the rest of the world. President Mugabe said Africa was embarking on a program of economic structural adjustment, political reforms and regional integration. Good governance had been accepted as vital throughout Africa as democracy could not be complete without it. He said those African countries that had demonstrated seriousness about their political and economic reforms deserved support and cooperation more than ever before.
