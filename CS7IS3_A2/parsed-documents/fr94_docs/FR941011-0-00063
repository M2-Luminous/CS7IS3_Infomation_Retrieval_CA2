FR941011-0-00063 FR941011-0-00017 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 45 CFR Part 801 Voting Rights Program AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Final rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is establishing a new office for filing applications or complaints under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended. The Attorney General has determined that this designation is necessary to enforce the guarantees of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments to the Constitution. This amendment establishes Barbour County, Alabama, as a new office for filing applications or complaints. DATES: This rule is effective October 11, 1994. In view of the need for its publication without an opportunity for prior comment, comments will still be considered. To be timely, comments must be received on or before November 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send or deliver comments to Stephanie J. Peters, Attorney, Office of Personnel Management, Room 7350, 1900 E Street NW., Washington, DC. 20415. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephanie J. Peters, (202) 606&hyph;1920. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Attorney General has designated Barbour County as an additional examination point under the provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended. She determined on October 6, 1994, that this designation is necessary to enforce the guarantees of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments to the Constitution. Accordingly, pursuant to section 6 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 1973d, OPM will appoint Federal Examiners to review the qualifications of applicants to be registered to vote and Federal Observers to observe local elections. Under §553(b)(3)(B) of title 5 of the United States Code, the Director finds that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking. The notice is being waived because of OMP's legal responsibilities under 42 U.S.C. 1973e(a) and other parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, which require OPM to publish counties certified by the U.S. Attorney General and location within these counties where citizens can be federally listed and become eligible to vote, and where Federal observers can be sent to observe local elections. Under §553(d)(3) of title 5 of the United States Code, the Director finds that good cause exists to make this amendment effective in less than 30 days. The regulation is being made effective immediately in view of the pending election to be held in the subject county, where Federal observers will observe the election under the authority of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it adds one new location to the list of counties in the regulations concerning OPM's responsibilities under the Voting Rights Act.
