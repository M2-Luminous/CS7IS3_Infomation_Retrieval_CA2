It is unthinkable that in a civilized country a government should be elected fraudulently and thereafter expect recognition and to be treated with respect. This is how the president of the People's Representative Council and CP leader, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg, reacted even before the ballot boxes had been locked and large-scale election fraud and irregularities had been exposed. Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg had at that stage already been insisting that the election be declared null and void, "as a result of the more than desired number of atrocious irregularities; because of the fact that the Independent Electoral Commission proved to be totally inefficient in doing the job; and that most of the parties have expressed their dissatisfaction. In such circumstances an election cannot be labelled free and fair, especially if measured by Western standards as has always been the case thus far in South Africa. Hence the intended and anticipated peace will also not materialize." According to Dr. Hartzenberg, this process has only been intended to put a communist ANC government in place, irregardless of the methods employed or how irregular the process has been. "Because the future of 13 nations is at stake, the cost of the recent abortive election must not be regarded as a restraining factor when a further election is deemed necessary. The CP therefore demands that the legitimate demands of all interested parties and nations be considered all over again, so that a satisfactory compromise can be reached before any other election is convened. The constitution's shortcomings must also be eliminated and the incompetent IEC be replaced by the Department of Home Affairs. An election must then be arranged on an ethnic basis for those nations which so prefer." According to Dr. Hartzenberg, the events during the election prove that the CP was right in its decision not to participate in it. "The CP's predictions relating to the forced time scales and the warnings regarding the incompetence of the IEC seem to have been correct." Meanwhile, leader of the HNP [Reformed National Party], Mr. Jaap Marais, has threatened to challenge the validity of elections in court. He said in a statement that the authenticity of the election was out of the question, since the lack of proper administration led to corruption and fraud. "The result can definitely not be accepted in South Africa, neither can it be recognized internationally. Mr. Marais added that the statement by the IEC on the legality of the election is invalid.
