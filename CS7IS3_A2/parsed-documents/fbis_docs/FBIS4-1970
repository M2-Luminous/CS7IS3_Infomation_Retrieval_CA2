These personnel will be trained in such fields as modern enterprise management, foreign trade and commerce, finance and insurance, real estate development, urban construction projects management, revenue and taxes, auditing, international law and foreign trade, rural economy management, tourism, foreign languages and computer technology. Candidates to be trained will be professionals with a college degree and those with intermediate professional titles as well as management personnel and technicians who have a bachelor's degree. Beijing municipal adult education officials said that by 1997, more than one million people will have to change their jobs. The job-switchers will get training at local vocational schools and radio and television universities. The local economy in Beijing, including the rural areas, has been growing as one of the fastest in China. On-the-job training has become increasingly urgent in some enterprises and rural ventures. There are so far more than 170 adult vocational higher education institutions in the city, and more than 3,500 other kinds of training centers. Last year, a total of 3.01 million people received adult education and on-the-job training, officials said.
