This, despite the different positions and views in the occupied territories on the interim stage agreement. The timing of the agreement and dialogue confirm the depth of the realization by the various Palestinian national forces, whether those supporting or opposing the Oslo accord, that a new stage has begun in the life of our Palestinian people and that we are standing on the threshold of a new reality, which makes it incumbent on all to shoulder their national and historic responsibility. This, at a time when the occupied territories' sons are getting ready to set up the first Palestinian self-governing authority and hoping that this development will be a prelude to ending the occupation and building an independent Palestinian state. From this premise, the comprehensive national dialogue derives immense significance. This dialogue, which relies on a firm basis of crucial common denominators linking the sons of one people, and which is based on democratic traditions reinforced by long years of struggle, should lead to the enhancement of Palestinian unity and spare it the dangers of fragmentation and infighting in the coming new stage. This stage requires every Palestinian effort to be directed toward construction. It also requires moving the new reality toward consolidating the Palestinian national authority and translating Palestinian aspirations for freedom and independence into tangible and responsible steps leading to the realization of this goal. At a time when the Palestinians in general, and the occupied territories' sons in particular, expect the current dialogue to produce positive results that remove from the Palestinian arena the elements of weakness and enhance unity in confronting the new reality, we hope that the various Palestinian national forces will translate the slogans of unity and democracy into steps that strengthen those that have already been taken. Moreover, we hope that the pace of this translation will not only be in harmony with our approach to the new reality, but will approach this reality with a firm Palestinian body, able to confront the various developments and capable of waging the battle of construction with the same resolve that it showed in its long march toward freedom and independence.
