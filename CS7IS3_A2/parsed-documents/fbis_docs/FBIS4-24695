This means a major breakthrough made by Anshan city in reforming the system concerning the ownership of state-owned assets. By the end of last year, Anshan set up a total of 18 limited liability stock companies whose shares were partly held by the state. Three of the companies raising capital stocks from the public and selling shares to the public were listed; and 15 companies were raising capital stocks from fixed directions, with capital stocks totaling over 1 billion yuan, of which, 45 percent was held by the state. Judging from the experiments, however, some problems remain in the fields of further changing the operating mechanism of enterprises on the basis of the shareholding system, enabling enterprises to assume responsibility for their own profits or losses, and enabling holders of the same amount of shares to enjoy the same rights and same profits. Conspicuous manifestation is that state shares cannot participate in market operation and cannot be circulated, thus being unfavorable to the activation of state capital and to the optimization of industrial structure. For this reason, Anshan city has mapped out programs on operation and management of state shares, has established property right exchange organs, and is preparing for the form of exchanging stocks behind the counter. The Anshan Automatic Control Instrument Group Limited Company and the Wuhuan Industrial Limited Company, side A of this stock transaction in Anshan, respectively transferred out 4 million and 6 million state shares (ordinary shares) valued at 4 million and 6 million yuan. Each share was sold at the ratio of 1 to 1.1 to side B, the Anshan City Trust and Investment Limited Company. The Anshan Automatic Control Instrument Group Limited Company and the Wuhuan Industrial Limited Company are share-holding enterprises with good management results and high social reputation in Anshan city. The former generated more than 10 million yuan in profits last year, with an increase margin of 105 percent, and the latter developed rapidly and drew more dividends in the past two years. The Anshan City Trust and Investment Limited Company is an enterprise gaining handsome profits through the stock market. Both buying and selling sides of this dealing are strong players in the stock market.
