The public security organs are analyzing deeply the causes and backgrounds of the crimes, intensifying their investigations to crack the cases, and striving to check the increase in kidnapping activities in order to guarantee social stability and to ensure the smooth development of reform and opening up. According to materials provided by the police, in the last few years, kidnapping cases have increased substantially. In particular, such cases have doubled and redoubled in the coastal areas and in Guangdong's Zhujiang Delta. For example, in the first quarter of last year, the kidnapping cases handled by the procuratorial organs in Shanghai alone increased by 50 percent over the previous year; and in the first half of last year, more than 200 kidnapping cases occurred in Guangdong, including 54 cases in Guangzhou, or 125 percent of the figure in the previous year, and 52 cases in Foshan, or 550 percent of the figure in the previous year. According to the mainland police, in the first four months of this year, at least two major kidnapping cases occurred every month, and most of such cases occurred in Guangdong. Gangsters in the mainland mainly kidnap individual business proprietors, private entrepreneurs, and businessmen from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. They demand from several tens of thousands of yuan to several hundred thousand yuan ransom. In some cases, the kidnappers even demand several million or over 10 million yuan. For example, the most serious kidnapping case over the past more than 40 years occurred in Guangdong in April 1993. Six kidnappers kidnapped the director of an aluminum product factory and his wife in Nanhai City, Guangdong, and demanded ransom of 10 million yuan. The victims were robbed of their Lexus car, Rolex wristwatch, gold jewelry, cellular phone, and other belongings with a total worth of more than 1 million yuan when being kidnapped. As another example, the police in Fuzhou City cracked a kidnapping case in April this year in which the boss of a karaoke lounge was kidnapped and the kidnappers demanded $400,000 in ransom. In another case, a Hong Kong businessmen, who invested in a number of projects in the mainland, was kidnapped by four armed gangsters last January in Shenzhen, and 800,000 yuan ransom was demanded. Then, in April this year, the Hong Kong boss of a metal plant in Shenzhen's Nanshan was kidnapped by four gangsters, who demanded 200,000 yuan ransom. According to information from the cracked cases, many kidnappers acted in an organized way, and the crime syndicates bore the character of secret societies. They collaborated closely through division of work; acted surreptitiously; and in some cases even possessed firearms. They also used cellular phones, pagers, cars, and other modern means of communication and transportation in the act. The kidnappers were cruel and merciless in their treatment of their victims, and often recklessly killed them. For example, the police cracked a case late last year in which the son of a criminal police team leader in Liaoyuan City was kidnapped and killed; the Daya Bay Public Security Bureau cracked a case in March this year in which an individual business proprietor was kidnapped for 3.6 million yuan ransom and was later killed; and the police in Zhuhai City recently cracked a case in which a Macao businessman was kidnapped in Gongbei for 360,000 Hong Kong dollars ransom and was later killed. A more shocking fact was that cases of youngsters being kidnapped by youngsters occurred from time to time. In late 1993, in the suburbs of Yancheng, Jiangsu, in order to extort 50,000 yuan from a rich family, three young people from 14 to 16 years of age kidnapped a nine-year-old boy by imitating the plot of a videotape. In March this year, an 18-year-old secondary school student in Xixia County, Henan, even kidnapped a 12-year-old boy for 60,000 yuan ransom, and the victim, who was the son of a police officer of the county's public security bureau, was later killed by the kidnapper. However, "the net of Heaven has a large mesh, but it lets off nothing evil--justice has a long arm." Most kidnapping cases were cracked by the public security personnel, and most kidnappers were brought to justice. In the first eight months of last year, more than 30 kidnappers were arrested, tried, and sentenced in Guangdong. Five of them were sentenced to death; two were sentenced to death with suspension; two were sentenced to life imprisonment; and seven were sentenced to imprisonment of various terms. Capital punishment was inflicted on all four kidnappers in the most serious kidnapping case involving 10 million yuan ransom in Guangdong.
