A highly placed Western source here said on Friday that Choe, who flew into Beijing last March 6, met Jiang on Thursday morning to exchange opinions on ways to expand economic cooperation between South Korea and China. "We understand that during the meeting Choe asked for and gained the Chinese Government's positive support for the refinery project being promoted in a joint venture with the China National Petrochemical Corp. and Shenzhen municipality," the source said. He added that the meeting between Choe, who serves as president of the Federation of Korean Industries, and Jiang lasted about 30 minutes and that Choe left for Korea after the talks. Sunkyong and the two Chinese partners have agreed to build a 1.5 billion dollar refinery capable of producing 100,000 barrels a day in Shenzhen. Sunkyong is to invest 40 percent of the capital. "We believe the refinery project has virtually been fixed with Choe's meeting with Jiang," the source said. "A formal contract could be signed timed with President Kim Yong-sam's visit here beginning March 26."
