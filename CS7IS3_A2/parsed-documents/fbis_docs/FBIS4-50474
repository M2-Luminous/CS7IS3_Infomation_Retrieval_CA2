Wang Qichao, member of the Standing Committee and secretary of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the provincial party committee, delivered a report entitled "Carry Out a Deep-Going, Sustained, and Even More Effective Anticorruption Struggle to Serve the Province's Reform, Development, and Stability." Wang Qichao reviewed the unfolding of the anticorruption struggle and building of party work style and clean administration in the province since it implemented the guidelines of the second enlarged meeting of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission. He pointed out: The province's anticorruption work showed a good tendency and healthy progress, basically satisfying the central authorities and the provincial party committee's demands in the previous stage. First, leading cadres' integrity and self-discipline were strengthened. Party and government leading bodies at or above county or department level generally held democratic meetings, during which 96 percent of the leading cadres carried out self-examination and self-correction with [words instinct] emotion. Most cadres conscientiously dealt with and corrected, in accordance with relevant provisions, mistakes exposed in their self-examination. For instance, 340 enterprise cadres with a second job had given up one of their jobs, 2,031 cadres turned in a total of 670,000 yuan in gift money and coupons they received and accepted during official activities, and 357 cadres returned credit cards they had kept for personal use. Second, discipline inspection, supervision, and examination organs at all levels cracked a number of serious cases of law and discipline violation through concerted efforts. In the latter half of last year, discipline inspection and supervision organs received and handled 42,256 letters and visits from the masses, a 109.9-percent increase over the first half of the year; placed 1,988 discipline violation cases on file for investigation and corrective action, up 43 percent; and punished 2,351 party-member cadres, up 88.7 percent. Of the cadres punished, 645 were expelled from the party or discharged from public employment, 79 were removed from official positions, and 486 were placed on probation within the party. Third, some progress was made in special rectification work, such as clearing up illegal fees, economic entities set up by party and government organs, overseas and out-of-country trips, and reckless distribution of gift money and coupons. The provincial government abolished 310 unreasonable fees in two batches, while relevant departments at the provincial level and various cities, prefectures, and counties scrapped 1,226 self-imposed fees. Wang Qichao pointed out: In carrying out anticorruption work this year, the province should take proper, unremitting charge of three tasks to strive for fresh results in the next stage: 1. to further take good charge of leading cadres' integrity and self-discipline. While continuously implementing the five provisions put forward by the central authorities last year on leading cadres' integrity and self-discipline, we should earnestly enforce the five new provisions forwarded and reiterated by the central authorities this year; 2. to intensify efforts in handling cases and sternly punish corrupt elements; 3. to take good charge of special rectification work and the work to rectify unhealthy practices.
