FBIS4-4339 "dreas062_d_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-062 Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 South Korea Russia Assumes Responsibility for Soviet Loans Russia Assumes Responsibility for Soviet Loans SK3003085394 Seoul YONHAP in English 0819 GMT 30 Mar 94 SK3003085394 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, March 30 (YONHAP) -- Moscow agreed to assume responsibility for repaying all South Korean loans, including commodity and bank loans, to the former Soviet Union at a working-level meeting with Seoul that closed here on Tuesday. In November 1992, Russia agreed to repay all commodity loans South Korea had extended to the former Soviet Union. But the two countries differed on how and when Russia should repay the loans, agreeing only to meet again in the near future. Assistant Finance Minister Yim Chang-yol, who headed the South Korean delegation to the meeting, said Russia had insisted on a moratorium on the loans, refusing to accept South Korea's offer to take repayment of the loans in kind, such as in industrial materials. South Korea will push for another meeting on the matter in May, he added. Russia proposed that South Korea grant a moratorium similar to the one provided for under an agreement reached with the Paris Club of 19 advanced nations in April last year. But, Korea rejected the proposal, saying it cannot allow a Paris-Club-type moratorium since Korea is not a Paris Club member. Under the agreement it made with the Paris Club, Russia must repay half of the Paris Club nations' loans to the former Soviet Union outstanding as of the end of 1992 by September 1993 and the rest in five years after a two-year grace period.
