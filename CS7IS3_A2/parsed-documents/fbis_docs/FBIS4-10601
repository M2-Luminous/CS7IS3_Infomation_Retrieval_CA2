Shortly before departing for Marrakech, Morocco, where the signing of the Final Document of the Uruguay Round of GATT is scheduled to take place, the secretary of commerce and industrial development said that "the agreements of the Uruguay Round will be crucial in promoting world trade of goods and services, as well as in facilitating the flow of capital and the transfer of technology." The GATT will reportedly go into effect on 1 January 1995. Serra highlighted that "the creation of this new framework for world trade complements Mexico's free trade agreements with other countries." Additionally, Serra stressed that "the Uruguay Round will considerably improve expectations for a more favorable international arena, creating jobs and greater business opportunities for Mexican exporters." The basic objective of Mexico's participation in the Uruguay Round, he said, was to obtain at the multilateral level stable and safe access for our exports to international markets, in reciprocity for the autonomous measures of trade liberalization adopted in the last few years. According to the GATT Secretariat, world trade of merchandise will increase 12.4 percent between 1995 and 2005 as a result of the agreements reached at the round, generating an annual increase in the world's gross domestic product of $230 billion for the same period. In this regard, the secretary of commerce and industrial development affirmed that Mexico has the potential to increase its participation in world trade because the country has a comparative advantage in some sectors where growth is predicted, particularly textiles, clothing, agriculture products, prepared foodstuffs, and beverages. Serra remarked that "political stability and international security depend on the permanent generation of wealth through international trade and the equitable distribution of that wealth. The changes undertaken by most countries pose great challenges to the world society. The process of globalization requires a trade system that facilitates the exchange of goods and services to permit all countries to benefit from the scientific, technological, and cultural contributions that appear in the different areas of the world," Serra concluded.
