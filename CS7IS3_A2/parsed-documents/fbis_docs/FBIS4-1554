The China Foreign Exchange Trading Centre will be used mainly by the head offices of China's foreign-exchange banks. And any of the country's 18 domestic and 100 overseas-funded banks that conduct foreign exchange business can become a member, said Yang Gonglin of the State Administration of Exchange Control. Member banks will offer rates tied closely to the previous day's closing price of the US dollar on the inter bank market. This marks a major departure from the practice over the past three months, when the central bank published daily foreign exchange rates based on average prices among the country's 18 major swap markets. Exchange banks could then buy or sell hard currency at the central bank rate. Analysts say the inter-bank foreign exchange market is a major step forward in the country's reforms. It would pave the way for China to make the renminbi freely convertible on current accounts within six years. The central bank will be able to influence the renminbi's foreign exchange rate by buying and selling hard currency on the market. The Shanghai-based market has been in trial operation since March 1, but only US and Hong Kong dollars have been traded. Ten major cities are to be added to the network that currently includes Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Shenzhen. Besides spot trading, the forward and futures trading of foreign exchange will also be conducted in the market in the future. Yang said the State is considering retaining the existing swap markets to serve foreign-funded ventures. Since there is no need for foreign funded companies to sell their foreign exchange earnings to banks, they trade their hard currency on the swap markets. Yang also said the government will publish more foreign exchange regulations in the next few months. They will cover the management of the inter-bank market and of foreign exchange accounts. All domestic firms are required to sell their foreign exchange earnings to banks. They can buy foreign exchange directly from banks by showing valid certificates. Foreign exchange in capital accounts will still be kept under strict control, Yang said. And although some problems may arise, he added, the government will deal with them in time. He called on enterprises and all social sectors to be patient and co-operate with the government to ensure the reform goes smoothly. And he said China has made great strides in its foreign-exchange control system since January. These include eliminating the dual track exchange system, phasing out foreign exchange certificates (FEC), abolishing enterprises' proportional retention of foreign exchange and carrying out a bank settlement system.
