ANC Chairman Thabo Mbeki said that he would take right-wing proposals for constitutional amendments to the 26-member National Working Committee today. Meanwhile ANC media spokesman Carl Niehaus has said that the organization does not fear outright civil war. He was commenting on remarks by Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] co-leader General Constand Viljoen in an SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] television interview last night. Gen. Viljoen said that an uprising could be unavoidable if a volkstaat [homeland] was not proclaimed before the election.
