Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR]. H.E. Gen. Than Shwe and his delegation were accorded an honorable welcome by H.E. President Nouhak Phoumsavan and the Lao people in all places they visited. H.E. Gen. Than Shwe and the delegation called on Khamtai Siphandon, chairman of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee, in a cordial and friendly atmosphere. They also visited various places of economic, historic, and cultural significance in the capital, Vientiane Province, and Luang Prabang Province. Official talks between H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of the LPDR and delegation, and H.E. Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of the SLORC of the Union of Myanmar, and delegation were held at the Hokham Presidential Office in Vientiane. The two sides informed each other of outstanding situations in their respective countries during their talks, which proceeded in a good atmosphere of profound friendship and mutual understanding. They also exchanged views on international issues of common interest. The two sides expressed satisfaction over the increasing development of good relations of friendship and cooperation between the two countries of Laos and Myanmar. This development has been shown concretely through the exchanges of high-level delegations, the exchanges of visits between the peoples, and the settlement of various problems between the two countries on the basis of sincerity and mutual understanding. Noteworthy is that following the visit, the Government of the LPDR and the Government of the Union of Myanmar have jointly signed three agreements -- namely the agreement on tourism cooperation between governments of the two countries, the agreement on the establishment of joint commission for bilateral cooperation, and the agreement between Government of the LPDR and Government of the Union of Myanmar on the permanent international boundary between the two countries along the Mekong River. These three agreements serve as a firm basis and mark a historical milestone for the further and fruitful enhancement, promotion, and expansion and the long duration of the existing, good relations of friendship and cooperation between Laos and Myanmar. The signing of the three agreements has proved the intention and desire of the two sides to promote and strengthen the relations and cooperation between the two countries on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and complete respect of each other's sovereignty. The success of the SLORC chairman of the Union of Myanmar and his delegation during this official visit to the LPDR marks the opening of a new era -- an era for the further strengthening, ever more profoundly and extensively, the relations and cooperation between the two countries and the fraternal friendship and affection between the two peoples of Laos and Myanmar. The Lao people would like to wholeheartedly hail the glorious success of the visit on this occasion. They pledge to do their utmost, together with the Myanmar people, to contribute to further developing the existing, good relations of friendship and cooperation between the two countries and fruitfully implementing the agreements on cooperation in various fields as already signed by the governments of the two countries. This will bring about concrete benefit to the two peoples of Laos and Myanmar and contribute to promoting and establishing peace, stability, friendship, and cooperation for development in this region and the rest of the world.
