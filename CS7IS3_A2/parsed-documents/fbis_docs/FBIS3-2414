Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Chief Secretary Anson Chan will lobby for unconditional renewal of China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status when she visits Washington. Jenny Lam reports: [Begin recording] [Lam] The chief secretary will set out to the Americans the importance to Hong Kong of unconditional renewal of China's most-favored-nation trading status, in Washington and New York. [Chan] We don't think that in principle it is right to use trade as a tool to achieve other objectives. [Lam] The U.S. wants China to show improvements in human rights before deciding whether MFN can be renewed in June. But for Hong Kong no MFN means up to 75,000 jobs here may be lost. The blow will be even more devastating if Chinese trade is in jeopardy not only with the U.S. but with the European Union as well. Trade restrictions which apply to all 12 member states of the Union will replace national ones next week. China will have her quota cut on seven types of products, including 20 percent in the toy industry. [Etienne Reuter of European Union Office in Hong Kong, identified by screen caption] Given that out of a total of more than 7,000 national restrictions in the world, 4,700 concerned China, I would say that the trade with China is probably the most, you know, concerned with this issue. [Lam] Britain was the only country in the Union which voted against slapping trade restrictions on China. The British ambassador to China [Sir Robin McLaren] made clear his country is keen to maintain a cordial relationship with Beijing despite political differences: [McLaren] The British Government attaches enormous importance to this area as a whole and is devoting, and I'm sure will continue to devote, a great deal of diplomatic effort to it, and I'm sure that that will continue after 1997, just as the British government will continue to attach enormous importance to Hong Kong after 1997. [Lam] Sir Robin added that so far, Sino-British trade is business as usual, with no sign of Britain being singled out for discrimination. Jenny Lam, TVB News. [end recording]
