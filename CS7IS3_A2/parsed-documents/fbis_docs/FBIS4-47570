It has a microprocessor inside. This little ``bean'' is called a self-contained electrostimulator (AES). It's a unique article--you can't find anything else like it in the world--that came into being through the joint efforts of medical specialists (chiefly surgeons) and electronic specialists over a decade ago. But only doctors and patients of the elite clinic of the Health Ministry's Main Administration No. 4 knew about it. Today the AES is becoming available to simple mortals. Electrostimulation has already been used extensively for a long time in different areas of medicine. But it was a long time before the simple of idea that the body needed to be acted upon by electric pulses from within came into someone's mind. It was this idea that was brought to life by the creators of this electronic pill--the AES. As we know, the central nervous system generates certain pulses with which all organs are controlled. The moment some breakdown, or ``error'', occurs in this body control system, a particular disease arises. The task of the AES is to travel through the whole body (10 meters of intestines) in 25-36 hours, find the damaged or ``sleeping'' components, and awaken them--activate them and restore their operation by means of electric pulses. After this the capsule is eliminated from the body in the natural way. This electronic pill was initially intended for use chiefly in surgery. The probability of complications--paralysis or paresis of the intestine--is high after any complex abdominal operation. Surgeons know all too well how high mortality following such complications is. Consequently it was no accident that several of our most prominent surgeons (including Academician Petrovskiy at the Surgical Institute and Professor Lukomskiy at Medical Institute No. 1) were among the first to actively begin using the AES in therapeutic practice. Having undergone the required clinical tests in the country's leading clinics, the AES began to be used in the Fourth Administration's closed clinics in 1984. The cherished capsules were made at a certain military plant in limited quantities, because they are very expensive, as is true by the way of any complex microelectronic device. Nonetheless, over a period of 10 years the pill was used around 2 million times to treat thousands of patients. Among its regular users were certain ``ruling elite'' whose faces were seen every day on official documentary footage. No side effects were established for the AES. And new miraculous properties of the magic capsule were continually discovered. It was found that the besides having a local effect on the most highly damaged components (parts of the intestine, the liver, or duct systems), the AES has a powerful influence upon the entire body as a whole, in a sense enlivening some ``sleeping'' forces in the individual. The body undergoes detoxification--wastes are eliminated from it. Circulation improves, and immunity and performance increase. In serious stressful situations the electronic pill relieves depression and fatigue, and raises vital tone. It is therefore absolutely no surprise that the capsules were so popular among our elderly government officials. Prolonged use of the AES confirmed that stimulation helps to reveal chronic prostatitis complicated by impotency. Research conducted by Professor Balabolink at the Endocrinology Institute revealed that lipid metabolism indicators normalize in the presence of sugar diabetes (the non-insulin dependent form). One of the most important results of the work of the electronic pill is its positive effect upon hypertension and atherosclerosis. Finally, the AES proved itself to be indispensable in military field surgery and in emergency medicine--there are times when only the stimulator can revive a person from a coma or shock. Let me emphasize one more time: The AES does not introduce anything foreign into the body, anything alien to it, because the pulses the pill produces already exist in the individual, and are generated by our nervous system. Research on electrostimulation is continuing. Judging from everything, new surprises await us in the future. But it is already clear that the AES affects aging processes. There are serious grounds for suggesting that it can and must be used to prevent oncological diseases. It is becoming increasingly more obvious to medical specialists that the electronic pill is essentially needed by everyone. Nonetheless, the future of this miracle of micro-engineering is under great doubt. As often happens in our country with any innovation, the electronic capsules are having a hard time making their way to the people. The O.K. to make wide use of the AES was obtained with the help of the Medical Equipment Administration of the Russian Ministry of Health. But the Fourth Administration--the chief user of the electronic pill--no longer exists. Practically no one in other clinics knows about it, and hospitals don't even have enough money for the most elementary medicines, not to mention microelectronics. Converted enterprises of the military-industrial complex have lost their former might, and each day new problems are faced in production of the electrostimulators, which is currently being conducted by the Ecomed Scientific-Production Association. The existence of the AES has already long been known beyond the borders of our fatherland, and the innovation has been given its proper assessment. It is fully possible to sell the discovery there--buyers could be found right now. And no one would be especially amazed by such a sale--the world has already become accustomed to our practice of selling off our unique technologies and inventions generously for a pittance. However, today's creators of the electronic pill, who invested many years of their lives into it and who are deeply convinced that this is to be the medicine of the 21st century, stubbornly want to save their invention for Russian fellow citizens. Such are the strange people who are caring for this fabulous electronic bean.
