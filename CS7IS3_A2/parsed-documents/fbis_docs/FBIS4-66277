In response to these requests, the editorial department has invited the Ministry of Machine Building and Electronics' Economic Regulation and State Assets Oversight departments to write a series of articles on the new tax system, which we are carrying here successively for reference by our large numbers of readers. In the new tax system that went into effect at the beginning of 1994, what actually are the new features? The new parts are in contrast to the old system. Our former industrial and commercial tax system was formed after the 1984 substitution of taxes for profits and the overall reform of industrial and commercial taxes and profits, being a multi-tax and -profit, multi-link, and multi-level compound tax system with 32 tax caegories, the major ones being the flow and income taxes, complemented by related auxiliary tax categories. But it was not adaptable to our socialist market economy development, being hard to play the proper regulatory role in the area of dealing with the distribution relations among the state, enterprises, and individuals and between the center and localities, which was adverse to the formation of China's large uniform market and the implementation of our state industrial policy. The new tax system reforms old-system defects, such as nonuniform tax laws and tax administration, a too complicated tax system, too many and indiscriminate tax preferences, and an ever-growing gap between nominal tax rates and real tax burdens, so will be bound to bring stability and prosperity to economic activities, mainly as follows: --It will contribute to fair tax burdens, promoting equal competition. The former enterprise income tax categories were set up with tax rates varying by respective ownership systems, with large- and medium-sized state enterprises subject to a 55-percent proportional [flat] tax rate, private enterprises subject to a 35-percent flat tax rate, and small state enterprises and collective enterprises subject to an eight-grade progressive tax rate for excess income. The new tax system sets the enterprise income tax rate at 33 percent, while giving the proper consideration to small enterprises with smaller annual incomes by setting two additional lower tax rates, to consolidate the tax laws and regulations for domestic-invested enterprises [DIEs]. As enterprises of all ownership systems use the same financial accounting principles, when calculating income taxes, they all adjust taxable income based on the provisions of the income tax laws and regulations, with the tax provisions on reductions and exemptions also becoming more consistent, thus consolidating taxable income criteria. While the former flow tax system included the three tax categories of value-added taxes, product taxes, and business taxes, the new flow tax system uses a dual regulatory system of general regulation through value added taxes and special regulation through consumption taxes in coordination with business taxes, overcoming the old tax system's irrational phenomena, such as duplicate collections and overlapping regulatory functions. As the new tax system consolidates the internal and external flow tax system, as well as gradually consolidating other internal and external tax categories, it paves the way for the operation of a uniform and equal tax policy in the same market climate for DIEs and FIEs of all economic-ownership components. -- It will help to rationalize the distribution relations among the state, enterprises, and individuals. Certain too high tax rates in the old tax system were hard for enterprises to bear, with its host of preferential policies hard for the revenue sector to deal with. Local governments and responsible departments also used various pretexts to collect sizeable amounts from enterprises through means, such as management fees, various funds, and set-asides. Contract-enterprise income taxes made enterprise income taxes exist in name only, as well as making for a confusing dual status for the state as both public manager and state-enterprise assets owner. The new tax system eliminates income-tax contracting, contributing to the conversion of both enterprise operating forces and government functions. The new tax system eliminates the "state enterprise regulatory tax" and the collection from state enterprises of state transportation and priority construction funds and state budget-regulation funds, not only lightening enterprise burdens, but also changing this nonstandard distribution form between the state and enterprises. For instance, the state-enterprise income tax rate had reached 55 percent, with some having to pay profit-regulation taxes, causing enterprise difficulties that forced the adoption of tax-reduction and -exemption measures, causing a phenomenon of high tax rates, many preferences, a narrow tax base, and low tax burdens, and eroding the tax base to cause a large loss of revenue. The new tax system will change this situation of reductions by the state and enterprise insustainability. In the old tax system, as to individual income taxes, foreigners were subject to the "Individual Income Tax Law," Chinese citizens to the "Interim Regulatons on Individual Income Regulation Taxes," and individual industrial and commercial household operations to the "Intermim Regulations on Urban and Rural Individual Industrial and Commercial Household Operation Income Taxes," with three taxes coexisting. This was hard to interpret in both legislation and execution, as well as being out of line with international practice. The new tax system provides for individual income taxes to be collected mainly on higher incomes, with lower or no taxes on middle and low incomes, helping to regulate the personal income gap, as well as alleviating the conflict of social distribution injustice. --It will help to delimit central and local revenue and tax management jurisdiction, to meet the needs of tax sharing. As the market role in the disposition of resources has expanded steadily, the flaws of the former revenue package system have grown ever-more evident. The division of tax categories in the new tax system considers not only income distribution between the center and localities, but also the regulatory impact of taxation on economic development and social distribution. All legislative authority for central taxes, jointly-shared taxes, and local taxes is concentrated in the center, to ensure uniform central government decrees, and to preserve a nationally uniform market and equal enterprise competition. The taxation uses graded collection, with central and shared taxes collected by the central tax agency, the local share of shared taxes deposited directly into local treasuries by the central tax agency, and local taxes collected by local tax departments. This will help economically developed regions to continue to maintain a faster growth momentum while, through central-revenue return and transfer payment of taxes to localities, supporting the development of economically backward regions and the upgrading of old industrial bases. --The new tax system streamlines and standardizes tax categories. The elimination of tax categories not suited to economic development, merging of duplicate tax categories, and installation of certain necessary tax categories, will contribute to tax-system simplification and efficiency. For instance, we have switched all of the products previously subject to product taxes to value added taxes, as well as selecting 11 products, such as tobacco, alcohol, cosmetics, expensive jewelry, and small motor vehicles, for collection of consumption taxes in addition to value added taxes, to reflect the principle of essentially maintaining the previous tax burden. The new system's business taxes have been expanded appropriately to include not only DIEs and units, such as state, collective, and private enterprises, and operations by Chinese citizens, but also FIEs and foreign enterprises. While the old business-tax collection scope involved secondary industries and all tertiary ones, the new business tax can include in principle operations that provide taxable services, transfers of invisible assets, and sales of real property. The new business-tax taxable items are reduced from 14 to nine, with the 27 tax rates in four grades reduced to nine in two grades. The collection of value added taxes on land can appropriately regulate excessive real estate transaction profits. The urban and rural construction maintenance tax will become one of the key tax categories in the local tax system. Other revisions of tax categories are: 1) we have abolished the rural market transaction, livestock transaction, oilburning special, bonus, and wage regulation taxes; 2) we have made the special consumption tax a consumption tax with a special regulatory role; 3) we have eliminated the collection from FIEs and foreigners of urban real estate and car- and boat-use license taxes, collecting uniform real estate and car-and boat-use taxes, and suitably raising currently too low tax rates and payments; 4) we have devolved authority to localities for slaughtering and banquet taxes; 5) we are collecting inheritance taxes. Through this tax reform, China's new industrial and commercial tax system will have the 17 tax categories of value added, consumption, business, individual income, enterprise income, FIE and foreign-enterprise income, resource, urban land use, land value added, urban and rural construction maintenance, real estate, car and boat, fixed asset investment orientation regulation, stamp, securities transaction, inheritance, and slaughtering taxes.
