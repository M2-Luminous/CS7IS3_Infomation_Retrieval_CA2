States and local jurisdictions are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) from imposing with respect to the premises, facilities, and operations of federally inspected establishments any requirements that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the FMIA or PPIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, impose recordkeeping and other requirements within the scope of section 202 of the FMIA and section 11 of the PPIA, if consistent therewith, with respect to any such federally inspected establishment. States and local jurisdictions are also preempted under the FMIA and the PPIA from imposing any marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirements on federally inspected meat and poultry products that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the FMIA and PPIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, exercise concurrent jurisdiction over meat and poultry products that are outside official establishments for the purpose of preventing the distribution of meat and poultry products that are misbranded or adulterated under the FMIA or PPIA, or, in the case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their entry into the United States. Under the FMIA and PPIA, States that maintain meat and poultry inspection programs must impose requirements that are at least equal to those required under the FMIA and PPIA. The States may, however, impose more stringent requirements on such State inspected products and establishments. No retroactive effect will be given to this proposed rule. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR 306.5 and 381.35 must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this proposed rule, if the challenge involves any decision of a program official. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR parts 335 and 381, subpart W, must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the application of the provisions of this proposed rule with respect to labeling decisions.
