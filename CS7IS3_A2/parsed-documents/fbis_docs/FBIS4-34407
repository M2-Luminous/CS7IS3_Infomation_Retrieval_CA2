Indians who have been protesting against an agrarian development law since 13 June clashed with merchants and residents in the cities of El Tambo and Azogues, Canar Province, 270 km south of Quito, leading the Army to intervene. Journalists from the newspaper EL MERCURIO, which is published in Cuenca, near the place where the incidents took place, told AFP the Indians had "seized" food from stores and markets in El Tambo and Azogues and then tried to boycott the weekly fair this Sunday. The merchants and residents organized themselves and discovered that a large portion of the food seized by the Indians was stored in an Indian community house. They recovered their products and torched the house, leading the Indians to regroup and confront the merchants. As a result, a dozen people were injured, and approximately 10 vehicles were burned. Approximately 1,200 vehicles are trapped north of Cuenca, and Army soldiers repressed Indians with tear gas in the south of Cuenca, near Santa Isabel, 350 km south of Quito. Approximately eight Indians were beaten up in the clashes. The agrarian development law spurred the Indians to protest throughout the Andean and Amazon regions, except in the area north of Quito, where an annual festival is being prepared. The protests consist of highway blockings to impede the shipment of food. The government has ordered the public order forces to avoid confrontations and has not ordered the reopening of the highways. Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen will receive Indian leaders on 20 June to talk about the agrarian law. According to the Indian leaders, such laws provide benefits to business firms and landowners, whose farm products are exported to the detriment of the benefits which the peasants and small landowners used to enjoy.
