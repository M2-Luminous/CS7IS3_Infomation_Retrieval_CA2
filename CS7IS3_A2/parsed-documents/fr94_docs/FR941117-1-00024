FR941117-1-00024 FR941117-1-00004 The facility would be required to have written transfer agreements with one or more hospitals which assure that a resident can be transferred to an appropriate setting in a timely manner when transfer is necessary for more intensive psychiatric care or for medical treatment (proposed §483.220(a)). Necessary information relating to the resident's care would be exchanged at the time of transfer. The facility would also be required to have an effective program for infection control (proposed §483.218(c)). Each resident's dignity would be respected and facilities would be precluded in §483.216, Facility practices and resident behavior, from imposing any physical restraints or administering any psychoactive drugs for purposes of discipline or convenience. All forms of abuse would be forbidden, including verbal, mental, sexual, and physical abuse. Any grouping of residents would be planned to protect the safety and promote the treatment of all group members. The facility would be required to report any alleged abuses to the administrator or to other officials in accordance with State law. Facilities would have to retain evidence of a thorough investigation. Concerning staff qualifications, we would require in §483.214(b) that the facility employ the professional, administrative and support staff necessary to implement the inpatient plans of treatment and to carry out the applicable regulatory requirements. Professional staff could include qualified psychiatrists and other physicians, clinical psychologists, psychiatric nurses, social workers, substance abuse specialists, other health professionals and ancillary staff. We would require that all staff be competent and that professional staff be appropriately licensed, certified, or registered when this is required under State law. We would further require that professional staff not be under sanctions imposed for infractions as specified in sections 1156, 1128, or 1892 of the Act. Services provided by nonemployees would be subject to a written agreement that specifies the facility's and contractor's responsibilities. We invite comments as to whether this section should contain more specific requirements concerning personnel qualifications. We would require that responsible direct care staff be on duty and awake on a 24-hour basis to take prompt action in case of injury, illness, fire, or other emergency in a facility housing residents who are aggressive, assaultive, or security risks (§483.214(a)).
