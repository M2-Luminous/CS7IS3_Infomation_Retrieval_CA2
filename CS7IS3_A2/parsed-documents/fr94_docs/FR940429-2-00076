FR940429-2-00076 FR940429-2-00062 As to Complainant Gray, who had a hearing loss, the ALJ found that he was not substantially limited in his employment opportunities because Commonwealth suspended only one opportunity. Moreover, the ALJ concluded that Congress did not intend to include correctable impairments, such as Gray's hearing loss, in the definition of ``handicapped individual.'' Finally, the ALJ found Commonwealth did not regard Gray as handicapped in that it would have reconsidered him for employment if he had his hearing loss surgically corrected. The ALJ concluded that OFCCP had failed to prove that Gray was handicapped and therefore could not seek individual relief in his behalf. Id. at 12&hyph;15. In addition to individual relief, the ALJ noted that OFCCP sought a cease and desist order and debarment of Commonwealth for violation of its affirmative action duties. He stated that the merits of the contentions relating to five Complainants who did not file complaints could be considered as evidence of a failure to establish an effective affirmative action program. Because Complainant Marshall's hernia was correctable, the ALJ found that he was not handicapped and there was no duty of affirmative action owned to him. Concerning Complainants Matthis, Sherrard and Zellers, the ALJ noted that they had back impairments and, given the contraindications for heavy manual labor positions for these individuals, they are not qualified for the jobs for which they applied. As to Complainant Etnire, who was rejected in 1980 because his x-ray showed a back condition and hired in 1981 after passing a subsequent physical examination, the ALJ stated that at best the evidence shows a mistaken, but apparently good faith belief that he was not qualified for employment in 1980. Id. at 15&hyph;17. Based on the record as a whole, the ALJ found that the evidence was insufficient to establish a violation of Commonwealth's affirmative action duties. In view of the foregoing, he recommended that OFCCP's complaint be dismissed in its entirety. Id., at 17. Discussion I. Conciliation Efforts Although the ALJ did not reach this issue because he recommended dismissal of other grounds, R.D. and O. at n.2, Commonwealth argues that, if the issue is considered, the complaint should be dismissed for OFCCP's failure to conciliate. Commonwealth's Response to OFCCP's Exceptions (Com. Resp.) at 19. While conceding that there were several conferences and negotiations, Commonwealth alleges that of OFCCP generally failed to communicate any offers of settlement to any of the complainants as required by its own Federal Contract Compliance Manual. Com. Resp. at 20&hyph;21. The pertinent section at the time of this action provided the ``[g]enerally, the complainant should not be present during the conciliation sessions. However, the EOS [Equal Oppportunity Specialist] should keep the complainant informed of the progress, in order to gather further input and to discuss proposed settlements.'' Ch. 6&hyph;120.5. Commonwealth contends that this section places OFCCP in a position similar to that of a lawyer who represents his client. Com. Resp. at 21. The first part of the quoted language, however, belies that assertion as it provides the complainant shall not be present, a clear indication that the complainant is a not a party to the action and need not be consulted on settlement matters in the same manner as a client. Rather, the Manual provision is more properly viewed as providing guidance to EOS concerning how to facilitate the conciliation process. As such it confers no rights upon parties to an action under the Act. Cf. OFCCP v. National City Bank of Cleveland. 30 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. [BNA] 6, 9 (Sec'y Final Dec. and Order Sept. 9, 1982) (OFCCP vindicates government interest in terms of contract but does not represent individual complainants or class members). In any event, there is no basis for concluding that the Compliance Manual confers rights upon a Section 503 defendant which could be raised as defense to a Section 503 complaint. Commonwealth also alleges that it was never advised that the conciliation process had reached an impasse except with respect to Complainant Gray and further that OFCCP never explained how the rejection for employment of Complainants Etnire, Marshall, Matthis, Sherrard and Zellers violated Section 503. Id. at 23&hyph;26. Although, as Commonwealth argues, the letter notifying Commonwealth that the complaint was being forwarded for enforcement refers only to Complainant Gray, Defendant's Exhibit (D)&hyph;3, Commonwealth was aware that OFCCP was seeking relief from the other similarly situated individuals in conjunction with Gray's complaint. In its response to the Gray complaint, Commonwealth questioned the connection between the Gray case and the other cases, but nevertheless offered employment opportunities to the other individuals as part of a settlement. See D&hyph;5. There is no evidence that a settlement had been reached as to them. Accordingly, it should have known that the enforcement action would include individuals as well as Gray. As for the alleged failure to explain the violations relative to the other individuals, Commonwealth could have inquiried about the nature of the violations during the conciliation process. For all of the foregoing reasons, I conclude that OFCCP properly discharged its duty to conciliate under 41 CFR 60&hyph;741.26(g)(2).
