Arutyunyan, vice president of the Republic of Armenia. Information on the assistance rendered the work of the competent commissions looking into the circumstances of the loss on the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh of an Iranian C-130 military-transport aircraft and the causes of the tragedy by the Armenian authorities was heard at the session. Profound regret was expressed in connection with the aircraft catastrophe and the human casualties, and it was noted that Armenia was assisting in every way and would continue to assist the investigation of all the circumstances of the loss of the aircraft by specialists who had come from Iran and the competent commission of the CIS Interstate Aviation Committee. The shipment of the remains of the victims of the tragedy from Stepanakert to Yerevan and from there to Tehran has been properly organized also. At the same time it was observed at the session that the disinformation being spread from time to time by certain foreign news media and the biased interpretation of the incident are making this accident a subject of political speculation. It was observed also that many questions still await a definitive answer. According to the specialists from Iran, the C-130 aircraft did not have a "black box." It was ascertained also that the aircraft lost pressure 50 minutes after departure from Moscow and lost 2,400 meters in altitude, but the crew decided not to return to the Moscow airport and continued the flight. The investigation confirms that the aircraft did not enter Armenia's air space at all and did not make contact with Yerevan's air traffic control services, although the latter had attempted to establish communication also via a Russian aircraft, Flight 954, when Georgia's air traffic control reported that the airplane had strayed off course and that communications with it had been lost. It is still not clear why the aircraft deviated abruptly from the flight path on the territory of Georgia and went for quite some time deeper onto the territory of Azerbaijan, losing altitude appreciably (approximately 4,000 meters). At the same time hope was expressed that the answers to all the questions might be obtained after a comprehensive study of the incident by specialists and the competent commissions. Emphasizing the vital need for the establishment of stability and peace in the region, concern was also expressed at the session in connection with the fact that Azerbaijan's frustration of the peacemaking initiatives for a settlement of the Karabakh problem was becoming a cause of the tragedy of the sons not only of the Armenian and Azerbaijani but also--involuntarily--of the friendly Iranian people. A number of current matters concerning Armenian-Iranian economic relations was discussed at the commission session also.
