I. Sevastyanov, USSR pilot-cosmonaut, twice Hero of the Soviet Union, and USSR State Prize laureate, by Valentina Nikiforova: "Once He Told a Parable"; first paragraph is source introduction] [Text] Vitaliy Ivanovich Sevastyanov -- twice Hero of the Soviet Union, USSR pilot-cosmonaut, and USSR State Prize laureate. Little mentioned, but such dear, splendid titles. And a recent title -- people's deputy of Russia. And the current title --candidate for people's deputy of the Federal Assembly, and together with G. Zyuganov and V. Ilyukhin, he is heading the list of the preelection association, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. PRAVDA: Vitaliy Ivanovich, you saw with your own eyes the tragic end of the Supreme Soviet. And once again, you're going into politics. Why? Because of dissatisfaction with your personal life and your social position, or because of a desire to be high profile? Sevastyanov: I'll tell you frankly: out of a sense of social responsibility. And four years ago, which I plunged into my first preelection campaign, I was doing it with that same sense. I didn't have any experience in politics, I just learned it as I went. I knew this: the most important thing is to be honest. Now after three and a half years of work in the Supreme Soviet, I feel an acute need to use the platform of the highest organ of representative authority to explain to the people where we're being taken and what lies ahead. PRAVDA: You could explain without being a member of parliament. You have fame and authority. Sevastyanov: But the possibilities are considerably fewer. And the main thing is that in parliament, you can have a direct effect on the fate of Russia, that is, the actual possibility of either adopting or rejecting a given law. And just look at how many harmful laws we've managed to reject! For example, when they were discussing the legislation on jurors, I told a parable. One great visionary brought to his country a sundial, and the people learned what time it was. They began to appreciate time, they worked better, and the country flourished. The people idolized the dial and decided to erect a temple to it. They raised the walls, and then imbricated the cupola. The sun went away, the shadow disappeared, and the dial didn't work. The people lost track of time and again became disorganized -- devastation came, and the country fell apart. The parable was timely. Seven percent voted for the law on jurors. There it is -- with a majority you can make sensible decisions. The parliament, after all, is not simply a publicist platform -- it's a platform for unification and for promoting a sense of social responsibility for the future of the country among deputies of varying political persuasion. PRAVDA: What would you like to start your work in the State Duma with? Sevastyanov: With a reform of the government. I don't know when the Duma is to assemble, but that has to be done right away. Second, the course of the reforms has to be adjusted in order to stabilize the economic and political situation. Otherwise, a social explosion is unavoidable. And third, perhaps, is parallel to the first two steps -- restore the Fundamental Law (the Constitution) and the laws that were adopted by the Supreme Soviet. The state is the law. If there's no law, there will be repression. PRAVDA: Vitaliy Ivanovich, do you still have ties with NPO Energiya? Sevastyanov: Of course. I'm still in the cosmonaut corps. I work as an instructor and as an experimenter-cosmonaut. We have these slots: a plain cosmonaut, an experimenter-cosmonaut, and a researcher-cosmonaut. In terms of work experience and length of service, there are cosmonaut candidate, cosmonaut, and cosmonaut instructor. And since I've long been an experimenter in the cosmonaut corps, I hold an instructor's position. PRAVDA: Has the political and economic instability also had an effect on the space program, a sector that is so favored by the public, is prestigious, and is, in fact, profitable? Has it affected the Energiya association. Or have they noted no changes there -- things going the way they always did? I mean, our people are still going aloft. Could it be that the talk of difficulties is just a matter of habit, to get a little more from the state for the growth of the sector? Sevastyanov: What? No changes? The funding for the space program has been cut by more than 60 percent. The funding difficulties have forced us to let go several thousand of the most skilled specialists from the enterprise. PRAVDA: Several thousand? Sevastyanov: Yes, several thousand. In our sector, 38 percent of the candidates of science and doctors of science have been let go; they went to commercial structures or went abroad. The Mir station, which has already worked through three service lives, exists and operates to this day as a result of a colossal repair-and-restoration program. But it can't last forever. And they haven't put up a new station -- there's no money. And if the funding isn't opened up in the near future, our consistent work in space will cease. PRAVDA: And that's why it is with such sadness that we recall past records and feats. You, after all, went into space for the first time in 1970, right? Sevastyanov: With Andriyan Nikolayev. Aboard Soyuz-9. We were aloft for 18 days. At that time, after the five-day missions, that was the first long-duration mission; it was an absolute world record for three and a half years, and, in that class of spacecraft, it is a world record to this day. The second time I went aloft was with Petr Klimuk, aboard the Soyuz-18, in 1975; we docked with the Salyut-4 orbital station. We saw the Soyuz-Apollo docking -- we were 110 kilometers above them. And then we returned to the ground after them. PRAVDA: You were born in the Urals and finished school in Sochi. What brought about such a change in location? Sevastyanov: In December 1945, my father was demobilized, and he took me and my mother to Kuban. At first we lived in Maykop, and then in 1948 we moved to Sochi. My parents stayed there. My father died five years ago, and my mother didn't want to move away. PRAVDA: Did your father ever tell you stories about the front? Sevastyanov: Of course. He left on the third day. And spent the entire war in the same 150th Separate Tank Brigade of the High Command Reserve. He fought on several fronts -- near Konev, near Zhukov. He finished the war in Prague. PRAVDA: Did he hold a high rank? Sevastyanov: He was an ordinary enlisted man -- senior sergeant. He drove a tank the whole war. He had the full set of enlisted man awards. That's the history of my father and his fellow soldiers, and I won't allow it to be defiled. That's why I've volunteered to defend the CPSU in the Constitutional Court. PRAVDA: Vitaliy Ivanovich, you're being asked about a lot of things in the preelection meetings. But I would like to ask about the logo of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation in the elections: a crisp, elegant drawing of the hammer and sickle is surrounded by the words "Russia. Fairness. Labor. Power to the People." Sevastyanov: The person behind the logo is the science-fiction artist Andrey Sokolov. I've known him for some 25 years, since he first entered the cosmonaut corps, in which Aleksey Leonov worked. The logo is rectangular. You won't get it mixed up with any other.
