FR940627-0-00203 FR940627-0-00019 (2) Fuels shall be classified pursuant to ยง79.56(e) into categories and groups of similar fuels and fuel additives according to the components and characteristics of such fuels in their uncombusted state. The classification of a fuel product must take into account the components of all bulk fuel additives which are listed in the registration application or basic registration data submitted for the fuel product. (3) Fuel additives shall be classified pursuant to ยง79.56(e) into categories and groups of similar fuels and fuel additives according to the components and characteristics of the respective uncombusted additive/base fuel mixture pursuant to ยง79.51(h)(1). (4) In determining the category and group to which a fuel or fuel additive belongs, impurities present in trace amounts shall be ignored unless otherwise noted. Impurities are those substances which are present through contamination or which remain in the fuel or additive naturally after processing is completed. (5) Reference Standards. (i) American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard D 4814&hyph;93a, ``Standard Specification for Automotive Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel'', used to define the general characteristics of gasoline fuels (paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A)(3) of this section) and ASTM standard D 975&hyph;93, ``Standard Specification for Diesel Fuel Oils'', used to define the general characteristics of diesel fuels (paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A)(3) of this section) have been incorporated by reference. (ii) This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103. Copies may be inspected at U.S. EPA, OAR, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC, 20460 or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. (e) Grouping Criteria. The grouping system is represented by a matrix of three fuel/additive categories within six specified fuel families (see Table F94&hyph;7, Grouping System for Fuels and Fuel Additives). Each category may include one or more groups. Within each group, a representative may be designated based on the criteria in this section and joint registration information may be developed and submitted for member fuels and fuel additives.
