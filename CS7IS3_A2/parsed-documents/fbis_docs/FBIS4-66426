HYCOL is a new furnace that the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) set up as a part of the New Sunshine Project at the Coal-Utilizing Hydrogen Production Research Association's operations laboratory in Sodegaura City, Chiba Prefecture. The furnace, which first went into operation on 14 December 1993, attained the record 1,000 hours of continuous operation that indicates good prospects for its practical application. The new furnace processes 50 tons of coal per day to make 90,000 cubic meters of gas. The gas is 32% hydrogen, 59% carbon monoxide, and 9% carbon dioxide. The gas efficiency, which indicates how much coal energy is taken out as gas energy, is 75%. There are good prospects that with future improvements the furnace's efficiency can reach 78%. Coal gasification furnaces, which produce fuel gas from coal, are attracting attention as a technology for using coal, an abundant resource, for low-polluting, high-efficiency electric power generation by means of fuel cells and the like. However, long-term continuous operation of coal gasification furnaces has been difficult because ash contained within the coal sticks to the furnace. That weak point of coal gasification furnaces was solved in the new furnace: the ash in the coal is turned into glass-like molten ash (slag) that is removed from the furnace. A coal gasification furnace produces hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide from coal by mixing coal particles with a small amount of oxygen and then incompletely burning that mixture to break the carbon-hydrogen bonds and the carbon-carbon bonds that keep coal solid. The new furnace gasifies coal at a higher rate because of the special way the coal particles circle around the furnace. In addition, the new furnace has a feature that was contrived independently in Japan: burners that bring the coal particles and oxygen into the furnace are attached to the top and bottom of the furnace. Coal gasification furnace technologies, such as those based on Texaco's method, Shell's method, and Dow's method, were developed overseas long before. In comparison, though, the AIST thinks that the HYCOL is superior to existing technologies in terms of gasification efficiency and the range of types of coal that it can handle. The AIST will continue on with research to make the furnace practical.
