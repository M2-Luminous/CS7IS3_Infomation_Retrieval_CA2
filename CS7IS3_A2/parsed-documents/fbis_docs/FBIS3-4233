According to figures released by the Finance Ministry, the total volume of value-added tax collected in the first two months of this year amounted to 21.5 billion yuan. Of this amount, the central coffers took 71.1 percent while the local governments shared a total of 28.9 percent, close to the projected sharing ratio of 3:1. Liu Zhongli, finance minister and director of the State Taxation Bureau, expressed satisfaction over the implementation of the revenue-sharing system, which became effective January 1 this year to replace the former turnover tax system. The reform of the taxation system, based on a rational division of responsibilities and rights, was aimed to strengthen the ability of the central government in exercising macro-economic regulation. Liu said the past two months saw a rapid increase in revenue. By the end of February the country's total revenue (excluding debts) was up 32.1 percent over the same period of last year. He said the detailed rules and regulations on implementing the new taxation system issued early this year properly addressed the concerns of foreign-funded enterprises and cleared the doubts of foreign investors -- their total payment of taxes did not increase under the new system. This was done because the additional payment under the new system would then be returned to the foreign-funded enterprises to ensure their original interests, he said. However, he said, this period of "tax compensation" will not exceed five years, and those enterprises founded after January 1 this year will be subject to the new taxation system. As to the value-added tax on land, Liu said it was designed to prevent land speculation, not to discourage foreign investors, especially real estate businessmen engaging in developing residential quarters. He reiterated three governing principles: value-added tax (VAT) will be levied on land, with domestic and overseas investors on an equal footing; land VAT should be unified everywhere in China; and government departments will give consideration to public reaction and formulate relevant regulations. Liu did not give a timetable for promulgating the detailed rules and regulations on levying land vat, but he added they will be made public "as soon as possible".
