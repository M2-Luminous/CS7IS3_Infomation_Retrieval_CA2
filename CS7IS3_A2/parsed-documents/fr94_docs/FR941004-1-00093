FR941004-1-00093 FR941004-1-00018 Section 1357.15(o) Family Preservation and Family Support Services and Linkages to Other Social and Health Services We are proposing in paragraph (o)(1) that the State must provide information specifically on the development and/or expansion of family preservation and family support services; how these services relate to existing family preservation and family support services; and how they link to the child and family services continuum (of which family support and family preservation services, child protective services, foster care and adoption services, reunification services, and independent living services, are a part). Paragraph (o)(2) proposes to require an explanation in the CFSP of whether and/or how CAPTA and ILP funds are coordinated with or integrated into the child and family services continuum. In paragraph (o)(3), we are proposing that the CFSP include a description of how the services in the child and family services continuum are linked to services in other Federal and non-federally funded public and nonprofit private programs, e.g., AFDC, Food Stamps, WIC, child care, health, education, housing, substance abuse, juvenile justice, Children's Trust Funds, and private foundations. In meeting the requirement in paragraph (o)(1), States will use, in part, the information gathered on the availability of family preservation and family support services (ยง1357.15(k)(2)). FY 1995 will be the first year in which all States will be implementing title IV-B family preservation and family support services. Thus, the information in paragraph (o)(1) will provide a national overview of the development, operation, and/or expansion of family preservation and family support services in all States as well as identify the processes States are using to develop coordinated systems of care. We believe it also will provide a picture of implementation efforts and relationships for national evaluation purposes. For similar reasons, we are proposing to request the information in paragraphs (o)(2) and (o)(3) on linkages with other services and service delivery systems. We believe this information will be useful to obtain a clearer understanding of each State's efforts and activities to bring about services linkages both within the child and family services continuum and with other public and privately funded service systems. It will also provide a broader national picture of such efforts. Section 1357.15(p) Services in Relation to Service Principles We are proposing in ยง1357.15(p) that the CFSP describe how the child and family services are designed to assure the safety and protection of children, as well as the preservation and support of families, and the how services in the CFSP are or will be designed to meet the other service principles in 45 CFR 1355.25, e.g., services that are flexible, easily accessible, and respectful of cultural and community strengths. We believe these principles are the basis for the development of effective, responsive, and quality services programs.
