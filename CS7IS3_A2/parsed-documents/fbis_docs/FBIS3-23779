At present, agricultural production and the food industry account for 33.6 percent of the total structure of production. This ratio is not favorable; the proportion of industry should be substantially higher. Throughout the world agriculture is subsidized at the expense of other sectors of production, whereas in Estonia this cannot be done. Leetsar believes that in the future agriculture should not remain a leader in the area of exports. The volume of production in agriculture should increase; however, the growth in industry should be substantially higher. Last year exports of agricultural products increased by approximately a factor of two, and came to 2.1 billion kroons, leaving other sectors of industry behind.
