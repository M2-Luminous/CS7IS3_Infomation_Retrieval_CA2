A paratrooper, he is also an Oxford graduate. In 1982, during the Falkland war, he was in command of the 22d SAS Regiment (Special Air Service, the British Army's elite commando corps). After becoming army chief of staff, Lieutenant-General Rose took command on 5 January of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] in Bosnia-Herzegovina. New Air Strike Doctrine In an interview with LE FIGARO, he explains the new doctrine on the use of air power as part of a UN peacekeeping operation. Indeed, this is the first time UN ground soldiers on a peacekeeping mission are given air support -- here from NATO aircraft. [Girard] Before the weekend there still were a few Serbian gun batteries -- for instance at Osijek -- which were not under UNPROFOR control, despite NATO's ultimatum. How do you explain this? What are you going to do about it? [Rose] The UNPROFOR has not yet succeeded in getting all heavy weapons on all sites under control. First of all because of the weather. Collecting all weapons was very difficult. Second, the Serbs did not manage to carry out such a task as efficiently as they thought they would: Their army is rather poorly structured, it is only a loose collection of militias. Third, they consider they never agreed to disarm, only to place their weapons under UN control. There has been some confusion at lower echelons. [Girard] And yet NATO's ultimatum was very clear... [Rose] Indeed, and we could have taken a much tougher stand. We chose to be understanding to avoid negative repercussions on our action as a whole. The goodwill of the Bosnian Serbs is real, as we can see from our daily meetings with (their "President") Radovan Karadzic. Serbian officials say: "We are having difficulties, but we want to disarm and we are doing it. Stop hassling us!" Basically, Serbian militia men are totally confused, and this is the reason why we do not push as hard as we could. However, I can certify that they cannot resume artillery fire without first having to fight us. We removed essential parts from their weapons, which means that, technically, these guns are under our control, even if their being scattered all over the place is an inconvenience. And the situation is getting better every day. [Girard] The Bosnian presidency stated that at least five Serbian batteries remained out of UN control... [Rose] We act every time reconnaissance aircraft identify new heavy weapons. Often, the Serbs will have forgotten they had placed guns here or there. These are abandoned guns which they had not used in a long time. Nevertheless, I will not let myself be diverted from my main goal: the peace process. This is more than a mere cease-fire. We want to turn Sarajevo into a European city again, an open city with a normal life. LE FIGARO mentioned the risk of the siege becoming institutionalized, as in Nicosia. I repeat, we do not want that. We have already achieved a lot. `Totally in Phase With NATO' [Girard] There are still incidents, light weapon fire. Are you not afraid of the Serbs slowly chipping away at the cease-fire? [Rose] This is a real danger. The Serbs charged the Bosnians with trying to advance their front-line positions at four different places. If this is true, it is unacceptable. I am going to visit those places: If trenches have indeed been moved, I will demand that the Bosnian Army return to the positions it held when the cease-fire took effect. [Girard] Everyone could see over the last three weeks that there was a substantial discrepancy between NATO's discourse, which has been rather "hawkish," and that of the United Nations, more on the "dovey" side. How do you overcome the contradiction? [Rose] I can only comment from a tactical viewpoint, my own. (...) But I can tell you that since 9 February, the day when I laid the foundation of a peace agreement with the Serbs and the Muslims, I have been totally in phase with NATO. You may have noted that some terms of the Brussels' communique (NATO's ultimatum issued on the night of 9 February) seem to have been directly taken from the agreement signed by the Serbs and the Bosnians. The ultimatum reinforced our peace plan. [Girard] Were you absolutely certain that NATO Southern Area Commander Admiral Boorda would only send out his planes on your request? [Rose] Absolutely. There must be no doubt about it: NATO is here only as a support force. And it is a first: A regional defense organization coming to support a UN peacekeeping force. I am positive: Not a single NATO bomb will be dropped without my order. With the exception of a plane acting in self-defense, of course. [Girard] Was your tactical approach -- enforcing the cease- fire and sending Blue Helmets to guard Serb batteries -- not inconsistent with a strategic decision to perform even a symbolic strike in order to convince the Serbs of Western determination? [Girard] I am very clear on the matter. Our first priority is to make sure humanitarian aid comes through. This is a matter of survival for 2,700,000 people in Bosnia. Our second priority is to facilitate the creation of safe havens, one of them being Sarajevo. We will be able to carry out such missions as long as we remain noncombatants. As soon as we become combatants -- see what happened in Somalia -- we become helpless. `Our Planes Would Blow It to Smithereens' There is one question left: How do we reconcile air strikes and continued noncombatant status? Simple: The use of air power must remain proportional and strictly connected to this or that violation of the ultimatum. It must be a way to strike back, not to change the military balance or the political landscape. I developed a number of principles: -- Any strike must be directed at the guilty party. -- It must be proportionate: You are not going to destroy a whole army because someone fired at you once. -- It is necessary to determine in the field whether the target is a legitimate one. [Girard] Meaning... ? [Rose] Let us take an example. Very recently, a U.S. plane told us about hostile fire, speculating that it might have been a 20-mm three-tube cannon (a weapon banned by the ultimatum). We sent a military monitor to check it out and it turned out that it had been only a young man wasting his 12.7-mm machine gun's ammunition for the hell of it. This cretin was not worth an air strike. However, should an artillery regiment -- on whatever side -- attempt to reassemble and to fire on or from Sarajevo, then our planes would blow it to smithereens. [Girard] Then weapons will now surely remain silent in Sarajevo? [Rose] Both armies have now gotten as far as was possible for them. Without their artillery, the Serbs cannot conquer any more land, supposing they want to. (...) The Bosnians know that they cannot substantially alter the military situation with ground soldiers only. They have been paying attention to Western pressure. In Sarajevo, we have reached a kind of climax as far as military operations are concerned, which will make it possible for the peace plan to be implemented.
