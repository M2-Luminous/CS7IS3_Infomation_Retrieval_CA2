The day's talks on insurance trade, the most promising of three priority areas, consisted of confirming progress made before bilateral trade "framework" talks broke down in February, a Japanese official said. Both sides expressed caution, but there were indications the U.S. was ready to ease its hard-line stance in the insurance talks that conclude Thursday in Tokyo. "I gather there's an atmosphere of optimism that we are going to move forward," a U.S. official said. "The U.S. is going to be more flexible but we're not going to throw everything overboard." But the official, who asked not to be named, said the Americans were sticking to their main positions, adding, "we'll just have to see how things go in this first round -- whether we move forward or just get stuck." The Japanese side was also cautious, with one Finance Ministry official saying both sides remain apart on the pace of liberalizing the foreign-dominated "third sector" of insurance that includes accident, nursing care and disease coverage. Washington is urging Tokyo to go slow on deregulating the sector, with U.S. officials stressing in the past the need for "prudent" regulation. But Japan sees the go-slow demand as an attempt by the U.S. to hold its lead. Nonetheless, insurance was an area that both sides have said was nearer to agreement than other priority areas -- government procurement and automobiles and car parts -- as it is less likely to revert to bickering over whether U.S. demands amount to "numerical targets." The framework talks broke down on February 11, when then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton could not agree on the "objective criteria" called for in the framework accord signed last July. In restarting the talks, the U.S. side said that although it wants a "results-oriented" agreement, it is not seeking market-share "targets." But Tokyo's concerns remain. Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said Wednesday that the "Japan-U.S. gap has shrunk considerably" but that no sectoral agreements have been reached. Answering questions in the House of Representatives budget committee, Kakizawa expressed a "fear that something like a request for numerical targets could emerge." Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, whose ministry is responsible for the insurance talks, vowed his "utmost efforts" to reach a framework agreement in time for a July summit of major industrial nations. But he told a regular news conference he did not know the details of the day's insurance talks. Asked if both sides could wrap up an agreement on insurance in two days, lead U.S. negotiator Ira Wolf, assistant trade representative for Japan and China, smiled and said, "We'll see." The Japanese team is headed by Eisuke Sakakibara, deputy chief of the Finance Ministry's International Finance Bureau. The two countries are to resume the auto and parts talks Thursday in Washington and the talks on Japanese Government procurement of medical equipment and telecommunications Friday in Tokyo.
