Nunez, who was on leave for 60 days to facilitate the investigations conducted by a presidential committee, has reiterated that he is innocent but admitted that the scandal is harming the police institution and for this reason he should leave his post. In announcing his resignation to reporters, Nunez said the institution's image has been seriously damaged and this has increased the agressiveness of criminals. In a noticeably shaken voice, Nunez said: Because of this basic consideration which is of an institutional and social-safety nature, I find that I must withdraw from the General Command by submitting my resignation. The cabinet today discussed the resignation of the police chief. A government spokesman has told REUTER that Nunez' departure is a fact and that President Sixto Duran-Ballen will appoint a new commander general before Monday. Nunez, who is well known for his diligent struggle against the underworld, has been accused of illegal acquisition of wealth and abuse of power. The charges, which initially were filed in mid-May against Nunez only, gradually were applied to the entire police staff by Police Colonel Hector Estrella, who exposed the scandal. [Paris AFP in Spanish at 2331 GMT on 9 June in a similar report adds: "Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen has appointed General Miguel Rosero as the new police commander."]
