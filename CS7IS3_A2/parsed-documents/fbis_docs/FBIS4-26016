Fifty-two giant transnational conglomerates, listed among the world's top 500 companies in the U.S. "FORTUNE" magazine, have pumped money into China since 1993, with a total contractual capital of four billion U.S. dollars, said officials from the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC), in a recent exclusive interview with XINHUA. The arrival of leading international investors marked a significant shift in China's introduction of foreign investment which had been dominated by relatively small projects, the officials said. More fund and technology-intensive projects are coming in, they added. "China's fast-growing economy and improved investment environment are major factors behind the transnational companies' favoring China," said Martin Claus, chief representative of the German KHD Company's Beijing office. KHD, one of the most prestigious engineering firms in the world, is now close to signing a 400- million-U.S. dollar contract with China. China's economy has been growing at double-digit pace over the past several years and is expected to grow 12 percent in the first half of this year and 10 percent for the whole year. Latest statistics indicate that transnational companies account for about half of the total foreign investment in China since 1993. According to the SAIC officials, over 3,700 foreign firms have established representative offices or branches in China since the beginning of last year, including some 260 powerful companies. Among them are big names like Du Pont, General Electric, Siemens, IBM, Philips, Mitsubishi and National. While bringing investments to China, the transnationals have come along with more projects of technical cooperation. Apart from Western firms, rising giants from newly-industrialized countries and regions, such as Singapore and the Republic of Korea, are also elbowing for a share in the Chinese market. A survey conducted recently by an international organization shows that 98 percent of U.S. firms interviewed have listed China as the best place for investment. Attracting big transnational firms has been China's main target in the 1990s. Foreign investments in chunks up to 10 million dollars are most welcome, particularly in key economic fields such as infrastructure and basic industries. More big international firms are putting money in these sectors as well as the service industries, said an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. China has announced that its imports will be as high as 1,000 billion dollars in the remaining years before the end of the century. And foreign investors now face a good prospect.
