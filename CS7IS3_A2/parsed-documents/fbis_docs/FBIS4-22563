It is extremely dangerous. Let us look at it objectively. The picture is ambiguous. It cannot be painted in only one color; for example, black or white, or, moreover, pink. For one thing, the drop in production is continuing, furthermore, over the last few months, this problem has sharply exacerbated. For another thing, market supply and demand mechanisms are gradually beginning to work. Before, for example, workers at the Motor Vehicle or Television Set Factories would have never thought that someone would not buy their products. Everything that was produced by them was centrally distributed. Currently, a key question is: Will our television sets, motor vehicles, tractors, or other goods be bought? The first signs of competition are appearing. The movement toward the market has begun, though with mighty efforts and in low gear. However, this is not the sort of a market which we are longing to set up and which has made people of many states wealthy. Currently, with us, economic freedom correlates with the economic irresponsibility of many businesses in their relations with partners, consumers, and the state. However, this is also caused by the lack of reliable legal protection for our citizens and enterprises. Over the decades, our economy, its costs, technologies, wages, and profits have been formulated according to mechanisms other than those of the world economy. Production was oriented toward relatively cheap fuel and raw materials, at considerably lower transportation costs. It is impossible to immediately integrate into the global price system, which has a fundamentally different structure. What issue is the most acute today? Prices for energy resources. The point is that nearly our entire economy is based on energy- intensive technologies. The gap between domestic and world prices for oil was as big as nowhere else. The cost of oil stood at 7 percent the world price. Currently, those proportions have abruptly altered. Up to 60 percent of prices for energy resources approach world levels, which makes our goods noncompetitive. [passage omitted] Our position is as follows: 1. To keep the budget deficit at last year's level; 2. To considerably cut and gradually rescind grants and subsidies to producers, and direct them toward consumers; 3. To increase state financial aid to the population. These financial subsidies should be granted only to people who are in sore need of them; 4. To minimize the issuing of bank credits on favorable terms; to foresee the allocation of budget means to lower interest rates for granting credits to priority branches and businesses; 5. To reject administrative methods when setting up a state currency fund; to use a single exchange rate for state needs and rescind the tax on currency revenues; 6. To introduce payments in some institutions of the social sector; 7. To reduce the number of enterprises which receive state subsidies. A producer who is unable to organize effective production without being financially supported by the state should either restructure his production or close down, according to the Law on Bankruptcy. These main directions of the government's activities were adopted by the Supreme Soviet and we are doing everything possible to implement them. [passage omitted] To resolve cadre issues, the Cabinet of Ministers adopted a resolution to set up a military academy. All of us understand its importance. Costs for training the senior military staff will be decreased by five times. However, it turned out that not all the opportunities for attracting military researchers and setting up the academy's scientific potential -- as stemming from the Republic's opportunities -- were sorted out. In my opinion, it is worth recalling that we have two excellent military colleges to train officers, as well as a Suvorov secondary military school. It is necessary to use their capabilities to train foreign citizens, raise the issue of more extensive student exchanges. This could lower the cost of training even further. Enough time has passed in which to create the Armed Forces. Their restructuring will have to be finished by 1 January 1995. It is high time to raise the issue of an officer's honor and dignity, the fulfilling of the military oath. We consider it to be a serious failure of the Defense Ministry that a number of officers are ready to leave their fatherland after they have taken their oath of loyalty. Their patriotism proved false. They are ready to leave the fatherland and lose their citizenship for a better salary abroad. Is this not a training problem, a result of our faulty staff policy? This serious failure, which led to the dismissal of a range of first class officers for the sake of preserving those who were considered to be our future and did not live up to our expectations. The government realizes these dangerous processes and understands their destructive impact on the Armed Forces. The issue of maintaining the staff is likely to be a key one in keeping the Army up to snuff. To improve their living standards, the government is going to adopt a resolution to substitute their food rations with monetary compensations and to later increase them. We are looking for opportunities to increase the basic allowances for military ranks in May-June. Given the current economic situation, we cannot provide for the introduction of contract service in our Armed Forces. This demands that a radical staff reduction and severe expenditure increases be introduced; and that 100 percent of all servicemen -- from a private to a general -- receive housing facilities. At the moment, this problem is one of the most acute and difficult to resolve. The government is concerned by the fact that some 15,000 servicemen have no housing. Of these soldiers, one in every three has been transferred to the reserves. Those servicemen, who were transferred to the reserves and listed as requiring better housing conditions after 1 July 1992, have no right to state housing. However, their allowances and pensions do not allow them to engage in building their own houses or apartments. Therefore, we take all measures to build houses and apartments for servicemen, including those in the reserves, at state expense. In the immediate future, these issues will be discussed at the Presidium of the Cabinet of Ministers. During negotiations with the United States, we agreed that $10 million out of the $25 million which the United States will provide to aid the conversion of our defense industry will be spent on building housing for servicemen, and $5 million -- for the retraining of officers in the reserves. It is a well-known fact that under a market system, the Army should be completely financed by the state. The ideas of some primitive politicians that the Army could be maintained at the expense of some commercial structures are not only self-deceiving but, in some sense, directed at demoralizing and undermining the defense capabilities of the Armed Forces. A complicated economic situation engenders a desire to immediately upgrade the economy at the expense of the defense system, and this must absolutely be ruled out. At the same time, the inaction of the Defense Ministry on issues related to the rational use of existing housing facilities is also inadmissible. For years, in big cities, empty buildings have not been used and nobody leases them. Many agreements have been signed with Russia, Ukraine, and other republics, however, they are being introduced very slowly. This is another extreme situation connected with the sluggishness and misunderstanding of time which demands that active measures and perseverance be used. More and more new issues arise in both the economic and military areas. Their resolution is impossible without cooperating closely with other states, first and foremost, with Russia. I will give you two examples. Belarusian enterprises can produce only 3 percent of our required armaments and hardware. Belarusian repair enterprises can handle only 2 percent of armaments and hardware out of 4,000 types which our Army utilizes. You know that the government is consistently working in the direction of setting up a close economic union, in particular, the financial and monetary union, with Russia. Similar work is being conducted in the military sector. We are sure about its positive results and that they will serve as a good basis for the implementation of the planned military building. But we do not exaggerate the results of this unification and do not relax while waiting for it to happen. As head of the Belarusian Government, I declare that the government is undertaking, and will continue to undertake various measures aimed at maintaining the Armed Forces. The Defense Ministry will no longer ask other ministries and departments for means to maintain the Army. The entire process of military building and Army restructuring will be based on "state orders" to ensure the provision of the Army with hardware and armaments. According to the Armed Forces' demands, the state buys equipment, which cannot be produced in Belarus, abroad. We hold out hope that cooperation in the military sphere will be of importance, as well. To implement these programs to reform the Armed Forces, resolving the social issues of the officers corps, the military budget will shortly be indexed. However, the Defense Ministry should also learn how to earn money. The work of the Commercial Department should be upgraded. [passage omitted] We all are unanimous: We must maintain the Armed Forces! Our defense should be reliable and stable. Esteemed Officers, you play the key part in this process. Your dignity and the state analysis are the basis for our defense capability and the stability of the state, lawfulness, and discipline in the troops.
