The interview he gave us covered his country's place in Europe. [Zecchini] In terms of its exports, Ireland will benefit from the GATT agreement, but it will lose out on agriculture, following the reduction of farming subsidies. Are you satisfied all the same? [Spring] Indeed, our economy is highly focused on exports, but our agriculture is also well protected by the commitments undertaken at the most recent Community meetings. If there is an imbalance regarding the Common Agricultural Policy [CAP] within the context of GATT, it is the European Council that will have to review the question of compensations. In any case, we will have to wait several years to see just how compatible the terms of the reformed CAP are with the rules agreed under GATT. [Zecchini] Ireland has always managed to obtain substantial structural funds, but are these not short-term victories, to the extent that you have an economy that is increasingly dependent on financial support? [Spring] There are different ways of looking at things. What we are trying to do within the Community is achieve a kind of balance regarding our various economic situations. We entered the EC with a standard of living of about 66 percent of the Community-wide average. Today, we have attained a level of 70 percent, so we are making progress. Clearly, it would not be in our interest to belong to a Community which merely served the interests of the richest countries. A large proportion of the structural funds are being spent on developing our infrastructures and educational system. This will enable us to heighten our competitiveness and have an economy which is increasingly compatible with that of our partners. [Zecchini] One day the Community could decide that some countries in Eastern Europe are in greater need of Community funds than Ireland. [Spring] That is a question of balance. We are extremely aware that the development of the countries in Central Europe will become a decisive factor regarding the security and stability of all of Europe. However, there are both advantages and disadvantages linked with this new situation: Even if our financial assistance is reduced, we will at the same time have access to new markets. [Zecchini] The Irish are considered to be "good Europeans," but that does not prevent you from buying Boeing aircraft instead of Airbus, and of equipping your police force with Japanese motorcycles. Could you be pragmatic Europeans? [Spring] We are highly dedicated Europeans. We want to buy in Europe as much as possible. Moreover, there are major opportunities for our own products that we have not yet exploited, namely on the French, Italian, and German markets. Although many of our traditional industries suffered when we joined the EC, we want to play our role in developing Europe. Although the criteria enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty are imposing very tight constraints on our economy, ironically enough today we are closer to fulfilling those criteria than many other countries which are strongly in favor of them. Mark my words, the Irish will continue to be good, solid Europeans. It is in all our interests -- especially bearing Russian instability in mind -- that Europe should continue to develop, with the small countries continuing to exert their influence, as we have been doing since 1973.
