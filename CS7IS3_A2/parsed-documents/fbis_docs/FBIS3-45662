However, CPC leaders cannot prepare for their New Year holidays with ease. They are immersed in coping with various changes brought about by the reform measures which came into force on 1 January, including problems in the new taxation system, the agricultural issue, and the price issue. At present, the most pressing problem lies in agriculture. Recently, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is also in charge of agriculture, stressed the need to ensure peasants' livelihood while stabilizing grain prices in order to prevent trouble among them. The serious attention of the authorities reflects the worrisome situation in the countryside. However, the authorities did not make public the real situation in the countryside. According to reliable official sources, in 1993 the areas sown with major crops decreased by the largest margin in the last few years. In particular, the area sown with wheat, rice, and corn decreased by 2.64 million hectares. Although it is expected that the gross grain output remained at the same level, if the factor of population growth is also considered, then the per capita grain output decreased. In addition, the area sown with cotton decreased by 1.38 million hectares and the cotton output decreased by about 10 million dan. The area sown with oil-bearing crops decreased by 420,000 hectares and the output also decreased by about 30 percent. This inevitably led to a decline in peasants' income and brought about instability in the countryside. In addition, this also caused a sharp increase in grain prices. The central authorities are deeply worried about this situation. They think that grain prices will increase by at least 10 percent in 1994. China always has to import wheat to meet domestic needs, and the wheat import in 1994 will have to increase. Moreover, as the central government has changed the allocation system into the agent system for imported grain, with import subsidies being terminated, plus the unification of the foreign exchange system, it is expected that the wheat price will inevitably increase substantially. On the other hand, as the international corn and soya bean prices are increasing, exports will grow. However, rice output decreased by a big margin. In some localities it was difficult to purchase rice from peasants. Some localities even dispatched military troops for forced grain purchases. Another fact that the authorities did not tell the public was that China's current area sown with grain crops has decreased to the warning level, or even below it. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishery recently delivered a report to the central authorities saying that the area of farmland sown with grain crops in China must be kept at a level higher than 1.65 billion mu. However, the area of farmland for growing grain crops decreased sharply in the last two years. In 1992, it decreased by 24 million mu to 1.66 billion mu, and in 1993 it further decreased to 1.62 billion mu, which was lower than the warning level. As peasants are uneasy and found it hard to maintain their livelihood, the tide of migrant laborers has appeared earlier than in previous years. Peasants in poor areas have begun to pour into cities, but they did this after Chinese New Year in previous years. According to the official information, as early as last November four or five streams of migrant laborers gradually took form in the country, and they separately flowed to Guangdong, Beijing-Tianjin, Shanghai, Harbin, and cities along the Chang Jiang. It is expected that the number of migrant laborers will exceed 50 million people, and those from Sichuan alone will be nearly 10 million people. The spread of the "Sichuan troops" all over the country indeed worries the authorities. The authorities can only adopt two countermeasures. First, opening the state granaries to keep the grain prices stable. Normally, the Chinese Government stores grain for the nation's consumption in six months, so there is sufficient grain in stock. It is not difficult to tide over the demand peak period around the Chinese New Year. However, China will have to quicken grain imports in the following months of this year. Another measure is to print more bank notes to purchase grain from peasants. In October 1993 the amount of newly printed bank notes exceeded the major mark of 100 billion yuan. As the State Council was determined to solve the IOU problem, it allocated 30 billion yuan to local governments. However, the local governments said that the funds were still insufficient and required the central authorities to increase the allocations. Finally, the central authorities could not but allocate another 50 billion yuan to ensure that the first 30 billion yuan could be delivered to the hands of peasants. It seemed that while the IOU problem was resolved or mitigated, fuel would have been added to inflation. All such unstable factors forced the central authorities to seek various countermeasures. The pressure on Zhu Rongji, who is also in charge of agriculture, was even greater. Recently it was rumored that his status might have become worrisome (for example, the "macrocontrol" for which he bears the main responsibility has quietly come to an end), and the outside world is now wondering if he is in a predicament. However, informed sources said that Zhu Rongji's position was still rather firm and had not been shaken or changed. Although he may withdraw from the office of governor of the People's Bank of China (and may be succeeded by Dai Xianglong, currently first vice governor of the bank), this is in fact an arrangement made long ago. When Zhu Rongji took the banks' governorship, it was known among the insiders that this was only a transitional step, because the situation at that time required Zhu's authority for adopting some urgent and stern measures. In addition, Zhu Rongji continued to take charge of the economic work without change. Although Li Peng frequently appeared on public occasions in the last few months, Zhu Rongji was still one of the principal officials deciding the economic reform policies in 1994. Otherwise, he would not have said that macrocontrol was not contradictory to Deng Xiaoping's idea about accelerating development. The economic officials also gave tacit consent to the option of alternately tightening and loosening control, because the disorder would appear if control is too loose and the economy would be stifled if control is too tight. However, such policy was different from the previous retrenchment policy. Instead, it was just a means of more flexibly alternating "tight control" and "loose control." Another issue that is now worrying the central authorities is the confusion in people's minds and the tendency to independent administration among the local authorities. Therefore, in the activities of commemorating the 100th anniversary of Mao Zedong's birth last month, the authorities again stressed the values advocated by Mao. As Deng Xiaoping pointed out, negating Mao is equal to negating the party, so they must adhere to this even if the sky is falling down. However, at the same time there was a "criticizing-Mao campaign," which was not officially called this. That was the large-scale study of Volume 3 of Deng Xiaoping's works promoted by the authorities. In fact, in the study of Volume 3 of Deng's works, the authorities concerned relayed Deng Xiaoping's recent instructions on foreign, economic, and political affairs. Deng stressed that China has entered the era of peaceful construction, so there should be no life-and-death struggle between China and the international community. Instead, it is an era of interdependence. China's economic construction has included a variety of operation forms and management systems, and is no longer in a "large monolithic mode." To put it more plainly, China now needs to replace Mao's theories about "taking class struggle as the key link," about "preparing against the unavoidable world war," and about the planned economy, with Deng's ideas that "keeping stability is an overwhelming task" and his theory about "building socialism with Chinese characteristics." Therefore, the current activities of "praising Mao" only served the purpose of consolidating the legitimacy of the CPC's rule, and the criticism of Mao also served the same purpose, that is, consolidating the CPC's ruling position through correcting Mao's mistakes.
