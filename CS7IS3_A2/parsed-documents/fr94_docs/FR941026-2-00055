ACTION: Announcement of availability of competitive financial assistance to assist eligible applicants address environmental problems and impacts from Department of Defense activities to Indian lands. DEFINITION: For purposes of this program announcement, Indian lands is defined as all lands used by American Indian tribes and Alaska Native Villages. SUMMARY: The Congress has recognized that Department of Defense activities may have caused environmental problems for Indian tribes and Alaska Natives. These environmental hazards can negatively impact the health and safety as well as their social and economic welfare. Accordingly, the Congress has taken steps to help those affected begin to mitigate environmental impacts from Department of Defense activities by assisting them in the planning, development and implementation of programs for such mitigation. This environmental mitigation program was begun through a program announcement published on December 29, 1993 as a response to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, Public Law 103&hyph;139, which was enacted on November 11, 1993. This program continues under Public Law 103&hyph;335 (the Act), enacted on September 30, 1994. Section 8094 of the Act states, ``Of the funds appropriated to the Department of Defense (DOD) for Operations and Maintenance Defense_Wide, not less than $8,000,000 shall be made available until expended to the Administration for Native Americans within 90 days of enactment of this Act: Provided That such funds shall be made available only for the mitigation of environmental impacts, including training and technical assistance to tribes, related administrative support, the gathering of information, documenting of environmental damage, and developing a system for prioritizing of mitigation, on Indian lands resulting from Department of Defense activities: Provided further, That the Department of Defense shall provide to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and House of Representatives by September 30, 1995, a summary report of all environmental damage that has occurred on Indian land as a result of DOD activities, to include, to the extent feasible, a list of all documents and records known to the Department that describe the activity or action causing or relating to such environmental damage.'' The Administration for Native Americans (ANA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) announce the availability of FY95 funds for eligible applicants to begin the process of addressing the environmental problems and damage caused from defense activities. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sharon McCully_(202) 690&hyph;5780 or Rita LeBeau_(202) 690&hyph;5790 or Gerry Gipp_(202) 690&hyph;6662 at the Administration for Native Americans, Department of Health and Human Services, 200 Independence Avenue, SW., Rm 348F, Washington, DC 20201&hyph;0001. DATES: The closing date for submission of applications is August 18, 1995. A. Introduction and Purpose The program announcement states the availability of any unobligated fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 1995 financial assistance to eligible applicants using funds provided by the Department of Defense through the Administration for Native Americans for the purpose of mitigating environmental impacts on Indian lands related to Department of Defense activities. Financial assistance awards made under this program announcement will be on a competitive basis and the proposals will be reviewed against the evaluation criteria in this announcement. The Federal government recognizes that substantial environmental problems, resultant from defense activities, exist on Indian lands and will geographically range from border to border and from coast to coast. The nature and magnitude of the problems will most likely be better defined when affected Indian tribes and Alaska Natives have completed environmental assessments called for in Phase I of this four-phase program. The Federal government has also recognized that Indian tribes, Alaska Natives and their tribal organizations must have the opportunity to develop their own plans and technical capabilities and access the necessary financial and technical resources in order to assess, plan, develop and implement programs to mitigate any impacts caused by Department of Defense activities. The Administration for Native Americans (ANA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) recognize the potential environmental problems created by DOD activities that may affect air, water, soil and human and natural resources (i.e., forests, fish, plants). It is also recognized that potential applicants may have specialized knowledge and capabilities to address specific concerns at various levels within the four phase program. Under this announcement proposals will be accepted for any and all of the four phases or one specific phase. These phases are: Phase I_assessment of Indian lands to develop as complete an inventory as possible of environmental impacts caused by Department of Defense activities; Phase II_identification and exploration of alternative means for mitigation of these impacts and determination of the technical merit, feasibility and expected costs and benefits of each approach in order to select one approach; Phase III_development of a detailed mitigation plan, and costing and scheduling for implementation of the design, including strategies for meeting statutory or regulatory requirements and for dealing with other appropriate Federal agencies; and, Phase IV_implementation of the mitigation plan. The following are some known areas of concern. It is expected that applicants may identify additional areas of concern in their applications: •damage to treaty protected spawning habitats caused by artillery practice or other defense activities; •damage to Indian lands and improvements (e.g. wells, fences) and facilities caused by bombing practice; •damage caused to range and forest lands by gunnery range activities; •low-level flights over sacred sites and religious ceremonies which disrupt spiritual activities;
