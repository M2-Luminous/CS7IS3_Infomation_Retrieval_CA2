That is the length of time that it has not been printed by Krasnoyarsk's "Ofset" Production and Publishing Combine owing to lack of money to cover paper and printing costs. This is a graphic example of what may happen to other Russian publications as a result of Russian Federation Government Decree No. 1233 on revaluing the capital stock at national economic enterprises. Krasnoyarsk newspapers have reprinted ahe Appeal from Russian press personnel and the chief editors of the leading central newspapers to V. Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Federation Government. The editors of leading Krasnoyarsk and certain rayon newspapers, as well as the "Ofset" Publishing House, have signed up to the appeal. As a sign of solidarity they are willing to stop publishing during the first "week of parliament" -- 11 through 17 January.
