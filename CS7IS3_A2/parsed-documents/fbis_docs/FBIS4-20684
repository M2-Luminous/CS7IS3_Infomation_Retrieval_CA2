Introduction In recent years, with the adoption of higher density in semiconductor integrated circuits, the quality requirements for ultrapure water have become increasingly higher purity. Actually, it has been required to remove dissolved oxygen (hereinafter referred to as DO) from ultrapure water, in order to prevent growth of the native oxide layers on water surfaces. The conventional processes for removal of DO from water include physical processes (e.g., vacuum degassing, purging with N[.sub]2[/] gas) and chemical process involving the addition of reducing agents with catalyzer. In achieving an extremely low concentration of DO by the conventional degassing processes, there are some problems; e.g., a large facility will be required, they will occur the increase of impurities, and a large amount of N[.sub]2[/] gas will be required. This paper describes not only the method of reducing DO to 5 ppb or less by UV ray, but also the decomposition and removal of TOC by UV ray. 2. Removal of DO by Using UV Ray 2.1. Experimental and Principle DO reacts with hydrogen by irradiating UV ray which contains a wavelength of 185 nm. However, the reaction between DO and hydrogen does not occur by using UV ray of more than 254 nm. Figure 1 shows the test equipment. Hydrogen gas was employed as the reducing agent and dissolved in water by using a gas-permeable membrane module. The gas-permeable membrane was polyolefine hollow fiber type. Figure 1. Experimental Equipment Hydrogen gas dissolves in water because of the pressure level of difference outside to inside of membrane. Accordingly, it was easy to control very small amount of additional gas. Moreover, gas bubbles were not remained in water. Low pressure mercury lamps and thimble tubes, which were used synthetic quartz glass, were installed in a UV reactor. Irradiating water contained hydrogen with UV ray of 185 nm, DO or dissolved hydrogen (DH) is excited and DO reacts with DH to become water as follows. 1/2 O[.sub]2[/] + H[.sub]2[/] O* + 2H* H[.sub]2[/]O [h_n_ above first right arrow] 2.2. Effect of Water Depth UV of 185 nm wavelength is absorbed by water very well. It is necessary to bring DO and DH into contact with UV light zone, in order to gain higher efficiency of UV reactor. Accordingly as depth of water layer increased, DO removing percentage of UV reactor went down as shown in Figure 2. Furthermore, the effect of water was strong according as retention time decreased. Figure 2. Depth of Water Layer and DO Removing Percentage It is desirable to decrease water depth as thin as possible. However, on producing UV reactor it is difficult that the depth becomes 5mm or less. Accordingly, the retention time of actual UV reactor needs more than 20 seconds and form of buffer plates in UV reactor are devised. 2.3. Effect of Hydrogen Dosage Effect of hydrogen dosage injected into water was tested by using two kinds of UV reactors: One had UV lamp's output power level of 650 w and another had 1550 w. The results of the test are shown in Figure 3. Figure 3 shows the relationship between the rate of DO reaction efficiency and the amount of hydrogen indicated by 2H[.sub]2[/] per O[.sub]2[/] ratio. Figure 3. 2H[.sub]2[/]/O[.sub]2[/] Ratio and Rate of DO Reaction Efficiency In case of A to have scarce intensity of UV irradiation, hydrogen per oxygen ratio is had to become more than four, in order to make the rate of DO reaction efficiency become one. However, in case of B to have enough intensity of UV irradiation, the rate of DO reaction efficiency becomes one if H[.sub]2[/] per O[.sub]2[/] ratio is more than 1.2. DO concentration of influent is not constant at actual DO removal treatment. Accordingly, excess amount of hydrogen gas is injected into water. 2.4. DO Removal Performance of Actual Equipment DO removal performance of actual equipment which had treatment ability of 10 m[.sup]3[/]/h, is shown in Figure 4. Additional dosage of hydrogen gas was one and a half times of H[.sub]2[/] per O[.sub]2[/] ratio for initial DO concentration of 100 �g/l. Figure 4. DO Removal Performance It kept always constant even if initial DO changed. It was enough satisfied to reduce the residual DO in treated water to 5 �g/l or less at initial DO of less than 100 �g/l. Furthermore, if initial DO is less than 30 �g/l, it is possible to reduce DO to 1 �g/l or less. 3. Decomposition of TOC by Using UV Ray It is known that the UV ray of 185 nm is able to decompose low molecular organic compounds without oxidizer. Accordingly, decomposition of TOC and removal of DO simultaneously achieved by using a same vessel of UV reactor. TOC is decomposed into several kinds of organic acids and carbonic acid by UV irradiation. For example, decomposition products of ethylalcohol is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Decomposition Products of Ethylalcohol by UV Irradiation Test Ethylalcohol Percentage of each product No. (�g/l as C) Acetic Oxalic Formic CO[.sub]2[/] Unknown acid acid acid (%) matters (%) (%) (%) (%) 1 38.1 46.2 4.5 2.9 44.1 2.3 2 56.1 44.7 3.9 2.7 36.5 12.2 3 87.2 45.8 3.4 2.6 32.2 15.9 This result was obtained under the conditions that flow rate of treatment was 300 l/h and a 70 w low pressure mercury lamp was used. As a result, it seems to increase percentage of unknown matters according to an increase of initial ethylalcohol concentration. However, TOC of more than 80 percent was decomposed into several kinds of organic acids, particularly acetic acid, and carbonic acid. These organic acids and carbonic acid are easily removed by a conventional anion exchange resin. As a result of long running actual equipment operation, TOC of treated water has stably become 2 to 3 �g/l at initial TOC level from 10 to 20 �g/l. 4. Ultrapure Water Unit at Used Point As shown in Figure 5, ultrapure water unit, which is used at a close point to the ULSI manufacturing place, consists of the following components: a gas permeable membrane module dissolving hydrogen, a UV reactor, modules of membrane deaerator for reducing residual dissolved hydrogen, ion exchange cartridge polishers, ultrafiltration membrane and non-particle pumps. Figure 5. Flow Sheet of Advanced Ultrapure Water Unit Needless to say, 254 nm of UV ray has a sterilizing effect. Therefore, this process has ability not only for removing of DO and TOC but also for the sterilizing of ultrapure water. Table 2 shows water quality of the advanced ultrapure water unit. Table 2.

This process does not cause any increase in impurities. 2) This process is very suitable to place as close to used points as possible, because of very compact size.
