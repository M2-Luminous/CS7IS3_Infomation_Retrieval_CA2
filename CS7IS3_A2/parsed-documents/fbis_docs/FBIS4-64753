At a joint news conference with the Federal Association of Young Entrepreneurs [BJU], Rexrodt said that although initially there could be personnel reductions because of excessive employment in former commune-controlled enterprises, such increases in efficiency always mean a saving of funds, which in turn means higher profits by privatized enterprises and reduced costs to citizens. The leftover profits are then available to the enterprises for investment purposes, or to the citizens for consumer purposes. In this way, employment opportunities are created elsewhere. Apart from this, said Rexrodt, it cannot be assumed that financial officials will keep the money earned through privatization in a sock. Instead, it will be spent on other undertakings that can create new jobs or preserve existing ones. The 14,500 communes in Germany provide services that private entrepreneurs could provide equally well, therefore the potential for privatization is enormous. Happily, privatization among the laender and communes has increased, said Rexrodt. However, these must not remain isolated cases that were only undertaken because of empty coffers. On the other hand there has been an absence of consistent privatization strategies. Rexrodt greeted the deal reached between Lufthansa and the Federation concerning the airline's privatization. The Federation should now encourage the privatization of shares in the Rhein-Main-Donau AG, Neckar AG, the State Freeway Subsidiary Services Company, and the Deutsche Genossenchaftsbank. BJU Chairman Thomas Suwelack reported the results of an Emnid survey whereby 70 percent of the respondents had said that the communes are bad entrepreneurs, 66 percent had said that privatization means not just greater efficiency but also a reduction of the burden on communal coffers, and 55 percent had said that privatization should cause an improvement to important public services.
