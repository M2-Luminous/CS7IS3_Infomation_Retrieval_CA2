Khlystun, Russian minister of agriculture and food, held a news conference Thursday [31 March] on the results of a government presidium session which examined, in addition to other matters, the draft program for agrarian reform in 1994-1995. The presidium approved the draft program and instructed interested ministries and departments to finalize it in due course and submit it to the Federal Assembly for final ratification. The program assesses the results of the first stages of agrarian reform involving the transformation of property relations with regard to ownership of land and the means of production and the reorganization of agricultural enterprises. A considerable proportion of the program is devoted to the development of a market infrastructure with wholesale markets, market information, and everything necessary for a multisectoral agrarian economy. A mechanism is also envisaged to provide agricultural producers with state support. An important part of the program is the introduction of a civilized land market, which will enable the owner of a plot of land to sell it and a buyer to purchase it. But, the minister stressed, this cannot totally escape state regulation. Nowhere in the world is there a land market without certain restrictions. And Russia has them too. First: Agricultural land must not be taken out of agricultural use as a result of a sale and cannot be used for other purposes. Second: A maximum area is established for a plot of land that a physical person can privately own. Third: Agricultural land can be acquired only by a person who has the ability and opportunity to work the land himself, predominantly by using his family, and who lives in the given area.
