Dated: November 8, 1993. David Howekamp, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. II U. S. EPA_San Luis Obispo County APCD Agreement for Delegation of Authority for Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations (40 CFR Part 55) The undersigned, on behalf of the San Luis Obispo County Air Pollution Control District (``SLOCAPCD'' or ``the District'') and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA''), hereby agree to the delegation of authority from EPA to SLOCAPCD to implement and enforce the requirements of the Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations (``OCS'') (40 CFR part 55) within 25 miles of the state's seaward boundary, pursuant to section 328(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act (``the Act''), subject to the terms and conditions below. EPA has reviewed SLOCAPCD's request for delegation and has found that SLOCAPCD's regulations meet the requirements for delegation set forth at 40 CFR 55.11. This delegation includes authority for the following sections of the Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations: ␣ 1Section 1Title 55.1 Statutory authority and scope. 55.2 Definitions. 55.3 Applicability. 55.4 Requirements to submit a notice of intent. 55.6 Permit requirements. 55.7 Exemptions. 55.8 Monitoring, reporting, inspections, and compliance. 55.9 Enforcement. 55.10 Fees. 55.13 Federal requirements that apply to OCS sources. 55.14 Requirements that apply to OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries by state. EPA is not delegating the authority to implement and enforce §§55.5 (Corresponding onshore area designation), 55.11 (Delegation), and 55.12 (Consistency updates), as authority for these sections is reserved to the Administrator. In addition, SLOCAPCD does not have SIP-approved Prevention of Significant Deterioration (``PSD'') regulations, nor has it received delegation of authority from EPA for implementation and enforcement of the federal PSD program. Therefore, EPA shall retain authority for the PSD provisions of part C of the Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder at 40 CFR 52.21. Under section 328(a)(3) of the Act, EPA may delegate authority to implement and enforce the OCS air regulations to a state if that state is adjacent to an OCS source and the Administrator determines that the state's regulations are adequate. The State of California is adjacent to a number of OCS sources. For the OCS sources for which the San Luis Obispo County has been designated the corresponding onshore area (COA), the State has submitted SLOCAPCD's regulations to EPA and requested that EPA delegate to SLOCAPCD authority to implement and enforce the OCS air regulations. SLOCAPCD's regulations have been reviewed by EPA and determined to be adequate for implementing and enforcing the delegable sections of 40 CFR part 55. The OCS air regulations set forth the following criteria for delegation at 40 CFR 55.11: (1) The state has adopted the appropriate portions of 40 CFR part 55 into state law_SLOCAPCD adopted Rule 215, Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations, on November 17, 1992. This rule incorporates the provisions of 40 CFR part 55 that EPA is delegating to the District. (NOTE: Section 55.5, corresponding onshore area designations, was adopted by SLOCAPCD but EPA will not delegate authority for this section, as provided by §55.11(a)).
