Jiang made the remarks when meeting with Lawrence Eagleburger, former U.S. secretary of state, here this morning in Zhongnanhai, headquarters of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council. Eagleburger is here as a guest of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, leading a U.S. "China investment and trade" delegation. During the meeting, Jiang said that the current international situation is still changing in a complicated and profound way. The world is developing in the direction of multi-polarization, and the regionalization and conglomeration of the world economy are tending to accelerate. However, the president said that various contradictions and conflicts concealed by the Cold War are gradually being uncovered, leading to disturbances, clashes and even the spilling of blood in some areas. Jiang said that China has always attached much importance to developing relations with the United States. More mutual trust and cooperation between China and the United States will make the two countries play a more active role in handling international affairs. Sino-U.S. relations have seen positive development since the Seattle meeting between the presidents of the two countries last November, Jiang said, and since then, exchanges of visits at high-ranking level had been frequent and bilateral trade and economic cooperation strengthened. "All these are helpful to promoting mutual understanding and solving disputes," he added. As long as both sides have their eyes on the over-all situation and the next century, observe the principles of the three joint communiques between the two governments, respect the facts, increase consultations, and seek common ground while reserving differences, Sino-U.S. relations will be able to maintain a constant development on a normal track. Eagleburger agreed with Jiang, saying that the changes that have taken place in China are very impressive, and all those who are concerned about stability in the next century should agree on the importance of proper u.s.-China relations, because a sound Sino-U.S. relationship is beneficial not only to the two countries, but to world stability and peace as well. Eagleburger and his party arrived in Beijing on Monday [21 February] evening. In addition to Beijing, they are scheduled to visit Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
