Churkin said he hoped that the law on citizenship will not have an impact on the implementation of the agreements on troop withdrawal, on the situation of retired Russian servicemen and on the issue of the radar station in Skrunda signed by the two countries' presidents in Moscow. He said these agreements were too important to be affected even by such a serious document as the law on citizenship.
