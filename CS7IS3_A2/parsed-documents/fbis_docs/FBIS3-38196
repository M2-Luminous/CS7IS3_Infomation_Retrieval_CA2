Speaking at a dinner hosted by the World Economic Forum in Davos last night, she highlighted the scope of foreign investment and the program of privatization by her government. [Begin Bhutto recording] Pakistan is a confident nation. We have no inhibition to restrict the scope of economic relations with foreigners on mutually advantageous basis. Today we are an interdependent world, we are not an isolated world, and the confidence of international financial institutions demonstrates that Pakistan today is well on the road of political stability and economic stability, and therefore a good place for foreign investors to look to. The investors' confidence in Pakistan can be seen from the fact that (?well) in New York a Pakistan fund was open. It is oversubscribed three times, by three times. So, now we are thinking of opening another fund or issuing government securities. Not only was the Pakistan fund oversubscribed, but the stock market has been rising and rising. Pakistan today offers the most lucrative investment opportunities in major infrastructure projects. We have charted out a highly ambitious energy sector development plan, in which some $10 billion are likely to be invested over the next five years. We have made this an almost exclusive domain of the private sector, particularly foreign investors. Needless to say our optimism is based on the successful initiation of implementation work on the Hab power project which is a foreign private initiative costing $2 billion. In fact, this is the largest World Bank-funded private power project anywhere in the world today. [applause] [end recording] The prime minister also highlighted Pakistan's geographical location which can open new vistas toward greater and better relations with the Central Asian countries. In Davos today, the Turkish president, Suleyman Demirel, hosted a working breakfast which was also attended by Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto and President Nazarbayev of Turkmenistan and President Karimov of Uzbekistan. The leaders of the ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] countries exchanged views for better cooperation among the member-countries. The leaders reviewed the existing links between the member-countries and identified areas where possible ties of further cooperation can be explored. The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, also held a meeting with the senior minister of Singapore, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, in Davos today. During the meeting, the prime minister and the Singapore minister discussed various issues in the fields of economics, commerce, and trade, and possibilities for raising a sound infrastructure in Pakistan, which can attract foreign investments. The prime minister briefed Mr. Lee about the economic policies of her government. [passage omitted]
