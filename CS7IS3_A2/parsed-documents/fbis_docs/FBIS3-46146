They also are urging an education drive to make workers in enterprises, especially in foreign-funded and private ones, aware of protecting their health, rights and interests through current regulations. Last year, more than 10,000 new industrial projects were checked on occupational safety and hygiene, according to Lin Xiaoning from the Labour Ministry. Those factories which did not pass the examination have been ordered to make improvements within a fixed time before going into operation. But Lin did not give the exact figure of the factories failing to pass the check. He complained that some enterprises and even local governments had ignored poisonous dust and other materials that brought great harm to workers' health. A report by the local health department shows that at least 5,000 shoe workers are suffering from benzene poisoning in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province. With 4,000 shoe producers, shoe making is a major industry in the city. The Beijing-based Health News reported that 72 to 73 per cent of the workshops in the city's shoemaking industry had benzene density in the air beyond allowed limits. A woman worker was killed by the poisonous air at a privately- owned shoe heel workshop where four women worked in a nine-square metre room. The consistency of benzene in the air was found 20 times higher than the State standard. The Beijing-based China Environment News also reported a similar situation in the foreign-funded shoemaking industry in Hainan Province. It said the provincial government officials have decided that any projects likely to cause environmental pollution would not be introduced into the country's largest special zone any more. The capital city of Beijing is also not exempt from the problem. The municipal government has promised to help check poisonous dust in foreign-funded enterprises. According to Lin Qiu, Deputy Director-General of the Beijing Labour Bureau, the health of about 100,000 workers is affected by poisonous dust in local enterprises.
