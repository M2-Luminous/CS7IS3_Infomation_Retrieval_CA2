Already, three economic and technology development zones and nine high-tech development parks, mainly in the east coast area and including Qingdao, Yantai and Weihai Cities, have appeared in an embryonic form. The Qingdao Bonded Zone is in full operation. So far it has approved the establishment of 102 projects with funds from other parts of the country and overseas. These projects involve a total investment of 63 million U.S. dollars. The Qingdao Shilaoren Tourism and Holiday Village has held talks on about 700 projects involving a total investment of 3.1 billion yuan. As the coastal areas are adjusting their foreign investment structure to attract international consortiums and corporations and compete in the world market, Shandong's central and western parts are taking advantage of their natural resources and abundant labor forces to absorb foreign investment to help boost their agriculture and rural industry. The provincial government has granted export autonomy to all its cities and prefectures, and selected 25 counties with backward economies to try out a scheme of overall economic growth. The province has established friendly relations with 52 cities in 20 countries. By the end of last year Shandong had approved the establishment of 13,000 foreign-funded enterprises with contractual investment totalling 12.45 billion U.S. dollars. It exported 5.98 billion U.S. dollars-worth of goods last year, an increase of 27.1 percent over the previous year.
