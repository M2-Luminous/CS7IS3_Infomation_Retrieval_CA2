Salvadoran citizen Jose Francisco Guerrero, president of the Parlacen, explained that the diplomat's appointment is temporary until Nicaragua, which has already ratified the charter for this regional forum, elects its 20 representatives. He added that Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal notified him in writing of Diaz' appointment as permanent observer, given "the importance of Parlacen meetings." The Parlacen was created three years ago as a regional forum to discuss the area's political, economic, and social issues. So far only Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras have appointed representatives, while Costa Rica and Panama have yet to ratify the charter.
