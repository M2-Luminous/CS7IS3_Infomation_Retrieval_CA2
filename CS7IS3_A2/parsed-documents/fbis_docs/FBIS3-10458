There is "a group of unarmed coca producers who, at the first attempt to force them to reduce their plantations, will blow their pututos [native Bolivian musical instrument] to summon the people." Felipe Caceres, conflicts secretary of the Coca Growers Federation, said that if necessary the growers will arm themselves with sticks, machetes, picks, and big hoes to drive away those who try to destroy the plantations without giving anything in exchange." [no opening quotation marks as published] Caceres said that the coca growers only seek to protect their interests and that "under no circumstances do we intend to protect drug traffickers. We believe trafficking is one of the scourges to affect the Chapare zone. It brings unrest to the coca growers. The repressive organizations, however, should take care of this task. We should not interfere in this work." The peasants declared a general mobilization at the grassroots level after government organizations this week destroyed seven hectares of plantations in Senda Bayer and Villa Pagador, the excuse being that maceration pits used for producing cocaine paste had been found nearby. The peasant organizations have organized "union watch groups" to control any infiltration of alien individuals who seek to mar the coca growers' image. The coca growers have thus managed to halt the government elimination of what it regards as surplus plantations which, according to the government, surpasses 35,000 hectares in the Chapare and Yungas region.
