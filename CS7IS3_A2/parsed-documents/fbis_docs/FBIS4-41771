He told a press conference in Minsk that this could be judged from the wide gap between the 45.1 percent of the votes he garnered, and the 17.4 percent, going to Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. He stated, however, that he would not oust all of the current Cabinet members from their posts, if he were elected president. According to unofficial sources, Lukashenko will offer the post of prime minister to the current Vice Premier and Economics Minister Sergey Ling. In an exclusive interview with Interfax, Lukashenko's proxy, Chairman of the Parliamentary Commission for Legislation Dmitriy Bulakhov expressed doubt about the authenticity of the results of the first round. However, he refused to comment on the rumors about instances of ballot rigging. According to these rumors, in the first round Lukashenko actually garnered 56 percent, rather than 45.1 percent of the votes, which would have meant his complete victory. Bulakhov expressed hope that Lukashenko would become president in the second round. "So, there is no need to cast doubts on the official reports of the Central Electoral Commission," he said.
