The offensive began on 11 October. A gunfight between rival gangs in the Roquete Pinto shantytown in Rio de Janeiro's Northern Zone resulted in shots being fired at the Army's 24th Armored Infantry Battalion and wounding a sentinel. In response, the military unleashed a major operation in cooperation with Federal, Military, and Civil Police to get rid of the traffickers controlling day-to-day life in the neighborhood. The assault resulted in one dead and eight wounded, with 28 suspects ending up in jail--and it should have ended there. It should have, but it did not. Since then, Army soldiers and officers have taken charge of the fight against drug trafficking in the shantytown as part of what is considered a pilot project that may be extended to other parts of the city. Without fanfare, the military occupation of Rio de Janeiro's shantytowns has begun. "The Roquete Pinto shantytown has become a training camp and school for soldiers of the Armed Forces," explains Colonel Paulo Cesar Costa de Oliveira of the Rio de Janeiro Military Police, who has been appointed to coordinate the joint operation by state police and the Army. "Once the work in that locality is well established, I am going to ask that they occupy the Vigario Geral and Parada de Lucas shantytowns." So far, the objectives of the operation have been achieved. The traffickers have been routed, the shantytown mapped out, and the residents registered. But perhaps the chief success has been the trust instilled in the residents by the military. "The atmosphere here has changed from water to wine; things are calm," swears Denilson de Melo, 19, who has headed the local residents association since the president-elect, Gilberto Silva, was arrested a month ago on charges of helping the traffickers. "Now on hot days, I can sleep in the flagstone courtyard at my house, which used to be occupied by `fireworks kids' (boys who set off fireworks to alert traffickers to the arrival of police or a shipment of drugs)." Melo believes that the entire Roquete Pinto community gives the action by the federal troops its unconditional support. Upon taking charge of policing the area, the Army's first step was to map all the alleys and side streets in Roquete Pinto and assign numbers to them. It then began registering the residents. Using its prerogative under the Constitution, the Army relieved the state police of their duty to combat trafficking in the region and began making two daily incursions into the shantytown. The last step was to close off access by sea, since Roquete Pinto is located on the shores of Guanabara Bay. The process of issuing identification papers to fishermen will be completed within a few days, after which only those living in the locality will be allowed to enter. The entire operation has the support of the Special Service, whose agents have infiltrated the shantytown to provide information. From the children to the older residents, everyone has only praise for the soldiers. "For the first few days, people were afraid, thinking that this might become a military stronghold, but it was the opposite that happened," says Severina Santos, 45, who owns a bar in the shantytown. "Now we can move about in the streets at any hour without being afraid that bad things will happen to us," she adds with an air of satisfaction. The "bad things" to which Severina is referring are not limited solely to crimes committed by the traffickers: they also include arbitrary acts by military police officers from the 16th Battalion, who were previously responsible for patrolling the area. "They are hated by the community because they were in the habit of assaulting innocent workers and invading the shacks of honest people instead of pursuing criminals," says the president of the residents association. According to Melo, one reason why the shantytown residents support the Army's action is precisely that it has eliminated the control that PM [Military Police] soldiers used to exercise over the residents. Even the children agree. "The police were always beating us up for no reason, saying that we were acting as runners (delivering drugs), and one time one of them took my bicycle," commented eight-year-old L. To establish closer relations with the residents, the 24th Armored Infantry Battalion has stepped up the medical care that it has been providing at the Community Center for the past two years. That center is now being used as a kind of base for the troops in the shantytown. "I hope they never leave here," says the president of the residents association. As a result of the increase in crime in Rio de Janeiro, and especially since the slaughter in the Vigario Geral shantytown, the idea of making federal troops responsible for policing the state has brought the Left and the Right together in a surprising consensus. On the day following the massacre, Federal Deputy Sergio Arouca (PPS [Popular Socialist Party], Rio de Janeiro), who was once a member of the Brazilian Communist Party, took the floor in the Chamber of Deputies to demand federal intervention in Rio de Janeiro's Military Police, although he does not support an isolated action like that in the Roquete Pinto shantytown. In a newspaper article, sociologist Herbert de Souza ("Betinho") appealed to Governor Leonel Brizola (PDT [Democratic Labor Party]) to request the "immediate and urgent cooperation of the Armed Forces." Even Mayor Cesar Maia (PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]) endorsed the idea. Those appeals did not surprise Army commanders. In a document drawn up by the War College [ESG] in 1989 and titled "Structure of National Power for the Year 2000," such a situation had already been foreseen by the formulators of military strategies. The document predicted that "at the start of the coming century," a "contingent of dropouts, criminals, and even murderers" would be harassing the state police forces to such an extent that the latter would "ask the Armed Forces to help by taking over the tough task of confronting that horde of outlaws, neutralizing them, and even destroying them so that law and order can be maintained." Although total disorder was not expected until the year 2000, members of the Army High Command began in mid-1992 to draw up a plan for occupying Rio de Janeiro's shantytowns, calling it Operation "Diamond." The plan was even tested in brief and secret exercises conducted in cooperation with the Military Police, but the possibility of its actually being put into effect was repeatedly denied by military authorities. But in October, Operation "Diamond" did indeed take effect. Without any fanfare, the Army has stopped drug trafficking in the Roquete Pinto shantytown, and its action may be extended to other localities. The Armed Forces have their sights set chiefly on Borel Hill, whereas the Military Police would prefer to have military help in Vigario Geral and Parada de Lucas. Although the commanding officer of the 24th Armored Infantry Battalion declines to discuss the Army's situation in the Roquete Pinto shantytown, the unit's deputy commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Themistocles Leao Filho, has written an article on the subject for the next issue of OMBRO A OMBRO, a newspaper aimed at military readers. In his article, Leao criticizes officers who supported more vigorous action in the shantytown after the traffickers fired at the barracks. "Some comrades have been heaping severe criticism on us for not sending in armored units and firing away until not one stone was left on top of another," the lieutenant colonel comments. "Once again, without getting carried away and without heroics or insane actions, the mission was accomplished and is being accomplished," he says. "Since that time, we have been in the shantytown registering people, supporting them, and patrolling the area." Unconcerned with the ESG's strategic theories, the residents of Roquete Pinto are again experiencing peace. The soccer fields once used by rival gangs of traffickers are again being visited regularly by children. The troops no longer frighten anyone--quite the contrary. The soldiers are winning fans in the shantytown. "They are cute," says Marcia Ribeiro, 16.
