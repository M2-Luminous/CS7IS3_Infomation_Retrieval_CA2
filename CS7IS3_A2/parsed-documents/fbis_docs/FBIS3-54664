Moral and economic support from Sweden and the other Nordic countries is also necessary in the new situation which has arisen, Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis, 54, said in an interview with DAGENS NYHETER. In President Ulmanis' view the Latvians will not be able on their own to get the Russian troops to leave the strategic radar base in Skrunda in southwestern Latvia. World opinion and perhaps a third country in the West should help to put pressure on Moscow and Yeltsin. It is the presence of the Russian troops which is the biggest problem in Latvia. It is true that the situation has improved somewhat recently as a result of "silent withdrawal." This week it was reported that the number of Russian troops had fallen from 17,000 to 13,000. But Moscow is also demanding to be allowed to keep the radar installation for at least another six years. The Skrunda installation, whose task it is to give early warning of intercontinental missiles, is not only a political problem. It is also destroying the environment because of its powerful magnetic fields. The trees in the woods are withering, animals, birds, and even people are being affected. Ulmanis received DAGENS NYHETER at his temporary residence, an imposing patrician villa in Riga. The house has been lent by a Latvian woman who lives in exile in France. The president's security guards checked our bags. His office is enormous, the floor in front of his desk like a small dance floor. Ulmanis had just returned from this week's crisis meeting of the three Baltic presidents in Tallinn. Concern after Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's great electoral success is great in the Baltic region. At the meeting the presidents -- Estonia's Lennart Meri, Lithuania's Algirdas Brazauskas, and Latvia's Ulmanis -- agreed on a common strategy and an appeal to the rest of the world. Has President Ulmanis himself met Zhirinovskiy? "No, never, nor do I want to meet him." The response was rapid. "Obviously we are worried that the Russian Liberal Democrats won so many votes. But life goes on. Now we will have to adjust our policy. I would like NATO to undertake a real analysis of the Russian election result and abandon its passive policy vis-a-vis the Baltic region." "Partnership for peace" is not enough. A first step toward security is that the Baltic countries be given the status of associate members, Ulmanis said. He is hoping for much from the NATO summit early in the new year. What does he expect of Sweden and the Nordic area? "Moral support, to begin with, and this is something that is not so insignificant. But we must also be given help to put our economy in order, with capital investments and support with credits." Are not the requirements in the proposed new citizenship law not too strict vis-a-vis non-Latvians? People will have to have lived in Latvia for at least ten years, be able to speak Latvian, and also annual quotas will be introduced limiting how many people can acquire citizenship. No, President Ulmanis does not think so. The draft law is still undergoing its first reading in parliament. It will now be scrutinized by international organizations, including the Council of Europe. Ten years is perhaps a long time, he admitted, adding that he could perhaps imagine a "golden mean." But on one point it is impossible for the Latvians to give way: the language requirement. New citizens must be able to speak Latvian. As a boy Ulmanis was deported to Siberia. What does he remember? "A lot of snow. Very cold. I cannot remember ever satisfying my hunger. We were always thinking about a small country far away, about Latvia where the cows were brown and the meadows green and where people lived in harmony. That helped us to survive." Guntis Ulmanis was clearly moved. "These are still painful memories," he explained. So why has almost no one been brought to trial in the Baltic region for crimes against human rights during the years of occupation? He believes that this is due to the fact that the communist period meant so much suffering, terror, and blood that people have still not gotten enough distance from it to be able to judge the guilty objectively. "But the moment when we will be capable of doing so is very near," Ulmanis said. What sort of Christmas is the Latvian people expecting? In the shadow of the Russian election result? With many poor people, even children begging on the streets of Riga? Rising crime? Things are not easy for the old, the pensioners. Nor will all the farmers have a good Christmas, the president admitted. But he still hopes that Father Christmas will come to all, that people will light candles and forget the nationalists' successes in Russia. Despite everything Christmas 1993 is better economically than Christmas 1992. Economically Latvia is at rock bottom, but it is no longer sinking. Now things are starting to move upwards.
