It opposes the harsh terms contained therein. Borge said at a FSLN political activity held during the weekend that they do not oppose the foreign resources that the signing of the ESAF by the national government and the IMF would guarantee. Borge disclosed that the FSLN told the government and the ESAF experts during a meeting held last week to discuss the terms under which the financial institution would loan the government approximately $82 million, that those resources should be earmarked mostly for production and not for the payment of Nicaragua's foreign debt. According to the Sandinist leader, they proposed to Violeta Chamorro's government as well as to the IMF that the freezing of the foreign debt should be urged. To avoid a social outbreak in the nation, they also proposed less harsh terms with regard to a massive dismissal of government workers, as well as other terms that will adversely affect the needy sectors. Nevertheless, the government paid no heed to the FSLN recommendations. Tomas Borge said the nation must unite to face the international financial institutions and their impositions. The FSLN leader stated that only the nation's unity can save it from the disaster resulting from the measures that the IMF will impose through the so-called ESAF agreement. To approximately 200 FSLN members this weekend, Borge made reference to the ESAF as follows: [Begin Borge recording] We cannot go against the possibilities of foreign aid for this country. Therefore, we do not oppose the ESAF in general. What we oppose are [words indistinct], the conditions, the terms set out, and terms of the agreement. These matters deeply violate the nation's sovereignty. Currently, however, sovereignty is described in other terms - we cannot speak in the same terms as in the past. The international financial institutions are now going to decide on Nicaragua's internal budget and tax policies. The high-ranking leaders of the private sector have decided this. I am very pleased that [words indistinct] government its fiscal policy. But if I were the government I would be ashamed if a condition is imposed on me. [Words indistinct] outright violates national interests. Many of the aspects agreed upon, in principle, violate the nation's Constitution and other laws. What is more, it is indicated that if any law of the Republic approved by the Legislative Assembly contradicts this agreement, such as [words indistinct], it will be vetoed by the Executive Branch. We believe that the international organizations should, in effect, contribute to this country with foreign aid, as long as it does not harm the nation's sovereignty and dignity, and much less harm the workers' rights. The outlook for this country is greater poverty, growing unemployment, and generalized hunger. This is what it appears to mean. Now, what choice do we have? It think it would be wise to unite the whole nation, [words indistinct] if the government itself were united. [end recording]
