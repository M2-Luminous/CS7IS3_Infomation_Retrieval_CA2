It focused on ways of developing and enlarging the Peninsula Shield Force and linking radar networks in the member states in the form of an early warning network. The meeting of the GCC chiefs of staff is considered the first practical step toward implementing a number of recommendations the GCC defense ministers made during their meeting in Abu Dhabi last November, which were referred to the GCC leaders during their December summit meeting in Riyadh. [passage omitted] Sources at the GCC General Secretariat say that "the joint Gulf early warning network which has been agreed will not lead to a radical change in what already exists in the member states. This network will amount to a coalition among the radar networks the Gulf states own at present and what they plan to own in the future, provided a mechanism is secured to guarantee a smooth flow and exchange of information among the armed forces of the member states." The meeting of the chiefs of staff committee will determine a location for the command of the early warning network system. Regarding development of the Peninsula Shield, there is an agreement to enlarge it, namely by each state allocating units from its army to join the Peninsula Shield Force whenever necessary or during joint exercises and maneuvers. There is also an agreement that the Peninsula Shield Force command be assumed by turns among the member states, provided that the headquarters of these forces remains in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and that a unified general staff, based in Riyadh, is formed for these forces. Regarding financing and armament, each state will contribute according to the number of units it allocates to the Peninsula Shield Force. GCC Secretary General Shaykh Fahim al-Qasimi says that the recommendations are intended to develop the Peninsula Shield Force and to make it a deterrent force with an early warning network in order to guarantee the region's stability and security.
