[Strak] I would put it another way: The fact that so far, on the surface, these conflicts were not visible means we are ruling the country in a responsible manner. Being in power is not about taking the advice of your neighbor with every conflict that might occur. [Subotic] But the matter has already happened.... [Strak] And it is done with. It is over now. [Subotic] Exactly. Do you expect a counterattack on the part of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]? [Strak] There was no attack in the first place, so there will be no counterattack. Some differences became visible, but to those who were watching the arrangement from the inside, it was no big surprise. First, it was wrong to assume at the beginning of the Cabinet's term that this will be a coalition where everything will go very smoothly, or that the slogan "Let's love each other" will be the coalition's leading slogan. This coalition consists of two independent political bodies. Each of them has its own history, its own problems, and its own political foundations. So there can naturally occur divergences, but I think the will to act together is stronger than those divergences. A coalition is a kind of contract. [Subotic] But was there not a breach of this contract in the "Kawalec-Borowski case" [former Deputy Finance Minister Kawalec who was dismissed, and former Finance Minister Borowski who resigned]? [Strak] The outcome demonstrates that there is agreement over such a solution. [Subotic] And what kind of solution is that? [Strak] We are waiting for a candidate for the post of deputy prime minister and finance minister. [Subotic] Does it mean it will be just one person? [Strak] That is up to the SLD. [Subotic] You said one could have expected from the beginning that there would emerge differences between the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the SLD.... [Strak] The differences that emerged were not only between the PSL and the SLD but also within each of the two structures. That is a new element compared to the Sejm of the previous term. Back then, the main emotions were associated with interparty relationships. Right now, the focus of the emotions is being shifted "inside." We were aware from the beginning that the government's biggest problems would not be with Sejm deputy clubs or opposition parties, because they are definitely weaker, but with its own basis of support. [Subotic] Meaning? [Strak] It will be much harder for us than for our predecessors to come to agreement within the coalition. [Subotic] What is the essence of the heterogeneity within the PSL? [Strak] The PSL's situation is perhaps better than that of the SLD, even though there can occur different assessments of our policies vis-a-vis rural areas. Theoretically, it is possible to have a view that we are not doing enough for those areas. But other people in turn say we are doing too much. There is nothing wrong with having such differences of opinion. The only question is: How are these differences eliminated? Does it not happen in a way that would endanger the cabinet's stability? [Subotic] From that standpoint, what is your assessment of the manner in which the coalition crisis was terminated? [Strak] The coalition's stability remained unshaken, and, from that standpoint, one can say that the parties' leaderships demonstrated sufficient effectiveness. [Subotic] Who demonstrated greater, as you put it, effectiveness? [Strak] I would not make any distinctions. We put an end to the conflict together. [Subotic] So there are no winners or losers? [Strak] That is right, there are not. The interpretations that appeared in newspapers were written by people who are on the outside. It is their right to think this or that, but it is the governing arrangement that comes out as the only and common winner--it continues to function. If it were to collapse, that would be a common defeat. [Subotic] Do you really believe, in accordance with what a joint communique had declared, that the governing PSL-SLD coalition is destined to last four years? [Strak] You know, there are many people who would like us to last that long. If one assumes that the arrangement is not fixed but that it is going to undergo various convulsions--meaning that there will be thunder coming from the volcano but the volcano will not erupt--it is possible to maintain the arrangement for four years. Flexibility is indispensable. [Subotic] What could prevent this four-year scenario from materializing? [Strak] A sudden outbreak of social discontent. [Subotic] On the basis of research and analyses conducted by the government, can it be concluded that such an outbreak is very likely? [Strak] Not right now. We will rather witness some local conflicts and ones limited to specific groups. [Subotic] Perhaps you have an idea for an alternative governing coalition with the PSL's participation? [Strak] Theoretically speaking, other coalitions are possible. But, from a realistic standpoint, there are no alternative solutions for the nearest future. This lack of other solutions should last about four years. Incidentally speaking, it is my observation that society is no longer interested in politics per se. What it wants is normalcy and peace, not spectacles. After the four years during which the nation suffered various setbacks, what society wants right now is that those whom it had elected be in power for some time to come. And if they rule efficiently, they will be reelected. [Subotic] Yet you did show precisely this kind of political spectacle for several days. [Strak] I had meetings with Sejm deputies during this, as you put it, spectacle. What is interesting is that not a single question about it was asked. So it was a spectacle for a very small group of connoisseurs. Politics is a bit like an automobile: You get interested in how it works only when it begins to break down. [Subotic] And this particular automobile, to use your metaphor, has not yet begun to break down? [Strak] Perhaps something was escaping from the exhaust pipe with too much noise. But I think society had a feeling that everything that was happening did not present a danger of the vehicle coming to a halt. [Subotic] You did not fear even for a moment that the coalition would collapse? [Strak] Not even for a moment. It is like in a marriage: Even if you have an argument with your husband, that does not mean you will immediately want to get a divorce. [Subotic] "Getting rid of Strak" was one of the SLD's preconditions during the conflict. Can the SLD have something against you? [Strak] You should ask it about that. [Subotic] My question was: Can the SLD "have something against you"? [Strak] I cannot be the judge in my own case. [Subotic] What is actually the story with local governors [wojewodowie]? [Strak] All of the local governors that replaced the previous ones were approved of in a double way: by both the PSL and the SLD, except for one case. At this point, there are indeed some more new local governors coming from the PSL. [Subotic] So far, you have dismissed 19 local governors. How many more of them do you intend to replace? [Strak] In accordance with the rules of the game, one does not disclose one's plans. An old and experienced politician once told me that you should not utter a word until the decision is "officially in." [Subotic] With regard to the issue of local governors, why do you succumb to local party organizations, primarily the PSL? [Strak] It would be hard to call it succumbing. Perhaps I have a better understanding than others of a need that has emerged after the most recent elections: For the whole arrangement to function efficiently, what is needed is harmonious cooperation among the government, local governors, and political power centers in voivodships [administrative units]. If the harmony can be introduced without replacing a local governor, I am very satisfied. But if it is not possible to avoid a replacement, then to maintain the disharmony for some time period would be bad for everyone. Parliamentary democracy has its own rules: One cannot limit the functioning of parties only to the central level. After all, these parties have their own structures, which means also their own interests, at the level of voivodships. [Subotic] So they must be given prizes? [Strak] It is not an issue of prizes but one of realistic participation in ruling the country. [Subotic] So you see no danger whatsoever of local party structures really determining who should be appointed voivode? [Strak] It is too early to talk about it or to disclose details of decisions that are being made. But to say that local party agencies determine everything is an oversimplification. There have been a great many such oversimplifications. But it is a fact that we have granted the local structures the right to come up with their candidates for the posts of voivodes. [Subotic] Has it ever happened that someone was appointed voivode than what the local structures "came up with"? [Strak] Yes, it has. [Subotic] When was that? [Strak] I do not want to go into that, but I can guarantee you that it really has happened. And, from among the more-than-10 newly appointed local governors, practically only one failed to obtain a positive opinion from local self-governments. Even though we have allowed our party authorities throughout voivodships to influence the process of appointing local governors, it turned out that they are sufficiently good candidates to have gained the support of local self-governments. I should add that majorities within these local self-governments are, after all, composed of supporters of other political parties. [Subotic] You once said: Seeing the way Solidarity is in power, I am convinced the time will come for the PSL. [Strak] As early as in 1989, when the revolution was just beginning, during a meeting with activists for the United Peasant Party, someone asked the question of whether the party will manage to defend itself. I replied then that it is not possible for a social group as large as peasants not to come up with their own political representation. A need for the PSL was widely felt. All that was left after that was the issue of political efficiency. [Subotic] But why did the others who wanted to lead the peasant movement fail--for instance, Gabriel Janowski and Jozef Slisz? [Strak] We simply proved better. They were not capable of adopting down-to-earth positions: They talked too much and they were not doing enough. [Subotic] Let us return to the coalition issues. Does Sejm Deputy Pek express the PSL's position on privatization well? [Strak] Sejm Deputy Pek is the chairman of the Sejm Ownership Transformations Commission; he has access to materials that he studies and analyzes. [Subotic] But you did not answer my question. [Strak] I think there is no need to identify the PSL's position with that of Sejm Deputy Pek. By the same token, one could ask a question on whether measures undertaken by me regarding local governors reflect the PSL's position well. [Subotic] Do they? [Strak] There is definitely a correlation, even though there is no unanimity, strictly speaking. If you talked to my colleagues, I am sure you would hear as many positive assessments as critical ones of what I do. [Subotic] But isn't it the case that the negative views prevail? [Strak] Perhaps they do, but not as much as to manifest themselves in organizational measures. [Subotic] How would you comment on the view that you are Pawlak's Wachowski? [Strak] All I can do is have a laugh at that.
