NODONG SINMUN today says this shows that the moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK are expanding, assuming a new aspect in the international arena. The news analyst goes on: It is not to be thought of to convene an international meeting while applying "sanctions" to us. "Sanctions" and dialogue are incompatible. We expressed some concern over the Russia-proposed international meeting, proceeding from the hope that it may make an affirmative contribution to a fair solution of the nuclear issue and other matters on the Korean peninsula through negotiations after the rupture of the DPRK-U.S. talks. But we will never allow any attempt to make the international meeting a lever of pressure on us. We have made it clear that in case any "sanction" is applied to us, the parties joining it whether it is at their own will or against their will, and the parties backing it, would take the responsibility for this. This is not an empty talk. We are ready to solve the matter through dialogue and negotiations but we will strongly counter pressure and "sanctions" against us.
