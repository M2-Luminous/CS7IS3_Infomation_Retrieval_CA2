Serb forces gained the strategic hill on the right bank of the river Drina which runs through the beseiged enclave, UN High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Peter Kessler announced just after 4:00 pm (1400 GMT). Some 15,000 refugees were fleeing the Moslem east of Gorazde in panic and the area, including the hospital, could be "under threat very quickly," UNHCR spokeswoman Lyndall Sachs said in Belgrade. "The whole eastern part of the town has taken flight (...) towards the west of the town," she said. People working for the UNHCR in the town "can see the fighting easily from their office, with bullets flying in their direction," she added. [passage omitted]
