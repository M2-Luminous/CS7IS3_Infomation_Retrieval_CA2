The ceremony was attended by a big crowd which completely filled the large installations of the Ernesto de Leon municipal stadium. Volonte announced that on 8 June he will resign as the president of the UTE [General Administration of State Electric Power and Telephones] board of directors and immediately begin to participate in the electoral campaign with his running-mate Alvaro Ramos. The crowd exceeded the expectations of the organizers. Many said they were witnessing "a phenomenon similar to that observed in 1971 [not further specified]." A note was read identifying the faction and explaining the reasons behind the choice of Volonte, who was identified as the right person to turn their vision of the country into a reality. It was said that the UTE president shows he is a "tough administrator" who does not "hide his interest in social questions and who shows real sensitivity over the problems of the people." During his speech, Walter Santoro stressed and recognized the achievements of the current National Party administration.
