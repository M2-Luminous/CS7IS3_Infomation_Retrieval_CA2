Answering a question from Raja Afzal, the minister in charge of communications, said the government had abolished the Islamabad- Peshawar motorway project. He said the decision was taken due to lack of effective traffic demand for such a motorway, noninclusion of project in the master plan for road transportation and the 7th five year plan's lack of resources and existence of highways in the same traffic corridor, which were sufficient to cater traffic needs till the year 2005. He said it was thus a bad project which had created distortions in the economy and was therefore abandoned.
