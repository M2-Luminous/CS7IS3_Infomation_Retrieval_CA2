"We do not yet have a special standpoint on this invitation. We are still maintaining our offer of open candidate sheets," Carnogursky said. He confirmed that rather than form an electoral coalition, the KDH preferred to continue offering places on its candidate lists to politicians from the smaller right-wing parties. The KDH's offer has as yet been accepted only by politicians known from the days of the Czechoslovak federation, headed by ex- Minister of the Interior Jan Langos. While the Slovak left today officially entered into a coalition, the other side of the political spectrum is still unclear. According to pre-electoral polls, only the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the left-wing coalition and the KDH are sure of gaining the five per cent of votes needed to enter parliament. In the 1992 elections the Slovak right was not able to overcome its fragmented nature. The method in which the right-wing parties will enter the autumn elections has to be decided before the candidate lists close in July.
