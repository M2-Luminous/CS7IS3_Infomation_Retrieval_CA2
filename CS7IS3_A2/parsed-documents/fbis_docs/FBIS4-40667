Our reporter has separately interviewed Tajik representatives as well as opposition members and UN representative. [Correspondent] How hopeful are you about the outcome of these talks? [Zuhurov] I think the talks are not going to be very easy; however, I hope that while in Tehran we will witness a round of fruitful talks between the Tajiks that will lead to a resolution. [Correspondent] What role can Iran play? [Zuhurov] I think Iran can play a major role. Today, during the opening session of the talks, I had the feeling that all the Iranian people, the Iranian Government, and the Iranian Foreign Ministry--as represented by Foreign Minister Velayati--are all extremely eager and interested in restoring peace and tranquility in Tajikistan as soon as possible. [Correspondent] God willing. Thank you very much. Let us ask a question to Ata Khan Latifi. Mr. Latifi, as the representative of the Tajik opposition groups, how hopeful are you about these talks and what issues are you going to raise during these round of the talks? [Latifi] We shall do our best during these talks to reach a conclusion. We took the first step in Moscow. We signed several agreements and now we are obliged to take some serious steps during these talks. I wish to emphasize that the cease-fire should be discussed during the talks. This is one of our conditions which we raised in Moscow. We have expanded this condition and we will raise it again tomorrow. [Correspondent] Elections are going to be held in Tajikistan soon. What is the opinion of the opposition groups on these elections? [Latifi] You think about it, how can they hold elections at a time when a large number of Tajik people are outside their country? They have fled the country to live as refugees in dozens of countries. They are destitute and helpless. Their children have been deprived of schools for the second consecutive year. There are a number of refugees in Tajikistan itself who keep moving from one city to the next and from one village to another. How can elections be organized under such circumstances? [Correspondent] As a representative of the opposition, what are your expectations from the Tajik Government during these talks? [Latifi] I believe at the present we should all feel sorry for the people. If we all act with the intention of serving the future of our republic, we shall reach a conclusion. [Ballon] My plan is to succeed, but it is up to the Tajik sides to decide a way. [Announcer] UN envoy at the Tajik peace talks, Mr. Ballon, stressed that the warring factions in Tajikistan have now realized that the only way of resolving the Tajik crisis is through talks. He added: Despite the existing difficulties in the talks, I am optimistic about the outcome of these talks in Tehran. He praised the role played by the Islamic Republic of Iran, Russia, and Tajikistan's other neighbors in the peace talks.
