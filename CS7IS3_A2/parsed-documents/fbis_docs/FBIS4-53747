Due to difficult working conditions on offshore islands, the company leadership constantly takes care of the workers' life, providing them with enough foods, vegetables and fresh water. The company is now managing nearly 30 light houses from northern Province of Quang Ninh to the central Province of Quang Nam Da Nang and the Truong Sa archipelagoes in the East Sea.
