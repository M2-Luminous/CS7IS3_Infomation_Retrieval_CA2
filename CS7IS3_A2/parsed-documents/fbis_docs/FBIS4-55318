FBIS4-55318 "dreeu093_p_94010" FBIS-EEU-94-093 Daily Report 13 May 1994 POLAND _O_Personnel Chief on Future of Officer Corps _O_Personnel Chief on Future of Officer Corps 94P20733A 94P20733A CSO [Editorial Report] At a 20 April news conference, General Roman Harmoza, the recently appointed chief of the Defense Ministry personnel department, discussed the major personnel issues facing the Polish military and, in particular, the plans for the Polish officer corps in a period of downsizing, reorganization, and redefinition of mission. Harmoza explained to the assembled reporters that "the most important task for the Army personnel department at this time is adjusting the Army's structures to the needs of a much smaller army. The reorganization of the armed forces will mean eliminating a number of positions and some military units as well as the creation of new garrisons." Harmoza noted that, as it downsizes, the Polish Army will also be increasing its reliance on career soldiers instead of conscripts. He estimated that, by the turn of the century, half of the Polish Army will be composed of professional soldiers. Nevertheless, the number of career officers will decrease, and promotions will be slower in coming than in the past. Harmoza expressed his belief that "a smaller, elite officers corps will increase the prestige of the Army." Requirements for noncommissioned officers will also be tightened, with secondary-school diplomas being made obligatory. (Currently, only 40 percent of Polish NC0's are secondary-school graduates.) (RZECZPOSP0LITA 21 Apr 94) However, the general did not foresee the need for forced reductions in the officer corps beyond the strict enforcement of mandatory retirement at age 60. For the time being, the size of the officers corps will be frozen at the 1993 level. All promotions will depend on the number of slots that are vacated and will be dictated by the "needs of the Army" and justified by the "impeccable behavior" of the officer. (GAZETA WYBORCZA 21 Apr 94) Harmoza emphasized that the change of government after the 1993 elections has not slowed down the process of reforming military institutions. All decisions are made according to the legitimate military hierarchy, with the commander in chief, the minister of defense, and the chief of the General Staff collaborating on all important initiatives. He stated that the decommunization problem no longer exists in the military because a large part of the old officer corps has already left the service. (In the years 1989-94, more than 22,000 officers, including 58 generals, left the Army.) Harmoza assured his listeners that "the Army will not take part in any coup d'etat--the Army today is mature, apolitical, and staffed with new and different people." (TRYBUNA 21 Apr 94)
