Jiang Chunyun stressed: To successfully promote administrative honesty and diligence, we should, on the one hand, launch the anticorruption campaign in a resolute, in-depth, and sustained manner and severely investigate and punish a tiny minority of morally degenerate elements, and should, on the other hand, vigorously summarize and popularize the advanced deeds of a large number of individuals and collectives who have been maintaining administrative honesty and diligence, selflessly dedicating themselves to the state, and willing to be public servants of the people in a bid to promote healthy trends and foster a new atmosphere of socialism. Jiang Chunyun expressed hope that this team would make good reports after going to 17 cities and prefectures in order to affect and educate the vast numbers of party members and cadres. Jiang Chunyun also expressed hope that press, radio, and television units would vigorously publicize and report the deeds of this team to form a social effect so that these advanced deeds would yield positive results in various professions and trades.
