Rabin spoke about the announcement by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], stating that after the Hebron massacre and again today Hamas announced it will carry out five harsh retaliatory attacks inside Israel's territory to revenge the massacre. According to Hamas, it has carried out two of those attacks: the grave attack last week in 'Afula and today's serious attack in Hadera. Prime Minister Rabin said Hamas and the Islamic Jihad decided to focus on their activity inside the Green Line boundaries with a political aim of diverting Israeli public opinion against the peace process.
