The meeting was attended by provincial and city party, government, and military leaders Li Zemin, Liu Feng, Chai Songyue, Lu Zhangong, Wang Qichao, Xu Yongqing, Liu Xirong, Li Jinming, Xu Xingguan, Xu Zhichun, Jue Duanlin, Wei Boliang, Wang Jingxi, Yang Shijie, Yan Eryi, Xu Tingsheng, and Li Jinliang, as well as 2,000 officers and men of the ground, naval, air, and armed police units stationed in Zhejiang. Li Jinming, Standing Committee member of the provincial party committee and secretary of the Hangzhou party committee, officiated at the meeting. Liu Xirong, Standing Committee member of the provincial party committee and vice governor, was the first to speak. On behalf of the provincial party committee, the provincial government, the provincial people's congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference provincial committee, and the people of Zhejiang, he extended Spring Festival greetings to officers and men of all ground, naval, air, and armed police units stationed in Zhejiang; families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers; disabled soldiers; demobilized servicemen; and retired military cadres. He also extended warm congratulations to the seven cities and counties named as model counties (cities) in supporting the military and government and in giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. Liu said: Led by the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, over the past year we have adhered to the party's basic line of "one center and two basic points," earnestly studied and practiced Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, persisted in reform and opening up, and accelerated the pace of establishing a socialist market economy, thereby achieving significant progress in socialist construction and bringing about a new climate in building a socialist spiritual civilization. These achievements are the results of concerted efforts and hard work by soldiers and civilians in Zhejiang. He added: Over the past year, officers and men of the ground, naval, air, and armed police units, sharing weal and woe with the people, have further rendered meritorious services for economic development and military building. Over the past year, families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized servicemen, preserving and carrying forward glorious revolutionary traditions, have played an important role at various posts and on all fronts, and have performed new exploits in reform and construction; at the same time, the large number of retired military cadres have made new contributions to promoting social stability and economic growth, thereby winning the respect and praise of the people throughout Zhejiang. Liu went on to say: The year 1994 will be very crucial for China's reform, opening up, and economic construction. We must unswervingly follow Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In line with the requirements for establishing a socialist market economy, we must seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability so as to achieve faster growth in the provincial economy and raise the standard of living by a larger margin. In the coming year, we must inherit and carry forward the revolutionary traditions; further deepen the campaigns to support the government and cherish the people, and to support the army and give preferential treatment to military dependents; concern ourselves with military building; and further strengthen unity between the military and the government as well as between soldiers and civilians, thereby pushing the double-support work to new heights. On behalf of all officers and men of the ground, naval, air, and armed police units, Xu Yongqing, political commissar of the provincial military district, extended warm congratulations to the counties and cities named as models in supporting the military and the government and in giving preferential treatment to military dependents; he also extended sincere gratitude to party committees and governments at all levels, as well as the people of Zhejiang, for their concern and support for the construction of military units and reserve forces over a long period of time. Xu said: In accordance with the requirements set by the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, all units stationed in Zhejiang, under the leadership of higher authorities and the support of the provincial party committee and provincial government, have successfully completed the tasks and duties of war preparedness and training, focusing on education and training, and aimed at raising their combat capability. In the coming year, we shall inherit and develop the glorious traditions of the party and the military, preserve the nature of the people's military, and promote social stability and military building. In the face of arduous tasks, all military units shall unfailingly adhere to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concept of military building in the new period, and in accordance with Chairman Jiang Zemin's demand -- that "all military units must be politically qualified and militarily capable, must have a good work style, must maintain strict discipline, and must be assured of adequate logistic support" -- shall strengthen military building in an all-round manner and resolutely complete all tasks assigned by higher authorities. Meanwhile, we shall stand fast with the 42 million people of Zhejiang in holding high the banner of reform and opening up, and in working with one heart and one mind to make even greater contributions to building two civilizations in Zhejiang. Liu Feng, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and head of the provincial leading group on double-support, read a "Decision on Naming the Third Group of Model Cities (Counties) in Double-Support" adopted by the provincial party committee, the provincial government, and the provincial military district.
