First by insisting on the "determined" policy of the French Government in Bosnia: "Once again setting an example, France has just contributed 25 million francs for the reconstruction of Sarajevo. The money will be used to restore the power distribution network, following an EDF [French Electrical Company] evaluation mission in the city." The minister added: "To my knowledge, we are the prime contributor of funds to Sarajevo." Then, having learned of the withdrawal of the "Europe Begins in Sarajevo" list while he was still in Mulhouse for the summit, he turned on the acid tap: "The saga ends in farce," the minister taunted. "I have only one other thing to say: Bernard-Henry Levy's list's motto must have been something like 'let us be brave and run away from voters!'" The foreign minister emphasized that current talks are based on the "Juppe-Kinkel plan" developed in December 1993, which made it possible to bring the Bosnians back to the negotiating table. The plan, Mr. Juppe went on, places the city of Mostar under European (specifically French and German) control as part of UN Resolutions 900 and 908. "This is a highly symbolic operation," Mr. Juppe said in Mulhouse, since the person put in charge of it is former Bremen Mayor Hans Koschnik. Support From Sarajevo Although Paris has been preparing to "redeploy its forces around Sarajevo," as President Mitterrand put it, France still has some 7,000 blue helmets in Bosnia and Croatia. France is "the leading contributor of troops for peace keeping" in the former Yugoslavia, the foreign minister reminded his audience. In an interview with LE FIGARO, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic praised the "new accents" of French policy. At the time when Gorazde was being besieged and the United Nations refused to strike Serb positions, Sarajevo's strongman stated: "We are grateful to the French Government for its firm stand in favor of the use of force to bring this war to an end." The Bosnian prime minister maintained that Mr. Juppe "knows the situation inside out." This does not mean that there have been no contradictions in France's position. Indeed Muhamed Secirbegovic, Bosnia's ambassador to the United Nations, pointed out that France simultaneously hosted two conferences on central European issues last week. "While one, the Balladur plan [for stability in Europe] in Paris, insisted on border inviolability and minority rights, the other, in Talloires, completed the job of carving up Bosnia." Nevertheless, U.S. President Bill Clinton told France that it should "continue" its efforts and "remain in Bosnia as long as all potential avenues for settlement have not been explored." Mr. Clinton, who was speaking on the eve of his trip to Europe to celebrate of the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landing, said that "it is still possible that the belligerents realize that they may keep fighting into the next century without being able to solve their problems through the use of arms."
