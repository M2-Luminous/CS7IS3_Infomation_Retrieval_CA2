The diplomat said his country is prepared to join a multinational peacekeeping force in Haiti, as it does in Western Sahara, where it has a small military contingent. The situation in Haiti was one of the topics the foreign minister discussed on 25 June with U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry, who is wrapping up in Puerto Rico today a visit that included Panama and Honduras. Paz Aguilar reiterated Honduras will not accept a massive inflow of Haitian refugees, because it did that two years ago with 250 Haitians who were taken to the Bonito Oriental sector in the Caribbean region of this country. There are still approximately 26 Haitians in that area who would like to go to the United States or Canada. The refugees sparked certain disturbances in the Bonito Oriental sector. Honduras would like the situation to return to normal in Haiti, where the military toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide two years ago, the foreign minister said.
