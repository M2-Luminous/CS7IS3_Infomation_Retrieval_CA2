The Nicaraguan business sector representatives who accompanied me during the breakfast were Mr. Alberto Chamorro, president of the Nicaraguan Chamber of Industries; Mr. Roberto Teran, president of the Chamber of Commerce; Mr. Juan Chimilino, vice president of the National Union of Farmers and Cattlemen; and Gerardo Segura, president of [word indistinct].
