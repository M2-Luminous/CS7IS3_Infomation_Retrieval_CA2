A man infected with the AIDS virus appeared before the public for the first time in Lithuania. [passage omitted] AIDS Center Director S. Caplinskas said that the slogan of this year's AIDS World Day -- "Time for Action" is slightly ironic, because the world learned about the epidemic 10 years ago. Nevertheless, the director urged the nation to rally its forces at least now in order to change its behavior. L. Stribinskiene, chief of the AIDS Center laboratory, familiarized the audience with the recent story of AIDS-infected donor blood in Germany. [passage omitted] By the way, Lithuania began to test the blood of its donors with perfect "Abbott" systems only a year ago. TIESA's readers may remember the scandal when the virus of jaundice (fortunately, not the AIDS virus) was found in the blood of almost all donors in Vilnius. According to S. Caplinskas, the blood of Lithuanian donors is now being tested with the most reliable systems. S. Caplinskas presented the following statistics: Of 19 AIDS carriers identified in Lithuania, one is a woman, 14 are men who have had homosexual contacts, and 10 persons have families with 13 children. The wife of one infected man is expecting a child. No member of the carriers' families have caught the AIDS virus. The age of the patients ranges from 19 to 40 years. There are only two persons with unfinished higher education, six of the patients are serious businessmen, and one is a representative of bohemian circles.
