Seventeen customs officials have been assassinated in those departments during the last two years. As a precaution, the guards now remain at a distance of up to 10 km from the dirt roads used to bring contraband into the country. These roads are in bad condition, but they are the safest and most reliable for smugglers. A sizable part of the alcoholic beverages and cigarettes which negatively affect the economy in Santander Department are brought into the department using these roads. The dusty roads are suitable for smugglers because they are located in so-called conflict-ridden areas, where various guerrilla fronts freely operate. Obviously, due to security reasons, customs representatives never go there. [Begin Santander Finance Secretary Angel de Jesus Becerra recording] They know they cannot go out and conduct operations without coordinating everything first to ensure that they are properly backed up by public security forces. [end recording] "TV Today" newscast toured the area and observed vehicles turning off from the main highway to avoid checkpoints. Official intelligence sources emphasized that the alliance between smugglers and guerrilla groups was formed to smuggle merchandise. Only two highway policemen manned the checkpoints on the road to Cucuta. [Begin unidentified policeman recording] We have learned that guerrilla forces blew up the next post. That is the way things are around here. They operate around here and in Los Colorados. [end recording] Given the roads' geographical location, customs guards do not dare enter the zone for fear of losing their lives.
