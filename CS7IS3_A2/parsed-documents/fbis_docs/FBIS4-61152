[Begin recording] [Correspondent Nermine Elikhanbeyli] The powerful attacks launched by Armenia's armed units since 10 April have considerably aggravated the situation in regions of our republic adjacent to the frontline such as in Terterskiy, Geramboy, and Bardinskiy. The visit of Rasul Guliyev, speaker of parliament, to Bardinskiy and Geranboy rayons was linked to the existing sociopolitical situation. During a short meeting at the Bardinskiy Rayon executive administration, in which Deputy Prime Minister Ali Takhmazov [name and title as received], and Defense Minister Mamedrafi Mamedov also took part, the situation in the region was discussed and the necessary instructions were issued. It became clear that compared to our fighting sons, the number of deserters who flee from the frontlines and are engaged in destructive activity in the cities is not small. During the meeting at the Geranboy Rayon administration building, the region's problems were discussed. The necessary instructions were issued for a speedy solution to the problems. After familiarizing himself with the refugees' living conditions in Barda, the chairman of the republic's Supreme Soviet, Rasul Guliyev said: [Guliyev] The situation is very grave, because Azerbaijan is alone in this struggle. We must state this openly and face it. That is, there is no other state that will give much support to the Azerbaijan state and people. You know who is helping the Armenians. This is a known fact. That is, it is impossible that the Armenian Armed Forces could be so superior to the Azerbaijani Armed Forces. In my opinion, this is impossible. Also, the economic potential of the Armenians does not make it possible for them to wage a prolonged war against us. But, undoubtedly, there are many who provide support to the Armenians. Armenia has a powerful diaspora. Though the Armenians are dispersed all over the world, they keep in touch with each other. There is a certain uniting party among the Armenians living outside Armenia and in Armenia. All these are facts. In addition, there are other forces who support the Armenians and give them arms and military hardware. Therefore, Azerbaijan is now in a grave, dangerous situation. To be more correct, Azerbaijan has no strength (?now). Azerbaijan has been in a terribly grave condition for the last six years. Ways should be sought to extricate ourselves from this situation. That is, this cannot go on like this for long. Therefore, my personal efforts of late have been directed at solving this problem peacefully. And this is how it could be solved peacefully: There should be a cease-fire, and after that the Armed Forces of Armenia and Daghlyk-Karabakh [Nagorno-Karabakh] should withdraw to the present borders of Daghlyk-Karabakh. That is, they should leave Azerbaijani lands. After that, a certain zone -- this is known as [words indistinct] zone -- should be created between the armed forces of Daghlyk-Karabakh and Azerbaijani Armed Forces. International observers and international armed forces should be stationed in this zone. After this stage, our refugees should return to their own homes. And, only after that will we start talks on the so-called status of Daghlyk-Karabakh. I consider this to be the optimal path because it preserves the [words indistinct]. All these developments will be completed within 35 to 40 days. That is, if we begin the cease-fire today, the Armenians must leave our lands within 35 to 40 days. We are taking steps in this direction. [Elikhanbeyli] The chairman of the parliament also met with the officers and soldiers of the military unit. [Guliyev] In recent days I was in Moscow. We have to solve this problem peacefully. We will solve it peacefully. That is, the war cannot go on for long. The war is having disastrous consequences for the Azerbaijani people. I am sure that you will not abandon even an inch of land to the enemy. [Elikhanbeyli] The head of the parliament returned to Baku yesterday. [end recording]
