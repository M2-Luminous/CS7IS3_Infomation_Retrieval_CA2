Within the next month or so, the colony's Legislative Council [Legco] will vote upon his proposals for the first phase of electoral reform, extending democracy. It is probable, though by no means certain, that these proposals will pass, and that later in the year more controversial aspects of the package will be considered. Since the Chinese government has made plain its irreconcilable opposition to Mr Patten and his plans, relations with Beijing are likely to remain deadlocked, and even perhaps to worsen if the Governor's proposals are implemented. Some prominent British businessmen, both in Hong Kong and London, have expressed great concern about this prospect. Since the Chinese will have the power and, some believe, the will to unscramble anything Britain decrees between now and 1997 they argue that the belated Patten reforms are futile. They are even more alarmed by the prospect that the Chinese will respond by squeezing British business out of the huge opportunities opening up in China. These are serious issues, and they have caused much heated private discussion in Westminster and Whitehall. The controversy over Hong Kong coincides with a low point in the Tories' fortunes at home. Minister after minister has lamented privately that Chris Patten, among the ablest of Tory thinkers and strategists, is absent from the bridge in the Government's hour of need. Once Legco has voted upon the Patten reform package, goes an argument heard at the most senior levels, will there be a real job left for the Governor to do? Could not the Prime Minister kill two large flying objects with one stone, by appointing a new governor who might be better able to build bridges with Beijing, and bringing home Mr Patten to bolster the Government? It has been suggested that he could become the principal behind-the-scenes strategist and fireman, or, more ambitiously, could be elevated to the House of Lords and given one of the great offices of state. It is understood that Mr Patten himself has now acted decisively to kill all speculation on this front. First, he dismisses the suggestion that his job in Hong Kong will be completed once Legco has dealt one way or another with his reform package. A long and increasingly sensitive period lies ahead, and he feels a strong personal commitment to seeing his job through. Second, he sees no plausible scenario for his own return to British domestic politics this side of a General Election. The House of Lords holds no charms for him, and the British public would be unlikely to be impressed by the dramatic return of Lord Patten to the political battlefield, when it would be so obvious that this was because voters would refuse to reinvent Chris Patten MP at any by-election. We believe that Mr Patten's calculations are correct and honourable on all three counts: the interests of Hong Kong, of himself, and of the Government. We have been critical in the past of the manner in which he embarked upon his democratic initiative. The Chinese regime in Beijing is indeed despotic, geriatric, and thus unstable. But it remains highly debatable whether Mr Patten's approach was the one most likely to serve the long-term interests of the people of Hong Kong. Today, however, that phase is history. We are where we are. Legco will make its own decision about the feasibility and desirability of Mr Patten's plans. Whichever way this goes, Hong Kong will need a committed governor with visible political authority to safeguard the stability af the colony in the run-up to 1997. Even leaving aside the major difficulty of identifying a credible replacement for Mr Patten, the mere fact of his departure would be bound to heighten fears and uncertainties in Hong Kong, and could even incite the old men in Beijing to act more ruthlessly. We share the view that there is, anyway, no convincing route by which Mr Patten, much as he is missed, can re-enter British politics in the next three years. He deserves all credit if he is willing to see his Hong Kong assignment through. The removal of any uncertainty on that score should be welcomed both in the colony and at Westminster.
