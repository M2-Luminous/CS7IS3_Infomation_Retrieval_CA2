There will be no changes in attitude towards the relations on my part, I even hope to be able to give personal contribution to their further development. According to the plan, I am to stay for a whole year in Macedonia. Having in mind the fact that the overall situation is improving and the fact that establish relations are very good, I believe it will be a pleasant year in your country."
