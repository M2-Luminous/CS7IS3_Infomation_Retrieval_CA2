In all, 1,024 candidates from 13 parties and blocs and 12 independent candidates are running for 104 seats in the new parliament. But the election represents not merely a formal change of deputies in Moldova's top legislative body, but also a kind of referendum on the future path of the state's development. The Agrarian Democratic Party, clear favorite in the election marathon, is in favor of preserving state independence. The Socialist, Social Democratic, and other parties are fighting for votes with similar programs. To counterbalance them, the People's Front of Moldova and the "Civic Alliance of Romania" have come up with the idea of uniting the republic with Romania. But, according to the Moldovan Embassy in Moscow, these ideas have the backing of no more than 8 percent of the population. The alarm over the possibility of more bloodshed seems not unfounded. In the Dniester Region, for instance, the creation of polling places and technical groups to hold the elections is forbidden. Dniester Moldovan Republic [DMR] President Igor Smirnov's edict introducing a special situation came into force 20 January. Admittedly, the Central Electoral Commission is examining the possibility of organizing a ballot on the Right Bank of the Dniester for Moldovan citizens resident in Left Bank rayons. Despite Gagauz leaders' refusal to take part in elections, polling places will also be set up in some rayons of southern Moldova with compact Gagauz communities. The 14th Russian Army has once again taken center stage in politics. After Commander Aleksandr Lebed announced the policy of "armed neutrality," it stopped the war between Moldova and the Dniester Region. DMR power structures are now accusing Lebed of attempting a coup d'etat, preparations for which allegedly began back in January last year. That naturally brought retaliation. In a statement disseminated by the mass media the 14th Army's Military Council drew attention to the exacerbation of the situation in the unrecognized DMR. The leadership of the 14th Army accused the managerial apparatus of the DMR of being corrupt and merging with the criminal world, which has created over 200 criminal groupings in the Dniester Region. Official circles in Moldova and the Dniester Region have been warned that they must abandon their illusions as to the possibility of resolving matters in the region by strong-arm methods. People organizing armed provocations from the Left Bank of the Dniester, the statement says, will be severely punished for attempting to unleash conflict. If large-scale armed provocation arises, no matter who is behind it, the 14th Army reserves the right to "cool overly hot heads."
