Notes on State's Income and Expenditure in 1994"] [Text] Moscow -- So then, the federal budget for 1994. The government's plan puts income at 120 trillion rubles [R] and expenditure at R183 trillion. You can see that once again the population is trying to spend more than it pays in tax. This is once again an obstacle to the reformers. Just how can the deficit be covered? The government sees two main ways -- the first is Central Bank loans to the tune of R38 trillion, and the second is foreign loans totaling R19.3 trillion. The third source of funding, which is the main source in civilized countries, is through state securities bought by banks, enterprises, and the population. But Russians have failed to grasp their advantages and have hardly been buying these bonds, which is again hampering the reforms. On what terms does the government raise loans? It is wiser in this respect than enterprises and the population. Just try getting a 10-year bank loan at 10 percent. You will be referred to a psychiatrist. But the authorities have favorable terms, they are borrowing the R38 trillion they need from Gerashchenko at 10 percent interest over a 10-year term. I would like to see the reaction of the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve if the White House asked him for a loan at 1 percent when the rest of the economy was paying 7 percent. It would hardly be considered humorous. Now to turn to the second source -- foreign loans to the tune of R19.3 trillion. Who will provide them -- America, Japan, the FRG? This means that we take out loans in dollars, process them through speculators on the foreign exchanges, and fill the cracks in the budget with "worthless" rubles. Later, admittedly, these loans -- which certain journalists often call aid -- will have to be repaid. In oil, gas, and gold. Does it never strike you that Russia, which extracts up to 200 tonnes of gold a year, has almost none left for itself? Let's talk about budget revenue -- that part of the earnings of enterprises and the population which is transferred to the treasury by means of tax. The higher production volumes and profits are, the higher the revenue side of the budget is too. And, conversely, when there is a recession, the revenue side shrinks -- as does, consequently, the expenditure side. That is the basis of a country's full-fledged budget. Naturally, our "reformers" could not fail to be alarmed about this fundamental principle. In 1991 production and national income were already falling. In order to bring budget revenue more into line with expenditure in 1992, the reformers introduced value-added tax [VAT] at a level unprecedented anywhere in the world -- 28 percent. This was a truly "revolutionary" breakthrough in economic science and practice. Production began to fall, fiscal pressure was increased, and price-setting was handed over to monopoly enterprises and merchant speculators. And we waited for the economic miracle. Once again enterprises and the population were unable to grasp and implement these "brilliant" ideas. The economy went to the dogs. But the government gleefully reports that the reforms are making progress and that their policy should not be changed. Obviously, this is a mixture of economic ignorance and criminal intent. The authorities of the report to the State Duma "On the Federal Budget in 1994" repeatedly stress that all their calculations are based on the existing tax system -- the same system which helped bring about the production slump. We do not need any subtle calculations to realize that the production slump in 1994 will be more than the 7-8 percent which the budget's compilers were aiming for. Consequently, there will be no way to collect the R120 trillion in taxes which are the basis of the revenue side of the budget. The reforms have also set about foreign economic activity with a will. With a sensible approach organized for the benefit of the population this could, of course, be a "goldmine." It accounts for almost 23 percent of revenue. Twenty-three rubles in every R100 comes from export and import duties, funds realized by the centralized export of output, and other income. Not bad, right? But this money comes from the sale of nonrenewable natural resources. And the export quotas and licenses issued to hundreds of dubious firms help to promote the excessive and undeserved enrichment of a narrow group of people, the growth of social tension, and the spread of crime. Moscow and St. Petersburg are already importing more than half of their food, while their own production is collapsing and food is rotting away in warehouses. It seems that this food is uncompetitive. But the point is that foreign-currency food loans have allowed a group of "entrepreneurs," who have paid off the powers that be, to get rich. The newspapers and television shape the opinions required for the continuation of this predatory activity. They have no time for the "Russian-speakers" working in the confectionery industry, at meat combines, or at enterprises in the Russian agro-industrial complex, which is collapsing faster than other sectors of the economy. What about federal budget expenditure? The reformers, in the manner to which they are accustomed, are talking about two extreme options. The first is the best option, the government option. Reducing expenditure to a minimum -- loans, support for enterprises, defense orders, pensions, and spending on science, education, and culture. Under these circumstances there will be financial stabilization and low inflation. Just what unemployment will be like, how much people will have to pay to survive, how far production will collapse, and what will happen to the defense complex, science, and health is not so important. But there will be financial stabilization. The Malthusian approach. The second option, which the reformers talk about with nostalgia, is connected with meeting the needs of ministries and departments for capital investment, subsidies, pensions, and other spending on social needs. It would then be necessary to spend not R183 trillion, but, staggeringly, R237 trillion. Inflation, the draft's authors assure us, would then be 32 percent a month by the year's end. It would be the ruin of the state. The government, of course, cannot go along with all these petitioners. There is still life in that cherished old dog of the Gaydar supporters -- monetarism. The authors of monetary theories are people with a mercenary and usurious slant of mind. Their philosophy and the aim and purport of their activity revolves around money, trading, exchange, and banking operations. Long-term fundamental processes take a back seat as far as they are concerned. It is interesting to note that the draft law on the federal budget has been submitted for discussion by the State Duma, which is to receive a government ruling [zaklyucheniye] on its actions. Otherwise they might confuse "red" articles with "brown" articles. Or again revive militarism and help idle scientists. Or encroach on the "holy of holies" -- foreign economic activity. Nonetheless, the budget, as democratic gentlemen on both sides of the ocean are noting, is militarist in nature. It is planned to spend R37.1 trillion (20.3 percent) on defense. The largest item in the budget. This money will be used to maintain the Army, pay for state orders from defense industry enterprises, and for the Russian troop withdrawal from the newly independent states. After all, the collapse of the unified system for protecting the state and the unified defense industrial complex along with the collapse of the state will not make it possible in the foreseeable future to create a similarly reliable system to allow people to live in their fatherland without fear. Just look at how greedily the eyes of almost all our neighbors burn at the thought of Russian lands. What are we supposed to do -- hand them over and embrace pacifism? The second biggest item on the expenditure side of the budget is state support for national economic sectors -- R33.2 trillion (18.1 percent). This section looks quite puzzling. It lists the federal programs on Chernobyl, housing for servicemen, the fuel and energy complex, transportation, conversion, and so forth that have been examined and adopted by the government. What remains unclear is the funding mechanism -- who specifically will get the money and where is the guarantee that it will be utilized in a targeted way? Experience shows that budgetary funds channeled through commercial banks and different funds help to make intermediary speculators rich. Russian producers receive only part of the funds. But even then, the leaders of enterprises and the small enterprises, foreign economic structures, and other market formations that have flourished under them often defend their own market interests. These people, needless to say, are thinking about their own pockets. The funding sources for national economic investment break down into domestic (R19 trillion) and foreign (R12 trillion). The latter will be used to buy agricultural equipment, transportation equipment, and medical equipment in the United States, Germany, Britain, Japan, and other countries. That is, as is the case with agriculture, we are supporting Western producers while destroying our own. Compare the R12 trillion channeled by the Western countries to Russia to ensure that it buys their technology and equipment with the budgetary spending on the conversion of Russian defense complex enterprises. It turns out that our reformers love Western enterprises 16 times more than Russian enterprises. It will take major amounts of investment to seriously change the structure of production and renew it, but this money is lacking and, clearly, will not be forthcoming in 1995 either. It will take the Russian economy more than two or three years to get out of the hole which we have dug for it. There are many more interesting points in the reformist 1994 budget. Admittedly, it is already April -- we have been living through the first and second quarters without any legislative examination of the budget. But, after all, someone was preventing the government from drawing up the budget in November-December 1993. There was no Supreme Soviet and no State Duma either, but they were impeding things too. So was winter, and the elections, and surging prices -- what prices would be used to calculate the budget? And so did the ruble's steady fall against the dollar -- what level should be chosen for the calculations? There is a draft budget. Now the State Duma will cause problems -- why, it will ask, is only R591.7 billion being allocated to federal migration and resettlement programs when a minimum of 1 million refugees are expected from the CIS countries? That equates to around R600,000 per person. That is enough to buy a tourist tent. Yet at the same time loans to the CIS countries' national regimes total R533 billion. But it is hard to believe the figures in the draft budget. Who knows what inflation will be like -- after all, in early 1993 they had wanted to hit the 5-7-percent-a-month mark by the end of the year, but, it seems, the Supreme Soviet got in the way, as did people, who for some reason wanted to receive their pay. That is why inflation went higher. How many enterprises will still be left by the year's end? Judging from the size of state "support" and the authorities' investment policy -- not many. But it is quite obvious that, with the current system of taxes, foreign economic policy, rivalry between the regions and the center, and the government's inability to carry out phased and well-considered reforms, the current budget will not be able to improve the economic situation. The annual budget is in any case more suited to trading operations rather than to an assessment of investment projects and serious structural changes in the national economy. The destructive reformers, living day by day with their vindictive attitude to the past and their passion for foreign economic operations, will not be able to reassure the country. They have drawn up the current budget any old how and will fail to carry it out -- as was the case in 1992 and 1993.
