Research conducted by a team of lecturers at the Prince of Songkla University since 1992 has indicated that the amount of such dangerous substances is higher than the acceptable standards set by the World Health Organisation. This is especially so for arsenic which was recorded at 0.13 milligrammes per litre against the standard of 0.05 mg/l. The amount of cadmium in the river was measured at 0.04 milligrammes per litre against 0.01 mg/l while lead contaminatlon was found at 0.02 mg/l. The contamination is believed to be caused by mining activities at the Thalu Cave area in Yala's Bannang Sata District as miners dumped a huge amount of contaminated earth and sand into natural waterways. Prof. Dr. Prawet Wasi, president of the National Sub-committee on Epidemiology, provided more funds to the team of researchers, led by Prince of Songkla Engineering Rector Suraphon Arikun. Arsenic from tin-mining has long been the cause of a disease in Ron Phibun District in Nakhon Si Thammarat.
