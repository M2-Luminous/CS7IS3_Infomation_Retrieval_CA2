Several candidates were nominated for all posts, except that of president. Former [HSLS] President Drazen Budisa was reelected for the next two-year term. He received 914 out of 930 votes. Bozo Kovacevic, former secretary general of the party, was reelected to that post. Dr. Zlatko Kramaric, Velimir Terzic, Jozo Rados, and Mladen Vilfan were elected party vice presidents. Out of 88 candidates, the convention elected 33 members of the Grand Council. Five members of the Statutory Committee and five members of the Control Committee were also elected. Kovacevic received 600 and Zoric 325 votes. Nine ballots were invalid. While the votes were being counted, the convention continued to present and debate the resolutions of the convention, which encompassed many major issues concerning Croatia's development. The long and open debate and the proposing of amendments to the resolutions included many participants, so the debate on positions on the HSLS resolutions lasted well into the afternoon. For instance, as many as three proposals on the resolution on local administration and self-administration were made and a compromise version was adopted at the end. Among other things, a decision was made that the HSLS will advocate amending the Law on Local Self-Administration and Administration and the Law on the Territory of the Self-Administration Units in order to increase the power of local self-administration units regarding matters that are of interest to the citizens on their territory. The HSLS will devote special attention to isolated and underdeveloped insular and other regions, about which it demands financial help from the central state authorities. [passage omitted]
