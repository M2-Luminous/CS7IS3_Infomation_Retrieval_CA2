"We felt both helpless and irked until very recently at war-oriented reports from the United States," Kim said, referring to snowballing coverage in the American media depicting the Korean peninsula as highly volatile and threatened by military confrontation arising from the inter-Korean nuclear standoff. "Why do the American hard-liners have to dump ashes in solving the nuclear problem in the middle of negotiations, and why do they treat so carelessly a problem that is a matter of life and death to the 70 million people of our nation," he said before giving a lecture at Korea University. Tuesday's appearance was the first of a year-long lecture schedule for Kim, who voluntarily ended his long career as an opposition pillar after losing his bid for the presidency a third time in 1992. He now serves as head of the Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation for the Asia-Pacific region. Kim wondered why the United States kept leaking such reports without consulting with the South Korean Government and warned Seoul to stay on guard against American hard-liners. He ventured that North Korea and the United States have made significant progress in improving relations and economic cooperation in talks held under the table. He said he felt Seoul was being left out as Pyongyang and Washington invisibly stole the leading roles in the nuclear negotiations. "We have to look far into the future and prepare because once the nuclear problem is solved and North Korea-U.S. relations improve, there will be a dramatic change to the relationship where North Korea was regarded as a 100-percent enemy and the United States as a 100-percent ally," said Kim.
