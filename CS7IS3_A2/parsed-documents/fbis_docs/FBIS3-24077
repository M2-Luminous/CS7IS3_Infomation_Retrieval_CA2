This was announced by the deputy mayor's chief of staff, Vitaliy Voytsekhovskiy. He also added that his boss at this point has not received the official paper, and it is not quite clear whether a reprimand had indeed been issued and in what wording. Dmitriy Sergeyev learned of it only from the mass media. This did not stop him, however, from preparing the needed documentation, which will be handed over to the court, in the event he does receive the official paper from the mayor with the wording quoted in the press.
