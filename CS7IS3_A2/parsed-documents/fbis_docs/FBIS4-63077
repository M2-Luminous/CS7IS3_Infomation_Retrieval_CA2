The session participants discussed the issue of the implementation of a law on languages. Nil Hilevich, chairman of the legislative commission for education, culture, and preservation of historic heritage, delivered a report. He substantiated the setting up of an office within the Cabinet of Ministers to pursue a unified language policy in the Republic, and expediting the drafting of legal acts -- aimed at implementing the "Law on Languages in the Republic of Belarus" -- by state bodies subordinated to the government. At the proposal of Myacheslaw Hryb, a decision to set up a working commission, headed by Deputy Supreme Soviet Chairman Ivan Bambiza, to work out a resolution on this issue considering remarks and proposals by members of the presidium was adopted. According to Vyachaslaw Kuznyatsow, first deputy Supreme Soviet chairman, the following resolutions were adopted: "On Rough Plan Regarding Draft Laws and Other Issues To Be Discussed by the Belarusian Supreme Soviet Deputies in 1994 and Beyond" and "On Schedule for Designing Draft Laws for the 15th Session of the 12th Belarusian Supreme Soviet." These documents charge the Cabinet of Ministers and other initiators with drafting and forwarding legislative acts for discussion by the Consultative Council and the Presidium of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet under established conditions. More than 130 legislative acts should be discussed (60 of them -- at the 15th Supreme Soviet session) and some 20 international pacts and agreements should be ratified by the end of 1994. To honor the memory of the victims of the war and fascist genocide, and in connection with the 50th anniversary of Belarus' liberation and victory in the Great Patriotic War [World War II], a resolution to set up a memorial on the territory of the former death camp "Trastsyanets" was adopted. In connection with this resolution, the government should draft corresponding legislative acts. In addition, a range of ministries and departments were charged with making documents accessible in Belarusian and foreign (based on international agreements) archives on the former death camp "Trastsyanets," which operated in 1942-44, permitting research, publishing, and film production. Members of the Presidium of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet heard a report by the Control Chamber of the Republic of Belarus on developments in 1993. According to Control Chamber Chairman Vasil Sakovich, a resolution "On Establishing a Council -- Within the Cabinet of Ministers -- for Coordinating Operations of Control Bodies Conducting Financial-Economic Control of the National Economy" was adopted. V. Sakovich was nominated chairman of this council. It was agreed that this body will include, in particular, a minister for administration of state property and privatization, a director of the Department of Economic Control within the Cabinet of Ministers, a chairman of the State Chief Inspection of Taxation, and a deputy chairman of the Belarusian National Bank. The issue on measures regarding strengthening of material and technical supply, development of the social sphere of the Control Chamber of Belarus, and incentives for its employees was also discussed. The Commission for Planning, Budget, and Finances, along with the established council, was charged with drafting proposals concerning the strengthening of the social sphere of all control bodies of the Republic, and the development of incentives for its employees. The Presidium of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet adopted a resolution "On Issuing Credits." This resolution, in particular, charges the Belarusian National Bank with issuing a line of credit of 100 billion rubles [R] -- at the expense of the National Bank profits from the first quarter of 1994 -- under the conditions postulated by clause No. 15 of the "Law on the 1994 State Budget of the Republic of Belarus." Commercial banks were recommended to issue a credit line of R400 billion to the government in May-June. In addition, the National Bank was charged with drafting a special procedure for using economic norms regarding commercial banks issuing the aforementioned credits. When discussing this issue, it was noted that enterprises, organizations, and institutions of the budget sector require these credits for making payments to their employees. [passage omitted] Two posts -- that of domestic policy adviser, and press secretary to the Supreme Soviet chairman -- were introduced to the Supreme Soviet secretary staff.
