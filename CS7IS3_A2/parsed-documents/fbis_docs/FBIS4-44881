To Start Joint Venture in Pulp Nihon Seishi, Marubeni Corp. To Start Joint Venture in Pulp Manufacturing 943FE0607C Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 7 Apr 94 p 11--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 943FE0607C Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Nihon Seishi and Marubeni Corp. will embark on their Indonesian joint venture project in pulp manufacturing and afforestation with a local firm. The total cost required is about $900 million (approximately Â¥93 billion). Nihon Seishi will provide technical guidance in the construction of a pulp mill with an annual production capacity of 450,000 tons pulp for exportation to Europe and China. On May 8, 1994, Nihon Seishi signed a basic contract with an Indonesian Zaibatu company, Barito Pacific, covering the areas of technical aid and operational guidance. The target date for plant operation is 1997. Unlike the Japanese market currently suffering from excess supply, the Chinese market has a tremendous growth potential. Because of its expanding demand for paper, the companies also are considering the use of the venture company as a supply base for raw materials to be exported to China. Also under consideration for the future is paper manufacturing technology transfer to China and Indonesia. This is the first time that Japanese companies have participated in a joint venture for pulp manufacturing in Indonesia. Shortly, Barito will form a joint venture company, [Tanjun Enimu Resta], with Nihon Seishi and Marubeni. The total cost of this undertaking is $900 million, of which the amount of capital is estimated at around $250 million, with Barito Corp. providing approximately $200 million and the Japanese companies approximately $50 million. Of the $50 million, approximately $8 million will be provided by Nihon Seishi, approximately $20 million by Marubeni, and the remainder to be picked up by government organizations. They plan to secure remaining amount through financing by Japan Export Bank and financial and institutions in Northern Europe and England. The factory will be constructed at the [beribin] District of the southern part of the Sumatra Island. The companies are planning to bring the latest state-of-the-art equipment made in Northern Europe into the factory. The pulp factory with the annual production of 450,000 tons represents the largest-scale plant thus far participated by Japanese companies. Construction is scheduled to begin this year. Nihon Seishi plans to send approximately 50 engineers to provide technical guidance during a peak demand period. In the vicinity, Barito Corp. holds a 300,000-hectare plantation of fast-growing acacia. These trees are cut every 7 years for use. The amount of pulp produced by Indonesia for 1992 was approximately 1.2 million tons, slightly over one-tenth that of Japan's output. In the future, however, its pulp industry is expected to gain strength, its competitive power equaling to that of Brazil in the pulp exports field. Moreover, it is located close to China, a country ranking third in the world in the amount of paper consumed and currently facing the shortage of wood pulp. For the present, however, a greater part of manufactured pulp will be exported to Europe. What Nihon Seishi is aiming for, however, is to secure a market which can replace the present Japanese market suffering from oversupply; the company, therefore, has decided to establish a beachhead, as it were, in Indonesia so that when time comes it will be ready to take on a paper manufacturing joint venture in China. As for Marubeni, which handles approximately 1.2 million tons of pulp a year, its aim is the expansion of its business.

The participation in pulp manufacturing in Indonesia is the first large-scale overseas venture undertaken by Nihon Seishi, a company established by the merger of Jujo Paper Co. and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp Co. in April 1993. Shin Oji Paper Co., which was formed in October of the same year, also is providing Thailand with [sashi] technology. Under the present condition in Japan, because of surplus facilities and stagnant demand, neither company is able to gain full benefit from the merger. Asia, on the other hand, is an attractive market where companies can expect rapid growth in consumer demand. They are driven by necessity to move forward with the building of the Asian market which includes China while restructuring the Japanese market. The aim of Indonesia, on the other hand, is to turn its abundant forest resource into high-value-added export items. Especially Barito-Pacific Corporation, which has achieved a rapid growth in the plywood export business, was eager to import pulp manufacturing technology to their country, thereby providing a perfect setup for Japanese companies to enter a joint venture with them. Marubeni is considering the transfer of its paper-making technology to Barito. Pulp manufacturing by Japanese paper manufacturers abroad has been flourishing since the 1970's. Daishowa Paper Mfg. and Marubeni jointly entered the Canadian market while Oji Paper Co. (present Shin Oji Paper Co.) and Sanyo Kokusaku Pulp (present Nihon Seishi) jointly went to New Zealand. However, their objective at that time was to secure a supply of raw materials for Japan as its forest resource just about then began to decline and was unable to meet Japan's needs. For Nihon Seishi, emphasis will be on exports to Europe. What is vastly different about the present strategy from the past overseas strategy is that, this time, the company appears to be targeting the Chinese market. Japan's annual production capacity for Japanese paper and plywood is 33 million tons, whereas the annual hovers around 28 million-tons. There is even a suggestion floated--that Japan should export surplus facilities to China. Although the Japanese pulp market has begun to recover, the present situation, still calling for companies like Nihon Seishi and Mitsubishi Corp. to reduce the rate of facility operation, by means needs exportation of pulp. The total volume of paper consumed in China and ASEAN countries, on the other hand, continues to grow by 10% annually since 1985, reaching approximately 25 million tons in 1992, 90% of what Japanese consumes. Surely it is the wish of every paper company to be able to tie Indonesia's pulp manufacturing capability with a China's demand for paper, a country with the population of 1.2 billion people. China, ranking third in the world in terms of paper consumed, viz., over 19 million tons, has lumber pulp shortage, and it is almost certain that its import will rise. From the standpoint of future joint venture in paper manufacturing in China, Indonesia is a country which cannot be ignored. In addition to Rengo embarking on a manufacturing joint venture in China, Hokuetsu Paper Mills Co. is providing a local company with technical assistance in paper manufacturing technology. However, many companies have been more cautious, refraining from rushing into joint ventures with local firms. Their excuses were that local firms lacking solid industrial foundations are not ready for such undertakings. It is possible, however, that Nihon Seishi's latest joint venture may persuade others to follow its suit.
