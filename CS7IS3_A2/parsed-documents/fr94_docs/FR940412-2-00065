FR940412-2-00065 FR940412-2-00046 [Docket No. PR94&hyph;11&hyph;000] Olympic Pipeline Co.; Petition for Rate Approval April 6, 1994. Take notice that on March 25, 1994, Olympic Pipeline Company (Olympic) filed pursuant to §284.123(b)(2) of the Commission's regulations, a petition for rate approval requesting that the Commission approve as fair and equitable a firm reservation charge of $5.34 per MMBtu and a 100 percent load factor interruptible rate of $0.1755 per MMBtu for transportation services performed under section 311(a)(2) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). Olympic states that it is an intrastate pipeline within the meaning of section 2(16) of the NGPA and it owns and operates an intrastate pipeline system in the State of Louisiana. Olympic proposes an effective date of March 25, 1994. Because Olympic was due to file this petition three years after its petition in Docket No. PR91&hyph;8&hyph;000, a refund obligation began on December 12, 1993. Pursuant to §284.123(b)(2)(ii), if the Commission does not act within 150 days of the filing date, the rate will be deemed to be fair and equitable and not in excess of an amount which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge for similar transportation service. The Commission may, prior to the expiration of the 150-day period, extend the time for action or institute a proceeding to afford parties an opportunity for written comments and for the oral presentation of views, data, and arguments. Any person desiring to participate in this rate proceeding must file a motion to intervene in accordance with §§385.211 and 385.214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedures. All motions must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission on or before April 21, 1994. The petition for rate approval is on file with the Commission and is available for public inspection.
