FR940405-2-00096 FR940405-2-00043 27. Regulation: 24 CFR 811.107(a)(2), 811.107(b), 811.108(a)(1), 811.108(a)(2), 811.108(a)(3), 811.114(b)(3), 811.114(d), 811.115(b). Project/Activity: Russellville, Alabama HA refunding of bonds which financed a section 8 assisted project, Village Square Apartments. Nature of Requirement: The Regulations set conditions under which HUD may grant a section 11(b) letter of exemption of multifamily housing revenue bonds from Federal income taxation. Granted by: Nicolas P. Retsinas, Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner. Date Granted: June 30, 1993. Reasons Waived: The part 811 regulations cited above were intended for original bond financing transactions and do not fit the terms of refunding transactions. This refunding proposal was approved by HUD on June 2, 1993. Refunding bonds have been priced to an average yield of 6.10%. The tax-exempt refunding bond issue of $1,500,000 at current low-interest rates will save section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains long-term tax revenue benefits through replacement of outstanding tax-exempt coupons of 11.5% at the call date in 1993 with tax-exempt bonds yielding 6.10%. The refunding will also substantially reduce the FHA mortgage interest rate at expiration of the HAP contract, from 12% to 5.55%, thus reducing FHA mortgage insurance risk. The refunding serves the important public purposes of reducing HUD's section 8 program costs, improving Treasury tax revenues, (helping reduce the budget, deficit), and increasing the likelihood that projects will continue to provide housing for lower-income families after subsidies expire, a priority HUD objective. 28. Regulation: 24 CFR 811.107(a)(2), 811.107(b), 811.108(a)(1), 811.108(a)(2), 811.108(a)(3), 811.114(b)(3), 811.114(d), 811.115(b). Project/Activity: The Industrial Development Authority of the County of Maricopa, AZ refunding of bonds which financed one Section 8 assisted project in Guadalupe (Arizona), Barrio Nuevo. Nature of Requirement: The Regulations set conditions under which HUD may grant a section 11(b) letter of exemption of multifamily housing revenue bonds from Federal income taxation and authorize call of debentures prior to maturity. Granted By: Nicolas P. Retsinas, Assistant Secretary for Housing-FHA Commissioner. Date Granted: June 30, 1993. Reasons Waived: The part 811 regulations cited above were intended for original bond financing transactions and do not fit the terms of refunding transactions. To credit enhance refunding bonds not fully secured by the FHA mortgage amount, HUD also agrees not to exercise its option under 24 CFR ยง207.259(e) to call debentures prior to maturity. This refunding proposal was approved by HUD on June 11, 1993. Refunding bonds have been priced to an average yield of 5.90%. The tax-exempt refunding bond issue of $2,880,000 at current low-interest rates will save section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains long-term tax revenue benefits through replacement of outstanding tax-exempt bonds yielding 11.75% at the call date in 1993 with tax-exempt bonds yielding 5.90%. The refunding will also substantially reduce the FHA mortgage interest rates at expiration of the HAP contract, from 12.00% to 6.80%, thus reducing FHA mortgage insurance risk. Several liens placed on the project will be substantially forgiven and through the HUD required TPA this will become a stand-alone project to which no other liens can be attached. The refunding serves the important public purposes of reducing HUD's section 8 program costs, improving Treasury tax revenues, (helping reduce the budget deficit), and increasing the likelihood that projects will continue to provide housing for lower-income families after subsidies expire, a priority HUD objective.
