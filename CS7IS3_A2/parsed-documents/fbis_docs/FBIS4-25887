Hou Zongbin, deputy secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, said this during his inspection in northeast China's Liaoning Province on June 6-13. Hou pointed out that the party's struggle against economic crimes is a serious political struggle and has no room for compromise. He urged all departments in charge of discipline inspection and supervision to make as much headway as possible in dealing with economic crimes within a short period of time. He also asked all party leaders and members and government officials to shoulder responsibility for the work while working hard for reform and opening to the outside world. The discipline inspection and supervision organs should positively cooperate with judicial organs in the current struggle, he said. Economic crimes involving leaders above county level should be dealt with resolutely, he stressed.
