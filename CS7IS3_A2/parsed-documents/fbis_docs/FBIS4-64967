The U.S. Administration has bought diesel oil and kerosene from Iraq and distributed them free to the Kurds in the north of the country during the past year. A U.S. State Department official said: "It is true we have acquired kerosene and diesel oil through middlemen in northern Iraq and used them for humanitarian purposes. But I do not understand why that surprises you. It is not a new development. The operation has been continuing for about a year now." The revelation that the United States has violated the embargo when it directed pressure on foreign countries and gave ultimatums to them to remain committed to the sanctions comes as a surprise. Turkey was informed of the operation that has been going on during the past year only two weeks ago. The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs was informed of the U.S. policy of double standards in telegrams from Washington. But the reason Turkey has refrained from using the information in its talks with the U.S. officials on Iraq's oil remains unanswered. Although it has been revealed that the United States has purchased oil from Iraq during the past year, the U.S. Administration has been reluctant to admit that the operation violates the embargo. It has claimed that the kerosene and diesel oil were not directly acquired from Iraq. The officials acquired them from Jordanian middlemen who have long been transferring oil in tankers from that country. The U.S. Administration also claimed that the kerosene and diesel oil were used for humanitarian purposes, stressing that the embargo has not been violated. The reason they give is that it was not sold. Although the U.S. Administration has tried to describe the operation as a legitimate move, it has given Iraq an opportunity to profit through Jordanian middlemen.
