Foreign Affairs Minister Andre Ouellet made the pledge during a meeting with Mr. Aristide, who is on a six-day visit to Canada. Current sanctions imposed by the United Nations prevent oil and weapons from reaching the Caribbean island, but Ottawa wants the ban made complete in order to prevent Haiti from receiving anything except aid from nongovernmental organizations. Mr. Ouellet said Canada and the other three so-called friends of Haiti -- the United States, Venezuela, and France -- will soon put a motion before the UN Security Council, calling for the tougher sanctions. All four nations promised to push for a total embargo against Haiti if the military refused to relinquish power by 15 January. Mr. Aristide won Haiti's first democratic elections over two years ago, but was later deposed in a bloody coup.
