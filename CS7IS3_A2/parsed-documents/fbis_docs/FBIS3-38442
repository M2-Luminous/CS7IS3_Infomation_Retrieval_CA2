In the view of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs [DFAE], this event culminates a 20-year discreet but sustained dialogue with the PLO. It also demonstrates Switzerland's desire to continue its contribution, "which is real," to a peace process described in Bern as "irreversible." Support for the Middle East peace process is one of Switzerland's main foreign policy priorities, Ambassador Heinrich Reimann, head of the DFAE Political Section II (responsible mainly for the Middle East issue) explained on Thursday. He said: "What is happening in that region also has an effect on our country." In addition to Mr. 'Arafat, Flavio Cotti will meet with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa in Bern on Friday, and with Shim'on Peres, his Israeli counterpart, at the Davos Forum. Mr. Peres and Mr. 'Arafat will hold talks in Davos. PLO Office in Bern Since Israel and the PLO signed the agreement on autonomy in the occupied territories last September, Switzerland has tried to step up its dialogue with the Palestinian representatives. Two days after the signing of the PLO-Israel agreement, the Federal Council accepted the principle of opening a PLO office in Bern. This office, however, cannot represent the "Palestinian state" proclaimed in 1988. In accordance with international law, Bern only recognizes states defined by the three criteria of international law. These criteria, which must be recognized by the international community, cover the notions of people, territory, and government. "We have not reached that point," Ambassador Reimann noted on Thursday. A 20-Year Dialogue Switzerland has long recognized the PLO as an essential political force within the peace process framework. He stressed that a sustained dialogue has existed since the seventies, when the PLO opened its mission at the United Nations in Geneva. It was not until December 1992, however, that the DFAE named Nabil Ramlawi, PLO UN representative, as its official interlocutor. In 1981, Federal Council member Pierre Aubert even had a meeting in Bern with Faruq Qaddumi, PLO foreign affairs "minister." A second meeting was held in Tunis in 1985. Repeated contacts were also held during international conferences. The PLO was not the only beneficiary: Meetings also took place in the occupied territories with Palestinian representatives who reject the peace process. This policy of dialogue has often offended Israel in recent years. According to Ambassador Reimann, however, it reflects a conviction held by the Federal Council: Israel's right to existence within secure borders is inseparable from the Palestinian people's right to self-determination. Switzerland, which has been more discreet than Norway, for example, nonetheless has its "creative contribution to make," Mr. Reimann said. In particular, to enable the peace process to be balanced, Switzerland believes it necessary to "support the weakest partner." The 60 million francs Bern released between 1994 and 1998 to help the Palestinians illustrate this concern.
