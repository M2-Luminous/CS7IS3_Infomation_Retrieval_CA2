Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Wednesday, Zyuganov said that the country has become completely ungovernable and social tension continues to grow. Social and economic ties are falling apart. Summing the results of his trip to several Russian regions, Zyuganov said that local officials called for a strong and capable government whose powers must be separated from the powers of presidential structures, which, as they claim, "interfere in the economic management" and get in the government's way. To solve the food problem, Zyuganov suggested "establishing the minimum consumer basket and returning to state regulation of prices of basic necessities, including rationing." He stressed the need for changing the liberal economic policy which has failed. "We will have to use measures of state regulation, primarily in power engineering, transportation, communications and agriculture," he said. Zyuganov also believes that Russia should offer Ukraine, Byelorussia [Belarus] and Kazakhstan to set up a body to coordinate economic management and restore the severed ties. Another task is to fight crime and corruption and restore law and order in the country. Zyuganov noted that no one will support the idea of a general political strike in Russia, adding that the question of early presidential elections -- in September-October -- "may emerge within the presidential structures themselves."
