He described the situation in Sarajevo on Tuesday [18 January] morning as "relatively calm" and "far more peaceful than during the Christmas cease-fire." The general said that the Bosnian Muslim army was at present far better equipped and armed and the Bosnian commander in chief was convinced that the Bosnian Muslims can win the war. The representative of the Bosnian president Izetbegovic also spoke to this effect. When questioned whether statements from Brussels or Geneva about the latest of the innumerable cease-fires meant bad news for the warring parties on the ground, Briquemont answered that "the army generals do not always follow the politicians' orders" and, after the Christmas cease-fire agreed in Brussels, the commander in chief of the Muslim army assumed that the Muslims should continue the struggle. Briquemont called last week's "offensive" by Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo "a sort of provocation." The general explained the growing self-confidence of the Muslim troops by better arms and organization, the replacement of several commanders and "the embargo, which is difficult to monitor." The general said he could not indicate the origin of the improved arms, but on the ground he had observed that the Muslims were indeed better armed at present and therefore, rightly or not, refused a cease-fire. Briquemont called the intention of the Bosnian Serbs to cut off the road from Sarajevo to the industrial town of Tuzla part of this "strategy of tension." "All parties attack where they are strongest and the Serbs are clearly worried about the possible reopening of Tuzla airport, where they are consequently increasing the pressure. On the other hand in besieged Sarajevo, the Serbs are for example not thinking of attacking the town because they do not have the infantry to do so, while Muslim troops are attacking Vitez to cut the centers of resistance there in two," the general said, illustrating the strategy. As for his criticisms about working resources, more specifically troops, the general repeated that it was impossible to apply UN resolution 836 on the protection of safe areas on the ground. "So many UN resolutions do not help," he said. "Thousands of soldiers are lacking." Briquemont referred to Gorazde (where only a few UN observers remain), Zepa and Srebenica (one company) and Tuzla, where one battalion ("insufficient") is operational.
