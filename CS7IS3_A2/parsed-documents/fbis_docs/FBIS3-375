Mr. Ajello told a Maputo press briefing today that 1,144 UN police will be deployed in three phases. This month should see the arrival of UN police headquarters staff. Thirty-six police for regional centers and 327 observers for the 11 provincial capitals. From April to June, 70 percent of the 720 UN police to be deployed at districts and lower levels should be in place. A full police contingent must be in place one month before the country's first multiparty elections due to be held in October this year. Mr. Ajello said the UN police would be very useful for the unification of the territory and the republic's administration. He guaranteed that the Mozambican police should freely enter Renamo-held areas. Mr. Ajello found it very encouraging that Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama yesterday reiterated his commitment to unifying the country under a single administration. Mr. Ajello said he believed that both Renamo and the government were now strongly committed to implementing the peace process on time. He said there could be no question of postponing the elections until 1995 because both sides understood that [words indistinct].
