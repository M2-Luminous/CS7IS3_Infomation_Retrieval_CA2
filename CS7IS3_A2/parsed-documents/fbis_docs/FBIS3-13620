In a statement to AL-HAYAH Sha'th pointed out that delaying the adoption of a Security Council resolution on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre "has created a negative atmosphere." He said that "it is unimaginable that the Palestinians should pay the price for the Israeli crime." He added that the U.S. Administration's insistence on ignoring the Jerusalem issue and delaying the Security Council resolution is considered a negative change in the U.S. Administration's position. He wondered: "How can the Americans link tackling the massacre to excluding Jerusalem from a resolution representing international legitimacy?" He pointed out that the Palestinians have not taken any decision to pull out of the negotiation process...and that the main issue is ways of providing protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. He described the measures taken by the Israeli Government regarding the Hebron massacre as insufficient. He said: "The decision to classify Kakh and Kahana Hay as terrorist organizations has not been complied with." Indicative of this, he said, is that action has been confined to arresting a few people and confiscating 80 rifles, 13 pistols, and two bullets. He pointed out that the instructions the Israeli Army had received were not to fire on settlers. He added: "The Palestinian leadership is demanding that protection be provided, the Palestinian position has not changed, and we will not go to the negotiations before minimum Palestinian demands are met and practical measures are taken in this connection." Sha'th said that numerous scenarios are being discussed in Tunis for the resumption of the peace negotiations. He pointed out in this context that the contacts made recently in Tunis have produced no agreement. The Palestinian leadership is waiting to see what practical measures Israel can take after the Security Council adopts a resolution on the massacre.
