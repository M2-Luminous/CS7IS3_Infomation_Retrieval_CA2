Senior Commission officials feared a backlash of public criticism at the very moment when governments are urging voters to take an active part in the Union to elect new members to the European Parliament. The scheme, first mooted this month by Karel van Miert, the commissioner for personnel, would have opened the door for up to 450 senior staff to retire early on 70 per cent pay. Their desks are needed to make room for newcomers from the four applicant countries due to join the Union on 1 January next year. But the idea sparked off a fierce revolt from Van Miert's colleagues. The commissioner was told in no uncertain terms what the likely public relations consequences of such a move would be. He was told to come back by the end of July with other less politically and financially damaging ways of integrating into the Commission the new officials from Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway. Senior advisers representing other commissioners also raised serious doubts over the original estimate that 1,800 posts, ranging from senior administrators to secretaries and messengers, plus a further 900 research and linguistic staff, will need to be created in the three years following the arrival of the four in the Union. One senior member of the commission staff said: "Who says we need this number of new officials? You cannot say just because a country has such a size of population it should have so many officials. We have to justify them in concrete terms, according to the tasks to be done. Also, do we really need to use costly golden handshakes?" Golden handshakes are not new to the Union. They have been dangled in front of senior officials in Union institutions every time new countries join. First used in 1973 when Britain, Ireland and Denmark became members, they were most recently applied in 1980 when Spain and Portugal entered the then European Community. On previous occasions, to qualify for a guaranteed 70 per cent of their final salary until retirement officials had to be more than 55 and to have worked for the Commission, Parliament or Council of Ministers for at least ten years. Ironically, despite the growing hostility within the Commission to golden handshakes, some predict pressure for the scheme from the European Parliament's political groups. For them, it would be a simple ruse to encourage flagging senior staff to leave after the elections, paving the way for the promotion of younger colleagues. Ensuring a suitable contingent of Union officials is not just a matter of national pride for governments. It also guarantees their influence and views are represented in the various institutions. With Austria and the three Scandinavian countries set to be net contributors to the EU (European Union) budget they are certain to insist on a sizeable number of Euro-officials. The dilemma facing the Commission of satisfying these demands without unduly inflating its own staff or wasting public money is a direct, but unforeseen, result of the drive by EU government leaders to bring the four new countries into the Union from next year. "They pushed to have these countries in the Union," said one official. "Now let's see if they are prepared to pay for it. Governments not only have to give their financial go-ahead for new staff posts they must also approve the special legislation needed for the golden handshakes." Under Van Miert's scheme, half of the l,800 enlargement jobs would be met by creating permanent posts. Of the remainder, half would come through golden handshakes and the rest through the normal departures. Nor do Commission officials believe relying on turnover would defuse the debate. "About 300 people a year leave the Commission. If we reserved the posts for the new applicants, it would mean that when nationalities left they would be replaced by Austrians and Scandinavians," said a senior official.
