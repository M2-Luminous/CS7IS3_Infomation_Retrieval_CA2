Indeed, while the Rabin government is in the middle of negotiations with the PLO on a possible international presence in the occupied territories, the Israeli Army launched a particularly brutal attack on observers already on the spot, in this case a Belgian woman, An Mertens, from Scherpenheuvel who has been working on the West Bank since September 1992 for the UNRWA [United Nations Relief and Works Agency] as a refugee affairs officer. [passage omitted] Israel has never officially recognized the refugee affairs officers but tolerates them and generally allows them to travel round without too many hindrances. Until last Tuesday. On a routine mission with her Palestinian assistant in the Tulkarm region of the West Bank, An Mertens saw soldiers in the Nur-al-Shams refugee camp "beating up" two young Palestinian children, and a television crew arriving on the scene. Trying to calm down one of the soldiers, she was suddenly thrown to the ground, her hands bound by plastic handcuffs, dragged to the camp exit, and left for several minutes, forced to remain kneeling, her head down, with the tight handcuffs cutting into her skin. Shortly afterwards her assistant suffered the same fate. The two were finally released without any other proceedings but are still finding it difficult to recover from their bruises and shock. [passage omitted] Was this excessive zeal on the part of a local junior officer? Is it general nervousness on the part of the Army in the wake of the Hebron massacre? At all events, the UNRWA intends to inform UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and make a complaint against Israel.
