Hello, Vladimir, we're listening to you. [Plotnikov] Good afternoon. There really is a lot to say on the subject of Crimea, and Sergey Tsekov, chairman of the Crimean Supreme Soviet, has just finished a news conference in Simferopol. I'm sure that you'll get more information about that later, but I'll tell you now what the gist of it was. Well, first of all, he was saying that the situation is tense; listeners already will know that, though media reports are very contradictory. According to Sergey Tsekov himself, the situation is tense but under control. There are no public disorders whatsoever, and the resorts are functioning normally. The weather's great, too. The session of Crimea's Supreme Soviet went on today. One way or another, the deputies touched on future relations between Simferopol and Kiev and, as Sergey Tsekov said, they will develop on the basis of talks and, first off, on the basis of legality. A delegation of the Crimean Supreme Soviet has been formed for talks on the problems in Crimeo-Ukrainian relations. But it would be best if such a meeting was held in Crimea. That would enable the situation to be examined more deeply on the spot. The main point at the talks will be the economic question. A telephone conversation has taken place between the presidents of Ukraine and Crimea, but Sergey Tsekov was unable to reveal any of its contents. The Crimean Supreme Soviet has still to receive any signals from Moscow either on the reaction of the Russian State Duma to Crimean events. The Ukrainian defense and interior ministries are continuing to shuffle leading officials and deploy troops in Crimea without consultaion with the leadership of the autonomous republic. They are thus ignoring the law on delegation of responsibilities between Crimea and Ukraine. A picket in support of the Crimean president and Supreme Soviet and the 6 May constitution is still outside the Crimean Supreme Soviet building, but there are less people on the square now and the cossacks have disappeared. On the whole, a pause has settled over the war of decrees and in the relations between Crimea and Ukraine. Clearly, a sort of status quo is emerging before the start of the talks. The talks may be held in about 10 days' time.
