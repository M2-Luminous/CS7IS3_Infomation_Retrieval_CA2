The researchers here studied the behavior of cells after migration in an embryonic cortex and after transplantation into the cortex of intact female Wistar rats in order to determine, specifically, the nature of the migration demonstrated by neurons and glial cells and the positions occupied by the migrating neurons of the transplantate in the brain of the recipient. The label for the donor cells, [.sup]3[/] H-thymidine, was injected intraperitoneally twice a day on days 12, 13, and 14 of the pregnancy, so as to incorporate the isotope in the neurons of layers 1, 5, and 6 and in the nuclei of some astrocytes. The embryos were removed on day 20, and cortical fragments were transplanted. The animals were sacrificed on day 50 and studied. Transplanted cells that had migrated were clearly visible in 6 rats. The distribution throughout the brain of glial cells that had migrated was much broader than that of the neurons and was similar to the movement of astrocytes from the suspension grafts. Postmigration neurons were found to be capable of repeated migration. No large neurons, however, migrated. No donor neurons migrated to the layers of their origin, i.e., neurons from layers 1, 5, and 6 were found in layers 2 and 3. Figures 6, references 32: 3 Russian, 29 Western.
