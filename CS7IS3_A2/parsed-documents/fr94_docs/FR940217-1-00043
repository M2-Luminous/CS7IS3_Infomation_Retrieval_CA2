FR940217-1-00043 FR940217-1-00009 47 CFR Part 21 [CC Docket No. 92&hyph;297, FCC 94&hyph;12] Establishing Rules and Policies for ``Local Multipoint Distribution Service'' AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Second notice of proposed rulemaking; response to comments. SUMMARY: This document addresses comments filed in response to the Commission's proposal to redesignate the 28 GHz frequency band (27.5&hyph;29.5 GHz) from terrestrial point-to-point services, to terrestrial point-to-multipoint services. In this action, the Commission modifies its prior proposal. In order to develop regulations for the use of the 28 GHz band that optimize the public interest benefits to the Nation, the Commission is issuing concurrently with this document a public notice requesting comments regarding the establishment of a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee (NRMC). The NRMC, if established, will develop technical regulations reflecting a consensus determination whether proposed terrestrial and satellite uses can share, on a co-frequency and co-coverage basis, the 28 GHz band. In the event that sharing is not possible for some of the proposed uses of the 28 GHz band, parties will be requested to provide detailed analyses of the costs and benefits of the various choices available to the Commission for the use of this frequency band. All other issues pertaining to establishment of LMDS will await development of frequency coordination and sharing criteria for space and terrestrial services and technical parameters for the service. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan Magnotti, Common Carrier Bureau, Domestic Facilities Division, (202) 634&hyph;1773. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a synopsis of the Commission's Second Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in CC Docket 92&hyph;297, adopted January 19, 1994, and released February 14, 1994. The complete text of the Second Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center (Room 230), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC, and also may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Services, at (202) 857&hyph;3800, 1919 M Street, NW., room 246, Washington, DC 20554. Synopsis of Second Notice of Proposed Rulemaking In the NPRM, 58 FR 6400 (January 28, 1993), the Commission considered three petitions for rulemaking proposing a redesignation of the 28 GHZ band. That band currently is designated for fixed point-to-point and fixed satellite service use. It found that redesignation of the point-to-point and fixed satellite service use. It found that redesignation of the point-to-point use of the band to point-to-multipoint use could stimulate greater use of a band that largely has lain fallow. However, the Commission asked for comment from satellite entities regarding the effect of redesignation on any proposed fixed satellite use of the band. As requested by the petitions for rulemaking from Suite 12 and Video/Phone, the Commission proposed that the 28 GHz band initially be licensed to two 1000 MHz blocks to two different carriers. Since it appeared that video service initially would be the primary service offered in LMDS, it proposed to divide each of the 1000 MHz bands into 50 channels of 20 MHz each. It also proposed allowing licensees to provide a wide variety of other services. The Commission sought comment on whether other assignment schemes might better meet its objectives. It gave one example of a different assignment scheme, i.e., four blocks, two of which would have the capacity to carry 34 video channels, and two of which could be used for smaller video systems or telecommunications systems. Finally, the Commission requested comment on whether a separate assignment would be specifically required to accommodate the proposed satellite service applications in the Ka-band, or whether adequate coordination and sharing criteria could be developed to permit both terrestrial and fixed satellite services to operate compatibly in the band. It noted that the multicell multipoint configurations in the Suite 12 proposal envisioned a wide area distribution of services that might make frequency sharing with other services impossible. Comments to the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking indicated that the majority of interested parties support the Commission's finding of widespread interest in LMDS. However, satellite entities argued in opposition to LMDS, saying that such operations would cause unacceptable interference into fixed satellite services, including feeder links supporting mobile satellite service systems. The Commission stated that its preference is to accommodate all potential users of the 28 GHz band, both terrestrial and satellite. This outcome would be in keeping with the Commission's responsibilities under Sections 1 and 7 of the Communications Act and would provide consumers with the maximum number of service choices to meet their needs. Section 1 mandates that the Commission ``make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communications service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges *␣*␣*''. 47 U.S.C. 151. Congress also requires the Commission, through Section 7, 47 U.S.C. 157(a), to ``encourage the provision of new technologies and services to the public.'' So important is this policy, Congress has enjoined that ``[a]ny person or party (other than the Commission) who opposes a new technology or service *␣*␣* shall have the burden to demonstrate that such proposal is inconsistent with the public interest.'' It has been the Commission's experience, in the nearly sixty years since the Communications Act was enacted, that accommodating new technology and service proposals serves these objectives. The Commission stated that in its view, making the 28 GHz band available to all potential service providers would allow consumers to determine the best use of this spectrum. Accommodating all proposals would result in the availability of maximum communications services possible at the lowest consumer prices possible.
