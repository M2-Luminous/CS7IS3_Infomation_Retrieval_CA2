It was a timely observation. Vietnam is among the emerging economies where Singapore companies and individuals have moved in aggressively to take advantage of business opportunities. But if long-term investor interest is to continue, Vietnam must speed up the pace of its market reform. With the U.S. trade embargo now lifted, essentially this means putting in place the legal and financial systems that will promote investment. The stakes are high. The investment pool overseas -- Vietnamese firms and individuals-- number over two million, concentrated in France, Australia, and the United States. They are keen to invest in their homeland but only as market opportunities broaden. This essentially means reform of Vietnam's institutional framework. Priority must be given to its moribund banking industry, which needs to be automated and computerised. Vietnamese local banks are woefully undercapitalised, with capital adequacy of just 2 percent of their assets. Foreign bankers, wary about operating in Vietnam's banking environment, still regard it as a risky market. One of the biggest threats to the lending operation of foreign banks is that they are virtually unprotected and vulnerable in the absence of a mortgage law. Local banks, however, are able to take out mortgages against borrowers' assets unlike the foreign banks. A mortgage law to provide equal protection must be enacted soon. This is not to say that the reform process has been at a standstill. The passing of the bankruptcy law is certainly a welcome first step. Foreign bankers have always harboured the fear that if a company folded, the banks would have no means to recover loans. But the general uncertainty has led foreign banks to confine themselves to the safer business of trade financing and offshore loans to Vietnamese projects, leaving a vacuum for financing of vital domestic infrastructure projects. Above all, Vietnam should also open the market to more foreign banks. It can only benefit from such a move. The domestic banks will get an injection of much-needed hard currency when they team up with foreign banks. The foreign shareholders will also inject sophisticated banking techniques and entrepreneurship. As it stands, foreign banks are not restricted from setting up wholly-owned branches -- there are currently nine foreign bank branches in the country. But Vietnam's State Bank, which is the central bank, is too slow in issuing licences. As a result, only one licence was issued for the whole of last year, and that was to Standard Chartered. The pace of change must quicken. Vietnam, after decades of war, must maintain the momentum of regulatory reform if it is to achieve its objective of becoming the new Asian tiger early in the next century.
