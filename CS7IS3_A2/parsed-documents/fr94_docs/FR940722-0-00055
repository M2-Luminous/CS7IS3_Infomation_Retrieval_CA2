FR940722-0-00055 FR940722-0-00014 30 CFR Part 934 North Dakota Permanent Regulatory Program AGENCY: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior. ACTION: Final rule; approval of amendment. SUMMARY: OSM is approving a proposed amendment to the North Dakota permanent regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the ``North Dakota program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed amendment consists of revisions to North Dakota's rules in the North Dakota Administrative Code (NDAC) pertaining to preblasting survey requirements and the State's small operator assistance program. The amendment is intended to revise the North Dakota program to be consistent with and incorporate the additional flexibility afforded by SMCRA and the Federal regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Guy D. Padgett, Telephone: (307) 261&hyph;5776. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background on the North Dakota Program On December 15, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the North Dakota program as administered by the North Dakota Public Service Commission (Commission). General background information on the North Dakota program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and an explanation of the conditions of approval of the North Dakota program can be found in the December 15, 1980, Federal Register (45 FR 82214). Actions taken subsequent to approval of the North Dakota program are codified at 30 CFR 934.15, 934.16, and 934.30. II. Proposed Amendment By letter dated October 22, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;01), North Dakota submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA. North Dakota submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. North Dakota proposed revisions to its performance standards pertaining to the use of explosives and preblasting survey requirements at NADC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;17.02 (1) and (2). North Dakota also proposed revisions to its Small Operator Assistance Program (SOAP) at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;01, responsibilities of the Commission; NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02, program services; NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03, eligibility for assistance; NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;04, filing for assistance; NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;05, application approval and notice of denial; NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06, data requirements; NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;07, assistance funding; and NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08, applicant liability. The proposed changes to North Dakota's pre-blast survey and SOAP rules are meant to implement statutory changes to the State's regulatory program pertaining to the use of explosives and SOAP that were enacted by the State legislature in 1993. (For a document relating to the statutory revisions proposed by North Dakota for preblasting surveys and small operator assistance, see an additional final rule Federal Register notice for the State of North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.) North Dakota proposed the statutory and regulatory amendments to its SOAP program in order to implement the changes to the Federal SOAP program at sections 507 (c) and (h) of SMCRA made by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;486). OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the November 23, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 61857), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;08). The public comment period ended on December 23, 1993. Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting, none was held. III. Director's Findings As discussed below, the Director, in accordance with SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, finds that the proposed North Dakota program amendment as submitted by North Dakota on October 22, 1993, is not inconsistent with and is no less stringent than SMCRA. Thus, the Director approves the proposed amendment. 1.
