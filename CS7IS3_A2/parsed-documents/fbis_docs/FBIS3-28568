Foreign Ministry officials said the summit, which will be the third meeting between the two reform-minded leaders, will also focus on reviewing the progress of bilateral trade talks and coordinating foreign policy objectives. The officials said Hosokawa and Clinton will begin their talks Friday morning at the oval office in a small group session, including Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Vice President Al Gore. The two leaders will then have an expanded session of talks and a working luncheon, followed by a joint press conference at the White House. Hosokawa is expected to brief Clinton on Japan's record-high 15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus package aimed at spurring economic recovery, as well as the country's fiscal 1994 budget and third supplementary fiscal 1993 budget. The summit represents the first of four top-level biannual reviews of the current series of bilateral trade talks, which began last year between deputies of the two leaders on the basis of a "framework accord" worked out during Clinton's trip to Tokyo in July. Under the accord, the two sides agreed to negotiate measures to bring about a "significant increase" of imports into Japan. But the talks have stalled over how to interpret, in terms of specific measures, the "objective criteria" referred to in the framework accord for determining the extent to which foreign firms are making inroads into Japan. "We agreed to measure, using objective criteria, either numerical or qualitative, achievement in implementation of measures introduced," said a Foreign Ministry official. "That is what we are doing and the extent to which we can go." "But what the U.S. Government is seeking right now is a little bit beyond what we agreed upon," the official said, stressing that Japan never agreed to set "numerical targets" for imports. Officials said Hosokawa will update Clinton on the various political, administrative and economic reforms he has been pursuing domestically, considering their global significance. Hosokawa will also speak about the "renewed role to be played (by Japan) in international society" including its increasing participation in U.N. peace restoration efforts, they said. Meanwhile, he will stress the importance of a "global partnership" between Japan and the U.S. as two nations that are allies, leaders of the world economy, neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region and members of the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations, they said. The officials said Hosokawa and Clinton may exchange views on the situations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where allied countries may soon carry out air strikes to break the siege of Sarajevo, as well as North Korea, which faces possible economic sanctions if it refuses to open its controversial nuclear facilities for international inspections. The U.S. decision on whether to renew most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status for China and its recent decision to lift its trade embargo on Vietnam will also likely find their way onto the agenda, according to the officials, who also mentioned the possible topic of policy coordination on Iran. After the summit talks, officials said Hosokawa will deliver "a rather major policy speech" later the same day at Georgetown University, followed by a question-and-answer session with students. On Saturday, Hosokawa will hold a solo press conference and visit Arlington National Cemetery for a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. An official said he may also pay his respects at the gravesite of the late President John Kennedy, for whom he has "some personal attachment." Hosokawa will leave Washington later Saturday after an observation tour at the Children's National Medical Center, arriving back in Tokyo on Sunday.
