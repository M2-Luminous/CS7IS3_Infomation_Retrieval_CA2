Velasquez, as well as for President-elect Rafael Caldera, the imposition of price controls on family basket products comes in response to a public plea. The fixing of prices on 10 family basket products via price controls does not imply, in President Ramon J. Velasquez's opinion, that a step backward will be taken in the process of modernizing our economy. This measure is an attempt to halt speculation. Meanwhile, on this same subject, President-elect Rafael Caldera said the measure should be temporary, and he explained that in his government taxes will have to be paid. Nevertheless, the idea is to get those who have more to pay more and not for those who have less to pay more. Asdrubal Batista, economic adviser to Caldera, also commented on the VAT and price control issues. For Batista, the VAT is part of a tax system that unfortunately lacks fairness, and, therefore, in his opinion, the whole tax system should be totally reformed. Here is what President Velasquez said: [Begin recording] [Velasquez] Speculation has become widespread and therefore it is the government's duty, as indicated by law, to take steps necessary to protect the consumers -- in other words, the majority of the people. In the coming months, a number of reforms will have to be passed by parliament. It is not that we will be taking a step backward in the economy's modernization process. No, not at all -- no one is thinking such a thing. Venezuela cannot step backward, because those conditions of fiscal abundance in which everything was subsidized and everything was protected was a situation of false harmony that no longer exists. Unfortunately, this situation no longer exists. [video cuts to interview with President-elect Rafael Caldera] [Caldera] We want those who can pay more to pay more, while not placing a heavy burden on those who have less and, in turn, can pay less. [Unidentified reporter] Do you think that this can be done? [Caldera] There is apparently willingness to implement the measures necessary to save the fiscal deficit and to orient the nation's economy. This economy should not be inflationary in order to allow the necessary stability to develop. [video cuts to interview with Caldera adviser Asdrubal Batista] [Batista] It is regretful that currently those who have less are paying more proportionately than those who have more. This is what economists call a (?regressive tax) -- that is, an implicit imbalance in the direct tax collection system. This situation must be corrected, otherwise problems will occur over and over again. In short, accounts cannot be paid, expenses cannot be met, public services deteriorate completely, and the people feel general dissatisfaction because the state is not meeting its commitments. There is a law of dimension, and I think it is as follows: The state must allocate funds for its expenditures, and at the same time these disbursements must be permanently and cleanly financed through taxes paid by the community. [end recording] All concurred that it is the next parliament that must assess the extent of the changes the nation has experienced and take appropriate action.
