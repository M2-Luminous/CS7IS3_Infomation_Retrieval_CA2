The opportunity for a demonstration to be replicated in like processes, operations, and facilities, and the order of magnitude of the energy cost savings; (Category 3) Energy and environmental impact for the company. The magnitude and technical basis of the energy resource conservation and environmental benefits of the demonstration should be determined on a qualitative basis by considering the impact on primary fuel consumption and utilization at the source, even if off-site. (The emission reductions should be estimated very roughly by showing the relative types and relative amounts of fuels to be saved or used). (Category 4) Qualifications of critical personnel on the project team. The qualifications of key personnel on the project will be evaluated in relation to their skills, work experience, and education relative to the required work tasks to accomplish the proposed project. Preliminary-Proposal Policy and Programmatic Factors and Applications of Greater Interest DOE will use policy and programmatic factors to select the preliminary-proposals of greater interest. To attempt to ensure that a broadly representative group of proposals are selected, DOE will seek diversity in the Showcase Demonstrations selected by considering: geographical location, application type, industry type, and facility size (e.g., annual electricity costs) of the Showcase Demonstration. DOE prefers proposals for projects that are no further along than the engineering design stage. However, if a project is further along, DOE will consider the project as a Showcase Demonstration candidate, if a reliable and defendable methodology of establishing a performance baseline of a conventional system is available. For example, if another conventional system is currently operating, and a performance baseline of the conventional operating system can be measured and reliably compared to the demonstration project, then this would be acceptable to DOE. DOE has identified the following seven broad technical applications as those in which it is most interested in receiving Showcase Demonstration proposals: (1) Applications where new efficient electric motor and drive designs are creatively and cost-effectively integrated within specific mechanical component systems (e.g., pumps, fans, compressors, etc.), or processes so as to yield improved energy efficiency, productivity improvement, and reduced life-cycle cost relative to typical conventional operating systems. (2) Applications where an efficient electric motor and drive system replaces a less efficient heat-engine/mechanical drive system (e.g., steam turbine) to yield primary energy savings, productivity improvement, and environmental improvement both at the facility and on a global basis. (3) New manufacturing production lines where state-of-the-art motor and drive system utilization results in energy efficiency and productivity improvement compared to similar conventional operations. (4) Novel electric motor, drive, and mechanical system retrofits that are more optimally matched to yield overall improved system energy efficiency, reliability, and productivity improvement. (5) Demonstration of exemplary electric motor and drive system management policies and maintenance practices that result in higher process reliability and gradual, but continual, overall energy efficiency improvement. Topical areas of interest could be motor repair and rewind techniques, electrical distribution improvement, and mechanical system maintenance and optimization.
