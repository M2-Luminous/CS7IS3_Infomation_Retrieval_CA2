In the past ten years, the supreme court sent 125 delegations of 429 people abroad for visits, and received 113 delegations of 554 members, the sources said. Ren Jianxin said such foreign affairs work has helped to promote China's judicial exchanges with other countries, and win understanding and support from the international community.
