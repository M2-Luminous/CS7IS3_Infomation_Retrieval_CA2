According to Vasyl Hurin, doctor of technological sciences and professor at the Ukrainian Water Management Engineers Institute, he, jointly with his colleagues, succeeded in developing a project that will make it possible to ``bind'' radionuclides present in the soil by natural sorbents (available in Rivne Oblast). As a result, the harmful elements will not be absorbed by plants and will not be consumed, with food, by the people. The Rivne scientists are assisted by the Chernobyl Ministry and by corresponding oblast structures. Foreign specialists have also shown interest. Eric Nattall, doctor of technical and nuclear technologies [qualifications as translated] and New Mexico University professor, arrived in Rivne. The American expert praised the Rivne project and promised cooperation. Local enterprises stated that if the question of implementing the project arises, they would be willing to invest in this important undertaking.
