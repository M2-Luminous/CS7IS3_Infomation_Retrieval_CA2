The president also described the sentence handed down on Monday against 11 Army officers accused of the July 1992 disappearance of 10 civilians from the "Enrique Guzman y Valle" University also known as La Cantuta as "drastic and exemplary. We hope the sentence, which is in accordance with the law, will serve as an example so despicable human rights violations will not occur again in the future," the president stated after accusing some "political sectors" of attempting to harm Peru. Fujimori pointed out that isolated cases such as La Cantuta must not, in any way, undermine the anti-terrorist strategy his administration is undertaking, and warned that "this policy will continue until subversive groups have been beaten." He insisted this strategy must continue to prevent limiting the Armed Forces in its determination to confront terrorism. With respect to the approval of the controversial law transferring the missing La Cantuta civilians case to military jurisdiction, President Fujimori reiterated that the military courts "are the best guarantee" to ensure that those responsible will be penalized. Yesterday, the Supreme Military Justice court sentenced one general, one colonel, one captain, and four junior officers to sentences ranging from one to 20 years imprisonment. The military court also exonerated another colonel and left the case pending against a lieutenant who is a fugitive. The military court also determined that neither the Army command or the National Intelligence Service (SIN) were involved in the case, and ordered that once the corresponding appeals had been evaluated, the case should be filed and the controversial process should be closed forever. Political opposition sectors insist that General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, president of the Armed Forces Joint Command as well as Army chief, and Vladimiros Montesinos, the controversial presidential adviser and SIN official should have both been included in the court proceedings. Fugitive Gen. Rodolfo Robels, who is self-exiled in Argentina since May 1993, identified Hermoza and Montesinos as leaders of a paramilitary commando group responsible for masterminding the massacre of the La Cantuta students and professor. "I flatly deny that orders were ever issued by the Armed Forces command" to kidnap the university students, the president insisted in stating that "some sectors are trying to politicize this issue in order to hurt the country." Heriberto Benitez, one of the three lawyers for the relatives of the missing civilians, disagreed with the way the military court conducted the case, and he believes there were numerous irregularities. Nevertheless, Benitez said he hopes that in the future a new congress and a new judicial branch will review the case and prevent the guilty parties from benefiting from a presidential pardon in the short run. "This is a process, which for us as plaintiffs, has not concluded yet since the appeals to the Supreme Court for the case to be returned to a civilian court are still pending." He stated it is not a matter of the victims' relatives being satisfied with the sentences, regardless of whether they are 20 or 40 years imprisonment. This is a case that must be dealt with publicly in order for it to serve as an example to prevent any officer from repeating La Cantuta crime in the future. Meanwhile, Jorge Avendano, dean of the Lima Bar Association [CAL] filed a motion of unconstitutionality against the bill that approved the transfer of the La Cantuta case to military jurisdiction. The CAL lawyer pointed out that the document, filed before the Supreme Court of Justice's Court of Unconstitutionality, seeks to invalidate the so-called "La Cantuta" bill since he believes the norm "is not valid, and nonexistent also." He said the previously mentioned bill violates several legal principles. At any rate, he disclosed that with a sentence already having been rendered by a military court, "it will be very difficult to return it to civilian jurisdiction."
