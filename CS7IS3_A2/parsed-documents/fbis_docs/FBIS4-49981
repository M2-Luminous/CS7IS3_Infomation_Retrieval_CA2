He asked the Buddhists in Hong Kong to rest assured of the prospects for religions in Hong Kong after 1997. Chen Ziying said that, according to the Basic Law, the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] Government will not impose any restriction on religious freedom. People with religious beliefs, including Buddhists, will be able to openly carry out missionary work and hold various religious activities that are not in violation of SAR laws. Temples, hospitals, and other rights and properties of religious organizations will not be affected, and will be protected by law. In addition, religious organizations and individuals in Hong Kong may continue to maintain and develop relations with their counterpart organizations and individuals in other areas. Chen Ziying said that between the Hong Kong and mainland Buddhist organizations, Buddhists should show mutual respect before the Buddha, and there will be no subordinative relationship between the two sides. The religious circles in Hong Kong and the mainland are welcome to visit each other frequently so that they can increase exchanges. Zhao Bingxin, director of the Hong Kong Social and Cultural Affairs Department of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, was present at the meeting. In the evening, Chen Ziying and Zhao Bingxin invited the 12-member delegation headed by Rev Kok-kwong to the Hong Kong-Macao Center.
