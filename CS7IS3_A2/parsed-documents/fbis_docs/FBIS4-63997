They addressed a joint news conference here after today's talks. Yesterday, Grachev started his official two-day visit to Belgium. It was mostly thanks to Delcroix that the Russian defence minister met for the first with his NATO counterparts on Tuesday. At that meeting, Grachev delivered an hour-long report on Russia's new defence doctrine and expounded upon Moscow's views of European security issues. Apart from this, he delivered to NATO Russia's proposals for parameters of partnership with this organization. At today's news conference Grachev told reporters that Russia would sign shortly a framework document of NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, but only proceeding from the said parameters. The date of signing depends on how soon NATO will consider the Russian proposals. Their analysis at the expert level is being already carried out. Then, Russia expects NATO ministers to discuss and approve the proposals. After this, the two sides will just have to settle technical issues. "Now all depends not on Russia only", the minister pointed out, stressing the point at issue was exactly proposals, not any terms. When asked about Russia's idea of a mechanism of consultations with NATO, Grachev said since Russia was not a member of the North Atlantic Alliance, it had no right to demand to be informed and consulted on what country should be admitted to NATO and when, but certainly it will make its own conclusions about this. Consultations with NATO should above all concern peacekeeping missions. In this connection, the Russian defence minister recalled that he had criticized NATO's air strike upon Bosnian Serb positions, which was launched without preliminary consultations with Russia. "Russia does not only want but will remain a great power", Grachev said. But it does not mean that Russia intends to exert pressure upon Central and East European countries or to direct them. "We favour equal partnership with these states upon mutual consent", he pointed out, adding that Russia views cooperation with other CIS countries as a top priority. The Belgian defence minister told reporters that Grachev's meetings with NATO senior officials had promoted better understanding between Russia and the North Atlantic Alliance. Delcroix believes Russia is highly influential in the world and it requires an adequate treatment if NATO countries would like it to join the Partnership for Peace Programme. Delcroix also reported that today's talks, at which the two ministers addressed each other not only as colleagues but as personal friends as well, concentrated on the NATO's partnership initiative, Russia's military doctrine and the situation in Bosnia.
