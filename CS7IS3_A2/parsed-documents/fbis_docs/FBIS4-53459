FBIS4-53459 "dreas097_a_94029" FBIS-EAS-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Energy Demand To Be Curbed Toward 2010 Energy Demand To Be Curbed Toward 2010 OW1905085294 Tokyo KYODO in English 0820 GMT 19 May 94 OW1905085294 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- The Natural Resources and Energy Agency will pursue a policy aimed at limiting the annual growth of energy consumption at around 1 percent by 2010, a senior agency official said Thursday [19 May]. The policy is designed to promote energy conservation in the context of preserving the global environment, the official said on condition of anonymity. The agency is part of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. The official said the policy will be clarified in an interim report forecasting Japan's long-term energy supply and demand. It will be released by the advisory committee for energy in May or June. The panel advises the trade minister. Energy conservation in the new policy will focus on consumption by households and transportation sectors, the official said. New sources of energy also should be used to improve energy saving, including solar power, recycled use of waste materials and cogeneration systems. The official said the "summer time" daylight saving system should be introduced in Japan. He said Japan's energy consumption would grow at an annual rate of around 1.5 percent toward 2010 if the current energy policy is maintained. On the bargain sale of gasoline by an unlicensed gas station near Nagoya, the agency official said it is "timely" to discuss the validity of a law governing the operation of gas stations. The gas station was not granted a business license by MITI because it did not clarify the wholesale sources of its products, a requirement for running a gas station in Japan. The station, however, began selling gasoline in defiance of MITI's instructions. Under the existing system, to get a license a retailer must adhere to the requirement, introduced as a way of securing a stable supply of products, the official said. The official said he understands the regulation is intended to prevent excessive price-cutting competition among gas stations. But he added there appears to be room to discuss the validity of maintaining the regulation.
