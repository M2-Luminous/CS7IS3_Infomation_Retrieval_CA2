History has accelerated its pace, making mankind both a participant in and an eyewitness to global -- in terms of their consequences- - changes in the world structure. The world has become increasingly more open and interdependent. The epoch of the two systems and military-political blocs' great confrontation has fallen into oblivion. The global community of nations has been joined on par by many peoples who have established their new independent states. Concurrently positive changes on the European and Asian continents have been accompanied by emerging new challenges and dangers: interethnic conflicts, which are becoming sharper; emergence of security vacuum zones; attempts to destabilize the newly independent nations from outside and setting the spheres of influence are among them. All these demand urgent and adequate measures and decisions. While adhering to the principles of the world community and global security's indivisibility Ukraine and Kazakhstan believe that threats to any country's national security pose a danger for general security and peace the world over. The world's politics should be guided by axiomatic principles of one's own security through security of all and domestic stability contributing to global stability. Concerns which exist in the field of national security of a number of states may be eliminated only by way of estimating an inter-regional universal security system, extending from Vancouver to Vladivostok and including all the nations without exception. Such international organizations and institutions as the UN, CSCE, NATO, the North Atlantic Alliance Council and others play an important role in this process. The concept of Partnership for Peace, which was endorsed by NATO member nations' heads of state, has great potential. Its realization will allow to expand the framework of stability peace and trust among nations. The past decade's major event was the establishment of new independent states on the former Soviet Union's territory. Wishing to construct new civilized relations among them based on sovereign equality, parity, good neighbourliness, noninterference and mutual respect are nations who have behind them a common long and thorny historical road decided to set up their commonwealth to assist each other in overcoming the hard consequences of the totalitarian epoch and retain their good and mutually beneficial relations which really promote and consolidate friendship among our peoples. The Commonwealth of Independent States has existed for over two years now. Its evolution has been difficult and controversial, with intermittent instability and crisis periods sometimes aggravating into sharp conflict situations. Yet the two years of the CIS existence may be referred to, with all the due responsibility, as having summarized the fact that global cataclysms and (?societal) turmoil on the former USSR's territory were avoided, which had been forecast by some politicians. The process of the new nations accedance to the world community was accelerated and foundations laid for consolidation of our major priceless gain, that independence and the right to dispose of one's own destiny. Ukraine and Kazakhstan are both multiethnic entities intent on constructing their open democratic societies who base their development on retention and consolidation of interethnic and social peace and accord. We are aware of the tremendous significance of keeping civic and interethnic stability in our nations and other CIS member states and declare our full determination to further continue this course. In view of this deep concerns have been generated by certain trends which have surfaced in the international situation both within the CIS as a whole and in some of its individual member nations. We have no right to shut our eyes to the fact that of late irresponsible forces have been active which are calling for the totalitarian regime's reanimation igniting interethnic strife, xenophobia, chauvinism, nationalism, and propagating destructive ideas which contradict the UN Charter and the CSCE principles. These alien to civilized international relations phenomena have recently been condemned by foreign ministers of the CSCE member nations and the CIS heads of state. We declare with full responsibility that any support for aggressive national patriotism, imperial chauvinism, national exclusiveness, and intolerance which are being propagated by certain extremist political circles may result in destructive consequences of global dimensions. We draw the attention of all sober minded politicians, CIS peoples, the entire world community to the need of joining efforts in a bid to prevent further dissemination of ideas based upon propagation of fascism, calls to imperial expansionism and attempts at their realization which pose a threat not only to the new independent nations but to the entire world. Ukraine and Kazakhstan, who have voluntarily chosen a road to getting rid of the most devastating and lethal weapons in human history, nuclear weapons, can not but feel deep concern over their security, which they do not think as possible outside the context of universal international security. We appeal to all interested nations and governments, democratic forces, and the world public to double their efforts directed toward construction of a safer and more stable world based on cooperation, mutual assistance, and deep mutual respect among nations. Ukraine and Kazakhstan, acting jointly or parallelly [as heard] will strive for creation of an atmosphere of mutual understanding and trust, will engage in mutual beneficial trade and economic cooperation, and will make their weighty contributions to consolidation of regional and global security and stability. The text of the declaration issued jointly by President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine and Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan.
