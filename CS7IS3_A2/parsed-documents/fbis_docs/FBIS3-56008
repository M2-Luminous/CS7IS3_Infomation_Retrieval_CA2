As is known, it did not quite satisfy these countries. The reasons for this lie both in foreign and internal politics: The United States has a large Polish population. They constitute a powerful political and electoral lobby which is closely watching the administration's approach to Poland's admission to NATO. It was not accidental that on the eve of Clinton's European tour, U.S. Vice President Al Gore offered an explanation of U.S. policy in Milwaukee, of all places, with its large Polish community. Reading Clinton's speech (the president had to give the text of his speech to Gore following the unexpected death of his mother), Gore laid special emphasis on the fact that the Partnership for Peace is a real step toward the admission of Poland and other East European countries to full NATO membership. This argument presumably became the main one in the course of Clinton's meetings with the East European leaders in Prague. In Moscow, on the other hand, it would be most logical for Clinton to present the "second face" of NATO's two-faceted initiative and insist that the United States has fully taken Russia's interests into account and has sought to avoid such decisions that might be perceived as attempted geopolitical isolation. Incidentally, there is a considerable grain of truth in this: It was the U.S. Administration that initiated the idea of partnership, having been confronted with an extremely complicated problem of simultaneously taking into account the interests of East Europe and Russia and also its own interests and the interests of its bloc allies as well as NATO's real capabilities. The authors of the idea are apparently General John Shalikashvili, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Strobe Talbott, until recently in charge of the entire Russian policy in the U.S. State Department, who was then appointed first deputy to Secretary of State Christopher. The Clinton administration should be given its due: In a fairly complex and extremely conflicting situation it has chosen apparently the sole correct option. It was also dictated by the fact that politically Bill Clinton is almost inseparably linked to Boris Yeltsin and his fate. Up to now Russia's relatively successful advance down the path of democratic development has been seen as one of the major success stories for the administration -- which, incidentally, have been few and far between on the foreign political scene. Clinton has invested such political capital in Boris Yeltsin that should Yeltsin collapse, Clinton will suffer a colossal defeat. Along with the failures in Somalia and Bosnia, this could drastically undermine the positions and authority of his administration not only in international affairs but in America itself. Already now Clinton's unqualified support for President Yeltsin is drawing sharp criticism in the United States, which is rising as the situation in Russia destabilizes. Therefore it is not ruled out that as a result of the trip the administration's line will be adjusted somewhat. Prior to the visit the White House announced that the president intends to meet with representatives of broad political forces, including communists but excluding Zhirinovskiy. Strobe Talbott also made it clear that the administration intends to expand contacts with representatives of the democratic opposition and stop focusing on Yeltsin alone. Meanwhile the "Z factor," as Western journalists have dubbed Zhirinovskiy, is turning for Clinton into a perennial headache and a major element in political decisionmaking. Practically the entire U.S. press is talking about the revival of imperial nationalism in Russia, finding confirmation for this even in deeds and statements by Yeltsin and Kozyrev. Clinton is being called upon to do away with the legacy of Yalta, that is to say, with consideration for Russian interests with respect to Eastern Europe. The intensity of debate in the United States in fairly high. Moreover, there is no unity within the administration itself: According to some reports, even prior to Zhirinovskiy's victory Secretary of State Christopher spoke in favor of the NATO Council session in Brussels giving a clearer signal to the East Europeans that they would soon be admitted to NATO. Thus, Russian-American relations are again being subjected to a very serious test of durability, when the public background in the West in clearly unfavorable for Russia. Will Clinton manage to find that solely correct note that will allow him to avoid the traps and dangers involved in supporting such a leader as Boris Yeltsin and at the same time preserve the existing capital of relations and links? For the U.S. side it will apparently be especially important to avoid a fundamental and at the same time fairly probable mistake -- to take Russia's aspiration to maintain its legitimate national interests for the consequence of a sharp strengthening in the positions of Zhirinovskiy and hard-line forces. Such a temptation in the United States and the West as a whole today is extremely great. Yet there can be no better aid to Zhirinovskiy and company than to deny Russia's right to its own policy and its own national priorities.
