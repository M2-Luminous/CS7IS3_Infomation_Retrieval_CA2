The government intends to hold such informal talks as early as this week, and coordination is in progress on dispatching to Washington either Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi or Deputy Minister Sozaburo Okamatsu of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]. Since the United States has indicated that "the door is still open" (as stated by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor), the government believes that "the United States will not negate resumption of the framework talks" (as stated by a MITI source). At the Japan-U.S. summits held last February, the framework talks were suspended because of a failure to settle differences in views between the two countries on the issue of objective criteria. While the United States insisted on establishing objectives for the future, Japan maintained that targets should be limited to results achieved in the past. Therefore, the government maintains: To resume the talks, "efforts should be made to settle the issue of objective criteria through informal talks," otherwise "the talks would end divisively again" (as stated by a government source). The government has thus decided on holding informal talks with the United States, focusing on the objective criteria issue. Objective criteria are supposed to be decided separately for various priority areas brought up in the framework talks, including telecommunications, government procurement of medical equipment, insurance, and automobiles and auto parts. However, the Japanese Government plans to conduct informal talks by focusing on such fields as government procurement and insurance. Since progress was made in these two fields at the recent summits, and the two countries have almost reached an accord in these two areas, the government intends to achieve a breakthrough in these fields, thereby bringing the deadlock in the framework talks to an end. At the talks held last February, the United States made an informal proposal for signing a compromise agreement, which states that while Japan will not be asked to indicate numerical figures as future targets, the United States will agree to the statement that "Japan will respect the upward trends established in the past." Based on this proposal, the government plans to seek points of compromise. However, since Japan and the United States have salient views on the subject of automobiles and auto parts, the government actually intends to postpone talks on the issue. At the same time, the government intends to give a briefing on details of its new package of external economic measures agreed upon in late March, thereby stressing Japan's position on tackling the market-opening issue. The government will then inform the United States and seek its understanding that Japan has postponed its conclusions on its macroeconomic policies, but that it will work out the details by the end of June. Moreover, the government also intends to point out the fact that the "Report on Foreign Trade Barriers" issued in late March by the U.S. Trade Representative lists "barriers" in 43 areas of trade in Japan. Strong dissatisfaction has been voiced within the government, maintaining that "the report claims to point out barriers in areas which have virtually been resolved in the package."
