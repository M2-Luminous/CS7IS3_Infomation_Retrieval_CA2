However, it added, if more money is owed, "any amounts underpaid will be paid." Clinton told reporters Friday [18 March] that any mistakes on his and his wife's tax returns "certainly were not intentional.... I don't think we owe any extra taxes, but I'm not sure yet." His comments came amid increasing indications that the Clintons may have underpaid their income taxes over the past 15 years. The records are being scrutinized as part of the special counsel's investigation into the Clintons' investments in the 1980s in the Whitewater Development Corp. Inc. in Arkansas. The Clintons' tax returns "have been professionally prepared by qualified CPA's (certified public accountants), and we have confidence that they were correctly done," the White House said in a statement. "Should any facts emerge that indicate that they owe more or less in taxes, any amounts underpaid will be paid," the statement added. David Kendall, the Clintons' personal lawyer, is reviewing the records with regard to their taxes, said a White House aide who declined to be named. The official added that it was too early to draw conclusions on whether the Clintons owe money. Vincent Foster, the late deputy White House counsel and Mrs. Clinton's law partner in Arkansas, discovered that the Whitewater Development Corp., which was half owned by the Clintons, had not filed tax returns for three years, according to the March 21 "TIME" magazine.
