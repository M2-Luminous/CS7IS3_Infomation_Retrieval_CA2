The full-scale exercise will involve army, navy, and air force units, and conclude with a landing on the northern Sporades Island of Skyros. The American units will be led by a helicopter carrier. The joint U.S.-Greek maneuver will be similar to an all-forces exercise held by American and Greek units on Greek territory last year under the code name "Alexandros." Preparations are also being finalized for a full-scale exercise in the Central Aegean involving all branches of the Greek Armed Forces later this month. This exercise will begin on January 17, and conclude on January 22 with a landing at Argolis. It will be the first military exercise comprising the army, navy, and air force in several years.
