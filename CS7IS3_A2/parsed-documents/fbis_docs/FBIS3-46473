Troops of Burma's ruling State Law and Order Council (SLORC) "resumed their offensive against the Karen National Union on December 29," said KNU spokesman Arthur Shwe. He described the clashes as "fierce." "Casualties on both sides are not yet known," he said. The fighting resumed as an attempt this month at political dialogue between the SLORC and opposition groups appeared to have aborted, political analysts said. Burmese troops launched their assault on KNU positions around Saw Hta, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of Mannerplaw, the Karen headquarters and that of the Burmese opposition in exile, bordering Thailand. It is the first major offensive ordered by the SLORC since January and is spearheaded by light infantry battalions 319 and 314 and No. 227 Regiment, said the Karen spokesman. It involves around 1,000 men, said Shwe. "Fighting was still going on last night" said the spokesman who was receiving information from Mannerplaw. The Karens, the second largest ethnic group after the Burmese, are mostly Christians and have been fighting for independence from Rangoon since 1947 when the former British colony became independent. Concentrated largely in the south-east of the country, the Karens control large tracts of territory along the Thai border area. In November the Burma Democratic Alliance, which groups about 20 opposition movements, met in Mannerplaw and agreed to try a dialogue with the SLORC. But the SLORC refused to talk through the alliance and said it would only dialogue with the opposition movements individually.
