We have not accused or exonerated anyone, he said. We have stressed, and still do, our absolute confidence in the judiciary and the security and military organs, foremost the Lebanese Army. Dr. Sa'adah called for an end to posturing, saying that such practices have been condemned by everyone. The Phalangist Party leader was speaking at an expanded meeting of the party's Political Bureau and Central Council, which met at 1700 today at the party's headquarters in al-Sayfi. Dr. Sa'adah said: I have mixed feelings about what we heard and read in the newspapers concerning the current investigations in recent crimes such as the bombings at the Phalangist headquarters and the Sayyidat al-Najat Church. My feelings are a combination of satisfaction and pain. My satisfaction is because the current investigation into these crimes has produced tangible results and promises to uncover the perpetrators, planners, and instigators of these crimes. The bombings did not only cause destruction and claim the lives of dear friends and devout worshipers but were also designed to rattle the foundation of our country and reduce it to a state of helplessness once more, Sa'adah announced. Slogans propagating self-security and bemoaning oppression against one section of the Lebanese people were raised following these bombings, but such slogans were greeted with nothing but disgust in our community, Sa'adah stated. Reports that the perpetrators of these crimes will be brought to justice are a cause for delight. We are pleased that this criminal trend will end and that our confidence in the state institutions, particularly the security and military, will remain unshaken, Sa'adah declared. The Phalangist leader added: But there is pain as well, because we fear that a sense of humiliation may grip our community once the individuals and groups involved in these crimes are named. We, in the Phalangist Party, have never lost faith in our beliefs. We have never accused or exonerated anyone and we are waiting for the judiciary to issue its final word. We have always had full confidence in the judiciary and the security and military institutions in this country, particularly the Lebanese Army. Our unshifting position has always been that the Army and judiciary should be allowed to carry out their full task without any hindrance at this crucial phase of the country's life, the Phalangist leader said. Dr. Sa'adah added: On my own behalf and yours, we address a word of respect and admiration to the security institutions, foremost the Lebanese Army, for proceeding, despite accusations leveled to distract them from their task, to unearth all the facts and expose them to the public eye. Our policy has always been rational. With logic and reason, we have assessed the matters and files laid before us. We issued repeated calls for calm dialogue. We even called for a debate to formulate an effective national policy, a call that has been welcomed by all except those who were only interested in fomenting discontent. We never complained of frustration or backed such complaints. We oppose attempts to manipulate our youth and community. We believe that the Lebanese no longer condone any disruptive and suicidal schemes, Sa'adah declared. The Phalangist Party leader opened the meeting with congratulations to Lebanese mothers who, he said, deserve to live in dignity, stability, and happiness. He also congratulated, on his behalf and that of all the Phalangists, the elected chairman of the Higher Islamic Shiite Council, Shaykh Muhammad Shams-al-Din, and his two deputies. Sa'adah praised Shams-al-Din's political judgment and patriotism. Dr. Sa'adah also congratulated the Phalangist Party branches in Dhuq Musbih and Kasrawan-al-Futuh on the rally they organized last Saturday and the al-Batrun branch on the reception it organized yesterday to mark Mar Yusuf day. Finally, the Phalangist Party leader announced that reconstruction work at the Phalangist headquarters is underway. He thanked all those who have so far participated in this effort, but said that more donations will be needed to finance this effort. The Phalangist Political Bureau will hold its regular weekly meeting at 1900 today, with various political and party issues on its agenda.
