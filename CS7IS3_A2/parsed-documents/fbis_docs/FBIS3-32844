The length of the stoppages will increase every day leading up to a total strike next Monday, Hugo Estrada, president of the National Association of Middle School Teachers, announced. Teachers and public employees are joining a strike initiated several days ago by public health employees, including doctors and nurses. Because of this strike, state and Guatemalan Social Security hospitals are providing emergency services only, to the detriment of patients who now must go to private medical centers. The state employees are demanding a 40-percent pay raise, although it is highly unlikely that Ramiro De Leon Carpio's administration can agree to it. Armando Sanchez, secretary general of the National Federation of State Workers Unions, stated that public employees will stand firm in their demands, because "we know the resources do exist to grant a wage increase."
