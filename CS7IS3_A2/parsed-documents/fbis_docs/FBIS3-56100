The warning appeared after three factions stormed out of the conference hall where faction leaders were meeting in protest against Zhirinovskiy's demand that he himself should chair the meeting because his Liberal Democratic Party was the first in the parliamentary elections. He proposed that the next meeting of the leaders can be chaired by the faction, which ended second in the polls, i.e., the Russia's Choice. Lawmakers opposed and offered a representative of the "Women of Russia" bloc to chair the meeting, but Zhirinovskiy was against it. The Russia's Choice, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, and the Women of Russia left the meeting in protest. A compromise was reached in their absence that Nikolay Travkin, the leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, which was the last in the elections, would chair the meeting. Zhirinovskiy also agreed with the proposal. Travkin then convinced the three factions to return to the meeting. After that representatives of all factions and groups in the State Duma, natrurally excluding the Liberal Democratic Party, agreed that in case Zhirinovskiy continues to speak out without officially requesting to take the floor they will jointly block his faction and would not allow his representatives to work in the ruling bodies of the lower chamber.
