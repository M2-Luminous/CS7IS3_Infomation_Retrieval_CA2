Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that the two apparently managed to enter the plaza armed with knives despite the metal detector placed at the entrance. Earlier, a knife-wielding youngster was arrested in East Jerusalem as he approached a Border Police unit. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that when interrogated the youngster he said he sought arrest because of a family feud. A girl bearing a knife was arrested near the Cave of the Patriarchs when she tried to stab a border policeman. A large demonstration was staged this afternoon in Hebron to protest the ongoing closure of the mosque at the Cave of the Patriarchs. The security forces were forced to use tear gas, and four demonstrators were injured when they inhaled it.
