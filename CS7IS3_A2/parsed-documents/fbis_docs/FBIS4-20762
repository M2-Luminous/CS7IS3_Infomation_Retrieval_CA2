The Gulf Organization for Industrial Investments has offered these 17 opportunities in cooperation with the Saudi Ministry of Industry and Electricity and the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The list of proposed projects includes a project for the production of heat-formed steel blocks, with a gross investment (not counting land) of 888.9 million Saudi riyals [R] ($236.3 million), with R822.4 million ($219.6 million) needed for machinery and assembly, R37.4 million ($10 million) in pre-production costs, and working capital amounting to R25.1 million ($6.7 million), with a construction period of 30 months. The project's profitability is estimated at a 22-percent average private return, 34-percent average private return on invested capital (for easy loans) and net present value (at an average 10-percent discount) of R861 million, or $230 million; an annual return on investment of 30 percent, an operating margin of 45 percent, annual operating profit of R219 million ($58.5 million), and annual cash flow of R267.4 million ($71.4 million). One million tons of steel blocks would be produced per year, on three daily shifts, over 330 days, which is the number of days of annual operation. Products would be sold in international markets, especially the Far East, Europe, America, and Canada, noting that the size of the local market is expected to reach 3 million tons by the year 2000, with export market volume to reach 100 million tons by the same year. Another project will produce 200,000 tons of iron rolls. These would include finished elongated rolls, reinforced beams, and light sections, with gross investment (not counting land) of R353.2 million ($94.3 million), of which R265.7 million ($71 million) is for machinery and assembly, R51.1 million ($4 million) for buildings and civil installations, and R45.9 million ($12.2 million) for pre-production costs. Working capital is R26.5 million ($7.1 million), with construction time of 20 months, with project profitability of 22-percent average private return, 26-percent average private return on invested capital (in case of loan), and net present value (at an average 10-percent discount) of R285 million ($76.1 million), 25- to 29-percent annual return on investment, 29-percent operating margin, R74.9 million ($20 million) annual operating profits, and R102.8 million ($27.5 million) in cash flow. The project study defined the geographic marketing area as the Western Province of Saudi Arabia, which represents 95 percent of sales, with 5 percent of sales for export markets on the basis of an estimate of the Western Province's market volume of more than 1 million tons per year. The proposed opportunities also include a project to produce acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene or ABS products, for the manufacture of high-quality and specialized products. Production would be about 30,000 tons per year: 10,000 tons of commercial products per year and 20,000 tons per year of specialized commercial products. Gross investments (not counting land) would be almost R261 million ($69.7 million), of which R222.5 million ($59.4 million) would be for machinery and assembly, with a working capital of nearly R16.8 million ($4.5 million). Pre-production costs are R21.7 million ($5.8 million), with a construction period of 24 months. The sale price per ton would be R5,868 ($1,567) per factory-delivered ton. Marketing operations would include the GCC states, which represent 63 percent of sales, with 37 percent going to international markets. The volume of the Gulf markets in this area was an annual 24,000 tons in 1991. The other 14 projects include a project to produce high-efficiency dehumidifier units, with a gross investment (excluding land) of nearly R9.98 million ($2.67 million); a project for electric engine insulators, with a gross investment of nearly R1.02 million ($275,000); a project for polystyrene sheets for packaging and wrapping "tabak" [tobacco; as transliterated] at a cost of almost R2.03 million ($540,000); a project for the press-method manufacture of stainless steel products, costing $16.4 million; a project for the manufacture of steel castings products, with a gross investment cost (excluding land) of almost R74.1 million ($12.5 million). The list also includes a project producing plastic pellets for health use with a gross investment of nearly R28.5 million ($7.6 million); a project to produce a rubber compound for covering the floors of flatbed trucks, with a gross investment of R21.7 million ($5.8 million); a project producing paper pulp and paper from palm trees at a total cost of nearly R67.4 million ($18 million); a project to produce synthetic diamonds for industrial uses, with an investment of R35.23 million ($9.41 million); a project for reinforced concrete bricks with a gross investment (excluding land) of 15.3 million ($4.1 million); a project to conform light aluminum products, with a gross investment of R11.32 million ($3.02 million); a project to produce flexible enamel-coated copper wire with a gross investment of nearly R4 million ($1.1 million); and a project to produce products extracted from used motor oils with a gross investment (excluding land) of R28.7 million ($7.7 million). The final project produces complete sets for computer cleaning, with a gross investment (excluding land) of R2.14 million ($570,000).
