"We pursue many important common goals on a bilateral, regional and global basis," Christopher said in his article published in THE WASHINGTON POST today. "Our economic interests are also converging," he said, "China's explosive growth is increasingly attractive to American exporters and investors." "We are determined to expand American participation in the Chinese market. China has an even more significant stake in open and profitable access to the American market," he added. Christopher said that the U.S. Administration's foreign policy stands for open societies as well as open markets and "this balance shapes our approach toward China." He said that one of the purposes of his recent trip to Beijing was to reaffirm U.S. intentions to engage China constructively on many issues where the interests of the two countries coincide.
