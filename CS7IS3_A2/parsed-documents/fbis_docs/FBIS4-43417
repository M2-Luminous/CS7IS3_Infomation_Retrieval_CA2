Mr. Arsenis will begin a visit to the United States on Sunday [19 June] to attend an informal NATO conference. The national defense minister stressed in a statement that Greek fighter aircraft, according to NATO regulations, must be armed if they intercept unidentified aircraft that violate the rules of air traffic in the Athens FIR [Flight Information Region] or violate national airspace. On the subject of Mr. Warren Christopher's statement, the national defense minister said that anyone who wants the artificial tension that was recently created between Greece and Turkey to be defused should see who is doing the violations and infringements. The national defense minister referred to the Turkish maneuvers Sea Wolf and Efes-94, which are being held in the eastern Aegean, as well as the efforts by the Turkish press because of these maneuvers to depict Greek-Turkish relations as tense, and he pointed out that these maneuvers were scheduled some time ago and, as is natural, they are being followed by our country as Turkey also follows the Greek maneuvers.
