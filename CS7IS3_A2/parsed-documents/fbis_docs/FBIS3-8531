Mr. Papoulias presented to the international mediator the Greek proposals on the flag and constitution of Skopje and explained the reasons why the Greek Government decided to impose the trade embargo on this statelet. According to reports from Geneva, after his meeting with Karolos Papoulias within the framework of efforts to settle the Greece-Skopje dispute, Cyrus Vance will also meet with Skopjean Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski. It has been learned from Cyrus Vance's circles that no meeting between the Greek and Skopjean foreign ministers has been scheduled. Mr. Papoulias is expected in Belgrade this evening. He will meet with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic at 1100 tomorrow, and after their talks he will leave immediately for Moscow. According to an ASSOCIATED PRESS dispatch received from Geneva a short time ago, UN envoy Cyrus Vance proposed to Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias some ideas to settle the dispute with Skopje, but the obstacles remain. Mr. Papoulias said that the trade embargo that Greece has imposed on the neighboring country will continue until an overall solution is found. The Greek foreign minister added that he will examine new proposals together with Mr. Vance when they meet again. Mr. Vance said that he hopes this new meeting will be held in two weeks. Mr. Papoulias said that in the meantime the Greek representatives will meet with Mr. Vance's aides as part of the efforts to solve the problem. After his two-hour talks with Mr. Papoulias, Mr. Vance told reporters that there is room for more negotiations.
