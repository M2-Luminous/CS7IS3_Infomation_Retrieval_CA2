The brother Presidential Council chairman spoke to them. He welcomed them and exchanged with them congratulations on the advent of the blessed 'Id al-Fitr. He expressed his immense appreciation of the militant positions and the high national sense of responsibility demonstrated by the Ma'rib Governorate residents. He also appreciated their keenness to stick to national constants, foremost among which are the revolution, unity, and democracy. He also praised the militant roles played by the Ma'rib Governorate population in defense of the march of the revolution and the Republic. The brother Presidential Council chairman added: Ma'rib is the epitome of history, civilization, loyalty, and glories. I have always been with you in all circumstances and conditions. I have listened to your grievances. I am aware of the sufferings caused for the Ma'rib Governorate, particularly since it was isolated and deprived of its right to development. Since 1981, the governorate has seen a tangible development effort. Much has been done in Ma'rib, thanks to the cooperation of its population. We have great hopes that we will be able to implement further service and development projects to promote the quality of life in Ma'rib. During his meeting with the population of the Ma'rib Governorate, the brother Presidential Council chairman reviewed current national developments, the background and implications of the current political crisis, the factors affecting its course, and its impact on the country and national unity, as well as the harm it has caused the homeland and citizens, who are currently overburdened by the continued crisis, which should not have reached this state of affairs in the first place. The brother Presidential Council chairman noted that our people regained their unity on 22 May 1990, when the Yemeni community was reunified, [words indistinct] potentials and capabilities so that the development endeavor may be promoted, and so the homeland may see progress. He said efforts have continued to be made to cope with the current crisis. He stressed the need for Constitutional institutions to convene their meetings so together they may shoulder their responsibilities toward the implementation of the accord document, and in order to promote trust and safeguard the march of unity and democracy in our country. The brother Presidential Council chairman asserted that there is no way for the separatist past to be recreated, and that there is no going back on unity, regardless of the price entailed, because unity is the ideal of all Yemenis' pride and dignity. It is the present and future of the homeland. The brother president warned against all forms of division within the society. He added: We must confront all feeble souls who cause differences, conflicts, and parochial disputes, be they regional, sectarian, tribal, or otherwise. For our people are an Arab and Muslim people. They have a common creed, common principles, and common objectives. They strongly adhere to their Islamic creed and their national constants. We must unify our ranks, and positions. Our top priority must be to spare our homeland sedition and conflicts, and to promote its quest for construction, development, unity, and democracy so that it may reach safe shores. The brother president commended the decisions and recommendations made by the expanded conference of the Ma'rib Governorate masses. He blessed these decisions, which reflected a high sense of national responsibility aimed at sparing the homeland division and rifts and safeguarding its unity. Besides, these decisions reflected the patriotic sentiments and truthful intent of the Ma'rib Governorate, which are best seen in hard circumstances and critical junctures in the homeland's history. He reiterated that democracy will continue to safeguard and fortify unity, and that differences, regardless of how serious they are, must be resolved through peaceful and democratic dialogue. He indicated that the Yemenis have embraced democracy, and that they must shoulder the consequences of democracy, regardless of what they may be. For democracy and pluralism have caused us to acknowledge and accept the peaceful exchange of authority. It is we who announced that the Yemeni president must not be allowed to rule for more than two presidential terms in office so that a new leadership may be allowed to take over, and to expand the base of power-sharing. The homeland provides ample room for all. Besides, it is the property of all Yemenis, the brother president said. The brother president added: The past, which is marked by separation, provides us with an abundance of lessons, from which we must learn. We must do everything that can serve our homeland and promote its higher interests. We must spare no effort to build the homeland and achieve renaissance and development in it. We will do our best to achieve this, in cooperation with all well-meaning parties in the homeland. [passage omitted]
