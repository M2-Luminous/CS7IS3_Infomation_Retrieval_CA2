Aerospatiale and Eurosam have just made the very first flight test launch of an Aster 30 surface-to-air missile. The missile was also launched for the first time from the Aster 30 ground missile launcher that will make up the future anti-aircraft and antimissile weapon system known as the Medium-Range Surface-to-Air Ground Missile (SAMP/T). The launch took place on 1 December under the responsibility of Aerospatiale, the prime contractor for Aster 15 and Aster 30 missiles, at the Landes Testing Center (CEL) operated by the General Delegation for Weapons (DGA). The two-stage solid-fuel missile--using the same Aerospatiale terminal delivery system (in the second stage), but with a booster from Italy's BPD (in the first stage) that is larger in the Aster 30 version than in Aster 15--was launched from one of the eight canister tubes of the missile launcher developed by Alenia in cooperation with OTO Melara (Italy). The Aster 30 in that configuration is five meters long and weighs 460 kg. The test, which was conducted using the unguided missile, made it possible to validate the vertical launch procedure for the Aster 30 (the procedure for the Aster 15 had already been validated). Earlier, Aerospatiale had validated the performance of the terminal missile with maximum-range launchings in particular and had also conducted flight tests making it possible to test trajectory formatting and the performance of the direct-force and aerodynamic control system (PIF-PAF). In all, according to Eurosam, there had already been a dozen or so launchings of propelled and/or guided missiles (but without Dassault Electronics' electromagnetic homing head) as well as firings from the naval launcher during flight tests conducted between 1987 and 1992. The test just completed also made it possible to test the various subassemblies--missile, canister-launch tube, and ground launch ramp--in the SAMP/T's operational configuration. The only difference was that the missile launcher was not mounted on a truck but simply placed on the ground on a firing range at the Landes Testing Center in Biscarosse. But the Aster 30 will be launched from a launcher mounted on a ground vehicle during the next two scheduled launchings--also at the CEL--in 1994. In another connection, Eurosam has announced that the first prototype (P01) of the Arabel fire control radar was accepted at the Bagneux plant of the manufacturer, Thomson-CSF, in November. That electronic scanning radar will be used in a series of technical tests in a marine environment that are scheduled for 1994 at the SESDA in Saint-Mandrier near Toulon. The Arabel will then be combined with the Alenia missile launcher for sea trials involving launchings from the experimental ship Ile d'Oleron. Those tests will be conducted with the Aster 15 in the configuration adopted for the future SAAM [surface-to-air antimissile] naval weapon that will be used by the French and Italian Navies. According to Eurosam, the SAAM will first be used in actual service on the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, whose sea trials are scheduled for 1999. The Aster 30 will be used by those same navies as well as the French Air Force (replacing its Hawks), with the SAMP/T that will be delivered for tests in 1998. Both missiles--the Aster 15 and the Aster 30--will also be used with new radars in the future naval PAMS system scheduled for 2002.
