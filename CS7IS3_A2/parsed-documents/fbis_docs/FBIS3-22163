A senior working-level meeting on the environment will be held in Beijing in April, with delegates from South and North Korea, China, Japan, Russia and Mongolia scheduled to attend. Three or four delegates of the director-general level from the Foreign and Environment Ministries will attend the Beijing meeting and exchange views on energy and air pollution, management of the ecosystem, training of personnel and information exchanges. Following the Beijing meeting, the first inter-governmental conference under the Northwest Pacific Action Plan (NOWPAP) is slated for Seoul in June or July, when South and North Korean, Chinese, Japanese and Russian delegates will discuss environmental protection in the Yellow and East Seas. The five countries held three rounds of preparatory talks for the Seoul meeting last year. The meeting is planned because the waters around the Korean peninsula were selected as one of 12 areas by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) where the possibility of pollution is very high. ``Northeast Asian countries have formed a consultative body on the environment, the first time they have set up such a body on a specific issue. Moreover, it is significant that both Seoul and Pyongyang are to attend the two environment conferences,'' the Foreign Ministry official said.
