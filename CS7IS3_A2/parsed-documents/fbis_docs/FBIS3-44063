In a memorandum presented to the media workers of South African in Ulundi, Chief Buthelezi said in fact many IFP, Pan Africanist Congress and Azanian People's Organisation supporters saw journalists as taking the side of the African National Congress [ANC]. "Since the unbanning of the ANC, hundreds of IFP leaders and supporters have been decimated by Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] cadres intent on wiping our organisation from the face of the earth. But instead of there being widespread coverage of this genocide, there has been deathly silence on the part of the press. Where coverage has been given to IFP killings, there has been little coverage of the true identity of their killers or the military precision in which they have been conducted," he said. Chief Buthelezi said the whole issue of the violence that had cost many thousands of lives had literally been swept under the carpet. He accused the media of having supported the ANC, the government and the ANC's Patriotic Front when they said the IFP was obstructive when its negotiator wanted the issue of violence to be dealt with as a priority issue at the start of the multiparty talks in April last year. "This issue, as I have stated, is largely under-reported. Members of the IFP have been the main victims of this violence, and yet we are deliberately being portrayed as its main perpetrators. Added to this failure to report on these killings is of course the selective reporting of massacres involving supporters of either side. One just has to think of Boipatong. While there was widespread coverage of this heinous deed and rightfully so, the massacres of IFP people involving equally large numbers in Natal and Zonkezizwe in the Transvaal received little or no coverage," he said. Chief Buthelezi said since the IFP walked out of the multi-party talks they have been attacked and ridiculed by the press and very seldom had the reasons of the action been spelt out to the public. He further said with the public only being fed which the ANC and the government allowed, it was not surprising to "us that we in the Freedom Alliance [FA] have come to be seen as spoilers". Chief Buthelezi said the extent to which the FA had backed down was clear from their preparedness to reduce their original 16 points to four. He also said without the government and the ANC acceding to the minimum demands the FA felt it was unreasonable for observers to expect them to fight the election. Despite the lack of progress in resolving these issue, the IFP along with the FA, were continuing to meet the government in the hope of achieving a breakthrough, he said.
