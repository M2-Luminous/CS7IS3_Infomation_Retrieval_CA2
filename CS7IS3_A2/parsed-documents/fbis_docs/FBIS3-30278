The studio announcer says that "on this, the 14th day of the [Serbian] enemy offensive against the free Doboj, Teslic, and Tesanj territories, the fighters of the 7th South Operative Group destroyed two more of the aggressor's tanks, an M-84 and a T-55, which brings the number to nine in this latest aggressor offensive, and to 72 enemy tanks destroyed since the start of the aggression against our country." Reporting from an unspecified location in northern Bosnia, Hajrudin Redzovic says that "our antiaircraft defense has also been brilliant today. In the region of (Bojakovici) an aggressor's helicopter was hit and, badly damaged, forced to land in the village of Vitkovci." He says that "it was real hell in the region of Filipovici today, where the enemy launched a series of tank-infantry attacks, also using howitzers, self-propelled guns, and cannons of all calibers. Our positions on (Taratova Kosa) were also exposed to heavy tank fire. All these attacks were repelled." The report says that "the heroism of the fighters of the Tesanj 207nd Glorious Brigade was also extraordinary today. They inflicted heavy losses on the aggressor's manpower." The studio announcer cites the Fojnica Press Center as saying that "the ustasha offensive on the Fojnica-Kiseljak front went into its third day today. During the day the enemy launched three combined artillery and infantry attacks on our defense lines. While the ustasha were attacking with waves of infantry, the chetnik artillery and tanks provided them with heavy support. Our fighters repulsed all these attacks and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy in manpower. The number of killed ustasha runs to dozens." As for the Celic front, the "[Serb] enemy started shelling the town fiercely in the afternoon hours, just as the representatives of the Nordic Battalion arrived. They, too, were exposed to the chetnik fire from artillery, mortars, and antiaircraft guns." The studio announcer says that "the enemy fired over 100 shells at Teocak today." Describing the situation in Sarajevo, the studio announcer says that "this morning the chetniks shelled Mijatovica Kosa, Brijesce, Turkusici, and Point 830. This afternoon, the chetniks shelled the region in and around Zuc, and residential districts in Alipasino Polje and Sokolje."
