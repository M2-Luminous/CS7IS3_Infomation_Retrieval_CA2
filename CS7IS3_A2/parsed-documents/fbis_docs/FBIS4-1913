These two major policies are as follows: When a 15-year contract for farmland responsibility has expired, the contract can be renewed for another 30 years. Non-arable land, such as waste hills and slopes can be renewed for 60 years or even longer. Second, land-use rights can be inherited, transferred, swapped, mortgaged, or converted into shares according to the law. Land and waste slope use rights can be leased and auctioned in an organized fashion. At the same time, it is made explicit that, during the contracted period, the implementation of the policy of making the area of contracted land constant regardless of increase or decrease in the number of people in a household will continue. To augment leadership in agricultural and rural work, Guizhou has recently set up a leading group for rural work.
