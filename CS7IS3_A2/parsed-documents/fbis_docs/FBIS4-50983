These funds have raised more than 800 billion yuan so far, and about 30 of them have been listed on the stock exchanges at Shanghai and Shenzhen. Experts here agree that the rapid development of China's investment funds is an outcome of the current reform of the banking system. Being a new financial instrument, the investment funds will play an important role in stabilizing the securities market, and in the reform of the capital market and investment system, according to the experts. The investment funds have invested 40 percent of their capital in securities and the rest in real estate and economic entities. At present, about 200 investment funds with a combined amount of capital of 30 billion yuan are waiting for approval from the People's Bank of China (the central bank), which is working out regulations on investment funds.
