It is no secret that the immense majority of the departmental assemblies, which are being held prior to the special session of the Sandinist Congress, have been ad hoc assemblies without any type of statutory legitimacy, except in two or three departments where congresses were really held. Anyway, according to the congress representatives who were consulted, if any document can be taken as a reference point for voting in the special session, it would be the documents that resulted from consultations with the rank and file, not the ones from these assemblies because most of the latter were so outrageous that they resolved exactly the contrary of what the rank and file had decided. According to Tomas Borge, former President Daniel Ortega won a majority of votes at all those "legitimate party assemblies" to continue being the secretary general of the Sandinist Front. In this respect and according to his figures, Daniel obtained 1,198 votes; followed by Borge himself with 1,180; and in third place, Monica Baltodano with 1,112; and Commander Henry Ruiz with 1,092 votes. The Sandinists consulted have asserted that Borge's statements are "an attack against the secret vote of the national congressmen." They warned against "shallow, one-sided interpretations" of their followers' votes and noted that the true accounting will follow when the national representatives to the FSLN Congress cast their personal and secret votes. Borge thinks the results and decisions of the assemblies have to be transferred to the Congress. "Each one has to be faithful to the mandate of the rank and file. If not, it would be a betrayal, a felony," the former interior minister said in reference to the issue. But the Sandinists, who reacted shortly after Borge's statements, asserted that Tomas is trying to suspend the Congress and is implying that the results of the voting at the assemblies take the place of the special session. They added that this is nothing more than "another sign of the desperation created by Commander Ruiz's candidacy for secretary general." This is all as untrue as the idea that someone in the rank and file has asked him to be secretary general, they added. Their desperation has gone so far that Borge, joining the chorus of slurs, has indicated that Ruiz is the candidate of the rightists and reactionaries. "I would not like to be a candidate backed by the spokesmen of right-wing sectors," Borge said, implying that such spokesmen supported Ruiz in an effort to divide the FSLN or because they felt Commander Ruiz represented them.
