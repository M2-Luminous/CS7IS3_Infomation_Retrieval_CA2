Kamov: "The Pilotless Ka-37"] [Text] The idea of developing a pilotless helicopter began at our design bureau in the early 1970's. Its use in various sectors of the economy can be feasible and advantageous for economic and ecological reasons. For example, for aerial photography, the transmission and relay of television signals, patrolling oil and gas pipelines, monitoring the radiation level at nuclear power plants, and determining the pollution of chemical enterprises. Recently, the equipment and methods for using pilotless helicopters in agriculture were developed effectively. Our Ka-37 was adapted to operate with a sprayer to atomize small amounts of toxic chemicals. The tests conducted showed that 50 kilograms is the optimum payload for this version. The helicopter has the coaxial configuration which is traditional for the KB [Design Bureau] imeni N.I. Kamov. As applied to the pilotless version, it has a number of advantages over the single-rotor configuration. Primarily because the coaxial arrangement rules out a loss of power to the drive for the tail rotor. This makes it possible to use full engine power to develop thrust for the main rotor. In addition, the coaxial arrangement makes it possible to build an aircraft with smaller dimensions. And the airflow from the coaxial rotors ensures high quality in the application of chemicals to agricultural crops. Incidentally, the two-bladed main rotors, each 4.8 meters in diameter, are made of light but very strong composition materials. The aircraft is controlled by commands from the autopilot. This is done with the aid of electrical steering mechanisms installed in the collective-pitch channels--for longitudinal, lateral, and yaw control. The engines' throttle butterflies are also controlled by an electrical steering mechanism. Technically, the helicopter may be controlled by an operator with a specially-equipped console on the ground. In this case, a person controls the position of the helicopter visually or in accordance with information displayed on the monitor of a personal computer. In addition to flight control information, the display shows certain parameters which indicate the efficiency of the basic systems. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Basic Performance of the Helicopter | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Normal takeoff mass, in kilograms |250 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Payload, in kg |50 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Engine |two P-037 piston engines | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Horsepower |33 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Developer |Samara Engine Building KB | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Maximum speed, in kilometers per hour |110 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Static ceiling, in meters |1,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Flight endurance, in minutes |45 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Structural Features The helicopter's fuselage consists of three compartments; electronic equipment is positioned in two of them, fore and aft, and all the main units and systems are in the central compartment. The central compartment is the principal load-carrying member which accommodates internal loads. It consists of two metal frames, a reinforced floor, nonremovable side panels and removable upper panels. When the upper panels of the central compartment are removed, the load-carrying unit, which is assembled separately and consists of the gearbox and two engines, may be installed in the helicopter. In order to facilitate installation of this unit, the forward frame is tilted to the front to increase space in the upper part of the central compartment. The load-bearing floor was built as a three-layer panel with a honeycomb filler and skin made of composition material. There are two wide-diameter openings in the floor for cooling air to reach the engine fans. Four brackets for the gearbox mount are installed in the floor's upper surface. Underneath four attachment points are installed in the floor for the sprayer tank and the skid-type landing gear. The aft compartment consists of a frame and the tail boom. It is attached with fittings and four bolts. A duralumin bulkhead is attached to the frame which separates the hot compartment for the power plant from the tail compartment. The tail boom has a cone-shaped load-bearing skin made of fiber glass, reinforced with metal diaphragms and a frame at the point where it is attached. Fiber glass stringers have been glued to the cone portion of the tail boom to provide the rigidity needed. There are brackets in the tail compartment for installation of a radio altimeter and the transmitter-receiver unit for the Doppler sensor of slipping speed. The empennage, consisting of a fixed stabilizer with an adjustable elevator and two fixed vertical fins positioned at the end of the stabilizer, is attached to the end of the tail boom. There is a small hatch in the lower part of the tail boom through which the magnetic plug of the gearbox can be inspected. The Power Plant The power plant consists of two P-037 piston engines, the gearbox, the gearbox mount, and the fuel system. The engine and gearbox were developed at the Samara Engine Building Design Bureau under the supervision of Chief Designer N. Trofimov. The engines, gearbox, and gearbox mount form a single unit. The gearbox is attached to the frame by seven bolts. Each engine is installed directly on the gearbox by two studs and two bolts. The piston engine is a two-cycle, two-cylinder engine with cylinders in opposing configuration, carburetor mixing and forced-air cooling. Air for cooling the hot parts of the engine is supplied by a centrifugal fan installed on the crankshaft. Air is taken from the fan for the needs of the helicopter's systems and to cool the muffler. The torque is transmitted from the other side of the crankshaft through a spring damper to the intake for the main gearbox. The fuel-air mixture is transferred from the carubretor to the manifold though a laminated-type pipe and valve. Ignition of the combustible mixture in both cylinders is produced by sparkplugs. Lubrication of all bearings is provided by the combustible mixture. The resonator-type muffler has three chambers to ensure adequate efficiency. Air comes out of the muffler sufficiently cooled and slowed down significantly, which substantially reduces the overall noise level of the helicopter. In order to warm the air in the carburetor when the temperature of the outside air is not favorable, the engine is equipped with an electric heater in the form of a gasket. It is installed at the point where the carburetor is connected to the branch pipe. Each engine is supplied with independent fuel supply, ignition, and cooling systems. The carburetor, which is the main unit in the fuel supply system, has a built-in diaphragm pump. Fuel flows to the carburetors by gravity feed through pipes from the tank. The welded 13-liter aluminum tank is located above the engines in the upper part of the central compartment. The tank rests on four supports and is attached to them by tension clamps. The upper part of the tank has a filler with a cap and measuring stick. The fuel glass is attached to the gearbox mount by two bolts. It contains a sensor to indicate the remaining emergency fuel. The fuel is drained through an opened valve in the lower part of the glass. The gearbox is designed to transfer power from the engine to the two coaxial two-bladed main rotors, as well as to their revolution sensors and the drives for oil pumps and brake shafts. It consists of a casing containing geared wheels, two clutches, and brakes for the main rotors. The gearbox contains two-stage reduction gear. The first cylindrical stage provides the cumulative power from the two engines, and the second stage provides for distribution of power in four flows to the two output shafts turning at identical revolutions in different directions. For the engines to operate steadily during startup and when idling, automatic clutches, which also perform the functions of overriding clutches, are installed in the gearbox. The clutch is a friction clutch of the centrifugal type; it transmits torque to the main rotors when the engine is idling. When one engine fails or its revolutions are decreased, it is automatically disconnected from the gearbox. The latter has an independent lubrication and cooling system. Lubricant is provided by a pump for the gears and bearings and is fed through them to the gearbox oil reservoir by gravity. The oil reservoir is cooled by air from the axial-flow fan (mounted on the oil reservoir shaft) through ducts inside the gearbox. In low temperatures, the gearbox and its oil reservoir are warmed before startup through a connecting pipe by hot air from a ground-based source. The Lifting System As already stated, the lifting system of the Ka-37 helicopter is coaxial in configuration, with the blades attached flexibly to the hubs of the upper and lower rotors. The aircraft does not have the traditional horizontal, vertical, and axial hinges. Their functions are performed by a flexible torsion bar made of reglued rubber and composition material. Because it has no lubrication points, this construction simplifies operation of the lifting system and increases its reliability. The bodies of the hubs are made of steel forgings and are linked by hinges with the shafts of the upper and lower rotors of the gearbox. In order to avoid whipping of the rotors during runup, centrifugal limiters are installed on the output shafts of the gearbox. These limiters prevent the hinges of the hubs from operating when the rotors are turning at slow speed. The internal rings of the wobble plates are installed on ball supports to reduce the size of the column. The slide bars of the upper and lower rotors make use of sliding bearings. The blades of both main rotors are made entirely of composition materials. Each blade is trapezoidal in shape; they are manufactured in a special device with the shape of its external surface. The mounting point of the blade is attached to it by four bolts. The blade itself is connected with the flexible hub by one special bolt. This makes it possible for one individual to remove all the blades from the helicopter when necessary within a few seconds and without the use of a tool. In order to simplify construction, the antiflutter weight is fastened to the outside of the blade. The blades are controlled by four electrical devices. The output shafts of these devices rotate in one direction or another in accordance with electrical signals from the automatic control system. Actuators for the longitudinal and lateral control channel are positioned on the lower slide bar of the main rotor column. But the actuator for collective pitch is installed on the upper lid of the gearbox casing. The rotor pitch is increased or reduced by shifting the slide bar up or down on the gearbox shafts by the collective pitch mechanism. The actuator for directional control is mounted on the lower casing of the gearbox. This device increases or reduces the pitch only on the upper rotor. At the same time, so that there is no change in the helicopter's altitude, the autopilot gives the command to reduce or increase collective pitch, maintaining constant rotor thrust. The actuator for engine control is located on the load-bearing floor of the central compartment. The throttle butterflies are opened or closed by a progressive-action device with the thrust system. The main rotors' brake is controlled through an electrical device installed on the first frame of the central compartment. The skid-type landing gear consists of two titanium springs and two skids made of duralumin tubing. It is attached with bolts to four points on the lower surface of the load-bearing floor. A sprayer is installed on the helicopter for agricultural work involving chemical applications. It consists of a 50-liter welded tank and a centrifugal pump with an electric motor, which feeds the liquid through an overlapping valve to two booms with nozzles. The tank is attached by tension clamps to points on the lower part of the load-bearing floor in the central compartment. The tank has a filler with a cap on the left. There is an opening in its center through which an electric harness is passed--to connect with the ground-based system for supplying the helicopter on the parking ramp. The harness ends with a contact-breaking electric plug and socket unit, which enables it to be disconnected automatically from the ground-based source when the helicopter takes off. Antennas for the automatic control system are located on the lower part of the tank. A 27-volt direct-current system provides electricity for the helicopter's units and apparatus in flight. Its source is a direct-current generator driven by the gearbox. Operation of the ignition system for the two engines, the electrical pump, the overlapping valve for the sprayer, and the automatic control system depend on the on-board electrical supply. In addition to the generator, a control and warning unit, an electrical filter, a junction box, and engine ignition units are included in the power supply. A secondary (reserve) source of power is provided in the automatic control system for reliability. The automatic control system (SAU) was developed by us jointly with specialists from the "Kulon" firm (General Designer A. Novoselov). Together with the radio link and the transmitting and receiving unit on board, the automatic control system makes it possible to provide for automated flight as well as with the help of an operator through a control panel at some point on the ground. Pre-startup preparation of the helicopter begins by connecting it to a ground-based power source. After starting the engines manually and adjusting them from idle to low power, the revolutions are stabilized and the automatic control system is shifted to power from the on-board generator. The program developed makes it possible to have the helicopter take off and hover against the wind at an altitude of 3 meters, accelerate and climb to the altitude needed for the path assigned, turn on the course needed, arrive at the point assigned, and fly on a standard path with the sprayer turned on. Upon completion of the spraying, the electric pump is turned off and the helicopter returns for a landing. The entire cycle of flight may also be carried out under the control of an operator through commands transmitted on the radio link from the point on the ground. Flight control is either visual or by means of the control panel display. Computers with a unit of damping gyroscopes, sensors of angular accelerations, a system of air warnings, barometric and radio altimeters, and a Doppler sensor of slipping speed have been installed in the helicopter. The control panel consists of a working position for the operator with levers for collective and cyclic pitch, as well as pedals for directional control. Everything needed for the pre-runup preparation of the helicopter's systems has been provided for here. The system for displaying information is based on the PC-AT-486 personal computer. The control panel is equipped with a power supply and communications. Before takeoff, the operator controls the helicopter by wire, and afterward by radio link commands. A little over a year ago (3 March 1993), the Ka-37 took off on its first flight. Tests of this helicopter are now under way at our base. Taking into account the experience accumulated, we propose that an entire family of pilotless helicopters for different purposes be developed in the future. The possibility of equipping them with engines of different power--both domestic and foreign engines--is being examined. It would be interesting to find out the opinion of GRAZHDANSKAYA AVIATSIYA readers and specialists who operate aviation equipment regarding the requirements for this kind of helicopter. We would appreciate receiving all suggestions which make it possible to expand the area of application of pilotless aircraft. * * * Our address: Russia, 14007, Lyubertsy, Moscow Oblast, 8 March Street, Building 8, the Kamov Firm.
