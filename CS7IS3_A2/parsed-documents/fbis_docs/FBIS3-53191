The main effort is focused on linking Ma'ale Adumim and Jerusalem in order to create a single populated bloc. The Ministries of Defense, Interior, Construction and Housing, and Industry and Trade are behind the plan. It was approved by the Civil Administration's Supreme Planning Council after receiving the approval of the committee dealing with exceptional cases, headed by Noah Kinarti, the defense minister's assistant on settlement matters. If implemented, the plan will be the first stage in the establishment of a new settlement bloc to be called the Adumim Bloc. It will include the town of Ma'ale Adumim, Kfar Adumim, Mitzpe Yeriho, and Qedar. Under the plan, the bloc will be linked to Jerusalem through uninterrupted construction along the new highway linking Ma'ale Adumim with the capital. After completion the distance between Ma'ale Adumim's municipal boundary and that of Jerusalem (the Pisgat Ze'ev neighborhood) will be some 400 meters, which means that in fact it will be a single bloc. The planned construction will include housing, hotels, and commercial building over an area of some 5,000 dunams. It will come under Ma'ale Adumim's jurisdiction, along the highway to Jerusalem, where there are no Arab villages, except for (al-Zayyam) -- which under the plan will remain outside the area of construction. The Ma'ale Adumim Municipality wants to extend the plan eastward toward Mitzpe Yeriho and the other Jewish settlements in the area, but it does not have the backing of the relevant government ministries for that. According to Ma'ale Adumim Mayor Beni Kasri'el, the plan has the blessing and support of Ministers 'Uzi Bar'am and Binyamin Ben- Eli'ezer and the support of "the government's and Labor's right-wing flank," in addition to that of leading opposition Knesset members. At the same time, a similar plan is being prepared for the 'Etzyon Bloc, linking it to the Green Line through the establishment of new settlements. In the first stage, a new settlement will be set up near the 'Adulam Bloc and the paramilitary outpost of Giv'ot, located between the 'Etzyon Bloc and the settlement of Betar 'Elit, which will be civilianized. The 'Etzyon Bloc plan, prepared with the Jewish Agency's Settlement Department, has already been presented to Minister Shim'on Shetrit, and according to regional council head Shilo Gal has already received his blessing. It will be presented to the construction minister later in the month. The plan is based on the idea of setting up territorial contiguity between the bloc and the Greater Jerusalem area by building on state lands in areas not populated by Arab settlements. North of Jerusalem, a plan to expand the municipal area of Giv'at Ze'ev up to the Ramot neighborhood in north Jerusalem is in advanced stages of being approved. Giv'at Ze'ev's current municipal area stretches to the foothills of al-Nabi Samu'il, a distance of only 150 meters -- as the crow flies -- from Jerusalem's boundary, but privately-owned Arab land stand in the way of the planners.
