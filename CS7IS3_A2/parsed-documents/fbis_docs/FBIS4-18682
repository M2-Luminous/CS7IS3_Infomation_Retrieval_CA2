[Buttiglione] Throughout the electoral campaign we told him that what he had was not an alliance, and that after the elections the game of summit meetings and intrigue would begin again. We were right. [Buttiglione ends] At 7 PM the leaders of the Popular Party [PPI] run to the [party headquarters in] Piazza del Gesu. The breakdown in negotiations in the pole for freedom means that they will have to prepare to face the unexpected. It had been decided that the center would remain in the opposition, but what now? [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi has told [League Secretary] Bossi to go to hell and says that if he is asked to do so, he will consult no one, but will make "his own" government and then go straight to parliament in search of votes. Rocco Buttiglione is speaking in his capacity of implicit PPI secretary. [Caporale] It is said that Berlusconi is getting ready to go big-game hunting in your party. [Buttiglione] Everyone who wanted to leave has left. [Caporale] What will you do if tomorrow he asks you to vote in his government? [Buttiglione] We will decide when we have read his program. [Caporale] Could the program meet your expectations? [Buttiglione] I do not think that the things Berlusconi wants to do are agreeable to us. [Caporale] Could we theorize on your possible abstention? [Buttiglione] Our abstention alone would not be enough. Berlusconi's problem is not confined to the Bossi issue. The other ally, [National Alliance leader] Fini, for example says that Mussolini was the greatest statesman of the century. It is not an historical judgment, because from that point of view it could even be justified, but it is a political judgment. And it is a serious political judgment. The leader of Forza Italia must deal with this major and weighty contradiction. [Caporale] How can he get out of it? [Buttiglione] I have an idea. [Caporale] Tell us what it is. [Buttiglione] No, first I must speak to him about it. [Caporale] Nonetheless, you could cover a lot of ground with Berlusconi. His program resembles yours on many points. [Buttiglione] And it differs in others. [Caporale] For example? [Buttiglione] I am thinking about solidarity. We put it at the center of the government's action, but he marginalizes it. [Caporale] Still, there are no great gulfs separating you, and Berlusconi could soften his liberalist approach. [Buttiglione] Well, I would be the first to congratulate him if he did. [Caporale] What is your plan? [Buttiglione] To form a major center force. [Caporale] Is it something that you will be looking to complete in the current legislature? [Buttiglione] I believe that it would be a good cure for my party to start with an albeit brief period in opposition. It would give our new force a fresh identity and body. Having said this, I maintain that the majority voting system is legitimate for government but not for changing the rules. The Constitution is the business of parliament, and is therefore everyone's business, not just the government's. [Caporale] So if, tomorrow, Bossi knocked at your door and asked to talk about constitutional reform, would you also open the door to him? [Buttiglione] I talk with everyone. I do not know what things we have in common, but that is another subject. Nonetheless, I understand the League's reasons. For them, this is the magic time. They have the force in parliament to really lay down their terms and conditions. Thanks to the electoral law, they are overrepresented. The majority system of voting above all favors the regional forces. With 8 percent of the votes, thanks to an agreement that no longer exists, they have 120 deputies in parliament, while we won 16 percent and have just 46 deputies. In Britain, the regional parties barely have any seats and discussions are under way about how to change the law. Now, however, it is clear that Bossi has to lay all his cards on the table once and for all. If he does not obtain the institutional reforms for which he fought, in such a way that they give him a new national legitimacy, he is destined to be reabsorbed into Forza Italia. If there is no room for federalism, then he would be better served by a weak government than one which can pass resolutions. [Caporale] Were you expecting this turmoil? [Buttiglione] To be honest, I thought that for at least a short time they would have tried to govern. I predicted 18 months of calm. Then chaos. [Caporale] Have they failed? [Buttiglione] Well, I still think that the president of the republic will have to give the task to the leader of the winning alliance. [Caporale] And what if Berlusconi sinks without a trace? Masssimo D'Alema [Democratic Party of the Left Deputy Secretary] says there is another possible majority. [Buttiglione] We can talk of anything.
