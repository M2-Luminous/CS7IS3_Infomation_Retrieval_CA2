FBIS4-4532 "dreas064_a_94015" FBIS-EAS-94-064 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Report on FY-93 National Balance of Payments Report on FY-93 National Balance of Payments OW0104085994 Tokyo KYODO in English 0818 GMT 1 Apr 94 OW0104085994 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- The government paid out 2,163.0 billion yen more than it received against the private sector in fiscal 1993, up 9,321.3 billion yen from year-earlier net receipts of 7,158.3 billion yen, the Finance Ministry said Friday [1 April]. The large net payments reflected a series of pump-priming measures, sluggish tax revenues and increased net payments in foreign exchange funds, a ministry official told reporters. As for the latest reporting month of March, the national coffer posted net payments of 2,874.9 billion yen, down 687.3 billion yen from the same month a year earlier. In the fiscal year that ended just Thursday, tax revenues came to 55,032.1 billion yen, down 2,978.5 billion yen from a year earlier, stemming from the weak economy, the official said. Covering the sluggish tax income, bond issuance rose 4,862.5 billion yen to lift overall revenues by 1,917.8 billion yen to 66,966.8 billion yen. Net payments resulted as general-account expenditures rose 2,569.7 billion yen to 45,969.8 billion yen, the special account increased 3,612.6 billion yen in net payments to 18,995.0 billion yen, and foreign exchange funds marked net payments of 3,836.2 billion yen, up 5,142.6 billion yen from the previous year's net receipts of 1,306.4 billion yen. Reflecting the economic stimulus packages in particular, spending on public works climbed 1,933.6 billion yen to 6,075.6 billion yen, a special account for the ministry's trust fund bureau decreased 1,115.0 billion yen in net payments to 5,588.7 billion yen, and government-backed financial institutions posted net payments of 4,915.0 billion yen, up 3,220.6 billion yen. The net payments in foreign exchange funds apparently stemmed from dollar-buying intervention by the Bank of Japan to stop the yen's sharp rise, and the ministry official said the figure is the largest since 1986 when net payments came to 4,350.6 billion dollars. The official said March public works spending and disbursement from the Trust Fund Bureau and public financial institutions remained steady for the month, in line with the third supplementary budget enacted in February to fund large chunks of the latest 15 trillion yen stimulus package. He cited the small year-on-year decline in overall net payments despite a full 2,073.5 billion yen increase in bond issuance. For the month of April, the ministry projected 4,134.0 billion yen in net payments, down 2,507.5 billion yen from year-earlier net payments of 6,641.5 billion yen.
