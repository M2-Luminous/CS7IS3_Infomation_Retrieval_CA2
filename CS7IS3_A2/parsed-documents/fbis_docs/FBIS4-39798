The sides were led by Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov and Yuriy Dubinin, Russia's ambassador-at-large. According to Shamrov, the current round was marked by a desire to find a compromise decision to solve the Black Sea Fleet issue. "After an agreement in principle was reached on dividing the fleets, specific lists of ships and vessels as well as the infrastructure subject to division were determined, and also a basis was laid down for a document which outlines the status of the base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet," Shmarov said. In the opinion of one of the members of the Ukrainian delegation "the progress at the negotiations was slow and one might expect them to become more lively after the 26 June presidential elections." As presidential representative in Sevastopol Mykola Hlushko said in an interview with UNIAN, uncertainty, as far as the location of the Black Sea Fleet main base is concerned, hampers the division of the coastal infrastructure. According to him, the Russian side insisted that Sevastopol be selected as the main base. The local authorities, remarked Hlushko, were more inclined to agree with the proposal of the Ukrainian side: to determine that the Black Sea Fleet main base should be not Sevastopol as a whole, but that the base should be in the city of Sevastopol, i.e. on its territory. Hlushko emphasized that today only Ukraine renders financial aid to Sevastopol: [word indistinct] to the value of 50 billion karbovantsi were allocated by the government to maintain the city, 33 billion karbovantsi of target aid were extended on a nonrepayment basis to finish the construction of purification systems at the Mezhgornyy water reservoir. On 8 June Sevastopol received target credits to the value of 50 billion karbovantsi (at the interest rate of 123 percent for a term of 40 days) to purchase foods products. Replying to a question from the UNIAN correspondent on whether the city authorities would change their stand after the 26 June elections, Hlushko expressed his conviction that the development of relations between Sevastopol and Kiev along other ways is unrealistic. The president's representative in Sevastopol mentioned the sum Russia would have to pay for the possible rent of the land and the immovable property of the Black Sea Fleet--2.5 trillion [as received] karbovantsi per annum. This money would be channelled to the city budget exclusively. Hlushko believes that a separate agreement between the governments of Ukraine, Russia, and Crimea with the participation of Sevastopol should stipulate the annual sum to be paid by Russia for the development of the city's infrastructure. In an exclusive interview with UNIAN, the Ukrainian Naval Forces commander, Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, pointed out that at the next round of negotiations attention would be paid to the infrastructure only, because "the issue on the division of ships and vessels has been solved." The vice admiral also emphasized the importance of noninterference on the part of the destructive forces at present, so that the "work done by the delegations would not be accelerated artificially by rallies and provocative statements." Answering a question from UNIAN, the head of the Russian delegation said that the sides are working on an agreement, which could be signed at the top level (presumably, at the level of prime ministers). In the near future the negotiations will be continued by the delegations in their present composition, possibly in Moscow, although the Ukrainian side insists that they should be held beyond the borders of Russia and Ukraine.
