Their demands appear to have gained momentum following the Tuesday transfer of a U.S. serviceman convicted of killing a Korean bar hostess to a local prison to begin his 15-year jail term. The National Campaign for Eradication of Crime by U.S. Troops in Korea yesterday issued a statement welcoming the decision to have Pvt. Kenneth Markle, 22, of Keyser, West Virginia, begin serving his sentence at the Chonan Juvenile Penitentiary, 150km southwest of Seoul. The body has 24 nationwide activists' organizations as its fraternity members including the National Alliance for Democracy and Reunification, Korean Federation of University Students, and Korean National Council of Churches (KNCC). It has led a series of campaigns to put an end to crimes by U.S. soldiers here and to revise the SOFA. It plans to hold a public hearing in October on the SOFA revision with a view to coming up with a singular draft bill to be submitted to the relevant ministries and the National Assembly, in addition to a nationwide move to collect signatures to this end. What is cited as the most problematic point in the SOFA is that the government has failed to exercise jurisdiction rights over crimes committed by U.S. soldiers, campaign leaders said. According to data compiled by the body, the crimes by U.S. soldiers from 1967 through 1987 numbered 39,452, of which only 234 or 0.6 percent were handled by the government authorities. This is extremely unfair compared to the cases in the similar U.S. agreements with NATO countries, Japan and the Philippines. The percentage of eases in which the nations exercised jurisdiction over the U.S. troops marked 32,32 and 22 percent, respectively. "As a matter of fact, Koreans are exposed to crimes by U.S. troops without proper legal means to be protected, due to biased articles in the SOFA," said Cho Chae-hak, chief secretary of the body. Some 850 criminal cases involving U.S. troops occurred from October, 1992 through last August, with only 10 cases dealt with by the prosecution authorities, according to the Justice Ministry report to the National Assembly. In most cases the Korean government had to transfer American military criminal suspects to the U.S. military authorities because of the regulations under the SOFA. Even in cases when the government authorities exercise jurisdiction, the soldiers can be confined to facilities in the U.S. bases in accordance with the SOFA. SOFA was signed in 1967 and was revised in 1991 first to scrap a clause under which the Korean government shall give up its jurisdiction if it fails to exercise it within 15 days after a crime. "But the newly-introduced point is thought to be virtually moot because it entails exceptions, as it empowers the U.S. side to remand the U.S. servicemen upon request, thus depriving the Korean government of the judiciary right," Cho said. It also stipulates the Korean government should offer favorable treatment for the suspected U.S. soldiers upon request, thus enabling them to the be put into a U.S. jail. What is a serious problem concerning the "unfair" accord is the attitude of the prosecution authorities who tend not to be positive in exercising jurisdiction, even within the possible scope, Cho claimed.
