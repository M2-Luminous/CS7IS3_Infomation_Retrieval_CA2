The three sides were unable to break their months-long impasse, but the Freedom Alliance agreed to consider a written submission on the ANC's position on Thursday. A government spokesman confirmed another trilateral meeting could take place on Thursday if the Freedom Alliance Executive responded favourably to the ANC position paper. Government chief negotiator Roelf Meyer remained optimistic a negotiated settlement was still possible. "The door should always remain open," Mr Meyer told SAPA afterwards. He said there were two options facing the three parties. They could conclude a deal by Thursday night, only hours before President F W de Klerk proclaimed the April 27-29 election dates on Friday. Political parties have 10 days from proclamation to register their participation in the election. Mr Meyer explained once the election had been proclaimed it would be virtually impossible to call a special parliamentray session to amend the constitution. The other option was that the parties could reach a kind of "gentlemen's agreement" in terms of which the government of national unity would make certain changes to the constitution immediately after it assumed power. However, Freedom Alliance adviser Mario Ambrossini on Tuesday night said he doubted whether the ANC would produce anything which warranted optimism. "The talking is over," he said. ANC negotiator Thabo Mbeki, who gave the undertaking to provide the Freedom Alliance with the ANC's position in writing, denied Tuesday's talks suffered a "complete breakdown". There was still room to build on what had transpired at the talks. According to the Freedom Alliance, the change in fortunes during the latest round of negotiations occurred late on Monday night. The ANC made a "complete backward somersault" 20 minutes before the end of seven hours of talks, Alliance Chairman Rowan Cronje told a press conference at the Bophuthatswana Embassy on Tuesday night. He was flanked by Inkatha Freedom Party President Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope, Conservative Party [CP] leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg, and Generals Constand Viljoen and Tienie Groenewald of the Afrikaner Volksfront. Mr Cronje said little or no progress had been made on a number of their demands, including for one instead of two ballot papers; more exclusive powers for the provinces; and, greater provincial constitution- making powers. Some progress had been made on the right of provinces to impose and collect their own taxes. He didn't mention the Freedom Alliance demand for a Volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland]. "At the end we came to the conclusion we have come to the end of the road as far as negotiations are concerned," Mr Cronje said. "There has been very little give on the part of the other side." CP negotiator Tom Langley said the government and the ANC were "conniving" against the Freedom Alliance. "It can be very, very bad for the country," he told SAPA. "I think they have a secret agenda, which is part of their (1992) record of understanding." Part of the alleged agenda was to drive a wedge between Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and Mr Buthelezi, and to break up the Freedom Alliance, according to Mr Langley. Mr Buthelezi told the media he had been put in a difficult position by the fact King Zwelithini had recently met with Mr De Klerk, who had given the king "certain undertakings". The IFP leader did not elaborate. Gen Viljoen said he remained committed to negotiations despite the latest talks outcome. "One must keep on negotiating until all the options are exhausted. The alternative is too ghastly too contemplate." The CP's Dr Corne Mulder told SAPA those at the negotiating table "are the moderates". "We've pushed this process to try to get an inclusive settlement. "If there's not a settlement the moderates will be swept aside and the radicals will move in."
