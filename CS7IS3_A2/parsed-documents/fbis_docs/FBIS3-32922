The self-styled Zapatist National Liberation Army's decision to stop charging this "tax" where they are present, improves the climate for the first peace meeting with this group, Camacho Solis stated. The commissioner observed that this measure and the group's previous decision to release former Chiapas Governor Absalon Castellanos on Wednesday morning, indicates that the channels for dialogue remain open. "We are witnessing a new demonstration of their political will in favor of a true dialogue," said Camacho Solis, who has maintained communication with the armed groups through public and confidential messages since the second week of January. On 2 January, the armed group kidnapped Castellanos Dominguez, forcing the Mexican Army to intervene one day after the conflict began in north central Chiapas, where the armed group violently seized several communities to present Indian demands. The clashes between the armed group and the Army were virtually suspended on 12 January, when President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ordered a cease-fire and initiated efforts to further pacification and reconciliation. In a communique distributed to the Chiapas residents in San Cristobal -- 1,200 km southeast of Mexico city -- the commissioner indicated that the suspension of the "tax" is an additional step in favor of the peace meeting. Military authorities asserted on 11 February, that area residents, who were dislodged by the conflict, have charged that the rebels took all their animals, crops, and properties, and constantly harassed them, "because they refused to join" the armed group. Camacho Solis said on Monday that the delegates appointed by the armed group for the direct dialogue are on their way to a meeting area from where they will be transferred by the International Red Cross to the center where the peace meeting will be held. Chiapas Bishop Samuel Ruiz, who is the liaison between the commissioner and the armed group, said on Monday that the date and place of the first peace meeting will be announced Thursday.
