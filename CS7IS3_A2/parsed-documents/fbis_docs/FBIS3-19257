Under the Finance Ministry's medium-term financial plan, expenditures on information about the illness and its prevention is to be reduced from 20 million German marks [DM] this year to zero by 1997. The Federal Central Office for Health Information, which will have to disband its AIDS department, is not the only organization that will be affected by the Bonn savings program. German AIDS Help, an umbrella organization to which 130 AIDS groupings belong, will also experience financial difficulty. As federal funds are to be reduced to DM16 million next year and to DM11 million in 1996, Waigel's officials want to cut down on the information campaign in the new laender above all. The argument is that there are still not that many AIDS cases there.
