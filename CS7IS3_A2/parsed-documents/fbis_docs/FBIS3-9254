The United States is hastily building its military bases and adapting airports near the ports of Valona and Durazzo in Albania, which is a part of the U.S. plan to form its militacy satellites in this region. The second part of the U.S. plan is to form military bases in the F.Y.R.M., Yorgos Harvalias, editor of the Greek pro-government paper ELEFTHEROS TYPOS says. Harvalias claims that Americans have sent logistics experts to the F.Y.R.M. to restore a former Yugoslav Army base at Krivolak so its could accommodate some 5,000 troops. The Americans need bases in Albania and in the F.Y.R.M. if they engage in fighting Serbia as NATO operations require two fronts. The mountainous region between Albania and the Serbia's southern province of Kosovo and Metohija does not permit of waging a war with infantry but from the F.Y.R.M. territory it would be much easier because second front is opened in this way, Harvalias stresses. Albanian separatists in Kosovo and Metohija have attempted for decades to secede this Serbian province from the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia and joint it to neighbouring Albania. To achieve this aim, they are using conventional terrorist methods, launching attacks on members of the army and police. Over the past year, provocations on the Yugoslav-Albanian border and illegal incursions into the territory of the F.R.Y. are frequent. The Krivolak testing range is the best equipped military testing ground in Europe and the former Yugoslav Army invested enormous funds in it, Radovan Kecojevic, the foremost Yugoslav military expert for explosive devices and pyrotechnics, whose knowledge and innovations are appreciated around the world, says. The configuration of Krivolak's terrain is such that a 1-kilo watt nuclear bomb can explode on it with no adverse effects for the environment, Kecojevic told VECERNJE NOVOSTI on Tuesday. A total of 322 U.S. troops, as part of the U.N. peacekeepers, are currently in the F.Y.R.M., and a possibility of bringing in additional troops is considered so that the Scandinavian peacekeeping contingent, currently in the F.Y.R.M., could be re-deployed in Bosnia.
