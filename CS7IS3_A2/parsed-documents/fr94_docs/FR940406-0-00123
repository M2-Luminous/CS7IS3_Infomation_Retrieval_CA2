Section 86.001&hyph;21 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from §86.094&hyph;21 or §86.096&hyph;21. Where a paragraph in §86.094&hyph;21 or §86.096&hyph;21 is identical and applicable to §86.001&hyph;21, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;21.'' or ``[Reserved]. For guidance see §86.096&hyph;21.''. (a) through (b)(3) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;21. (b)(4)(i) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, a description of the test procedures to be used to establish the evaporative emission and/or refueling emission deterioration factors, as appropriate, required to be determined and supplied in §86.001&hyph;23(b)(2). (b)(4)(ii) through (b)(5)(iv) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;21. (b)(5)(v) For light-duty vehicles and applicable light-duty trucks with non-integrated refueling emission control systems, the number of continuous UDDS cycles, determined from the fuel economy on the UDDS applicable to the test vehicle of that evaporative/ refueling emission family-emission control system combination, required to use a volume of fuel equal to 85% of fuel tank volume. (b)(6) through (8) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;21. (b)(9) For each light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, evaporative/refueling emission family or heavy-duty vehicle evaporative emission family, a description of any unique procedures required to perform evaporative and/or refueling emission tests, as applicable, (including canister working capacity, canister bed volume, and fuel temperature profile for the running loss test) for all vehicles in that evaporative and/or evaporative/refueling emission family, and a description of the method used to develop those unique procedures. (10) For each light-duty vehicle or applicable light-duty truck evaporative/refueling emission family, or each heavy-duty vehicle evaporative emission family: (i) Canister working capacity, according to the procedures specified in §86.132&hyph;96(h)(1)(iv); (ii) Canister bed volume; and (iii) Fuel temperature profile for the running loss test, according to the procedures specified in §86.129&hyph;94(d). (c) through (i) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;21. (j) and (k) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.096&hyph;21. 5. A new §86.001&hyph;22 is added to subpart A to read as follows: §86.001&hyph;22 Approval of application for certification; test fleet selections; determinations of parameters subject to adjustment for certification and Selective Enforcement Audit, adequacy of limits, and physically adjustable ranges. Section 86.001&hyph;22 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from §86.094&hyph;22. Where a paragraph in §86.094&hyph;22 is identical and applicable to §86.001&hyph;22, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;22.''. (a) through (c) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;22. (d) Approval of test procedures. (1) The Administrator does not approve the test procedures for establishing the evaporative or refueling emission deterioration factors for light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. The manufacturer shall submit the procedures as required in §86.098&hyph;21(b)(4)(i) prior to the Administrator's selection of the test fleet under §86.098&hyph;24(b)(1), and if such procedures will involve testing of durability data vehicles selected by the Administrator or elected by the manufacturer under §86.098&hyph;24(c)(1), prior to initiation of such testing. (d)(2) through (g) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;22.
