He emphatically pointed out: China is deepening its reform in an all-round way and the various tasks of establishing a socialist market economy are swiftly unfolding. This has presented a good opportunity for us to further our study of Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, to raise our capability in applying theory to get a correct grasp of the overall situation, and to properly resolve our immediate problems. The more occupied leading cadres are, the more they should try to set an example in studying theory. We should study theory with our current problems in mind and use the theory as a guide in solving the problems. We should exert ourselves in creating a strong atmosphere of studying theory -- and applying them in studying and solving real problems -- among all party members. The session was presided over by Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and president of the Central Party School. Present at the session were Ding Guangen and Wei Jianxing, members of the Political Bureau and Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee; Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat; and Ren Jianxin, member of the Secretariat. Following a decision of the CPC Central Committee on setting up theoretical study classes for principal leaders at the provincial and ministry levels, four such classes were conducted according to plan between 4 October last year to 31 May this year. Leading cadres at provincial and ministry levels, principal leaders of the major units of the People's Liberation Army, and comrades with leadership responsibilities on the propaganda and theoretical fronts -- 175 in all -- have attended the classes. Of the 175, 121 are members or alternate members of the CPC Central Committee. Comrade Jiang Zemin had informal talks with members of the first and third classes. At the conclusion of the first class and the start of the second, the members also heard a mobilization report by Comrade Jiang Zemin on earnestly studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. Jiang Zemin pointed out in his speech today that for the purpose of accomplishing the task of arming the whole party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the CPC Central Committee has run four theoretical study classes for principal leaders at the provincial and ministry levels. The responses from various quarters have been quite favorable and we have attained our set goals. After affirming the achievements of the study classes, he said that a good beginning has been made in terms of study by leading cadres. We must, however, refrain from overestimating the progress, thereby resting our laurels and coming to a standstill. To truly accomplish the task of arming the whole party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we need to further enhance our understanding, intensify our studies, and work harder in using theory as a guide for practice. Party organizations at all levels still have a great deal of painstaking and meticulous work to do. Jiang Zemin stressed: The party's position and its historical mission in the new period have made it essential, now more than ever before, for cadres at all levels, leading cadres at all levels in particular, to attach greater importance to the study -- and attain a deeper understanding of -- theory. Only by becoming clear-headed and firm theoretically will it be possible for cadres to be firm and clear-headed politically, to become more conscientious in comprehensively carrying out the party's basic line, and to achieve our socialist modernization. The Marxist theoretical level of leading officials is, to a considerable extent, essential to the administrative and leadership levels of the ruling party and to the success of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Bearing in mind the overall situation and looking toward the next century with a strong sense of historic responsibility and mission, all cadres, veteran and young, must continue to study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory assiduously and lead party members in studying Deng Xiaoping's theory persistently, thoroughly, and efficiently. We must not slack in our studies. Discussing ways to continuously deepen theoretical study, Jiang Zemin said: We have accumulated some experiences from seminars and study sessions sponsored by the Central Committee and local party committees recently. The most important of these experiences, and the one most worth popularizing, is the need to earnestly implement the principle of integrating theory with practice in close conjunction with the situation and tasks. We must persist in studying theory in the light of practical problems and must carry forward a good study style which combines study with application. We must pore over the original text of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, firmly grasping the theme of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and concentrating our minds on the party's basic line in order to thoroughly understand the quintessence of emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts, and to master comprehensively the theory's scientific system. Meanwhile, we must go deep into the realities under the guidance of the party's basic theory and basic line, adopt a scientific world outlook and methodology to conduct investigations and study, and seek correct answers to the questions that have arisen in the course of reform and economic construction, especially in building a socialist market economy. He said: The Central Committee has decided that the overall situation of the work of the whole party and the entire nation calls for seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability. This decision -- which was made after earnestly analyzing the situations at home and abroad, thoroughly studying various contradictions in everyday life, and extensively soliciting the opinions from various quarters -- reflects the requirements of the basic line of "one center, two basic points" as well as the party's deepener understanding of the objective laws having led the socialist modernization drive for more than a decade. Senior cadres in charge of important matters and the overall situation, must thoroughly understand the Central Committee's guidelines and, always bearing in mind and grasping the overall situation, proceed from the overall situation in considering, analyzing, and solving problems, so as to continually enhance their ability to grasp the overall situation and promote sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy. Speaking of how to correctly grasp the overall work of the whole party, Jiang Zemin first called for the use of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's exposition on reform, development, and stability to educate and unify the thinking of large numbers of party members, cadres, and people. While studying and publicizing Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, particular attention had to be paid to combining theory with practice in studying and publicizing the dialectic relations between reform, development, and stability; and to educating and guiding cadres and people inside and outside the party to conscientiously safeguard the overall situation, to persist in taking development as the objective, reform as the motive force, and the safeguarding of social and political stability as the precondition, thereby organically combining the three and promoting each with the others. Second, it is necessary to realistically assess and judge the current overall situation. This is the prerequisite for grasping the overall situation and ensuring good work. Leaders must stay sober-minded and, above all, make a sober assessment of the situation. Third, it is necessary to solve in a positive and appropriate way prominent problems adversely affecting reform, development, and stability. We must carefully study such problems, identify their root causes, differentiate the circumstances, and strive to properly solve them through well-conceived plans in the course of deepening reform. Fourth, it is necessary to unswervingly follow the party's mass line and give play to the initiative of all sectors of society. We must deepen reform, promote development, and maintain stability. Herein lie the fundamental interests of the masses, which can be realized only by closely relying on the masses. The more crucial the time is, the more necessary it is for our party to bring into play our advantage of close ties with the masses. So long as we have the support of the masses, we can safeguard the overall situation and successfully carry out the work in all fields of endeavor. Jiang Zemin stressed: The establishment of a socialist market economic structure and the deepening of comprehensive reforms have made it imperative to strengthen and improve party leadership and party building, and to bring the role of party organizations and members into full play. It would be wrong to slacken our efforts in party building or to fail to bring the role of party organizations into full play. It would be an even greater mistake if we dilute and weaken party leadership by separating party leadership and party building from reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, or setting the former in opposition to the latter. Party organizations at all levels must uphold the principle that the party must handle party affairs. This principle requires that all party members, leading cadres at all levels with party membership in particular, care for party building, that the party committee take the lead, and that the party secretary set a good example in handling party affairs. In regard to party building, the Central Committee has formulated plans that call for, among other things, making persistent efforts to arm the whole party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, improving party conduct, building a clean government, and making unremitting efforts in carrying out the anticorruption drive. We must earnestly implement them. In building up party organizations, it is essential to strengthen democratic centralism. The fundamental way to solve problems in this regard is to improve rules and regulations, instituting new rules or amplifying existing ones as required. Where sound rules are already on the books, they must be followed earnestly. We must work hard to strengthen grassroots party organizations, institute a system of responsibility in this undertaking, and give different guidance to suit different conditions. In close connection with the task of deepening reform, promoting development, and maintaining stability, we should build up the fighting capacity of party organizations and work hard to deliver some party organizations from their state of incompetence and slackened morale. We must uphold the principle of making the ranks of cadres more revolutionary, younger in average age, better educated, professionally more competent, and with both professional ability and political integrity. We should work hard to build leading bodies at all levels into leadership collectives that unswervingly implement the party's basic line, dare to deal with concrete matters relating to work, innovate, maintain close ties with the masses, and set a good example in performing their official duties honestly. Meanwhile, we must devote earnest efforts in training and promoting younger cadres so they will be able to assume leading responsibilities beyond the year 2000. In conclusion, Jiang Zemin pointed out: Ours is a party in power. The party committees at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels are the central leading force for other organizations at the corresponding levels and over all our undertakings. The party committee must exercise effective leadership over economic work and other undertakings and, at the same time, improve its method of leadership. This year is a crucial one for China to deepen reform, promote development, and maintain stability. There are heavy responsibilities on the shoulders of leading cadres. It is hoped the rank and file will be of one mind, rally closely together, work cautiously, conscientiously, diligently, and exert themselves in an earnest and down-to-earth manner and with a pioneering spirit to continuously advance the cause of reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. At today's session, two members of the fourth study class, Gu Jinchi, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regional Government chairman, and Mao Zhiyong, Jiangxi Provincial CPC Committee secretary, delivered reports on their studies. Wang Jialiu, Central Party School executive vice president, delivered a summation on the four study classes on behalf of the work group for the study classes. Present at the session were officials from relevant central departments including Zeng Qinghong, Lu Feng, Wang Weicheng, Zheng Bijian, Zhao Zongnai, Pang Xianzhi, Su Xing, Gong Yuzhi, Zheng Keyang, and Chen Fujin.
