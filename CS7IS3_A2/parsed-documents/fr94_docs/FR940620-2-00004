FR940620-2-00004 FR940620-2-00003 Forest Service Quartz Mountain Gold Project, Fremont National Forest, Lake County, Oregon AGENCY: Forest Service, USDA. ACTION: Cancellation of an environmental impact statement. SUMMARY: On September 29, 1987, a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Quartz Mountain Gold Project on the Fremont National Forest was published in the Federal Register (52 FR 36447). Because the proponent decided not to develop the site I have decided to terminate the environmental analysis process. There will be no draft or final EIS for the Quartz Mountain Gold Project. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Direct questions regarding this cancellation to Dave Schmitt, Environmental Coordinator, 524 North G Street, Lakeview, Oregon 97630 or telephone (503) 947&hyph;6326. Dated: June 9, 1994. Charles R. Graham, Forest Supervisor. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14911 Filed 6&hyph;17&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;11&hyph;M
