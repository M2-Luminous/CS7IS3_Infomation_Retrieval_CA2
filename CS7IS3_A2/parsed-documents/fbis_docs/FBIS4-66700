Among the major post-unification returnees who has recently played an important role is Shaykh Ahmad Bin-Farid al-Suraymah, leader of the Tribal Grouping, which currently backs the Socialist Party in Shabwah governorate. Considered one of the most powerful figures there, he was a figure in the episodes of confrontation that took place in the region during the past two weeks. Against charges of "regionalism" and "traditionalism" that some have leveled against tribal figures in the governorates, Shaykh Bin-Farid declares that he supports the local authorities in their support of the unified state. However, he rejects the use of the organs of that state for narrow partisan purposes. He is placing his resources as a businessman in the Arab and international arena at the service of the people of Shabwah in the context of a new alliance with the Socialist Party that will restore rights to their true holders and release their energies to participate in public work. Shaykh Bin-Farid spoke for the first time to the Arabic press--AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT--by telephone between 'Ataq, the capital of Shabwah governorate, and London. The following conversation took place. [Hammudah] What is the real situation now in Shabwah as you see it? [Bin-Farid] The situation in Shabwah now is that the great majority of citizens, tribal and nontribal, support the Socialist Party--in other words, the local authority that is an accomplished fact. Certain episodes have taken place in the area, as you have heard. This was because of provocative elements of the [General] People's Congress. Foremost among them were Ahmad Musa'id Husayn, the former governor of Shabwah in 1972 and also the former minister of state security, and a group from Shalal province who entered an area on the edges of Shabwah. There were also attempts to smuggle in arms and explosives in Mercedes trucks belonging to Colonel Ahmad 'Ali Muhsin, the Shabwah police commander. But elements from the Tribal Grouping, which backs the local government--the Socialist Party--in Shabwah, confronted them and stopped them. This flows from our faith and agrees with the Pledge and Accord Document, which provided for the principle of decentralization and established the foundations of local government. We are on the way to implementing it in fact. In my opinion, as long as the political leaders in Aden and Sanaa have been unable to implement the local government provided by the charter, it is reasonable and practical for us to begin implementing it on the scene. We are not against 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih as a person or the People's Congress as a party; we are for the Charter of Treaty and Agreement. It must be translated into action. That is why this Tribal Grouping, which includes 90 percent of the people of Shabwah governorate, came into existence. The situation two months ago was that people in Shabwah were suffering from confusion and vacillation, unable to distinguish between true and false. So we explained these matters to them. They understood them, and we gained control. Conditions stabilized completely, except when elements intent on sabotage occasionally tried to smuggle arms and explosives into Shabwah. I regret to say that they were coming from Sanaa. Now, however, we have set up tribal check points in Wadi Markhah under the al-Nisiyin tribes, in Wadi Khawrah under the leadership of the Al Dayyan tribes, and in Wadi Hammam under the control of the Hammam tribes. We have also managed almost to cordon off the roads into 'Ataq under the leadership of Shaykh 'Awad Husayn 'Ashim al-Kawkabi. He is certainly the number-two figure in the Tribal Grouping and one of Shabwah's most important shaykhs. Events in 'Ataq [Hammudah] What exactly happened in 'Ataq? Did you besiege the headquarters of the governorate and the police administration? [Bin-Farid] That is correct--when we arrived. The reason was because Governor Dirhim Nu'man and Police Commandant Ahmad 'Ali Muhsin turned these offices, which are official offices that represent the state as a whole, into headquarters for organizing the People's Congress, inciting the people against the Socialist Party, and entrenching the Congress's control. We said to them: "You represent a state, not the People's Congress or the Socialist Party. The governor represents the authority of the state, and the police director performs the duty of a man in government service." We insisted that they clear the buildings of the armed elements that were intimidating citizens into joining the People's Congress by force. This is the reason. [Hammudah] But they say that they are the last symbols of the People's Congress in the southern and eastern governorates and that their expulsion could somehow be considered as putting an end to unity and entrenching secession. How do you reply to this? [Bin-Farid] We say that the presence of the two ought to represent the united state, not the People's Congress. [Hammudah] You seem to be working on the assumption that you have no objection to their remaining if they represent the united state, and not a particular party. [Bin-Farid] Yes, exactly. [Hammudah] They still have not left the two buildings. Does that mean that they have carried out what you asked them to do? [Bin-Farid] They appear to have carried it out temporarily, because the joint military committee has arrived. But I suspect that when the committee leaves, they will return to their activities as before. Persona Non Grata [Hammudah] What danger did the return of Ahmad Musa'id Husayn represent? [Bin-Farid] He really is persona non grata. In his personal and tribal capacity he represents no danger at all to the Shabwah area, because he belongs to the Jabwan [as transliterated] tribe, one of the smallest tribes of al-'Awaliq, representing perhaps no more than 3 percent of the total tribespeople of Shabwah. However, he does represent a danger because he claims to represent the People's Congress and claims that he has been sent officially by them. Indeed, he brought about 20 armed crews with him, armed with such weapons as the Dushka. That is the source of the danger. But when we arrived, his influence and moves shrank to the valley to which he belongs, a small valley no more than 10 square kilometers in area. He has not left it from the time we arrived until the present moment. [Hammudah] Is he besieged in this area? [Bin-Farid] He is not besieged, but he is forbidden from all the tribes surrounding him. One can therefore say that he is besieged according to tribal customs--in the sense that the tribes are boycotting him. [Hammudah] What is the nature of the relationship between you and Colonel 'Awad al-Safidi, commander of the central military axis of the Socialist Party's southern forces? General People's Congress communiques say that he backed you with armored vehicles and forces in the operation of encircling governorate and police headquarters. [Bin-Farid] That is absolutely untrue. We did not see him all that week, which indicates that there is no connection between us. Change of Positions [Hammudah] Some people, attempting to review the pages of history, say that you were a foe of the Socialist Party in the past, but that now you support it. How would you reply to them? [Bin-Farid] This is a true charge in its place. I indeed was a foe of the Socialist Party, or what used to be called the National Front, after my house was demolished and I was evicted from it in November 1967. We have continued to disagree with them in opinion and principle throughout the past 25 years. We indeed have fought them. However, the balances have changed, as we now know. We are sure that they have abandoned their old methods and ideas. [Hammudah] Is that why you think that joint action with them has now become acceptable? [Bin-Farid] Yes. Yes, because participation and dialogue are necessary in order to implement democracy somehow. I believe they have good intentions. Time will tell. We hope that what we have in mind is correct. [Hammudah] How do you assess the strength of the General People's Congress and the Yemeni Grouping for Reform in Shabwah governorate? [Bin-Farid] The fact is that the People's Congress and the Reform Grouping were rejected by many groups from various classes of the people. The two of them have spent tremendous sums--money, weapons, and vehicles. This is a pity, because general elections were held on 27 April last year and expressed the will of the people of each governorate. The people of Shabwah governorate elected the Socialist Party's candidate from among the other candidates. This is democracy. The Congress and Reform ought to have stepped in again only when it came time for the next elections. That is when they should have made their contribution. But they have tried to impose their presence by force of arms, which is a mistake. [Hammudah] People are saying that the People's Congress and the Reform Grouping are trying to develop their own local forces in Shabwah and that at the same time the Socialist Party has turned to you. Is that correct? [Bin-Farid] It is not correct. We came to Shabwah as ordinary citizens, to visit family and kin, to rebuild our demolished homes, and to begin implementing the building and settlement projects we had promised. We in fact began to repair schools and hospitals. A week ago we began constructing a 35-kilometer road between 'Ataq and al-Musayni'ah at my personal expense. This shows that we love peace. We do not advocate fighting, and we do not carry weapons unless we are forced to do so. [Hammudah] Since the events of January 1986, Shabwah and Abyan governorates have been a virtual silent opposition to the Socialist Party. The People's Congress is said to have tried to benefit from this in order to detach al-Mahrah and Hadramawt governorates in the east from Aden and Lahij governorates in the west. [sentence as published] Is this correct? [Bin-Farid] Yes, this is indeed the strategy of the People's Congress. The implementation plan for it included pushing seven brigades from Ma'rib to split Shabwah to the sea by way of Mayfa'ah and Bi'r 'Ali. Thus they would gain control of Shabwah and detach Hadramawt and al-Mahrah, where the oil fields are located. However, when the 30th Brigade reached Shabwah early in January, we also arrived, completely thwarting this strategy. The balance has shifted. However, that is what they might have done. In my opinion, that strategy has failed, and they no longer have any hope of accomplishing it. Conditional Support [Hammudah] To what extent do you think the tribes of Shabwah support the Socialist Party? [Bin-Farid] The fact, as you know, is that if the Socialist Party proves its good intentions and translates them into deeds--and we have proposed to them that they restore private property to its owners, resume respecting tribal figures, and turn over sensitive positions to the people of Shabwah in managing their affairs, not making the holding of these positions conditional on being Socialist Party members, but giving them to generous, sincere, and honest persons, regardless of their previous political affiliations--I think that if they act in accordance with this view and continue in it, success will be theirs, and the majority will be on their side. [Hammudah] Does that mean that talk about how the tribes in Shabwah are submissive to the Socialist Party is a mistaken assertion? [Bin-Farid] Yes. [Hammudah] Tension has largely returned in recent days. What are the facts about this? [Bin-Farid] No, it has not returned. Nothing new has happened since the incident that took place in Bayhan. [Hammudah] What happened there? [Bin-Farid] About 10 large Mercedes trucks came loaded with food for the military economic installation in 'Ataq. They tried to bring them in by force, without submitting them to inspection by one of the army posts in al-Sulaym district. A group of tribesmen affiliated with the People's Congress, led by 'Ali Bin-Rashid al-Harithi, then attacked. A clash took place. Five members of the army were killed, and three of the Ba al-Harith. The trucks were seized and brought to 'Ataq. They are now undergoing inspection, because weapons are suspected to be among the sacks of rice and flour. [Hammudah] Are you in daily contact with the governor and police chief? [Bin-Farid] Yes, we are in contact--not daily, but every few days. We are not hostile to them personally, but we are hostile to the style they are following. [Hammudah] Do you think there has been an improvement in their style, so that it has become more acceptable to the people? [Bin-Farid] As I said previously, while the military committee is present, the two of them are implementing certain demands about not gathering together certain elements that support them in the People's Congress. However, I fear they may return to the old way of doing things after the committee leaves--and if they go back, we will too!
