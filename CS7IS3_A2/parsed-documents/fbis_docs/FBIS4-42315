With Peter-Michael Diestel, the final GDR interior minister, he attended the foundation of a CDU branch in Frankfurt/Oder, where he criticized the policies of the Brandenburg CDU and CSU [Christian Socialist Union]. "We must perform opposition work again," said De Maziere, who resigned from the post of Brandenburg CDU chairman because of his controversial Stasi contacts. The CDU cannot involve itself in "Stolpe's personnel problems" forever, said the former prime minister, who called for tolerance in evaluating the past. The Brandenburg CDU/CSU leadership did not wish to exaggerate the significance of the appearance by the two CDU politicians. At the sidelines of the CDU Brandenburg party congress in Strausberg, it was said that there were no objections to the political involvement of De Maiziere and Diestel. Diestel and the CDU Brandenburg leadership had a disagreement in 1992 in connection with the accusations of Stasi involvement leveled against Minister President Manfred Stolpe [Social Democratic Party of Germany].
