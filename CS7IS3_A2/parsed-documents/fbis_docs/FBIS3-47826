The team was formed after the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly held its sixth plenary meeting last December, when Kim Yong-chu, younger brother of President Kim Il-song, was returned to the party leadership and Kim Tal-hyon resigned as deputy premier and chairman of the State Planning Commission. "This has been confirmed by eastern European diplomats in Pyongyang," said the sources, who are well informed of North Korea's affairs. In parallel with its move to settle the nuclear issue, North Korea appears to be moving to prepare for dialogue with South Korea, expected to resume as soon as the nuclear issue is settled, they said. Both Kims are known as moderates in their policy toward South Korea, and their appointment as top South Korea policymakers gives rise to expectations that North Korea will improve its relations with South Korea. Kim Tal-hyon's appointment as deputy team leader signifies that he is still a member of the party leadership, defying rumors that he was demoted to manager of a textile factory.
