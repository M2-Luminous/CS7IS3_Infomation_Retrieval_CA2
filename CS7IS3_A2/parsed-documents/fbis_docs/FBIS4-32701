It will, however, keep the somewhat older MiG-21 aircraft, which it wants to modernize at least a little. This merely confirms factually that the military is becoming obsolete and that no decisive change is on the horizon. Few modern weapons can be purchased from the current military budget. We should not be surprised by this--after all, the state has more pressing concerns at the moment than extensive rearmament. Of course, the fact that the Army is withdrawing its state-of-the-art MiG-29's is rather surprising. The reason given, that it is too expensive to operate them, is also not the most convincing. It is usually preferable for a modern army to have just a couple of state-of-the-art aircraft than a dozen obsolete ones. So, the old ground-attack aircraft, in which the pilots will learn what it is like to be in the air and wait until the Army can afford really modern ground-attack aircraft, will remain in Czech skies. The troops in the ground forces are also choosing the same path. Instead of purchasing too expensive new tanks, it is envisaged that the current T-72-type will be modernized. It should be equipped with a better engine and transmission, a night-sight system, better reconnaissance, and improved armor, and it should be capable of using more effective munition. However, it will certainly not become the state-of-the art. The modernization of older weapons and their continued use is an acceptable stopgap until the state has more money left to thoroughly improve the Army's ordnance. This, however, begs the question more and more whether it would not be better for the country's defense to concentrate on building up an army in which the main strike force would be made up of a few but select and well-armed professionals. Of the current Army, the rapid-deployment forces would come closest to this. However, there is also a hitch in forming them. For instance, the Army cannot pay adequately or guarantee apartments for those interested in serving.
