Pasyakin under rubric "Deployments and Flights": "And Again in the Mediterranean..."] [Text] No matter how difficult the conditions in which the Russian Navy now finds itself, it lives and is performing assigned missions. This is indicated by the recent deployment of a group of ships of the Northern, Baltic and Black Sea fleets as well as of Leningrad Naval Base into the Mediterranean Sea. Military journalist Captain 2nd Rank V. Pasyakin acquaints readers with its details. It was the typical working atmosphere in the operations room of the flagship, the large ASW ship Kerch. Rear Admiral A. Grinko, chief of the deployment staff, and his closest assistants captains 1st rank N. Mikheyev and G. Ukhanov were bending over a chart with a colorful abundance of symbols. A hunt was under way for a conditional enemy submarine by the ship detachment made up of the Kerch, patrol ships Ladnyy and Razitelnyy and hydrographic vessel Liman (Black Sea Fleet); the patrol ship Legkiy (Northern Fleet); and the patrol ship Druzhnyy (Baltic Fleet), divided into two interworking groups. A submarine and the oceanographic vessel Polyus of Leningrad Naval Base also were in the exercise area. What is typical is that all ships and vessels began search operations in an organized fashion without preliminary joint drills. Later, while the Liman was maneuvering in the area in an attempt to detect the submarine, crews replenished fuel and water stores from the large ocean oiler Ivan Bubnov. It was eight years ago in the Mediterranean that I had occasion to observe the Ivan Bubnov in the simultaneous underway replenishment of three ships, including the air-capable cruiser Kiev, by the abeam-astern method. A guided missile cruiser, destroyers, large ASW ships and patrol ships of the Northern and Black Sea fleets were waiting their turn. We were paid more than one visit by NATO aircraft and helicopters, which trained television, camera, and movie lenses on the floating "city." Unfortunately, the Russian Navy now cannot boast of such a scale. Ships of the once great naval power put onto the oceans more and more rarely. Our Navy has been a rather rare guest in these regions since squadrons in the Mediterranean and South China seas and in the Indian Ocean were abolished. Is it surprising that instances of seizure of our merchant vessels have become more frequent of late? This time, too, one other ship of the Northern Fleet, the patrol ship Bessmennyy, was supposed to take part in the joint exercise, but she was sent to the Suez Canal, where a Russian tug was being detained for unknown reasons. It was well that our forces were in the Mediterranean and reacted promptly to the incident. But if they had not been? Yes, the Russian Navy must be present constantly in areas of active shipping and fishing, not "vegetating" in bases. But evidently not everyone understands this. Or perhaps they give the appearance that they do not understand? Our air-capable ships are not seen at sea. By the way, Russia has been left with just one, the heavy air-capable cruiser Kuznetsov, and she has to be brought up to snuff. But the cradle of these ships, the Black Sea Shipyard, went over to sovereign Ukraine. Ukraine, however, is incapable of having such giants and so they cut up the heavy air-capable cruiser Ulyanovsk--our first air-capable ship with a "normal" configuration for aircraft takeoff and with a nuclear power plant--for scrap just when she was being born. The almost ready heavy air-capable cruiser Varyag "got caught between heaven and earth." The air-capable cruisers Kiev, Minsk and Novorossiysk were decommissioned because of the absence of funds and a repair facility. Now our Navy's ships and auxiliary vessels rarely go beyond the Bosporus. True, the oiler Ivan Bubnov is there somewhat more often than others, in the words of her captain, A. Danilenko, but his crew today also has a large number of problems. "The captain of our enormous oiler has a salary of only 18,000 karbovantsy," said S. Sukharevich, chairman of the vessel's trade union committee, seething with just indignation. "And what does that say about seamen, when the subsistence wage in Ukraine long ago topped 22,000? How can a family be clothed, provided with shoes and fed on such money?! It was not without reason that above all the low pay and a desire to draw attention of authorities to our beggarly situation forced the seamen of Black Sea Fleet auxiliary vessels to hoist the St. Andrew's ensign." Problems of the Black Sea Fleet's status, unresolved through the fault of the leadership of Russia and Ukraine, often creates extreme situations. For example, the Ivan Bubnov was forced to put to sea from Sevastopol... without necessary fuel for refueling, and it was not so much because of its scarcity. "We were detained in Sevastopol by Ukrainian customs for two days," I was told by first mate V. Zadorozhnikov. "They let us go only after seeing that we had no fuel for refueling ships(!--Ed.), but only necessary minimum fuel for the transit, and this despite the fact that it is Russia that completely supplies the Black Sea Fleet with all fuels and lubricants. So our Bubnov had to proceed across the Mediterranean to replenish stores from her Northern Fleet colleague, the oiler Dnestr, near the Strait of Gibraltar. She received another 2,300 tonnes of fuel from the Baltic oiler Lena, and only after that were we able to begin refueling ships." It was here in the Mediterranean that it was clear how much we need not only combatant ships, but also auxiliary vessels, without which the Navy risks becoming only a coastal fleet. After refueling, the search group continued the "hunt" for the submarine, especially as they were not forced to wait for information on her--Captain 2nd Rank V. Borisenko's subordinates from the hydrographic vessel Liman had worked professionally. After studying the data received, the deployment staff adjusted the maneuvering scheme and places for laying the antisubmarine barriers which ASW aviators were supposed to put out. After some time a Ka-25 helicopter (a Saber-Toothed Tiger, as it was dubbed on the ship because of the emblem on its sides) piloted by Lieutenant Colonel I. Chernenko and navigator Major I. Sinigovets soared upward into the sky. Although it was not the first time ever for them to perform such an assignment (the two Ivans already had been flying together for six years and had learned to understand each other with hardly a word spoken), each hunt for a submarine conceals surprises. "Arrived in area, beginning placement," was the report the flagship received from the crew of the rotary wing craft. After laying two antisubmarine barriers, the helicopter personnel departed for the observation area. They did not have long to wait. Soon a report went to the flagship about contact with a submarine. Chernenko and Sinigovets immediately received the command to drop a series of "clarifying" buoys. It became clear from the information soon received from the Ka-25 crew that contact with a submarine had been established. This also was confirmed by listening to the sea using a dipping sonar. So the "long arm," as those in the Navy often call Naval Aviation aircraft and helicopters, proved its advantage this time as well, but it is becoming more and more difficult for that same Chernenko and Sinigovets to do this. I have to admit I was surprised to learn that their "tiger" has an even more venerable age than the twenty-year-old Kerch. The Ka-25 already was removed from production long ago and spare parts, instruments and accessories are not being produced for it. Senior technicians captains A. Mezentsev, V. Bakhtin and N. Maksimov have to work a great deal to see that their "little old man" does not let people down in flight, which is why the "Saber-Toothed Tiger" still retains sharp "claws" and "fangs" despite its venerable age. When the area in which the conditional underwater enemy was located became known for certain thanks to the helicopter personnel, the deployment staff developed a precise tactical plan of action: Each ship was assigned a specific mission by Chief of Staff and First Deputy CinC Black Sea Fleet Vice Admiral P. Svyatashov, the exercise director, and the helicopter was brought back to the ship. By the way, a half-hour after its return the "tiger" again took off into the evening sky: a multiton "little fish" already was heading into the "net"... Much more could be written about actions of ASW personnel on this deployment and about the people whom I met in the Mediterranean, but another issue worries all sailors today. Many crew members, even those who have served more than a single year in the Black Sea Fleet, were in the Mediterranean for the first time. Will they have occasion to be here in the future? Will not our navymen soon be navymen in uniform only, going on coastal cruises only rarely, and will not the appearance of the St. Andrew's ensign over expanses of oceans and distant seas become something exotic? By the way, it is not the Fleet which has to be asked this question... COPYRIGHT: "Morskoy sbornik", 1993.
