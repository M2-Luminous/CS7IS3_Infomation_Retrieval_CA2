The People's Front Governing Council considers this contradicts the law due to the following: 1. The act on the restoration of Georgian state independence adopted unanimously by the legally elected Georgian Supreme Council on 9 April 1991 was based on a nationwide referendum held on 31 March 1991, during which 98 percent of the population of Georgia voted for Georgia's independence. It is unlawful to make decisions on a complete or partial cancellation (limitation) [agency parentheses] of Georgia's independence by the way other than a referendum; 2. Georgia's joining the CIS contradicts the law of the Republic of Georgia on defense that recognizes Georgia's active neutrality and nonalignment with military blocs; 3. More than a half of the total number of members of the Supreme Council voted for Georgia's joining the CIS. However, such a decision can only be taken by a qualified majority.
