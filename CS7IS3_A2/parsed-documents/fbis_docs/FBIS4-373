The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] rebels have left their positions in the north of Rwanda and are advancing on the capital, Kigali. It is reported that the rebels have crossed the buffer zone agreed to in the cease-fire in March of last year. It is said that in some places they have engaged with government troops. Our correspondent Else Temmerman is now in the north of Rwanda and sends this eyewitness report: [Temmerman] The RPF's advance toward the capital, Kigali, started last night. There is fighting in various parts of the buffer zone. Artillery explosions can be heard as far away as here in Mulindi. The fighting is especially fierce on the main road to Kigali. There are reports that the rebels are now at a distance of 35 km from the capital. RPF Vice President Patrick Masinpaka said here in Mulindi that the main aim of the operation is to reinforce the 600 UN troops being held prisoner in the parliament buildings in Kigali. Second, the RPF wants to help the United Nations restore order in the capital. We have decided to fight this clique, RPF leader Paul Kagame said here this morning on the local radio. We regard everyone standing in our way as conspirators with the murderers and we will treat them accordingly. The rebels say they are surprised by the cease-fire mediated by the United Nations. We have no knowledge of such an agreement, the vice president said here. The RPF also opposes the new interim government. It is a government installed by the United Nations. It is based on nothing and, therefore, is not legally valid, the vice president said. The RPF also says that it will cooperate with foreign troops if they want to evacuate their nationals. How strong will be the opposition by the government army, and what the international community -- and especially the French -- will do, remain open questions.
