The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from reliable sources that they met one-to-one. Yuriy Kobaladze, head of the FIS press service, declined to reveal any details of the meeting. A top-ranking FIS official told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that one should not look for any hidden agenda in the meeting. Primakov and Kim first met in 1989, when the former was the head of the foreign relations institute and the latter the head of an opposition party. They have been on good terms ever since, and have often discussed bilateral and international issues of mutual interest, including nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.
