FBIS4-47 "cr00000023894001" 24 April 1994 FBIS FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-056--SYRIA Syrian Media Voice Approval of Attacks on Israelis Syrian Media Voice Approval of Attacks on Israelis Summary: Reaction by the state-controlled Syrian media to two recent Palestinian terrorist attacks within Israel was largely confined to brief but laudatory characterizations of the operations, although the government radio's "Palestine Broadcast" program loudly applauded the attacks. Such approval is in keeping with the program's frequent celebrations of attacks against Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as its occasional expressions of support for such attacks within Israel's 1948 boundaries. Monitored Syrian media have carried no direct comments by Syrian officials on the 6 and 13 April suicide attacks on passenger buses in 'Afula and Hadera, although 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, assistant secretary general of the ruling al-Ba'th party, made a passing reference to "the escalating brave Palestinian intifadah against the Zionists and their continuous terrorism" in a speech on 17 April (Damascus TV, 17 April). Syrian media, however, characterized the attacks alternately as "martyrdom" and "resistance" operations, with one headline in the daily Tishrin calling the 'Afula attack "a brave offensive" (7 April). A Damascus radio report the same day described the victims of the attack in 'Afula--which is within the 1948 boundaries of Israel--as "settlers," while a headline in the daily Al-Ba'th reported the death of "eight Zionists." Another radio account, referring to Israeli and U.S. appeals to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to condemn the 'Afula attack, reported that a U.S. State Department spokesman expressed support for Israel "in its fight against so-called terrorism." Stressing that the attacks came in response to the 25 February Hebron mosque massacre of Palestinians by an Israeli settler and subsequent acts of Israeli government "terrorism," commentaries described the suicide operations as evidence of the futility of current Israeli policies, including "separate deals"--a clear reference to the 13 September 1993 Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles (for example, Tishrin editorial reported by Damascus radio, 9 April). Several commentaries warned that Israel can expect more such attacks if it persists in its policies toward the Palestinians and the peace process: A radio commentary on the 8th asserted that if the Israelis think they can "achieve peace through the continuation of occupation . . . they will undoubtedly reap further bitter fruit." Making the same point more boldly, a commentator in Tishrin earlier declared that "he who sows death must reap death" (7 April). "Palestine Broadcast" Damascus radio's "Palestine Broadcast"--which purports to speak in the name of Palestinians but is fully under Syrian government control and makes little attempt to obscure its Syrian character- -unreservedly praised the operations. While repeatedly stressing that these attacks occurred in "parts of Palestinian territory occupied in 1948" (8 April), commentaries on the program nonetheless referred to those killed as "settlers" and stressed that the attacks underscored Palestinian determination to rid all of Palestine of Israeli occupation: --A commentary on the 8th cited approvingly both the 'Afula attack and another the same day "on Zionist settlers near Ashdod, also in 1948 Palestine," declaring that "these are some of the bold and heroic operations the intifadah youth carried out against the Zionist soldiers and settlers in the Arab territories occupied before and after 1967." The commentary declared that "our Palestinian Arab people . . . will chase the Zionists in every spot in occupied Palestine." --A commentary that followed the attack on the Hadera passenger bus was similarly laudatory, celebrating "the spectacular and wondrous 'Afula and Hadera operations" and claiming that although the Hadera attack "was only powerful enough to destroy just one Israeli military vehicle" it nonetheless "shook the earth under the decaying Zionist ideology" and constituted the punishment "called for by divine and temporal laws as well as moral ethics" for the Hebron massacre (14 April). In a notable exception to the overall militant tone of the Palestine Broadcast commentaries, however, the 14 April commentary asserted that "if Israel learns the lesson and ends occupation and dismantles settlements and disarms settlers, the road to peace will be wide open." The Palestine Broadcast's vocal support for the 'Afula and Hadera attacks is consistent with its generally more extreme rhetoric than that carried elsewhere in Syrian media. The Broadcast almost always expresses support following attacks against Israelis--whether military or civilian, or whether the victims are from the settlements or from Israel proper. While it has generally limited its expressions of support in recent years to operations in the West Bank and Gaza, the Broadcast has occasionally voiced approval following attacks within Israel (for example, 25 November 1992).
