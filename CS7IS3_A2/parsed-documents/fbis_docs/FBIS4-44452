This was the clear demand put forward by Wang Mingquan [3769 2494 2938], president of the Communications Bank, at the bank's 1994 foreign exchange work conference. The foreign exchange business of the Communications Bank is now conducted in 50 branch banks in 22 provinces and cities throughout China. The bank has set up branch banks and representative offices in the main international financial centers of Asia, North and South America, and Europe. Globally, it has 808 agent banks and close to 100 overseas account banks. The total number of its settled accounts has broken through the $10 billion barrier, and on three occasions it has successfully floated in Singapore the issuance of U.S. dollar bonds at a floating interest rate. Faced with the daily intensifying turbulent internatonal financial markets, this bank's foreign exchange buying and selling, releasing of funds, bond transactions, and other business with foreign exchange funds, under the premise of ensuring the security of the funds, have increased profits, thereby further improving the bank's investment skills. At the same time, there has been a new development of its foreign exchange business, in succession pushing and spreading a series of loan types, including leases, mixed loan credit transfers, and foreign exchange borrowings. Following the establishment of the Commercial Bank's position in China's financial system, the development of the Communications Bank faced a new "flight of steps." At the end of last year, the reform and development plan proposed by this bank was approved by the People's Bank of China; and for the Communications Bank to vigorously develop its international financial business and to be run as an export-oriented, standardized commercial bank is an important strategic idea in the plan. For this reason, starting this year, the bank will, in accordance with the successful pattern and standard of international practice and international commercial banks, implement unified systems, unified technological processes, unified operations, and unified certificates in its foreign exchange business administration and management; and take the lead in adopting current international methods in the aspects of foreign exchange quoted prices and foreign exchange funds. The bank is getting a tight grip on carrying out international credit rating and is doing well the work of raising funds overseas. This year it will set up two representative offices in Singapore and Frankfurt. To ensure the healthy development of its international financial business, the Communications Bank has proposed a series of measures for strengthening internal risk management and for ensuring the quality of foreign exchange assets. At the same time, it will put the cultivation of export-oriented talented persons in an extremely important positon; cooperate with colleges and universities in offering foreign language courses and foreign exchange business courses; continue to study and do fieldwork in overseas branch banks; and set up competitive mechanisms and exciting mechanisms for foreign exchange talents.
