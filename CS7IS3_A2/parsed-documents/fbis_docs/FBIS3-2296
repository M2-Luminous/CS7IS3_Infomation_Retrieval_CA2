"Strengthening the collection and management of taxes" and earnestly preventing the loss of taxes have become a consensus among the people. This author holds that there are many causes of the serious loss of taxes, but the existing excessively backward mode of collecting and managing taxes can only be said to be one of the important causes. Therefore, the way out is to reform, according to the demands of the socialist market economy, the existing outdated mode of tax collection and management and to modernize, socialize, and legalize tax collection and management. For more than 40 years, China has been implementing the system of special tax administrators administering enterprises, that is, one special administrator administers a certain number of enterprises and the administrator completes all by himself the work of giving instructions on paying taxes, tax payment assessment, tax declaration, handing over taxes to the treasury, and tax payment inspection. This mode of management once played a positive role, but it has increasingly greater difficulty in meeting the needs of the development of economic life at present. To explore a rational mode of tax collection and management, various localities across the country have, since the middle of the 1980's, carried out one after another the reform of tax collection and management which mainly separates tax collection and management from inspection. However, this reform is mainly a readjustment of the internal work relationship of taxation organs and cannot solve problems in the relationship between taxpayers and tax collectors. Also, because taxpayers continue to pay taxes at taxation departments as before, the workload of taxation departments increases day by day and the problem of the loss of taxes remain serious. Therefore, making efforts to explore how to deepen the reform of the tax collection and management structure in the socialist market economy has become a very pressing task. The Haikou City Taxation Bureau used international common practices for reference and in 1992 started the reform of the existing tax collection and management structure: It has abolished the special tax administrators system and has universally asked taxpayers to make tax declarations on their own; it has changed manual management, which is characteristic of voluntariness, and has universally used computers, which "pay no attention to human feelings," for management; it has changed its management function of doing all the work by itself and has asked social intermediate organs to act as tax agencies; and it has strengthened tax inspection and taxation judicial work. Practice has proved that this reform is a useful attempt to deepen the entire tax collection and management structure. 1. Taxpayers make tax declarations on their own. Taxpayers submitting tax declarations to the taxation bureau on their own within a certain time limit is a common and feasible international practice. The Americans, for example, are nervous on 15 April each year because that is the deadline for individuals to report to the federal government how much income tax they have to pay. On that day, people mail their declarations before the clock strikes midnight so as not to pay a fine for delay. At present, before the seventh of each month [as published], the people in Haikou go to various taxation offices to make tax declarations on their own. The former practice of special tax administrators going from door to door to provide "service" has gone forever. The crux of this reform is not just a change in the method of collecting taxes, but a demand that the taxpayers must be responsible for making their own tax declarations. With the exception of special cases in which the declared amounts have to be examined and verified, taxation organs usually collect taxes in accordance with the declarations of the taxpayers. In case false declarations are found during inspection later, investigation will be carried out and legal responsibility will be affixed. 2. Taxation management work is divided according to different types of work. The Haikou City Taxation Bureau has used the tax collection and management practices in Hong Kong for reference and former special tax administrators are grouped under three major categories--collection of taxes at counters, tax assessment, and tax inspection. The tax collection group is responsible for establishing files on taxpayers, handling tax declarations, handling tax collection formalities, sending out letters to taxpayers whose tax declarations are overdue notifying them of deadlines for tax declarations and tax payments, checking and ratifying tax amounts, punishment for violations of tax regulations, and preparing taxation forms, statistics, and reports for the higher level. The assessment group is responsible for collecting and filing taxation data, picking out and handling taxpayers who have ignored letters notifying them of deadlines for tax declarations and tax payments, and carrying out investigation and assessment of taxes on enterprises whose tax declarations are not true and whose accounts are not sound. The inspection group is mainly responsible for the investigation and handling of various cases of violation of tax laws and rules and referring such cases to judicial organs for trial. 3. Tax collection is carried out with computers. Computers are characterized by high storage capacity, a high degree of automation, and a fast, simple, and accurate manner of handling data. Therefore, taxation departments of all developed countries and regions of the world have attached great importance to the development, management, and utilization of computers and have used computers to replace manual operations in a bid to lower costs, improve efficiency, and reduce voluntariness in taxation work. At present, the Haikou Taxation Bureau has preliminarily set up a computer network for management and its network is connected with a network of various tax collection points (taxation offices), subbureaus, and the city bureau. Information can be speedily passed along across the city. At present, computers are used for taxation registration, tax collection, taxation statistics, tax declarations, notification of overdue tax payments, and other work. The computer network is also linked with those of banks. Tax declarations and handing over taxes to the treasury can be carried out at the same time, and taxation service is integrated with bank service. 4. The taxation agency system is instituted. The practice of professionals such as tax consultants, registered accountants, and auditors handling tax payment and other taxation affairs for others is quite common around the world and taxation agencies have been praised as "economic policemen who are not paid by the government." Such a practice has been tried in Haikou. At present, several hundred enterprises have entrusted taxation agencies with making tax declarations on more than 3,000 occasions, and these agencies have corrected nearly 1,000 mistakes in tax declarations of enterprises. The taxation agents have also visited enterprises to provide services and have succeeded in urging more than 50 enterprises whose tax payments are overdue or whose tax declarations are incomplete to pay overdue taxes amounting to over 1.8 million yuan. This reform has added a middleman between the tax collector and the taxpayer, giving rise to a system in which the three cooperate with and condition one another. 5. Taxation inspection and taxation judicial work are strengthened. Viewed from taxation management abroad, all countries and regions in which taxpayers make tax declarations on their own have paid great attention to taxation inspection and taxation judicial work. On the one hand, efforts are concentrated on strengthening inspection. On the other hand, special judicial organs are established to try cases involving taxation. In the course of the reform of tax collection and management, Haikou City has changed the past situation of paying attention to management while belittling inspection, reorganized taxation personnel to provide more people for inspection, strengthened the means and law- enforcement authority for tax inspection, and established taxation courts. Legal means are used to strengthen administration in taxation and to try in good time taxation administrative lawsuits, tax evasion cases, and cases of taxation organs' applications for enforcement. In the reform of the tax collection and management structure, Haikou City has achieved remarkable results in the following three aspects: The first is that the citizens' sense of paying taxes has been greatly strengthened and 95 percent of them have made tax declarations in time of their own accord. The second is that tax evasion has been effectively curbed and the amount of taxes collected has increased by a big margin. The third is that honesty in taxation departments has been strengthened and opportunities for abusing power to seek personal gain have been reduced as a result of structural improvement. We can believe that the deepening and perfection of this reform will bring about thorough changes in the entire taxation work, including ideological concepts, tax collection and management procedures, the building of organizations, and changes in functions, gradually bring taxation work into the orbit of modernization, socialization, and legalization, bring taxation work in line with international practice, and effectively promote the management of taxation according to law.
