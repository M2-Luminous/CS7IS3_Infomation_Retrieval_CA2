In a broadcast monitored in Belgrade, Radio Moscow commentator Yuriy Bragin said this was why he understood the position currently being formed internationally about Belgrade's new role as the political and social factor which could play a positive role in the future in re-establishing goodneighbourly, partnership and friendship ties among the peoples of former Yugoslavia. Commenting on the second anniversary of promulgating the constitution of the new Yugoslav state, Bragin said the past two years were marked by increasing pressure on Belgrade because the civil war in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina had not been ended. In late May 1992, the U.N. Security Council imposed tough sanctions on Yugoslavia for its alleged involvement in the civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bragin said each time Belgrade sympathized with the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the West, dissatisfied, tightened pressure on Yugoslavia, although Yugoslavia made it clear in a declaration made public two years ago that "it has no territorial claims to any of its neighbours." With this, Yugoslavia has clearly shown that it honours the U.N. Charter and CSCE documents and consistently supports the principle of [word indistinct] nonuse of force in solving all oustanding issues, he said. It is evident in practice that Yugoslavia is honouring all its obligations, that it has no territorial claims to any of the newly formed neighbouring countries, that it is constantly proposing new initiatives for a peaceful settlement of conflicts and that it is strictly abiding by the principle of avoiding force, Bragin explained. Bragin also said the plight caused by the international blockade did not cause chaos in Yugoslavia's political, economic and cultural life, but only consolidated its people and proved the vitality of the state organization. The recently launched monetary reform has curbed the disastrous inflation, stabilized prices and revived production both industrial and agricultural production. The country goes on living despite the blockade. Sports competitions and exhibitions are organized, new books are promoted and new plays staged in theatres, Bragin said.
